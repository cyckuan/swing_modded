UCONN DOMINATES SYACUSE TO REACH BIG EAST FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wh is Souleymane Wane and why is Khalid El-Amin
leaping as high as his shoes can fly to chest-bump what little
chest Connecticut's backup center has? And Rashamel Jones, pumping
his fist after once more knifing through the lane finishing yet
another fast break? Who is he?
</P>
<P>
   Until Connecticut thoroughly crushed Syracuse, 71-50, in the
semifinals of the Big East tournament, only the most devoted of
Husky fans could have answered those questions. No more.
</P>
<P>
   They are talented members of a team that, when it feels like
showing up, can be as dominating as any outside of the Duke Blue
Devils. And against Syracuse they not only showed up, but gave a
sold out, partisan Connecticut crowd at Madison Square Garden a
night to remember.
</P>
<P>
   While Wane and Jones sparked a first-half rally that demoralized
the Orangemen, such Connecticut stalwarts as Kevin Freeman and
Richard Hamilton downright embarrassed them. After teaming up for a
nifty bit of ball handling finished by Freeman's reverse layup _
shades of Michael Jordan _ the two stopped at the free-throw line
and bowed to each other.
</P>
<P>
   The two led Connecticut, as Freeman scored 21 points and
Hamilton 17. But it was the contributions from down the bench that
transformed the Huskies from a sluggish squad that barely outlasted
Seton Hall, 57-56, in the quarterfinal. In a suffocating display of
team defense, Connecticut held Syracuse to 38 percent shooting,
forced 15 turnovers and so bottled up Etan Thomas that he had to be
separated from Connecticut center Jake Voskuhl after a hard foul.
</P>
<P>
   UConn shot 45 percent, had only 10 turnovers and scored 16
points off turnovers. By contract, Syracuse scored just two points
off turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen led off a rough February for Connecticut, a month
in which the Huskies struggled as they lost the No. 1 ranking in
the country. At the Hartford Civic Center, Syracuse upset UConn,
top ranked at the time, as Hamilton and Voskuhl sat out with
injuries. The Huskies had their lowest point total of the year that
day as they lost, 59-42.
</P>
<P>
   But last Sunday, UConn went to the Carrier Dome to return the
favor. The Huskies' 70-58 rout in the regular-season finale was
most notable for perhaps their best half since their streak of 10
weeks as the top-ranked team. They wiped out the Orangemen's
two-point halftime lead when their transition game showed up with
the second-half tipoff. And in 10 nearly perfect minutes of
basketball, Connecticut went 10 for 10 from the field and scored 15
points on the fast break on their way to burying Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after last night's tipoff, it was apparent that this rubber
match mattered to both teams. Voskuhl, who has not practiced in two
weeks to minimize the wear and tear on an injured left foot, went
elbow to elbow, chest to chest with Thomas, Syracuse's 6-foot-9
shot blocker.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen's strategy was clear: turn the game into a
deliberate shoving match played within three feet of the basket.
Thomas tried to do that the hardest. He finished with 11 points, 10
rebounds and six blocked shots, but had little help as the
Orangemen shot just 30 percent in the first half.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In fact, early in the first half, when Syracuse guard Allen
Griffin ignored Jim Boeheim's game plan to pound the ball inside to
Thomas, the coach berated him so passionately that Griffin's
backcourt mate, Jason Hart, asked Boeheim to back off.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeheim had more than hard-headed players to contend with as
the Huskies came out determined to follow up last Sunday's perfect
half with an equally dazzling one to open the game. They intended
to stretch the court and make Syracuse chase them baseline to
baseline. They were successful.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Hamilton hit a 3-pointer to end the half and fired
an imaginary six-shooter at the Syracuse players, Connecticut had a
20-point lead and was on its way to proving they still are the
biggest team in the East.

WITH VISITORS CENTER, NEW YORK PUTS ON A HOSPITABLE FACE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city has often had a love-hate relationship with
its tourists. Sure, their money fuels the economy, but they also
crowd Manhattan streets and make it even tougher to get restaurant
reservations. And while locals do offer directions to
out-of-towners, albeit reluctantly, the city continues to be a
daunting place for visitors to master.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the city took a step toward greater hospitality with the
opening of a computerized visitor information center in midtown
that is designed to help tourists navigate a maze of cultural
offerings using state-of-the-art technology. It will let visitors
purchase tickets to a multitude of events and get up-to-the-minute
information on many of the city's cultural and recreational
offerings. Its operator, the New York Convention and Visitors
Bureau, calls it the most technologically advanced center of its
kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the welcome mat is being rolled out only so far: In true New
York fashion, the center will not have public restrooms. Nell
Barrett, a spokeswoman for the Convention and Visitors Bureau, said
space constraints would not allow anything but a single toilet for
use by the staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lack of comfort facilities, the center, at 810
Seventh Ave. at 53rd Street, signifies that New York has finally
caught up with other cities in trying to cater to its tourists,
said Fran Reiter, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously, we have not served visitors as well as we might,''
she said. ``We were so big and so exciting that we assumed we
didn't have to sell the city so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has good reason to be accommodating to tourists. An
estimated 35 million visitors will come to the city this year,
representing an increase of 53 percent since 1991, according to the
Convention and Visitors Bureau. These visitors will pump $14.5
billion into the city's economy, the bureau estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which cost $400,000 to set up, will be open 365 days
a year and will be staffed from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on weekdays
and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends by four clerks who speak a
multitude of languages. It was built in partnership with American
Express, Eastman Kodak and an Internet company, CitySearch.  &QL;

DON'T COUNT WILLIAMS AMONG THE LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It could have been the crushing blow in
a flurry of haymakers that sent the New Jersey Nets reeling like a
battered prizefighter. But instead of being floored by the loss of
another key starter, the Nets received good news Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams, who was taken to Hackensack Medical Center for
X-rays on his left thumb during halftime Thursday night of the
Nets' 96-82 loss to the Charlotte Hornets, is not likely to miss a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the club's heart and soul, has played the entire
season with ligament damage in his thumb, and after the X-rays
proved negative Friday, Dr. Charlie Melone said that the Nets'
center only aggravated the injury against the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Melone, a hand specialist who has worked with Williams in the
past, fit him for a soft splint Friday, and Williams is expected to
be in the lineup Sunday against the New York Knicks at Madison
Square Garden. As soon as the season is completed, Williams will
undergo corrective surgery. He insisted that the surgery will take
place ``the day after the Nets are knocked out of the playoffs.''
But a trip to the post-season does not appear to be likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, with their 3-12 record, are about to embark on a long
and potentially ugly road trip. Eight of their next nine games are
on the road, and whatever faint hopes they have of making the
playoffs could be dead when that stretch ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a big deal because we haven't played any
better at home than we have on the road,'' Keith Van Horn said of a
team that is 2-6 at home and 1-6 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the optimist, coach John Calipari talked Friday about his
team being only four and a half games out of the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nets are on pace to win only seven more games this
season and finish with a 10-40 record. Thus, there is no reason to
be upbeat about this team making a turnaround, despite the air of
confidence Calipari and his players are trying to portray.
</P>
<P>
   Since training camp, the coaches and the players have said that
Calipari has mellowed in practice. But in an attempt to spark some
fire in this club, Calipari said he would return to his louder,
more grating persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have backed off and not been as hard on the guys this year
and some of them aren't playing well because I have backed off,''
Calipari said. ``I'm not saying it's time for me to get in a guy's
face, but in practice, I've got to turn it on and stop being so
general in my criticism. I have to point out specific guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is because of Calipari's mellower demeanor during
practice or something else, the Nets are not paying attention to
details.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Evans, who as the last player on the Nets' bench has had
plenty of time to study his teammates, said the Nets' terrible
execution and shooting percentage (.391) were because of the team's
refusal to do the little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the little details that make a difference, like
jumping out strong on pick-and-rolls and making the defense adjust
to the way we're playing, like blocking out underneath the basket
every time,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And offensively, it's the same deal. When we come off a
pick-and-roll, we don't come off tight enough. When we run off a
screen, we don't run off shoulder to shoulder and make sure we get
rid of our man. Then the other team comes down and pays attention
to detail and it looks kind of easy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   With the worst record in the Eastern Conference, with the
second-worst shooting percentage in the league, and with eight of
their next nine games on the road, nothing is going to be easy for
the Nets. Even with Williams on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Reports that the Nets could trade KENDALL GILL and CHRIS GATLING
to San Antonio for the All-Star center DAVID ROBINSON are
preposterous, according to team officials. One said that the Nets
would make that trade in a heartbeat, but that San Antonio ``would
never entertain'' the thought. The same report had the Nets
thinking about trading JAYSON WILLIAMS for Robinson, but that is
impossible because under the new collective bargaining agreement,
Williams cannot be traded this season. &QL;

NFL STILL CAGEY ABOUT L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON _ National Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue
paid the city of Carson and wanna-be NFL owner Michael Ovitz
hundreds of compliments Friday after taking a helicopter ride over
the city and proposed site for a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't say the two words Ovitz and Carson wanted to hear
most: play ball.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner and other league officials were cagey as usual
about the fate of a proposed 32nd franchise and the three groups
bidding for it. He said the league will likely choose between
Houston and Los Angeles at its annual meetings March 14-17 in
Phoenix, but won't go any farther in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz/Carson group is competing for now with proposals from
the New Coliseum, headed by Kings owner Ed Roski, and a Houston
group fronted by businessman Robert McNair. A chance exists the
league will open up the bidding anew once it selects a city.
</P>
<P>
   It will be tough enough, Tagliabue said, to get 24 of 32 owners
to vote to expand. ``At best, we'll be making a choice on a city,''
he said. ``The where, who and how much remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producing a consensus (on those issues) won't be easy. There
are three strong groups bidding for a team and we have a lot of
strong-minded, individualistic owners. We need a consensus of 24,
and different factors are weighed differently by different
owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that clinical example of obsfucation, Tagliabue lauded
Ovitz and Carson. He said the flyover eased concerns about road
access, and called the size of 200-acre lot ``a strong positive.''
He said the NFL's legal staff has done its own thorough examination
of environmental reports and scheduled remedies, and he is
satisfied with it. ``It (building on a landfill) is not a unique
situation, so we're comfortable on that score.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times, he said the league will eventually select a
stadium and an owner that has the best ``vision.'' He diverted a
question about the possible franchise fee -- speculation puts it
between $500 million and $1 billion depending on who's speculating
-- by talking about what the league wants in a new partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far more important is the quality of ownership,'' Tagliabue
said. ``The two owners we selected in Carolina (Richardson) and
Jacksonville (Wayne Weaver) have already made terrific
contributions to the league. One of the reasons Michael Ovitz is
attractive is because he has a track record in entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's flyover was sort of a show, too, when you realize Ovitz
got Tagliabue excited by showing him a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   The former Hollywood agent felt the visit was important to give
the league a view of the site and ``reinforce my point of view that
this is an extraordinary opportunity and city,'' he said. Carson
officials like Mayor Peter Fajardo and Councilman Daryl Sweeney
felt the commissioner's visit was a serious step in the process of
being accepted.
</P>
<P>
   On at least one competitive issue related to the New Coliseum
proposal, Tagliabue clearly sided with Carson/Ovitz. He said
Carson's public investment -- $180 million in cashbonds -- ``is
much more substantial (than the Coliseum).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one area we're still addressing (with the New Coliseum
group). There are some variables and terms we need to define.
There's more uncertainty up there regarding ... how much (public
money) is really there.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the New Coliseum's public investment is in the form of
already completed infrastructure -- the value of the land, better
freeway and road access, and earthquake retrofitting of the
Coliseum. New Coliseum officials say a dime is a dime no matter
when it was spent.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue also deflated the notion that the league will build a
stadium itself. It may assist in funding construction and include
that expense into the franchise fee, which it did in Cleveland, but
that's the extent of the league's role. He also said Raiders owner
Al Davis' legal claim that he owns the rights in L.A. ``is not a
factor at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz once wanted a quick decision, but he said he's willing to
play at the league's pace. As far as the franchise fee, he has an
open mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a point where we're not going to go,'' he said.
``Every deal has that point, and I think NFL owners understand
that. The 31 owners did not get there by accident. They're good
business people and they know how to make a deal work.''

THREE AMERICANS KIDNAPPED IN COLOMBIA FOUND DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, N.Y.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three Americans who were kidnapped last week in the Colombian
rain forest were found slain Thursday just across the border in
Venezuela, the authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two women and a man, members of a group that is trying to
preserve an indigenous tribe threatened by oil exploration, were
found bound, blindfolded and shot several times, according to the
Venezuelan military, which discovered the bodies in a wooded area
on the outskirts of Rio Arauca.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports suggested that the three had been abducted by
leftist guerrillas in Colombia, who often use ransoms from
kidnapping to finance their military activity.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department condemned the killings and called on the
Colombian government to arrest and extradite to the United States
those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has identified the three dead as Terence
Freitas, 24, and Ingrid Washinawatok, 41, both of New York, and
Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The three had traveled to Colombia to study conditions among the
Uwa Indians in a community of 5,000 that is 200 miles northeast of
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Occidental de Colombia, an affiliate of
Occidental Petroleum of Bakersfield, Calif., has been trying to
explore the region, a move that anthropologists and
environmentalists say would devastate the Uwa and their land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Uwa won a legal battle against the company that
prevented it from drilling on their reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The three Americans, members of the Hawaii-based Pacific
Cultural Conservancy International, had been invited by Uwa leaders
for a weeklong visit when they were abducted. ``Everyone is in
shock,'' said Myra Scheer, a spokeswoman for The Rainforest
Foundation, on whose board Ms. Washinawatok served. ``They went
there to help people. We just can't understand why they were
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family members said they had assumed that the three
would be released unharmed, as was a group of American bird
watchers who last month were held captive by Colombian guerrillas
for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gay and Ms. Washinawatok were shot four times each, and Mr.
Freitas was shot six times, according to Col. Luis Eduardo Tafur, a
Venezuelan police commander in La Victoria, which is just across
the Arauca River from Colombia. He said officers had been drawn to
the site by the sound of automatic gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   No group has claimed responsibility for the killings, but a
representative from the Uwa Indians who was with the group when
they were abducted blamed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, Latin America's largest and most experienced
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the rebels have been holding preliminary peace
talks with the Colombian government to end an armed conflict that
has cost more than 30,000 lives in the last three decades.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Politically, the new killings made little sense, and they were
far different from other abductions the FARC has carried out,
raising some question about the rebel group's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The abductions occurred at a roadblock in Arauca, where
right-wing paramilitary groups have been waging a campaign of
extermination among trade unionists, leftists, human rights
activists and suspected rebel supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FARC's roadblocks are typically manned by
uniformed troops in full combat gear, not lightly armed fighters in
civilian dress. Covering Arauca is the group's 43rd Front, which
organizes its fighters into squadrons of 12 rebels headed by a
veteran combatant, making it unlikely that a handful of FARC
teen-agers, as described by the Uwa, could carry out a renegade
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the rebels stand to win nothing from killing
foreigners now. Since the peace overtures with the government
began, the FARC has sought the support of foreign powers. In
Washington, its alleged role in abducting two missionaries from the
New Tribes Mission in 1994 continues to hamper the ability of
Clinton administration officials to openly support the peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
   And the abductions did not bear other trademarks of FARC
operations. Last year, when the group took three American bird
watchers at a roadblock outside Bogota, the rebel group announced
they would be investigated for possible intelligence links and
either executed or released. This time, the FARC has yet to confirm
or deny the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Lee McClenny, a State Department spokesman, said, ``We demand
that the FARC accept responsibility for this cold-blooded murder
and turn over those of its members who perpetrated this crime to be
held accountable by the courts.''

   Shooting a 66, six under par, with six birdies and no bogeys,
Els soared into a second-place tie after Friday's second round of
the Doral-Ryder Open. Els is seven under par for the tournament
(137), two strokes behind Greg Kraft, who shot a 67 to take the
lead &UR; . &LR;  Greg Chalmers (66) is tied with Els for second place.
</P>
<P>
   The top three players in the world golf ranking _ Tiger Woods,
David Duval and Mark O'Meara _ decided to skip Doral, as did 11 of
the world's top 15. But after losing in the first round of last
week's Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship, Els, ranked
fourth in the world, changed his mind and entered Doral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I missed the cut last week, so I decided to come
down here,'' Els said. ``I felt like I was playing well, and if I
took this week off, I might lose that bit of magic.''
</P>
<P>
   If Els wins Doral, he will join Duval as a two-time winner on
the PGA Tour this year. Els won the Nissan Open last month.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much talk this year about a budding rivalry
between Woods and Duval for No. 1 player in the world, but Els
cannot be overlooked. He has won 28 tournaments worldwide since
1992, including the United States Open in both 1994 and 1997. While
Els will not have the chance to outplay Woods or Duval this
weekend, a victory would certainly get their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are still seven, eight wins ahead of me, especially
David,'' said Els, who is 29 years old. ``He's not playing this
week; Tiger's not playing. You can't really get into an argument
that I'm playing as good as they are, because they are not playing.
I'm just trying to do well in this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Doral is the first of four tournaments on the tour's Florida
swing, and Els plans to play them all.
</P>
<P>
   The day started with Tommy Armour III, Bob Burns, Scott Dunlap
and Franklin Langham locked in a four-way tie for first place at
five under par. But they were all overtaken Friday, as Armour shot
71, Burns and Dunlap both shot 72, and Langham shot 76.
</P>
<P>
   That opened the door for Kraft, Els and Chalmers. Els will be
the favorite, but he was taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to seeing superstars on the leader boards, and now
we've got new names,'' Els said. ``You don't know quite what to
expect. You've got to be on your toes.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Charles Raulerson &UR;  &LR; had a double-eagle on the par-5, 529-yard
first hole Friday, holing a 6-iron shot from 202 yards. It was the
third double-eagle on the PGA Tour this year. . . . Justin Leonard
and Nick Price are still in contention at three under par, while
Greg Norman is even (144), barely making the 144 cut. . . . Nick
Faldo (two over par), Mark Brooks (five over par) and Vijay Singh
(six over par) missed the cut. &QL;

WHITMAN SEEKS DELAY FOR RACIAL PROFILING APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ After denying for years that black and Latino
drivers are targeted by state troopers searching for drugs, the
Whitman administration said Friday that it was considering dropping
its appeal of a 1996 court ruling that found troopers had a ``de
facto policy of racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Paul Zoubek filed an affidavit Friday
asking for a four-month delay in the appeal hearing, scheduled for
March 12, saying the attorney general's office would like to
complete the first portion of an investigation into profiling
ordered by Gov. Christie Whitman last month before deciding whether
to continue the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the attorney general's office, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said the state may eventually drop its
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should these investigations turn up a lot, it's possible we
could drop the case,'' the official said. ``We don't want to paint
ourselves into a corner, but we want to be in a position to take
the appropriate reaction to whatever evidence the investigation may
uncover.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistants to Attorney General Peter G. Verniero have been
preparing an Appellate Court appeal to challenge a Gloucester
County judge's ruling in 1996 that troopers routinely attempt to
catch drug traffickers by stopping and searching law-abiding
motorists based on the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's position in the case _ that there is no
widespread practice of racial profiling _ has infuriated many civil
rights leaders, who say it symbolizes the Whitman administration's
racial insensitivity and ignores state police statistics,
complaints from minority drivers and lawsuits filed by troopers who
say state police colleagues told them to target blacks and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when Ms. Whitman tapped Verniero's office to begin
the profiling investigation, members of the Black Ministers Council
of New Jersey were outraged that the attorney general would
investigate the profiling allegations while his office was busily
denying the existence of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Legislative Minority Caucus, who have scheduled
public hearings on the profiling charges, have vowed to use the
issue to oppose Verniero's bid to join the state Supreme Court. Ms.
Whitman nominated Verniero last month to the state's highest court,
and the state Senate is expected to hold confirmation hearings this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Zoubek's affidavit also disclosed for the first time that the
attorney general's office has been investigating profiling
allegations against troopers from the Cranbury and Moorestown
barracks since April, when troopers from those barracks shot three
unarmed minority men during a traffic stop on the New Jersey
Turnpike. A grand jury has not yet decided whether the two troopers
who fired at the men, wounding them 11 times, should face criminal
charges.

SPREWELL PROVIDES SOME SPARK BUT KNICKS STILL GO DOWN IN FLAMES TO
BUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Latrell Sprewell popped off the bench Friday night
and came onto the scene like a siren in the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   He was clapping his hands for the ball and unnerving the
Milwaukee Bucks. After missing almost a month with a stress
fracture in his right heel, Sprewell was a welcome arrival that
kept the New York Knicks alive in this game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But once again, the Knicks showed their inability to win a
tough road game when Patrick Ewing _ for the second time in two
games _ missed a 13-foot jumper at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's miss allowed the Bucks to exhale and exit the Bradley
Center with an 88-87 victory. Ewing led the Knicks with 24 points,
while Sprewell added 18.
</P>
<P>
   Just like in the Knicks' one-point loss to Miami in overtime
Tuesday night, Ewing was the one taking and missing the last shot.
But this defeat was not Ewing's burden to bear. The slumping Allan
Houston had a dreadful night, hitting just 2 of 12 shots as the
Knicks (9-7) fell to 2-6 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks were led by Glenn Robinson (19 points) and Terrell
Brandon (16 points), who hit two free throws to give the Bucks an
88-87 lead with 8 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a nine-point third quarter lead, the Knicks began
to fray mentally and physically. A 3-pointer by Brandon, who came
off the bench after missing two games with a thigh contusion, with
6 minutes 34 seconds left in the game gave the Bucks a 75-73 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Houston tried to redeem his horrid night of shooting by nailing
a 3-pointer to bring the Knicks to within, 82-81, with 2:35 left.
The back-and-forth game went the Bucks way until 50 second
remained. A missed 3-pointer by Chris Childs was kept alive and
deflected off the Bucks by Sprewell with 26.8 seconds left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   That play allowed the Knicks the chance to go ahead, which they
did on a 10-foot jumper by Ewing. He was fouled, but failed to hit
the free throw, leaving the Knicks with a tenuous, 87-86 lead, with
16.8 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon took the inbounds and, trying to break down the defense,
drove into Larry Johnson and picked up the foul. Brandon coolly hit
both free throws to give the Bucks an 88-87 lead with 8 seconds to
go. Sprewell may have been listed as a reserve, but he made his
entrance back onto the league's stage like a leading man. There was
nothing tentative about him as he stepped onto the floor with 3
minutes 38 seconds left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell stepped onto the court with 3:38 remaining in the first
quarter. One minute and one errant 3-pointer later, an undaunted
Sprewell unveiled a vicious, two-handed dunk as he drove right by a
helpless Dell Curry with 2 minutes left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of confidence and the kind of unbridled
aggression the Knicks have been missing on offense, particularly on
the road. In a scoring sprint, Sprewell hit 5 of 11 shots for 14
first-half points. He did not come up for air until he was taken
out of the game with 2:06 to go in the first half. He had helped
turn a tie game into a five-point Knicks lead.

HEALTHY FOX IS ON TARGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A five-game winning streak noted for Dennis Rodman's
rebounding and Kurt Rambis' coaching needs a footnote appended to
it for Rick Fox's 3-point shooting spree.
</P>
<P>
   His shot ailing as much as his injured feet, Fox started the
season in a 1-for-18 slump from 3-point range. But he's hit 14 of
his last 26 attempts (53.8 percent), all during the Lakers'
five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so much better physically than I had for the first
month of the season,'' Fox said. ``Coming out of training camp, I
couldn't even run. . . . Thanks to (Lakers trainer) Gary Vitti for
getting me healthy and working on strengthening the ankle area, I
feel like I did last year when I was healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox opened training camp with new athletic insoles, which
unfortunately turned out to be a bad fit. He suffered sore ankles
and knees and later was diagnosed with bone spurs in his right foot
_ an ailment he'll wait until summer to rectify with surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But after weeks of treatment and therapy, Fox is playing
pain-free, and his shooting rhythm has returned. It started with a
4-for-6 3-point shooting night against the Clippers last Thursday,
followed by a 5-for-5 performance behind the arc against Houston
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The shortened training camp after the lockout also had an effect
on Fox's game, he said. ``A month and a half into the season is
about the stretch you usually get in preseason to get into a
rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis did the rest. Though not a shooter by any stretch of the
imagination, Rambis had noticed a few hitches in Fox's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was playing passively, he was hesitating. That's not his
game,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's watched me shoot a lot, he notices the difference when I
get into a really good rhythm when I've swayed a little bit,'' Fox
said. ``It's helpful to know someone's watching you and knows what
the key points and the key words to remind you are.''
</P>
<P>
   No power shortage: A week into Rodman's tenure, Rambis is
finding it difficult to distribute minutes at the power and small
forward positions.
</P>
<P>
   The glut of available bodies is so bad, former starter Robert
Horry played just three minutes against Phoenix earlier this week,
and he's now coming in primarily at small forward _ stuck behind
Kobe Bryant and former starter Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Corie Blount _ previously the first option off the bench at
power forward _ went three games without playing a minute, as
Rodman and starter Travis Knight dominated the playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get Robert as much time as possible. . . . It's just
hard to find the minutes,'' Rambis said. ``It comes down to a
big-time numbers game with Corie. He's played well, his attitude is
great, he practices hard. Everything about Corie, I love. There's
no easy way to say it, he's getting screwed. He deserves more
time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a bold strategy: Buy like mad, build like mad, pay for it
with an initial stock offering and a lot of borrowed money, and
pray that the snow _ and the customers _ would keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   For almost five years it was an exhilarating ride, as the
American Skiing Co. grew from a single Maine resort in 1994 to nine
in New England and the Rockies. Hotels bought, condos built, new
snow machines and gondolas installed: The company was pumping
millions into its strategy of rapidly building itself into a giant
in winter recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Then the juggernaut crashed into the season that wouldn't start.
Unusually warm weather in the East combined with a dry spell in the
West in the first few months of the 1998-99 season to keep trails
bare and cash registers empty. The cracks that soon appeared in
American Skiing's financial results call into question the wisdom
of barreling ahead so fast in an industry that depends so
profoundly on Mother Nature's fickle graces.
</P>
<P>
   The snows last week in New England came too late to rescue the
company's second quarter, which ended Jan. 24. On Monday, American
Skiing announced a net loss of $10.8 million, even worse than it
had forecast in January, on revenue of $109.5 million. Resort
revenue fell $3.7 million from the corresponding period the
previous year, while real estate revenue declined $1.6 million.
During what was supposed to be the company's most active quarter,
30 employees, mostly in middle management, were laid off at three
of the resorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can say that they are happy about having the kind of
weather that we've had,'' said Leslie B. Otten, the company's
founder, chairman and chief executive. ``Long term, I don't think
this is going to have any detrimental effect to the company. In the
short term, it is something that we understand and expect will
happen from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   With two prominent banks, Fleet and BankBoston, in the company's
corner as lenders, analysts had high hopes for American Skiing when
it went public at $18 a share in November 1997. But within a year,
the stock had slid to $5 a share; it closed last week at $3.75
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Noll, a ski industry analyst with the Chapman Co. in
Baltimore, called American Skiing the most highly leveraged in the
winter recreation industry and the most aggressive in real estate
development. When the company found that it had to defer some
projects, ``they disappointed the analysts on Wall Street, and
that's just been a big penalty for them,'' Noll said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how much of the company's aggressive
building schedule can be sustained, and how much must be scrapped
to conserve cash and service the company's debt of more than $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   American Skiing already has shelved its planned $30 million
Grand Summit Resort Hotel at the Sugarbush resort in Vermont,
because of poor advance sales, as well as a related land exchange
agreement the company had painfully worked out with the U. S.
Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the company also backed off from a planned $300
million offering of secured notes. Instead, it placed $58 million
in secured notes with high financing costs and will use the
proceeds to complete projects at its two Western resorts, Steamboat
in Colorado and The Canyons in Utah, in time for next season. The
switch led Standard &AMP; Poor's to downgrade the company's corporate
credit and debt ratings, saying it hurt the company's ``financial
flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the company sought to play down its bad earnings
report by announcing that it had renegotiated the terms of its debt
with its bank lenders. The deal will put about $20 million for
capital improvements into American Skiing's coffers during the
coming season. Though that is less than the $35 million the company
originally planned to borrow, it ``gives us more than enough
flexibility for the coming year,'' said Mark Miller, the chief
financial officer. ``We don't want anyone to get the impression
that the banks crimped us.''
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement also will allow Otten to keep pursuing his
vision of ski resorts that go beyond winter sports to become luxury
vacation destinations with all the trimmings. With much of the
basic infrastructure in place at the company's resorts, he added,
it is ``not a bad thing to be taking a break from that expenditure
pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullish analysts say the company's real estate ventures could
have more staying power than its lift-ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Frick, an economist with BBC Consulting in Denver, said
that aging baby boomers who no longer frequented the slopes were an
attractive demographic group for second-home ownership, including
resort condos. ``The real estate industry has really grown to
eclipse the skiing industry'' in the West, he said, and he sees a
similar trend, though not as advanced, in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Hammerle, an industry consultant in Littleton, N.H.,
said American Skiing should not have much trouble filling its
properties. ``Across North America, resort real estate is in fairly
high demand, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region,'' Hammerle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of time-share ownerships at American Skiing's hotels,
which come with amenities like the use of ski lockers, lounges and
libraries, have been brisk and highly profitable, Noll said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts find encouragement in Otten's track record turning
around resorts like his flagship property, Sunday River in Maine,
and hope the company can do the same with Steamboat. The Colorado
resort looked like a good bet after a 1.1-million-visit season in
1997. But skier visits have slid sharply this season, off 16
percent through January, and the resort's managing director
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   American Skiing continues to put much of its energy into
developing The Canyons, which it wants to transform into one of the
largest ski resorts in North America in time for the 2002 Winter
Olympics in Salt Lake City. More than 1,300 acres of skiable
terrain have been added; a hotel and condominiums, many of them
already sold, are under construction. Frick, the economist at BBC
Consulting, called it ``a make it or break it project'' for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the fate of The Canyons, it remains unclear how
America Skiing and the three other big, aggressive group owners _
Intrawest of Vancouver, British Columbia; Vail Resorts of Vail,
Colo., and Booth Creek Ski Holdings of Truckee, Calif. _ can keep
growing, given that the number of skiers has stayed fairly flat for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's clear is that those four companies are spending
hundreds of millions of dollars to put in high-speed chair lifts
and grooming, and they're all building a lot of housing,'' Noll
said. ``If they don't get some kind of growth, unless those four
companies take all of the market, you're going to have some of them
changing their lifestyle.'' &QL;

BRUINS FINALLY BEAT THE DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This time there was no coming from
behind three times, grabbing a tie, and being thankful for a point.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Bruins didn't have to play catch-up. This time,
they led from wire to wire.
</P>
<P>
   They grabbed a 3-0 first-period lead, then turned things over to
goalie Byron Dafoe, who was brilliant again, and whipped the New
Jersey Devils, 4-1, Friday night at Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The first-period snipers were defensemen Kyle McLaren and Grant
Ledyard, and Sergei Samsonov, who finished off a textbook
two-on-one breakaway with Joe Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   After surging to the 3-0 lead, the Bruins turned things over to
Dafoe. He had 24 saves and was denied his seventh shutout of the
season when Jason Arnott beat him on the power play at 17:52 of the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   Anson Carter scored the other Bruin goal into an empty net in
the waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
   So, was this big, Pat Burns?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, definitely,'' said the Bruins coach. ``We played with
emotion. The Devils were frustrated and that was the most
frustrated I've ever seen a New Jersey Devils team play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get the early lead and we did. We wanted to get
in low behind them, move our legs, and make them chase us. The only
intimidation we have against them is our speed and we did that very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The win gave the Bruins some breathing room in the race for the
eighth and final playoff spot, opening up a 4-point bulge on both
the Florida Panthers and the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The last time these two teams met, eight days ago at the
FleetCenter, the Bruins came from behind three times and escaped
with a 3-3 overtime tie. Friday night they hit the Devils early and
often, determined to end a 10-game winless streak (0-7-3) against
the Atlantic Division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins started a bit on the sluggish side and lapses forced
Dafoe to make sparkling saves on shots from Petr Sykora and Brian
Rolston in the first 90 seconds. But then the Bruins got moving and
when they did, they shifted into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   McLaren lit the lamp at 2:39 with a blast from the point that
whistled past Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur. Carter started the
play by picking up a loose puck inside the circle and passing it
out to Jason Allison just inside the blue line. Allison slid it to
McLaren, who let fly a bullet that Brodeur never saw.
</P>
<P>
   At 15:12, Ledyard boosted the lead to 2-0 when he slapped in a
rebound from 20 feet. Thornton had a big part in the goal. He kept
possession behind the net, brought it out front, and swiped it at
Brodeur, who kicked it right back to Ledyard.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton was the centerpiece of the third goal, too.
</P>
<P>
   Landon Wilson poke-checked the puck free just inside the Bruins
blue line to Thornton, who skated down the right wing two-on-one
with Samsonov to his left. Just before skating in on Brodeur, he
shoveled the puck across the crease to Samsonov, who put it behind
Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I wanted to settle down the puck on the stick and then
I saw Sergei,'' said Thornton. ``Then I said, `let me get it to him
and he can put it in.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Burns was impressed with Thornton's overall play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is still young and still has things to learn,'' said Burns,
``but he's coming along. The expectations of a first-round draft
pick are always high. Last year he had to learn a lot of things.
Now he is coming into his own. He knows what the NHL is all about.
He knows what it is like to go into the corner and get put down on
the seat of your pants. Kids have to learn that, we can't expect
them to know that. Remember, he was just 18 years old last year.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Bruins on top after the first 20 minutes, they
basically plugged the middle and played sound defense in front of
Dafoe. But there were some cracks, and more than once Dafoe came up
big.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey's a team that likes to play with the lead and when
they're down, 3-0, they can't stick to their game plan,'' said
Dafoe. ``Fortunately, I was able to make a few stops early and then
we got going. A win like this was probably impossible a few weeks
ago, but the confidence level on this team is so much bigger right
now. This is the way we know we can play.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three Americans who were kidnapped last week in the Colombian
rain forest were found slain Thursday just across the border in
Venezuela, the authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two women and a man, members of a group that is trying to
preserve an indigenous tribe threatened by oil exploration, were
found bound, blindfolded and shot several times, according to the
Venezuelan military, which discovered the bodies in a wooded area
on the outskirts of Rio Arauca.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports suggested that the three had been abducted by
leftist guerrillas in Colombia, who often use ransoms from
kidnapping to finance their military activity.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department condemned the killings, for which it blamed
a prominent leftist guerrilla group, and it called on the Colombian
government to arrest and extradite to the United States those
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has identified the three dead as Terence
Freitas, 24, and Ingrid Washinawatok, 41, both of New York, and
Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The three had traveled to Colombia to study conditions among the
Uwa Indians in a community of 5,000 that is 200 miles northeast of
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Occidental de Colombia, an affiliate of
Occidental Petroleum of Bakersfield, Calif., has been trying to
explore the region, a move that anthropologists and
environmentalists say would devastate the Uwa and their land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Uwa won a legal battle against the company that
prevented it from drilling on their reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The three Americans, members of the Hawaii-based Pacific
Cultural Conservancy International, had been invited by Uwa leaders
for a weeklong visit when they were abducted. ``Everyone is in
shock,'' said Myra Scheer, a spokeswoman for The Rainforest
Foundation, on whose board Ms. Washinawatok served. ``They went
there to help people. We just can't understand why they were
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family members said they had assumed that the three
would be released unharmed, as was a group of American bird
watchers who last month were held captive by Colombian guerrillas
for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gay and Ms. Washinawatok were shot four times each, and
Freitas was shot six times, according to Col. Luis Eduardo Tafur, a
Venezuelan police commander in La Victoria, which is just across
the Arauca River from Colombia. He said officers had been drawn to
the site by the sound of automatic gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives of the dead said the three had been aware
of the potential danger in the region but were deeply committed to
helping the Uwa people preserve their way of life. A graduate in
biology from the University of California at Santa Cruz, Freitas
had traveled to the area three times in the last few years, family
members said. ``I'm proud of my son,'' said his mother, Julie
Freitas, who lives in Los Angeles. ``He lived the life he wanted to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Washinawatok, a member of the Menominee tribe in Wisconsin,
lived in Brooklyn with her husband and their 14-year-old son. She
was a filmmaker and a lecturer on Native American issues and was
active with the American Indian Community House in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   No group has claimed responsibility for the killings, but a
representative from the Uwa Indians who was with the group when
they were abducted blamed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, Latin America's largest and most experienced
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the rebels have been holding preliminary peace
talks with the Colombian government to end an armed conflict that
has cost more than 30,000 lives in the last three decades.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Politically, the new killings made little sense, and they were
far different from other abductions the FARC has carried out,
raising some question about the rebel group's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The abductions occurred at a roadblock in Arauca, where
right-wing paramilitary groups have been waging a campaign of
extermination among trade unionists, leftists, human rights
activists and suspected rebel supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FARC's roadblocks are typically manned by
uniformed troops in full combat gear, not lightly armed fighters in
civilian dress. Covering Arauca is the group's 43rd Front, which
organizes its fighters into squadrons of 12 rebels headed by a
veteran combatant, making it unlikely that a handful of FARC
teen-agers, as described by the Uwa, could carry out an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels stand to win nothing from killing foreigners now.
Since the overtures with the government began, the FARC has sought
the support of foreign powers. In Washington, its alleged role in
abducting two missionaries from the New Tribes Mission in 1994
continues to hamper the ability of Clinton administration officials
to openly support the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   And the abductions did not bear other trademarks of FARC
operations. Last year, when the group took three American bird
wtchers at a roadblock outside Bogota, the rebel group announced
they would be investigated for possible intelligence links and
either executed or released. This time, the FARC has yet to confirm
or deny the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Lee McClenny, a State Department spokesman, said, ``We demand
that the FARC accept responsibility for this cold-blooded murder
and turn over those of its members who perpetrated this crime to be
held accountable by the courts.''

MERCER'S 35 POINTS LEAD CELTICS TO VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ron Mercer looked at the man assigned to guard him
Friday night. But he couldn't look him directly in the eyes. If
Mercer had wanted to do that, he would have had to look down. Way
down. Six inches down.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Denver Nuggets knew they were in trouble. They
were forced to match 6-foot-1-inch Cory Alexander with the 6-7
Mercer. It wasn't fair. The Celtics beat the Nuggets at the
FleetCenter, 102-94. And Mercer helped them do it, finishing with
35 points, the most he's had in his two-season career.
</P>
<P>
   We know that lots of fans consider themselves basketball
intellectuals. Rick Pitino has had many people from various
occupations offer him coaching tips. If Pitino wanted to make all
those fans happy, he could have called them to the Celtics bench
and told them to design a play for Mercer, based on what they saw
in the game. Most fans would have called the same plays that the
Celtics did. They went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Throw the ball to Mercer. Get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too complicated when you've got a smaller guy on you
like that,'' Mercer said. ``It's not hard to shoot. Most of my
shots were just basic turnarounds.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't tell by his remarks, Mercer is a humble man. Some
of his shots were basic. But others were brilliant drives. At
times, he punctuated his flights to the basket with soft finger
rolls. On other drives, he handled the ball as if he were doing a
yo-yo demonstration. It would be near his waist one split second,
near his chest the next, and then, finally, over an outstretched
hand and in the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics figured out the Mercer plan early. He had 19 points
in his first 19 minutes. He helped the Celtics build an 18-point
second-quarter lead and a 59-50 advantage at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him before the game that we were going to look for
him,'' Antoine Walker said. ``We knew what kind of advantage he was
going to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the building thought the advantage had to do with
height exclusively. But there was also some psychology involved.
Friday night was the first time all season Mercer didn't have to
wear a brace to protect his previously sprained right knee. You
know how some children smile a lot when they have braces removed
from their teeth? Mercer was like that, since no brace was weighing
down his knee. All he had to wear was a thin _ and light _ knee
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to wear anything last year,'' Mercer said. ``The
only thing I wore was an elbow pad. I was just happy that I
wouldn't have to wear the brace anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Since we have discussed Mercer's offense, you might be thinking
that is the sole reason the Celtics won. You might have noticed a
box score that shows Walker with 21 points and 18 rebounds; Paul
Pierce with 17 points; Kenny Anderson with 12 assists. Those
performances helped the Celtics control the Nuggets. But there was
another group that, arguably, closed out the game for them. If it
weren't for this bunch, the Celtics might not be heading to Toronto
Saturday with a 7-7 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bomb Squad, Bomb Squad,'' Walter McCarty sang in the locker
room after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb Squad?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' he said. ``Dana (Barros) gave us our name. He's the
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bomb Squad is the Celtics' pressing unit, led by players
such as McCarty, Barros, Bruce Bowen, and Greg Minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell 'em, G,'' McCarty said to Minor, ``we're bad. We're bad,
man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Squad had a tough assignment in the fourth quarter. The
Celtics had struggled through a miserable third in which they shot
21 percent. So their lead had dwindled from 18 in the second, to 9
in the third, to 5 at the end of three to . . . 2?
</P>
<P>
   It was 77-75 with 11:44 remaining. It took less than three
minutes for the lead to be pushed to 10, 85-75. That's because the
Celtics forced four consecutive turnovers, got a flurry of offense
from Minor, Bowen, and Barros, and so frustrated the Nuggets with
their defense that Alexander cursed Bowen for guarding him so
closely.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they are not called something generic like ``second
unit.'' They are The Bomb Squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our Bomb Squad did a great job (last night) as they
always do,'' Pitino said. ``I don't think they've had a bad
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander will be able to say he finished with a career-high 28
points. But he also had seven turnovers. Former Celtic Eric
Williams was his old self, getting to the free throw line 15 times
and scoring 20 points. Antonio McDyess (17 points, 15 rebounds, 6
blocks) was everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not enough to prevent loss No. 12 for Denver. The
Nuggets were Bombed. They were also Mercered.

SABRES' SUB GOALIE SUBDUES STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Bring back Dominik Hasek, already.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Dominator'' might be the best player on the planet,
as superstar Wayne Gretzky called him last year, the Stars have to
believe Hasek is no Martin Biron.
</P>
<P>
   Biron, the 21-year-old rookie who was called up from the
American Hockey League, came up with 27 saves last night in a 2-1
Buffalo Sabres' victory that stopped the Stars' franchise-record
10-game road unbeaten streak. It was Biron's first NHL victory in
six appearances and also stopped the Stars' three-game winning
streak against the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek was in the net for those three games and had abominable
numbers, including a 5.71 goals-against average and an .823 save
percentage _ shocking for a man who has been chosen the NHL's
regular-season most valuable player two consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But with Hasek out with a nagging groin injury, Biron was called
into duty and responded well. Mix that with a monster game from
Sabres captain Michael Peca and the Stars were staring at their
first loss in their past five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid played well,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``We
had a lot of chances, but we couldn't convert.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss drops the Stars to 39-12-10, 10 points better than the
Ottawa Senators, the next closest team in the NHL standings. The
Sabres move to 29-21-12 and continue to jockey for playoff seeding
in the tight Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ends a three-game Stars' road trip in New York state
that finished 1-1-1 and was ``sporadic,'' defenseman Richard
Matvichuk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not as consistent as we have been,'' Matvichuk
said. ``It's not that we're playing a bad game, it's just that
we've got to bear down and play better. We have to play our style
of hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three road games, the Stars have yielded 26, 30 and 28
shots _ they average 23 a game. What's more, they're making
uncharacteristic puck-handling errors _ something they can't blame
on the condition of the Reunion Arena ice.
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk made the biggest mistake of the game, turning over the
puck to the Sabres' Wayne Primeau at the 11:26 mark of the first
period. Matvichuk was trying to make a cross-ice pass off the
boards at the Stars' defensive blue line and sent the puck directly
to Primeau, who wristed it past a surprised Ed Belfour for a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars then tied the game seven minutes later when Joe
Nieuwendyk made a strong play to end a strong shift started by his
linemates Pat Verbeek and Jere Lehtinen. Nieuwendyk sent a 30-foot
wrister through a crowd for his 16th goal of the season and fourth
goal in the past four games. Nieuwendyk has a six-game
point-scoring streak going.
</P>
<P>
   The score stayed that way for the next 20 minutes until Peca
struck with 13.5 seconds remaining in the second period. The Sabres
were on a power play after Verbeek received a controversial
roughing penalty. Sabres defenseman Alexei Zhitnik fired a shot on
net and Vaclav Varada deflected it while camping out inches in
front of Belfour. Belfour made the save, but Matvichuk knocked
Varada on top of Belfour and Peca easily lifted the rebound in from
the left side of the net over the pile.
</P>
<P>
   A video replay was checked to see if Varada was in the crease,
and he was. But replay judges determined he had been pushed in by
Matvichuk and Peca's 25th goal of the season stood up as the
game-winner.

MAVERICKS FALL TO 0-19 AT JAZZ HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ This time, the Utah Jazz fans got their money's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   One week after the Mavericks played four starters 12 minutes or
less here against the Jazz, all hands were on deck last night for
the rematch. Unfortunately for the Mavericks, the outcome was
basically the same as they suffered another loss in their
least-favorite arena, 106-95.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are 0-19 at the Delta Center and have dropped the
past 24 games they have played in Utah. The Mavericks carry a 6-12
record into Sacramento, where they complete this two-game road trip
at 8 p.m. tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, which has an NBA-best record of 13-3, was in control for
much of the game, and a Howard Eisley 3-pointer pushed its lead to
84-63 with 1:37 left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   After that, either the Jazz lost interest or the Mavericks
decided it was time to play ball.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by Michael Finley, Hubert Davis, Shawn Bradley and rookie
Dirk Nowitzki, the Mavericks had enough energy down the wire to
keep the Jazz regulars in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We zone-trapped them a lot of the game, and it was successful
sometimes, and other times it wasn't,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson
said. ``But we stayed with it and got back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis hit a 3-pointer with 2:55 left as the Mavericks drew
within 94-87, capping a 13-2 run over a two-minute span.
</P>
<P>
   But John Stockton connected on two free throws, Nowitzki missed
a long shot, and Jeff Hornacek's 18-footer bumped the Utah lead to
98-87.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone led Utah with 30 points and nine rebounds, and
Hornacek finished with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Finley paced the Mavericks with 29 points on 11-of-19 shooting
and collected eight rebounds. Bradley and Nowitzki scored 10 points
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 26 at the Delta Center, Nelson decided to raise the
white flag after the first period against the Jazz. The Mavericks
had played the previous night at home against Denver, and were
following the Jazz game with a home game against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   With three games in three days, Nelson decided to play the odds
and rest the majority of his starters against the Jazz. The
strategy didn't go over well in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very tough game for us because of the way they
didn't compete against us the last time we played,'' said Phil
Johnson, who coached in Jerry Sloan's absence. ``And we were
concerned about it _ at least as a coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan missed the game while recovering from a knee operation.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Mavericks nearly pushed the Jazz to the final
minute, but they couldn't overcome their slow start. For more than
three quarters, the Jazz used precision passing to pick apart the
Mavericks. In the first half, all 16 of Utah's field goals came on
assists, and 32 of their 35 field goals overall were off assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team executes better than anybody in the league,'' Nelson
said. ``I think they are the best but look out for the Lakers
now.''

DEVILS FALL, BUT IT'S THE RANGERS WHO LOSE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With 20 games to play in the regular
season, the Boston Bruins are clinging to the eighth and last
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Their grip hardened a bit
Friday night _ at the expense of the Devils and to the chagrin of
the Rangers _ when Boston made three first-period goals stand up in
a 4-1 victory over the Devils at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory widened the gap to 4 points between the eighth-place
Bruins and the ninth-place Rangers, who play each other on Sunday.
It also might have widened the animosity between Devils and Rangers
fans, for the notion arose during the first intermission Friday
that the Devils, down by 3-0, were sitting this one out because
they wanted to avoid facing the Rangers in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Having been eliminated by the Rangers in their last two playoff
meetings, the Devils probably would rather see them left out of the
playoffs this spring. But that would be a sorry excuse for the
Devils' sorry effort on Friday. The fact is they have had trouble
dominating anybody at home this season. The Devils, the second-best
team in the conference, are only 14-13-6 at home.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the first in the last five games (3-1-1) for the
Devils, who got their goal from Jason Arnott with 2 minutes 8
seconds left. They still lead the Atlantic Division, but are 2
points behind the Ottawa Senators in the conference race for the
home-ice advantage in the playoffs, and the Senators have two games
in hand on the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake here,'' Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko
said. ``We're battling for every point, and for some reason we came
out flat. It happened, and we cannot explain why.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils started the game so lethargically that they allowed a
goal on the first shot by the Bruins (27-25-10). They also allowed
two goals 52 seconds apart late in the first period. The third goal
came on Boston's fifth shot of the game, the kind of statistic
Martin Brodeur rarely registers when manning the Devils' net.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle McClaren was the first to find the net with a shot through
a crowd 2:39 after the opening face-off. It was McClaren's sixth
goal of the season, a career high.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's second goal also came through a crowd. This time the
puck went over Brodeur's glove on a shot by Grant Ledyard at 15:12.
It was Ledyard's third of the season, and like McClaren's goal, it
was a shot Brodeur did not see until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out pretty good,'' said Brodeur, who faced 20 shots
and made 17 saves, ``and I guess we weren't really ready.
Sometimes, stuff like that you can't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Samsonov gave the Bruins a 3-0 lead with his 21st goal of
the season just 52 seconds later when he converted Joe Thornton's
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Robbie Ftorek of the Devils, who said he was unhappy with
the way his team played, said he was not concerned that the team
was barely above .500 at home because the Devils were going to play
their next five games on the road. The Devils have the National
Hockey League's best road record, 20-8-2. &QL;

STEAL BY BARKLEYPUTS STORM IN FINAL

<P>
   The St. John's basketball players had lusted for this rematch,
had said all week that the only interest the Big East tournament
held for them was the chance at one more meeting with Miami. They
wanted, quite simply, revenge against the only team that had beaten
them twice this season and surged past them in the national polls
in the final week of the regular season. They owed them, Coach Mike
Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff finally came Friday night when, in the waning seconds
of a game full of brutal defense and extraordinary intensity, point
guard Erick Barkley, who had promised that Miami had another thing
coming if it thought this third game would be a cakewalk, stripped
Johnny Hemsley of the ball as the clock wound down to single
digits, securing a 62-59 victory over the ninth-ranked Hurricanes
and St. John's first trip to the Big East final since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-ranked Red Storm (25-7) will play fourth-ranked and
top-seeded Connecticut (27-2) in Saturday's game, and has a chance
to vanquish another opponent that defeated it this season.
Connecticut came back from a 12-point deficit to beat St. John's in
their only meeting this season, 78-74. The Red Storm's victory
Friday night was its first over a top-10 opponent this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game should have been played in the old Madison Square
Garden,'' Jarvis said, ``because it reminded me of a Rocky Marciano
fight where you punch each other for 15 rounds and the guy that was
standing at the end won. Thank God we were the last team standing.
Tonight was a little reward for many of the other very, very
disappointing games that we didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, which used a small lineup because center Tyrone
Grant was hampered by an infected cut on his right hand, slowed the
pace considerably, mixing defenses on Miami (22-6) and causing the
play to turn ugly quickly. Neither team shot over 40 percent and
the teams combined for 30 turnovers. Bodies banged, arms flew and
the whistles were plentiful. But the strategy worked, throwing
Miami's offensive timing off early in the game. St. John's had a
7-point lead midway through the first half, but the Hurricanes
finally found their rhythm to pull even at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected this to be a typical St. John's game where they
try to score 80 points,'' Miami Coach Leonard Hamilton said. ``To
their credit, they really slowed the tempo and did a nice job of
executing. It made us work an awful lot on defense. Any time a team
can make that adjustment and play like that, it is to their
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's had built a 10-point lead with 4 minutes 30 seconds
remaining _ forward Ron Artest led St. John's with 18 points and
Bootsy Thornton, who had been struggling, regained his
aggressiveness and had 14 points _ but Miami scored 8 straight
points, 4 by the co-player of the year Tim James (25 points) to
close the lead to 56-54. But Barkley, who had just 9 points but
added 5 assists, lofted a 3-pointer with 1:59 left to stop the run
and allow St. John's to exhale.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 59-54, and after James hit one of two free throws
and then another layup with 57.9 seconds left, the score was 59-57.
On the next possession, St. John's Lavor Postell (17 points) got
smacked in the face by Miami's Vernon Jennings as he drove to the
basket. He made both free throws to make it 61-57 with 31.9 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After Miami let :15 seconds elapse, James hit another layup with
:16.8 left and the St. John's lead was back down to two 2 points,
at to 61-59. But as Miami tried to get in position for a
game-ending- shot, the ball hit Vernon Jennings in the leg and he
fell to the floor. With no timeouts left, Jennings tossed the ball
desperately to Johnny Hemsley. Barkley pulled it out of his arms,
and seconds later was dancing joyously around the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good players will make great plays,'' Hamilton said. ``He did
a tremendous job of running the offense _ the best I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The bluster before this game _ the start of what will likely be
a heated tango for years to come _ had been great and the game was
even greater. The founding fathers of the Big East _ the seven
athletic directors who founded the league 20 years ago and who were
honored during the evening _ must have felt as if they were in a
time warp, brought back to the glorious, bruising heyday of the
league with plenty of hard fouls and little offensive showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   That Miami is the only team to beat St. John's twice in one
season, that they have surged ahead of the Red Storm in the
national polls, that the Hurricanes, according to St. John's
players, pointed and laughed at them after the first win victory in
Miami, has made the Hurricanes the unlikely foil in St. John's
drive for revenge. Even the normally polished Mike Jarvis needled
his adversary to the south this week, when he said that getting
Miami in the tournament was the only thing that mattered for the
Red Storm. After the game, as the ice packs were applied, the ill
will and bumps that define so many of the Big East's great
rivalries lingered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just wanted to win real bad,'' James said. ``But they
were still scared. So I don't know what they're all happy about.''
</P>
<P>
   Because payback is sweet for St. John's. &QL;

<P>
   Miller resigns &QL; 
as Baylor coach &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Five seasons after taking over a team in turmoil from NCAA
violations, Baylor basketball coach Harry Miller resigned Friday
night on the heels of a 6-24 season that included a winless
conference record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for 25 years,'' said Miller, who was
56-87 at Baylor. ``I think the time is right for a change. I have
no regrets except for our record this year. We got caught in a
tornado and just couldn't get out. That's the hardest part about
leaving now. I've always wanted to be the very best and be on top
in everything I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor athletic director Tom Stanton said an advisory committee
will be formed to find a successor to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any names in mind as a replacement, and we don't
have a timetable,'' Stanton said at a news conference in Waco.
``Harry and I had some very cordial conversations the last few
weeks. We talked about the program and shared ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a forced situation. It was something where we
mutually agreed that the program needed to go another direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources say possible candidates for the job include Oklahoma
State assistant coach Paul Graham, Southwest Missouri State coach
Steve Alford and Tulsa coach Bill Self.
</P>
<P>
   Sources also say Jim Turner, the CEO of Dr Pepper Texas and a
prominent Baylor alumnus, plans to provide additional financial
support to help the school get the best possible successor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears this season suffered the most losses in school history
and became the first Big 12 team to go through the conference
schedule without a victory. The Bears were 0-16 in league play
before losing to Oklahoma State 83-57 on Thursday in the opening
round of the Big 12 tournament at Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not as bad as our record would indicate,'' said
Miller, who was in the last year of his contract. ``I hope the fans
will be patient with whoever takes over the program, but I think
they can bounce back quickly because we've built a solid
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's 1998-99 record was a drastic downturn from the previous
two seasons when Miller led the Bears to a 14-14 record last year
and an 18-12 mark in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor failed to make postseason play in either season, but it
was a major improvement from Miller's first two years when the team
was 9-19 in 1994-95 and 9-18 in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was named interim head coach in November 1994 after head
coach Darrel Johnson and three of his assistants were fired in the
wake of NCAA violations involving academic fraud. Miller was given
the full title Jan. 25, 1995, but the Bears were on probation until
the 1997-98 season _ the first in which Miller had a full allotment
of scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Miller came to Baylor as an assistant to Johnson in the summer
of 1994 after building Temple High School into one of the top
basketball programs in the state. Two of his players _ center Brian
Skinner and guard Roddrick Miller, his son _ signed with Baylor in
1994 and played four seasons for Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who is a rookie for the Los Angeles Clippers, became
one of the best players is Baylor history, and Miller was a
starting guard his last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Along with point guard Patrick Hunter, Baylor had three talented
senior starters last season and started league play 5-0, but the
Bears ended Big 12 play a disappointing 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of three senior starters caused Baylor to be picked
near the bottom of the Big 12 entering this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears were 6-7 when conference play began but did not win
another game after a 102-85 victory over Texas-Pan American on Dec.
30. Miller's team was last in the Big 12 in shooting (37.9 percent)
and last in field-goal defense (42.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 47, said he has several options about what he will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know for sure, but I've been looking into some
franchise businesses,'' Miller said. ``There's nothing concrete,
but if I do it, it will take me out of Waco. Even when Roddrick
graduated from high school, I started thinking about how much
longer I wanted to be in coaching.''

RED STORM SWEEPS PAST MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finally, St. John's got some satisfaction. After a
regular season of ``almosts'' and ``could have beens'' against
ranked teams, the Red Storm came away with a quality win against a
quality team Friday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   That the victim was No. 2 seed Miami in the semifinals of the
Big East tournament made it all the more satisfying for St. John's,
which pulled out a tough 62-59 victory over the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The victory will send No. 3 seed St. John's (25-7) into Saturday
night's championship game against top seed Connecticut. It will be
the Red Storm's first appearance in the final since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm had lost to Miami twice during the regular season
and vowed it wouldn't happen a third time.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't, although not without a monumental struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give them credit,'' said Miami coach Leonard
Hamilton. ``We expected them to come out with their quick-tempo
game the way they had played before. But they slowed it down and
controlled the tempo of the game. They showed a tremendous amount
of discipline and that's to their credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half was played at that slow pace ended tied, 26-26.
The pace picked up in the second half and the Red Storm seemed to
gain control when they built a 56-46 lead with 4:38 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hurricanes (22-6) streaked back again, scoring the next
8 points and closing the gap to 56-54 with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was gutcheck time. St. John's Erick Barkley spoke first,
popping in a rainbow 3-pointer from the left side with 2:19 left to
extend the St. John's lead to 59-54.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Tim James (game-high 25 points) countered by making 1 of
2 free throws to make it 59-55, but the Hurricanes were running out
of time.
</P>
<P>
   James, the Big East co-Player of the Year, wasn't about to give
up as he put in a layup with 57.9 seconds left to cut the St.
John's lead to 59-57.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's tried to work the clock and get a good shot. They
split the difference when Miami's Vernon Jennings fouled Lavor
Postell with 31.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Postell, who keyed a St. John's surge in the first half, made
both foul shots to extend the Red Storm lead to 61-57.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes gave it their best shot, again led by James, who
put in a follow with 16.8 seconds left. The Hurricanes used their
last timeout to plot strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Miami quickly fouled Bootsie Thornton with 15.4 seconds left and
Thornton missed the first end of a one-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes rebounded but Barkley stole the ball from Johnny
Hemsley with five seconds left. All the 'Canes could do was foul
with 1.8 seconds left. Barkley's final free throw sealed the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game probably should have been played in the old Madison
Square Garden,'' said St. John's coach Mike Jarvis. ``It was like
an old-time heavyweight fight. It came down to the last man
standing and that was us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis said his team didn't feel any added pressure after a
string of disappointments that included losses to Miami, UConn,
Duke, and Stanford. ``We never felt we had to get over the hump,''
said Jarvis. ``The courageousness of this team came out. We
deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The players felt the same way. Ron Artest, who scored a
team-high 18 points and was one of three St. John's players in
double figures, was asked what the difference was this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept going, we were full of energy, we didn't slack off,''
he said. ``You don't want to go down, 0-3, against a club. They're
not that much better than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, they weren't.

LAKERS BEAT SONICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ No string of victories, no number of Dennis Rodman
scissor-kick rebounds and no scientifically sound hypotheses about
the Lakers' quick turnaround could dispel the theory, however
quietly spoken, that just maybe this sudden success was a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Five wins in five games sounded good, but with two against the
winless Clippers and two against the inconsistent Phoenix Suns, it
has been all too easy to brush off this streak as the product of
scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   But legitimizing the streak was only as far away as a game
against a Seattle or a Utah, and the Lakers draw both in a
three-day span. Legitimacy may have come Friday night, as the
Lakers won a close battle with the Sonics 103-100 in front of a
packed house at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good test,'' coach Kurt Rambis said before tipoff
Friday. ``The players have to know exactly where they stand....
It's a barometer of where they are and where they have to be. Win
or lose, it just helps them understand what they've gotta do.''
</P>
<P>
   For certain the winning streak has masked some deficiencies,
from sporadic defensive lapses to bad shot selection. And Rambis
said it's not gone unnoticed, or unspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a point of telling them everything is not OK,'' Rambis
said. ``We still have a long way to go. We want to be playing much
better basketball at the end of the season than we're playing
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Minute for minute, Friday's game against the Sonics ranked with
the best the Lakers have played this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's always about improving,'' Rambis said. ``We don't
have time to kill in practice to get the necessary hard work. We're
going to have to improve in games throughout the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers entered the fourth quarter with a 74-73 lead, with
neither team able to mount a pull-away rally. The final period
turned into the Gary Payton show, as the Sonics' crafty guard
scored Seattle's first 15 points of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the most Seattle could muster was a four-point lead, and it
quickly vanished with a Shaquille O'Neal jam and Derek Harper
fast-break layup. With 1:58 remaining, the score was knotted at 94.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper and Dale Ellis then turned it into a personal
rivalry. The longtime friends, who came into the league together 16
years ago, began trading clutch 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   First Harper, then Ellis. Then an O'Neal baseline jumper to make
it 99-97 Lakers. Then another Ellis 3-pointer, followed immediately
by a Harper 3-pointer to give the Lakers the 102-100 edge.
</P>
<P>
   An O'Neal free throw made it 103-100 with 18.1 seconds left,
leaving it up to a wide-open Vin Baker to nail the 3-pointer ...
which clanged off the front of the rim. Hersey Hawkins' 3-point try
at the buzzer also missed to seal the Lakers victory.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal led the Lakers with 31 points, and Payton led Seattle
with 34.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-fought first half ended with a 50-48 Lakers lead. Kobe
Bryant, picking up where he left off two nights earlier, came out
blazing with 10 points in the first quarter, and Shaquille O'Neal
scored 15 in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers outshot the Sonics, 48.8 percent to 39.5 percent, but
the Sonics' flurry of 3-pointers _ five on nine attempts _ kept the
score close.
</P>
<P>
   With Rodman getting the majority of power forward minutes,
Travis Knight spent the first half justifying Rambis' confidence in
him as the starter. Knight stayed out of the early foul trouble
that has plagued him this season and ended the half with nine
rebounds and eight points in 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Knight also played solid defense against Olden Polynice, who
hurt the Lakers with 15 points and 17 rebounds in their meeting two
weeks ago. Rambis put Knight on Polynice, leaving O'Neal to cover
Vin Baker, and the move paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice ended the half with four points and six rebounds, and
Baker made just 2 of 12 field goals.

THREE AMERICANS KIDNAPPED IN COLOMBIA FOUND DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 10th graf to correct ``last MONTH'' to ``last YEAR''; 15th

clarification.) 
(ATTN: Hawaii, N.Y.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three Americans who were kidnapped last week in the Colombian
rain forest were found slain Thursday just across the border in
Venezuela, the authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two women and a man, members of a group that is trying to
preserve an indigenous tribe threatened by oil exploration, were
found bound, blindfolded and shot several times, according to the
Venezuelan military, which discovered the bodies in a wooded area
on the outskirts of Rio Arauca.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports suggested that the three had been abducted by
leftist guerrillas in Colombia, who often use ransoms from
kidnapping to finance their military activity.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department condemned the killings, for which it blamed
a prominent leftist guerrilla group, and it called on the Colombian
government to arrest and extradite to the United States those
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has identified the three dead as Terence
Freitas, 24, and Ingrid Washinawatok, 41, both of New York, and
Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The three had traveled to Colombia to study conditions among the
Uwa Indians in a community of 5,000 that is 200 miles northeast of
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Occidental de Colombia, an affiliate of
Occidental Petroleum of Bakersfield, Calif., has been trying to
explore the region, a move that anthropologists and
environmentalists say would devastate the Uwa and their land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Uwa won a legal battle against the company that
prevented it from drilling on their reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The three Americans, members of the Hawaii-based Pacific
Cultural Conservancy International, had been invited by Uwa leaders
for a weeklong visit when they were abducted. ``Everyone is in
shock,'' said Myra Scheer, a spokeswoman for The Rainforest
Foundation, on whose board Ms. Washinawatok served. ``They went
there to help people. We just can't understand why they were
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family members said they had assumed that the three
would be released unharmed, as was a group of American bird
watchers who last year were held captive by Colombian guerrillas
for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gay and Ms. Washinawatok were shot four times each, and
Freitas was shot six times, according to Col. Luis Eduardo Tafur, a
Venezuelan police commander in La Victoria, which is just across
the Arauca River from Colombia. He said officers had been drawn to
the site by the sound of automatic gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives of the dead said the three had been aware
of the potential danger in the region but were deeply committed to
helping the Uwa people preserve their way of life. A graduate in
biology from the University of California at Santa Cruz, Freitas
had traveled to the area three times in the last few years, family
members said. ``I'm proud of my son,'' said his mother, Julie
Freitas, who lives in Los Angeles. ``He lived the life he wanted to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Washinawatok, a member of the Menominee tribe in Wisconsin,
lived in Brooklyn with her husband and their 14-year-old son. She
was a filmmaker and a lecturer on Native American issues and was
active with the American Indian Community House in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gay was the director of the cultural group that organized
the trip. ``We're really in shock right now,'' said her husband,
John Livingstone. ``It's too much to process.''
</P>
<P>
   No group has claimed responsibility for the killings, but a
representative from the Uwa Indians who was with the group when
they were abducted blamed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, Latin America's largest rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the rebels have been holding preliminary peace
talks with the Colombian government to end an armed conflict that
has cost more than 30,000 lives in the last three decades.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Politically, the new killings made little sense, and they were
far different from other abductions the FARC has carried out,
raising some question about the rebel group's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The abductions occurred at a roadblock in Arauca, where
right-wing paramilitary groups have been waging a campaign of
extermination among trade unionists, leftists, human rights
activists and suspected rebel supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FARC's roadblocks are typically manned by
uniformed troops in full combat gear, not lightly armed fighters in
civilian dress. Arauca is in an area under the FARC group's 43rd
Front, whose squadrons of 12 rebels are each headed by a veteran
fighter, making it unlikely that a handful of FARC teen-agers, as
described by the Uwa, could carry out such an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels stand to win nothing from killing foreigners now.
Since the overtures with the government began, the FARC has sought
the support of foreign powers. In Washington, its alleged role in
abducting two missionaries from the New Tribes Mission in 1994
continues to hamper the ability of Clinton administration officials
to openly support the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   And the abductions did not bear other trademarks of FARC
operations. Last year, when the group took three American bird
watchers at a roadblock outside Bogota, the rebel group announced
they would be investigated for possible intelligence links and
either executed or released. This time, the FARC has yet to confirm
or deny the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Lee McClenny, a State Department spokesman, said, ``We demand
that the FARC accept responsibility for this cold-blooded murder
and turn over those of its members who perpetrated this crime to be
held accountable by the courts.''

DUCKS FIND NEW SCORING SOURCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Last season Teemu Selanne scored 52 goals as he did
his best to carry a Mighty Ducks team that was much too heavy for
even his sturdy back.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne's load is much lighter this year and both he and the
Ducks are enjoying themselves much more -- and that means
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Selanne extended his point-scoring streak to 15 games
and his goal-scoring streak to eight, but it was little-known Jeff
Nielsen who scored twice as the Ducks defeated Nashville 3-2 before
15,839 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, who had only one goal coming into the game, helped the
Ducks (29-25-9) equal a team record with their sixth consecutive
victory and move them four games over the .500 mark for the first
time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The win also moves them to within three points of fourth-place
Phoenix in the Western Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, who has only seven career goals, put the Ducks in front
early and then scored a much needed insurance goal midway through
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between Nielsen's goals was Selanne's 36th goal of
the season. It was a goal that helped him match a season-high
streak of eight set by Buffalo's Miroslav Satan. His 15-game point
streak is the second longest in the league this year (Eric Lindros
had an 18-game streak). It also ties his own team record.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took a 1-0 lead at 7:06 of the first period when
Nashville's Kimmo Timonen fell down on the job.
</P>
<P>
   There was nobody within 10 feet of the defensemen when he lost
an edge and fell on his backside at the Predators' blue line.
Neilsen jumped on the puck, broke down the right wing and his
25-footer from the right circle bounced in off Nashville goalie
Mike Dunham's glove for his second goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's Denny Lambert, a former Duck, hit the post midway
through the period, before the Ducks' mighty power play struck
again.
</P>
<P>
   With 26.2 seconds left in the period, Selanne took a pass from
Marty McInnis and ripped a shot from the top of the left circle,
beating Dunham high on the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Ducks' NHL-leading 66th power play goal, six more
than they have scored in any previous season. Anaheim has scored at
least one power play goal in 29 of 32 games at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The second period saw both teams generate some good scoring
chances. Dunham made a great glove save on Selanne to prevent
another power play goal and he stopped a deflection by Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Roussel thwarted Sebastien Bordeleau's shorthanded bid
from point-blank range 2 1/2 minutes into the period. He also
knocked the puck off Cliff Ronning's stick as the Nashville center
appeared ready to score on backhander with 5 1/2 minutes left in
the period.
</P>
<P>
   But the Anaheim backup goalie was unable to stop Tom
Fitzgerald's seemingly harmless 45-footer at 11:50, a shot that cut
the Ducks' lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had three splendid chances to get that goal back early
in the final period when Selanne and Kariya buzzed in and around
the Nashville defense.
</P>
<P>
   Dunham, however, was equally brilliant stopping a breakaway by
Selanne, a hard backhander by Kariya and a point-blank deflection
by Selanne.

TEXAS OVERCOMES FOUL WOES, INJURY TO STOP COLORADO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Texas coach Rick Barnes has often called Ivan
Wagner his team's unsung hero.
</P>
<P>
   When Wagner sat with his fourth foul yesterday and 11 1/2
minutes remaining in Texas' 82-76 Big 12 quarterfinal victory over
Colorado, the Longhorns lost the momentum of what had been their
most efficient offensive performance of the season.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, Texas had forged a reasonably comfortable margin
between itself and Colorado's dangerous offensive attack, led by
shooting ace Kenny Price.
</P>
<P>
   But the top-seeded Longhorns pulled off a series of late clutch
plays to hold off the Buffaloes, surviving Wagner's six-minute
absence and Kris Clack's bruised buttock that limited him in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Refreshed after a loss to Missouri a week ago, Texas (19-11)
advanced to face Oklahoma State (21-9) in today's 1 p.m. semifinal
at Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm very pleased with the way we did what we had to
do down the stretch,'' Texas coach Rick Barnes said. ``We got into
some trouble when Ivan was in foul trouble, which proves how
valuable he is to our team. But this time of year, players have to
make plays, and we had players who did that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading 61-47 shortly after Wagner's departure with 11:37 left,
Texas watched its lead gradually shrink to 75-72 with 1:40 to play.
The Longhorns then seized the moment.
</P>
<P>
   First, backup guard Will Clay hit a one-dribble, pull-up,
14-foot jumper from the left side of the lane with 1:06 to play and
four seconds left on the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``A one-dribble move I work on every day,'' Clay said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a Colorado free throw, Clack rebounded Gabe
Muoneke's errant 16-footer and laid it in off the glass for a 79-73
cushion with 19.5 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to jump, but I didn't have to jump that high,''
Clack said. ``I was in the right spot and was able to get \Rthe
rebound\S, throw it off the glass and it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Muoneke answered the call to seal the victory after
Jaquay Walls nailed Colorado's 14th 3-point shot of the day with
14.7 seconds left. After Clay netted a free throw at 12.3, Muoneke
stole the rebound when Clay missed his second shot. Muoneke kicked
it out and got a return pass for a dunk that slammed the door with
two seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might get inside my man and tip the ball out and
that would seal the game,'' Muoneke said. ``But he got control and
I tipped it out of his hands, picked it up, and then threw it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do anything to let this one slip away, though it
could have gone either way. We kept our composure to get this
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mihm led with a season's 17th double-double of 24 points
and 14 rebounds. Muoneke contributed 18 points and nine rebounds
and tied a career-high with six assists _ all to Mihm. Clack added
14 points and Wagner had five assists.
</P>
<P>
   Price hit a tournament-record nine 3-pointers in 11 attempts on
his way to a game-high 31 points. But Texas outscored Colorado
52-18 in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a really good Texas team,'' Colorado coach Ricardo
Patton said. ``They pounded the ball inside a lot and for the most
part _ especially in the first half \RTexas led 44-34\S _ we didn't
have any answers. It's a shame Kenny plays his best game of the
season and we come up short.''

FREE-AGENT ADDITIONS WOULD PUT GLINT BACK IN GAILEY'S EYES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chan Gailey's face was pale, his eyes dark and sunken that late
January afternoon just over two months ago. He searched for the
right words, looking for a way to say what needed to be said
without pointing fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' head coach started to talk, then stopped. He
answered questions with a nod. He asked, a couple of times, for
those gathered around him to draw their conclusions based on their
own observations.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey and a sold-out Texas Stadium had just seen the Cowboys'
offense shut down by dropped passes and poorly run routes.
Quarterback Troy Aikman had been sacked four times and threw three
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone paying attention in the home team's locker room after the
Arizona Cardinals upset the Cowboys, 20-7, in the first round of
the playoffs knew what was coming this off-season, knew that Gailey
would target two areas that had to be improved before next season:
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver and the middle of his offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The answers to both those problems paid visits to Valley Ranch
over the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion drawn: Owner Jerry Jones will somehow find a way to
put a smile back on his coach's face by signing free-agent wide
receiver Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail and center Mark Stepnoski within
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Gailey was already smiling yesterday, or
perhaps it was because he had just spent the afternoon playing golf
with Pat Summerall and a couple of other friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did was sit down at the end of the season and evaluate
where we were as a team,'' Gailey said. ``As we looked at the
players available, it just so happened that two of the better
players available fit what we were looking for in free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Just so happened? If Jimmy Johnson were still here, someone
would call that Cowboy luck.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Cowboys have cap problems. But since when has Jones not
been able to slither his way around, over, under and through that
red tape? He'll take money out of one pocket, drop it in another,
you watch and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a situation, when you're either tight under the cap,
you have to be smart about how you spend your money,'' Gailey said.
``We don't want to get to the point where we're dismantling the
team just to sign a couple of free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismantling, no. Rearranging, sure.
</P>
<P>
   Stepnoski is still one of the best in the NFL at center. His
presence alone would immediately upgrade the Cowboys' offensive
line and lift Aikman's spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the guy we've spent most of our time on and with to
this point,'' said Gailey, who hinted that the Cowboys and
Stepnoski might be close to striking a deal. ``We wouldn't be
posturing ourselves and neither would he if we didn't see that
there was a light at the end of the tunnel. Anytime you visit,
you've got a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great knowledge of our team and a lot of people in
our organization have a great knowledge of him. He's a sharp guy.
Very sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Stepnoski and the return of Everett McIver would
improve the depth in the middle of the line immensely. The Cowboys
could consider keeping Flozell Adams at tackle, where he's better
suited.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail would be the No. 2 receiver the Cowboys have needed so
badly to help stretch the field and take some of the pressure off
Michael Irvin. ``Rocket'' is coming off a career year in which he
caught 69 passes for 1,024 yards and eight touchdowns for the
Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an excellent year this year, obviously the best year
he's had,'' Gailey said. ``He's a guy who has a lot of potential, a
great deal of speed. He would fit our offense pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely need to be able to complement the other side of
Michael. I don't think anybody would argue with that. We did that
early in the year. We did not do that later in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   When wideout Ernie Mills and tight end David LaFleur went down
with injuries, the Cowboys discovered that Billy Davis was not
going to be the answer as the No. 2 receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had just been one injury, we might have overcome it,''
Gailey said. ``But then all of a sudden to get Ernie hurt and David
LaFleur hurt, those things just started to mount up. That got to us
in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made strides this year on offense and I think as much as
anything, us being in the second year of the offense will help,
along with Troy being comfortable in all the calls. But more good
players never hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are closing in on two more, which comes as no real
surprise to those who looked into Gailey's eyes that sickening
Sunday afternoon two months ago.

BAYLOR COACH RESIGNS UNDER PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Baylor basketball coach Harry Miller resigned
last night, little more than 24 hours after his team finished the
worst season in school history.
</P>
<P>
   He said he made his decision after consulting with athletic
director Tom Stanton yesterday, the latest in a series of
discussions that Miller said had gone on for the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a point in time now for me to turn another page in my
life,'' Miller said from Waco. ``I'm going to explore some business
opportunities outside athletics. I've done some preliminary looking
at some franchise opportunities that I was considering five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't rule out coaching again, but it's not in my immediate
plans. I've put five years into this program ... and I think I've
bridged the gap and borne the brunt of the most difficult part of
it. Now it's up to someone else to take it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller came to Baylor in the summer of 1994 from Temple High
School, the last stop in a distinguished career of Texas high
school coaching. He was appointed interim coach in November 1994
after Darrel Johnson was dismissed near the end of a two-year NCAA
investigation into academic fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was given a five-year contract on Jan. 25, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took over at a difficult time and has been a model of
integrity and class for our players, the athletic department and
the entire university,'' Stanton said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's record was 56-87. His best season was 18-12 in 1997,
though last season's 14-14 team improved from 6-10 to 8-8 and a tie
for fifth place in the Big 12. He lost the core of his program when
former Temple star center Brian Skinner and junior college transfer
guard Patrick Hunter graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Miller said, ``There is life after Brian
Skinner.''
</P>
<P>
   His optimism was unfounded. Baylor stumbled to a 6-7 start, then
lost 17 consecutive Big 12 games _ including Thursday's 83-57 loss
to Oklahoma State in the opening round of the Big 12 tournament. No
Baylor team had gone winless in conference play since 1945.

URI, TEMPLE TO MEET FOR A10 CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The storylines suggested a compelling game. The
University of Rhode Island featured sophomore sensation Lamar Odom,
the Atlantic 10 rookie of the year and future NBA lottery pick.
George Washington featured Shawnta Rogers, the 5-foot-4-inch A-10
player of the year. Moreover, GWU is coached by former URI mentor
Tom Penders.
</P>
<P>
   And if that wasn't enough, URI was so steamed it lost a
regular-season battle to GWU Jan. 23 that on Thursday night, Odom
declared, ``Don't be surprised to see blood on the floor'' the
second time around.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, there was no blood. There wasn't much suspense
either. URI used a balanced scoring attack and a defense that held
GWU to 21 percent shooting in the first half to post a 94-78
victory and advance to its second Atlantic 10 tournament
championship game in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Reynolds-Dean had 21 points and nine rebounds, Odom had
17 points and 11 assists, and Preston Murphy had 14 points and
blocked three shots by Rogers (four total) for URI (19-12), which
beat only its fourth opponent with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was outstanding, and Murphy set the tone,'' said
URI coach Jim Harrick, whose team will meet Temple, a 76-64 winner
over defending A-10 tournament champ Xavier Friday &UR;  &LR; night, in
Saturday's 6 p.m. championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Brokenborough had a game-high 22 points and Mark Karcher
added 19 points for Temple (21-9), which advanced to the
championship game for the league-leading 10th time, the first time
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the second time the teams have met in the title game;
Temple beat the Penders-coached Rams 68-63 in the 1988
championship, URI's first championship game appearance. The Owls
have won four titles, their last coming in 1990. Since then,
they've reached the finals four times, losing to the University of
Massachusetts each time.
</P>
<P>
   URI, which lost to St. Joseph's in the 1998 championship game,
struggled in two lopsided losses to Temple in the regular season.
It was one of the reasons URI players said Thursday night they
preferred playing Xavier should they reach the final. After Friday
night's win, however, the Rams changed their tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who we play now. I don't care if we play
Duke,'' said Reynolds-Dean, who helped URI outrebound the Colonials
in the first half, 28-18.
</P>
<P>
   But GWU assisted its own demise, with poor shot selection. The
Colonials (20-8) mustered just two field goals over the last 11:17
of the first half and trailed at halftime, 45-24.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers finished with a team-high 22 points but was 6 of 20 from
the floor. Odom, on the other hand, spent much of the evening
getting his teammates involved in the offense. With 14:57 left, he
threaded the GWU defense for a nifty halfcourt pass to Murphy, who
scored on a layup to give the Rams a 57-32 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the other game, Karcher scored 17 second-half points,
including three treys and four free throws over the last 7:26, to
help the Owls pull away.
</P>
<P>
   Temple trailed, 30-28, at halftime. Karcher hit consecutive
treys, the former with 7:26 left, to give the Owls a 57-53 lead. A
trey by Gary Lumpkin with 5:20 left, cut the deficit to 57-56, but
Karcher hit another trey and Lamont Barnes scored on a putback dunk
of a Kevin Lyde miss to give the Owls a 62-57 edge with 3:53 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Karcher sank a pullup trey, with 3:05 to go, to give the Owls a
65-59 edge. Two more Karcher free throws with 1:03 left gave the
Owls a 73-61 lead.

<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A week after the one-man, Rodman circus came to
town, his impact can be summed up this way: The Lakers are not
distracted _ but you are.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it, you're hopelessly, happily distracted by the freak
with the hair. You and 17,504 friends at the Forum have never
watched basketball this way before, with eyes riveted to the one
player least likely to sink a shot, tracking his every move even
when he's sitting on the bench, the hair and the pierced ears
hooded by a towel.
</P>
<P>
   I'm with you. I sat down to write the Lakers haven't been so
much fun to watch since they took ``Showtime'' off the marquee.
</P>
<P>
   But this sounds more precise: (begin ital)No Laker(end ital) has
ever been as fun to watch as Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team? I couldn't really say. I don't watch them
anymore. Is Eddie Jones still a Laker? How about Kobe Bryant?
</P>
<P>
   I know Shaquille O'Neal is still here _ he's the one who's
always spoiling my view of Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Like you, I don't want to miss a second of him.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the second when he air-balls a free throw, then
walks to the rim with his index finger in the air, as if to gauge a
tricky breeze, as he did in the Lakers' victory over Phoenix the
other night.
</P>
<P>
   Or the second when he asks a referee for the ball between
somebody else's free throws, squeezes it as if to check for
ripeness, and quietly hands it back.
</P>
<P>
   Or the second when he fumbles a rebound out of bounds, and takes
out his frustration by pulling himself up on the net.
</P>
<P>
   Or the second when he grabs a rebound right-handed because his
left arm is locked up with one of the Suns', and manages to hurl an
outlet without bothering to disentangle the other arm.
</P>
<P>
   Or the second when he locks arms with the Suns' Tom Gugliotta _
how (begin ital)do(end ital) these things always happen to Dennis?
_ both go tumbling and Gugliotta receives a technical foul for
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Or the second when he plants a playful pat on the butt of the
Suns' Joe Kleine, who's on a rant after being whistled for hacking
Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   Or the second when he quickly positions himself to get run over
by a cutting opponent, causing an offensive foul with a move so
clever it draws laughs from the (begin ital)Phoenix(end ital)
bench.
</P>
<P>
   All the things you booed when Rodman wore Detroit blue, San
Antonio black or Chicago red, you love now that he's in purple and
gold for your town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is an entertainer,'' Derek Harper said, which is what
Dennis has always maintained.
</P>
<P>
   During the weeks-long contract negotiations, the Lakers were
warned of the Rodman tradeoff: On the plus side, he'd give them
13.2 rebounds a game, nettling defense and infectious intensity; on
the negative, he'd be a goof-off _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But until or unless the ``or worse'' kicks in, the cold, hard
production and the clown act go together like skin and ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would say it's not the glamorous way to play,'' Laker Rick
Fox said of Rodman's emphasis on the game's menial tasks. ``But he
makes it glamorous.'' If he played baseball, Rodman would win
notoriety not by hitting 70 home runs but by breaking up 70 double
plays.
</P>
<P>
   You would also say Dennis Rodman is the last guy anybody would
hold up as a role model for the kids. But think about this.
</P>
<P>
   He has fun playing defense, the basketball equivalent of
homework. He has fun boxing out for rebounds, the basketball
equivalent of cleaning up your room. He even makes amusement out of
sitting on the bench, the basketball equivalent of keeping quiet at
your sister's flute recital.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the NBA's next public-service announcement:
``Kids, I'm Dennis Rodman, living proof that doing the chores with
panache will make you a star. So why don't you get off your
(bleep)?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to see a guy with the ability to play defense and
rebound as well as he does,'' Laker Derek Fisher said, ``and give
it flair.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke being that sometimes, Rodman appears to be not much
more than a kid himself. When he mused during the already-legendary
Planet Hollywood press conference that he wasn't sure he wanted to
rejoin the NBA and ``go back and be 22 again,'' the unasked
follow-up question was, When did you ever act as old as 22 before?
</P>
<P>
   As bitter as he sounded that tearful day in Beverly Hills, as
sour as much of his past has been, that's how sweet his basketball
has been for the first week in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The 13.2 rebounds aren't even half of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Wormaphobics' buzzword was ``distraction.'' Remember? Rodman
would be a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they were right. The Lakers might be all right, but I'm
hopelessly, happily distracted. And if you'd quit grinning long
enough to admit it, you are too. &QL;

<P>
   Juggling process &QL; 
ahead for Dierker &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alou's injury means new lineup roles
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ For any manager, there are two must-have items
once the exhibition season begins: a pencil and an eraser.
</P>
<P>
   During the next four weeks, Astros manager Larry Dierker will
fill in, scratch off and erase a number of potential batting
lineups. The only two spots on which it is safe to use ink are
leadoff (Craig Biggio) and No. 9 (the pitcher).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to look at a lot of different ways,'' Dierker said
after the Astros' 7-4 victory over Atlanta in their exhibition
opener Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to spring training, the batting order appeared to be the
least pressing issue, with the National League's most potent
offense from a year ago returning intact. The knee injury that
sidelined Moises Alou has forced some experimenting, if not
shuffling, in parts of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The search will concentrate on the Nos. 2 and 5 spots. The
latter was occupied last season by Alou.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker is inclined to move Derek Bell into Alou's former spot,
but he could be met with some resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Bell repeatedly says he has no desire to move from the No. 2
spot, one protected by Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, but the Astros must
find some way to compensate for the loss of Alou's power _ 38 home
runs and 124 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have to replace his RBIs, and the most veteran guy
we have to do that is Derek,'' Dierker said. ``But he doesn't feel
as comfortable hitting fifth as he does second. Maybe if we put him
in there a few times, that will change.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bell shifts to the middle of the lineup, Carl Everett and
Ricky Gutierrez become the leading candidates to bat second.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a 1-through-8 look at possible scenarios:
</P>
<P>
   1) Biggio is one of the best leadoff hitters in the game. End of
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   His blend of power, speed and smarts makes Biggio perfect for
this role. He had a club-record 210 hits last season and batted a
career-high .325, meaning he is always a threat to get on base.
Biggio managed 20 home runs and 88 RBIs _ figures usually reserved
for a No. 3 or No. 5 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   2) Perhaps the biggest lineup question: Do you move Bell from
his current comfort zone and run the risk of having his production
drop off? It's hard to disagree with Bell's argument that he remain
in the same lineup spot after he produced career-best numbers in
almost every category while hitting second in more than one-third
of the games.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal No. 2 hitter can hit line drives, is needed to move
runners from second to third and is usually a good bunter; this
last is not one of Bell's strong traits.
</P>
<P>
   One possible alternative could be Everett, who never has hit
second. Everett, a switch-hitter, is quick and makes contact
regularly. Another plus: set to begin his first full-time gig in
the major leagues Everett is willing to bat anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play,'' said Everett, who batted sixth in 91 of his
113 starts last season. ``For some guys it may bother them (to bat
in certain spots), but for someone like me that has never really
gotten to play you don't care where you hit. Some guys need
protection in the lineup. Some guys may have their superstitions,
or just feel comfortable, being in a certain spot. I couldn't care
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker also plans to look at Gutierrez (27 games at No. 2 in
1998); utility player Bill Spiers (57 games); and Alou's outfield
replacement, Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   3) Bagwell, who can be counted on 30-plus homers and 100 or more
RBIs, can bat third or cleanup. With the addition of Ken Caminiti,
he likely will see most of his time at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   4) Caminiti gives the Astros the potential to have four of the
top five spots produce 20 or more home runs. When healthy, he can
add another dimension to a club's lineup (40 homers, 130 RBIs in
1996), but Dierker will closely monitor how much playing time the
'96 Most Valuable Player gets after missing 32 games last season
with an assortment of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   On days he rests, Dierker probably will bat Bagwell fourth, a
spot he occupied in 99 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   5) Alou was a mainstay in the fifth spot, batting there in all
but 27 games in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing his offensive numbers seems unlikely; the Astros' goal
is to come close. The problem is determining whether Bell will
adapt to a new role.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker hopes that if uses Bell enough in this spot during the
spring, Bell will adjust.
</P>
<P>
   6) An ideal sixth hitter has decent power. Hidalgo and Everett,
who combined for 22 home runs and 111 RBIs last year, are logical
fits. Dierker was able to use them in a platoon. Hidalgo would get
the role if Everett moves to the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   7) Catcher Tony Eusebio likely will likely bat here. If
Gutierrez hits in the second spot, the Astros catchers could move
to No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   8) Whoever bats in this spot will be called on to do a lot of
things. Pitchers usually pitch the bottom of the order tough, so
the No. 8 hitter will have to be mentally tough.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros like Gutierrez in this spot because he is a
fast-enough runner to advance on bunts and infield outs _ often hit
softly _ by the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's too early to set a lineup,'' said Gutierrez, who
batted eighth 21 times in 1998, when catcher Brad Ausmus normally
occupied the No. 8 spot. ``There are a lot of options. All managers
wish they had a lineup like we do.''

<P>
   TATITLEK, Alaska _ It was a few minutes after midnight on March
24, 1989, when the big tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef in the icy
waters of Prince William Sound. ``Evidently, we're leaking some
oil, and we're going to be here for quite a while,'' the captain
radioed to the Coast Guard. Even now, as the 10th anniversary of
one of the nation's worst environmental disasters approaches, the
Exxon Valdez is in many ways still here.
</P>
<P>
   In environmental terms, the sound is still recovering, according
to a report issued recently by the joint federal and state council
that monitors the continuing effects of the tanker accident, which
dumped at least 10.8 million gallons of North Slope crude into the
sound and blackened 1,500 miles of the magnificent Gulf of Alaska
coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 28 species listed in the report, only two _ the bald
eagle and the river otter _ are considered to be ``fully
recovered'' a decade later. For the ecosystem in general and for
most other species, substantial progress has been made toward
recovery but ``there is a long way yet to go,'' according to the
council's director.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, the Valdez case drags on. Five years after a federal
jury ordered Exxon to pay a record $5 billion in punitive fines to
the thousands of villagers and commercial fishermen hurt by the
spill, the company has yet to pay any of the judgment, challenging
it in an appeals process that may continue for years. Exxon, which
spent an estimated $2.3 billion on cleanup activities and another
$1 billion in a federal settlement, says the award sends a
``perverse message'' after all the company did to mitigate the
spill's effects.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another continuing reminder of the spill, the tanker's
skipper, Joseph J. Hazelwood, is also still a presence here in
Alaska. After years of fighting his state conviction on the
misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil, the former
captain, who lives on Long Island, N.Y., will at last return this
summer to begin a court-ordered community service program. He has
been assigned to pick up trash on the streets of Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   And even the ship itself remains in the news. It has long since
been repaired and renamed the SeaRiver Mediterranean, and the Exxon
subsidiary that owns it, challenging the 1990 federal law that in
the animus of the moment prohibited her from ever returning to
Alaska, has been seeking permission in both Congress and the courts
for her once again to work the waters of Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   But for many people who live here, the idea of the tanker's
returning is ``just too much,'' in the words of Gary P. Kompkoff,
president of the village council here in Tatitlek, a small Aleut
community just three miles from where the Exxon Valdez went
aground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still struggling with what happened here,'' Kompkoff
said. ``Eleven million gallons of oil, from the bottom of the food
chain to the top. I'm not sure I understand how we could ever
totally recover from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the spill, Exxon and most of the people who live
in the area around the sound here were in disagreement over just
how bad its effects would be, and 10 years later, they still are.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon says the area has ``essentially recovered'' by any
reasonable measure, and the company's vice president for
environment and safety, Frank B. Sprow, said that while any oil
spill is an unfortunate event, exhaustive studies by the company
and independent scientists have found no long-term harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you find is acute short-term impacts,'' Sprow said, ``but
the environment &UR;  &LR; _ Mother Nature, if you will _ has remarkable
powers of recovery, whether aided by man or not, and the natural
order does re-establish itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to tourists who pass by in cruise ships or to a visitor
flying over the snowy tundra and vast blue glacial fields in a bush
plane, the sound looks as clean and spectacular as it ever did. And
some steps taken because of the spill may protect it all the more.
For instance, some of the money from Exxon's federal settlement has
been used for conservation programs protecting about 650,000 acres
of land, including sensitive habitat along 61 salmon and trout
streams.
</P>
<P>
   And while there can be no guarantee that a disastrous spill will
not happen again, steps undertaken since the accident have, it is
widely agreed, made shipping here less prone to a recurrence. In
addition to enactment of a federal law that phases in a requirement
that all tankers be double-hulled, an elaborate escort program with
tugboats, on-board harbor pilots, radar tracking and other measures
is in place for the tankers that routinely pass in and out of the
port of Valdez, ferrying oil from the trans-Alaska pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   But the Exxon Valdez spill killed 250,000 seabirds, 2,800 sea
otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles and up to 22 killer
whales, according to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council,
the federal-state monitoring agency. And the notion that the sound
has recovered from the kind of devastation that such a toll implies
is bitterly disputed by many of the 20,000 people who live in the
areas that were most directly affected by the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not back to what it was _ no way at all,'' said Gail
Evanoff, the council president in tiny Chenega Bay, a village that
lay directly in the the path of the westward flow of the oil.
``There's life there, but not what you saw before.'' Ms. Evanoff,
as well as officials of the trustee council, said there were still
small pockets along the beaches and in rock crevices where small
pools of oil and tar balls can be found _ and smelled.

 TATITLEK, Alaska: and smelled.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Cordova, a fishing village with a postcard harbor nestled up
against the Chugach Mountains, there is still visceral anger at
Exxon, and many people blame the oil company for a downturn in
their fortunes _ declining Pacific herring runs and a sharp falloff
in the value of commercial fishing permits, particularly for
herring. ``The fabric of this community was pulled apart, ripped,
torn, shredded, kicked,'' said a former mayor, Kelley Weaverling.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Lange, 46, who comes from a longtime fishing family and
with her husband has been struggling to maintain a fish-processing
plant in Cordova, said she believed the damage to the sound and the
people who make their living from it could be compared in many ways
to the trauma of a rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say with utmost certainty that there is no such thing as
a true `cleanup' here,'' Mrs. Lange said. ``You can put on makeup
and make a show of it and say, `Oh, it must be better again.' But
it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon vigorously disputes such claims and notes that many of the
people who are still complaining about the spill received
compensatory payments in 1989 and 1990 that amounted to several
times their normal annual income.
</P>
<P>
   Herring spawning has indeed sharply declined since 1989 _ from
100,000 metric tons to 16,000 by 1993 and now around 30,000, said
Stan Senner, science coordinator of the trustee council. But Exxon
says that such declines are part of normal fluctuations in the
ocean and cannot be attributed to the spill. Runs of salmon, which
make vast migrations and were much less directly affected by the
spill, have remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive look at the spill's continuing environmental
effects is not easy to come by, in part, scientists point out,
because there is not a lot of detailed ``baseline data''
quantifying exactly what the sound was like before the Exxon Valdez
hit the jagged shoals of Bligh Reef.
</P>
<P>
   But the trustee council, which was financed with money from the
government's settlement, did reach several conclusions in the
recent report. The good news was that bald eagles, which can be
seen all around here and which were enumerated in surveys before
the spill, are flourishing and are thus considered ``recovered.''
River otters no longer indicate elevated levels of the blood
chemicals that indicate oil exposure, and so they too were declared
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But several bird species and marine mammals _ including common
loons, three species of cormorants, harbor seals, harlequin ducks
and the killer whales of Prince William Sound _ have shown no
significant recovery, according to the report. The stellar sea lion
remains an endangered species, though its numbers had been entering
into a serious decline in the northern Gulf of Alaska even before
1989, meaning that the spill's responsibility for the continued
decline remains a subject of fierce contention.
</P>
<P>
   Many villagers rely on the fish, mammals and wild plants for a
subsistence diet here, and the report found that their gathering
methods had changed after the spill, with many vital foods being
much harder to find in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the ecological conditions remain under debate, the
legal terrain of the case remains a battlefield as well, and
recently, plaintiffs have been pressing Congress to intervene by
holding up the proposed $80 billion merger of Exxon and Mobil until
the case gets resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Exxon's arrogance in refusing to pay us what it owes us,
the government should not let Exxon amass any more power or
arrogance,'' said Patience Andersen Faulkner, a Cordova resident,
showing a visitor a letter she sent recently to her senators on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 federal jury award to about 33,000 fishermen, villagers
and other Alaskans was the largest pollution award in history, but
it remains unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is currently under appeal, and it might wind up
before the Supreme Court, though the plaintiffs' lead lawyer, Brian
O'Neill, says there is no reason for it to do so.
</P>

<P>
   ``It's basically a big drunk-driving case,'' said O'Neill, who
is based in Minneapolis. ``There are no big constitutional issues
involved. We don't need the Supreme Court _ Exxon should pay up.''
(The ship's captain was seen having drinks in the hours before the
Valdez left port and failed an initial blood-alcohol test by the
Coast Guard, but he has steadfastly denied being drunk when the
tanker hit the reef, and the state jury acquitted him of
intoxication charges.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plaintiffs in Cordova and Tatitlek seem prepared to
fight on in the courts for years or longer, while other shrug off
the whole case and say they doubt they will ever see any money from
the judgment. A few say Exxon tried to make amends and no longer
deserves to be the object of communal wrath. And still others say
that in the most important way, the case will never be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter has fished with me since she was a toddler, and
one thing I know we've lost is my ability to tell her, `Oh, it'll
be OK, the sound will always be OK,''' said Steve Riedel, a
42-year-old fisherman who notes ruefully that his fishing boat,
Lucky Lady, was so named before the spill.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Diana, is 16 now, and she has a collection of
rocks, including some oil-covered ones she pulled from the beaches
just last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just isn't the same,'' Riedel said, ``and she knows it. And
so when she's deciding what she's going to do with her life, I
think I'm probably going to tell her, keep your fond memories, but
find something to do other than fishing in Prince William Sound.''

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN ONE WIN FROM NCAAs 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Edniesha Curry couldn't find her shot, Lynda
Amari was there.
</P>
<P>
   When Amari ran into foul trouble in the second half, Curry was
there.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they put the Cal State Northridge women's basketball
team one step closer to the school's first date with 63 other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Curry scored 18 of her 24 points in the second half, and Amari
added 11 of her 16 points in the second half to lead the top-seeded
Matadors to an 83-68 victory over No.6 Northern Arizona in front of
a season-high 905 at Northridge on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win was its sixth in a row and put Northridge (20-7) into
tonight's 5 p.m. final against second-seeded Portland State. To the
winner goes as the conference's automatic NCAA Tournament
representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be one game away from the NCAAs is so exciting, it's almost
beyond words,'' Northridge coach Frozena Jerro said.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona, which had won four in a row to get to the
tournament, then knocked off No.3 Montana State on Thursday,
finished 14-14.
</P>
<P>
   As it has been throughout the season, Curry and Amari have been
the inside-outside combination for the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do it on purpose,'' Amari said. ``We have a
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night was no different.
</P>
<P>
   Curry was just 1 of 5 from the field in the first half, and
Amari played just eight minutes because of foul trouble. Both had
five points.
</P>
<P>
   What a different a half makes.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 34-32 to start the second half, Amari 11 of her team's
first 15 points. That keyed a 13-4 Northridge run and gave the
Matadors a 45-38 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona, which lost both games against Northridge this
season, fought back to tie the score at 51-51 with 11:30 to play.
Eight seconds later, Amari left with four fouls.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Curry awakened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat down (at halftime) and relaxed,'' Curry said. ``My
teammates told me to let the game come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She drove the land for a layup. She drained two 3-pointers. Then
two more outside jumpers. Then she stole the ball and made a layup,
followed by another 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen points in five minutes and seven seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, in the postgame interview, couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa!'' she exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Explosive, huh?'' Jerro said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Northridge had a 72-58 lead with about six
minutes to play, and that was the end of the Lumberjacks' bid to
become the first sixth-seeded team to reach the women's tournament
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took it to us in the second half,'' said NAU forward
RaeAnn West, who led the Lumberjacks with 20 points. ``Curry and
Amari came out, started hitting their. They were hot. We were in
their faces and they were hitting them.''
</P>
<P>
   One other piece of motivation guided the Matadors: Northern
Arizona had defeated them three times last year, the third time
coming in the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had forgotten,'' Jerro said. ``A player mentioned it. Tina
(Greer) said, `It's payback time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Keisha Harris added 11 points for Northridge, and Jamilah Jones
added 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona got 15 points from Kristi Forman, 11 points
from Anna Sturing and 10 points from Jess LeBlanc.

LAKERS KEEP WINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ No string of victories, no number of Dennis Rodman
scissor-kick rebounds and no scientifically sound hypotheses about
the Lakers' quick turnaround could dispel the theory, however
quietly spoken, that just maybe this sudden success was a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Five wins in five games sounded good, but too many of them came
against the winless Clippers and the inconsistent Phoenix Suns,
leaving an opening for cynics to brush aside the streak as the
product of scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe legitimacy was just one victory away, and the Lakers'
heart-stopping 103-100 defeat of the Seattle SuperSonics at the
Forum on Friday certainly qualified as a true test of their
newfound success.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming a 15-point fourth quarter by the Sonics' incomparable
Gary Payton, the Lakers held on for their sixth straight win and
avenged their recent loss at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge. It was huge,'' said Derek Harper, and the 16-year
veteran was qualified to make such declarations after carrying the
Lakers in the crucial final minutes with a pair of clutch
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of ending the Lakers hadn't seemed capable of
just 10 days ago, when they were losing three straight, starting at
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Tied at 94-94 with 1:58 left, the Lakers took the lead on a
Harper 3-pointer, only to watch Dale Ellis _ Harper's one-time
teammate and close friend _ answer with a 3-pointer of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal hit a baseline jumper, but Ellis canned another
3. Harper proved up to the challenge against his old running mate,
taking a kickout from O'Neal and hitting the 3-pointer to make it
102-100 with 37.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident taking big shots,'' said Harper. ``I have
throughout my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Even sweeter to outduel Ellis, the NBA's second all-time leader
in 3-pointers and Harper's teammate when both were drafted by
Dallas in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' Harper said. ``I'm waiting for him to come
over now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had three chances to tie or win the game, but Payton
missed a running jumper, and Vin Baker and Hersey Hawkins each came
up short on 3-point tries, the final buzzer sounding as Hawkins'
shot bounced off the front of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Minute for minute, the victory over Seattle ranked with the best
the Lakers have played this season. They shot 50.6 percent as a
team, outrebounded the Sonics 46-36 and never trailed by more than
five points as everyone in the rotation but Rodman scored.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 31, but the Lakers were multidimensional, getting
20 from Kobe Bryant, 17 from Harper and 10 from Travis Knight, who
also had 11 rebounds for his first double-double of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell chipped in eight points each, and
the Lakers won despite an off night from Rodman, who had six
rebounds in 26 minutes _ his lowest board count since joining the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored a game-high 34 points and almost single-handedly
killed the Lakers with his fourth-quarter spurt. ``Payton's
amazing, isn't he?'' Lakers coach Kurt Rambis remarked. ``I kept
thinking he'd wear out and get tired, but he just got better.''
</P>
<P>
   A hard-fought first half ended with a 50-48 Lakers lead. Bryant,
picking up where he left off two nights earlier against Phoenix,
came out blazing with 10 points in the first quarter, and O'Neal
scored 15 in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Knight played solid defense against Olden Polynice, who hurt the
Lakers with 15 points and 17 rebounds in their meeting two weeks
ago. Rambis put Knight on Polynice, leaving O'Neal to cover Baker,
and the move paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice ended the half with four points and six rebounds, and
Baker made just 2 of 12 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   So a test was passed, though another waits in Utah on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for us,'' Bryant said, ``to show how much we've
improved since the last time we played (Seattle). Maybe in the past
we wouldn't have come through like we did.''

DUCKS WIN 3-2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Last season Teemu Selanne scored 52 goals as he did
his best to carry a Mighty Ducks team that was much too heavy for
even his sturdy back.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne's load is much lighter this year and both he and the
Ducks are enjoying themselves much more -- and that means
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Selanne extended his point-scoring streak to 15 games
and his goal-scoring streak to eight, but it was little-known Jeff
Nielsen who scored twice as the Ducks defeated Nashville 3-2 before
15,839 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, who had only one goal coming into the game, helped the
Ducks (29-25-9) equal a team record with their sixth consecutive
victory and move them four games over the .500 mark for the first
time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often I score one goal, so then to score two ...,''
said Nielsen, who had a shot at a hat trick when he was rewarded
with some power play time late in the game. ``I held my breath for
a minute, but maybe three is a little too much to ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's 12th victory in its last 15 games moved it within
three points of fourth-place Phoenix in the Western Conference
standings.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Kariya still wants to see more from his team,
especially with Detroit coming to town on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play a lot better,'' said Kariya of the Ducks,
who outshot Nashville, 34-24. ``If we get the same kind of effort
against Detroit we're going to get killed, but I'm sure our team
will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, who has only seven career goals, put the Ducks in front
early and then scored a much needed insurance goal midway through
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't scored a lot of goal, but we feel real good about
our role,'' said Nielsen, who plays on a checking line with Ted
Drury and Jim McKenzie. ``We are going to play a real simple game,
try to create some energy and get the crowd going.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who was held scoreless despite seven shots on goal, was
happy for Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played extremely well,'' said Kariya. ``It's nice to see
him get rewarded. He has a great shot, he just needs to be more
confident in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Players like Nielsen scoring certainly take the pressure off the
Ducks' top line and that's very much appreciated by team's captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to get offense from other guys,'' Kariya
said. ``It's a huge confidence booster.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between Nielsen's goals was Selanne's 36th goal of
the season. It was a goal that helped him match a season-high
streak of eight set by Buffalo's Miroslav Satan. His 15-game point
streak is the second longest in the league this year (Eric Lindros
had an 18-game streak). It also ties his own team record.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took a 1-0 lead at 7:06 of the first period when
Nashville's Kimmo Timonen fell down on the job.
</P>
<P>
   There was nobody within 10 feet of the defensemen when he lost
an edge at the Predators' blue line. Neilsen jumped on the puck,
broke down the right wing and his 25-footer from the right circle
bounced in off Nashville goalie Mike Dunham's glove.
</P>
<P>
   With 26.2 seconds left in the period and the Ducks on the power
play, Selanne took a pass from Marty McInnis and ripped a shot from
the top of the left circle, beating Dunham high on the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Ducks' NHL-leading 66th power play goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The second period saw both teams generate some good scoring
chances, but the only goal came on a harmless looking 45-footer at
11:50 that eluded Dominic Roussel, who was making a rare start in
place of Guy Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, however, didn't scored again until there were only
11.8 seconds left in the game when Cliff Ronning beat Roussel on
the short side.

<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-NUKE-SECURITY (Washington) _ Working with nuclear
secrets stolen from a U.S. government laboratory, China has made a
leap in the development of nuclear weapons: the miniaturization of
its bombs, according to administration officials. Until recently,
Beijing was unable to produce small warheads that could be launched
from a single missile at multiple targets and form the backbone of
a modern nuclear force. But by the mid-1990s, China had built and
tested such small bombs, a breakthrough that officials say was
accelerated by the theft of U.S. nuclear secrets from Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico. By James Risen and Jeff Gerth.

SONICS FALTER IN CLUTCH, LOSE TO LAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Kobe Bryant performed all the fancy moves.
Shaquille O'Neal punished with power. And in the end, veteran Derek
Harper delivered the clutch baskets to prove Sonics coach Paul
Westphal's point.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers seem to have it all.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sonics are attempting to contend with Gary
Payton, a mystery sidekick from game to game, and strong signs that
one day soon they will piece it all together.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Sonics failed to hold a late lead and fell to the
Lakers 103-100 at the Great Western Forum. It was the Lakers' sixth
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics dropped their second straight and fourth in their
last six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up and down. We're not on the same page, but we'll get
there,'' Payton said. ``At some point, we're going to put it
together. I've played with these guys too long. We've just go to be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Lakers were the most diligent team in crunch
time.
</P>
<P>
   They withstood Payton scoring 15 of his game-high 34 points in
the fourth quarter. And with the game tied 94-94, the Lakers passed
the ball around the Sonics' trapping defense until they found an
open shot.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it was Harper with the open looks, and he made the
Sonics pay. Harper hit a 3-pointer with 1:26 to put the Lakers
ahead. Then, after Dale Ellis responded for the Sonics, Harper
struck again.
</P>
<P>
   His last 3-pointer with 37.8 seconds left to play put the Lakers
ahead 102-100. After O'Neal split two free throws, the Sonics had a
couple of chances to force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were just 1-for-12 from the 3-point line before
Harper's barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Sonics had two chances to force overtime. But when
the Lakers forced the ball out of Payton's hands with a double
team, the ball went to Vin Baker, whose 3-pointer fell short with
2.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle got the ball back and Hersey Hawkins fired a desperation
3-pointer that bounced off the back of the rim at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happened that it was Vinnie,'' Payton said. ``If it
was Dale (Ellis), he might have made the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Payton, the Sonics only got major offensive
contributions from Ellis. The reserve guard scored 20 points off
the bench, which included 5-of-5 3-pointers. Ellis sank two
3-pointers in the game's final minutes to keep the Sonics afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary and Dale were sensational,'' Westphal said. ``We couldn't
find much offense from anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal stayed with his revamped lineup. Hersey Hawkins started
at shooting guard with Billy Owens at small forward. Detlef
Schrempf came off the bench for the second straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal used just eight players until late in the third
quarter, when Aaron Williams made a brief appearance. Otherwise,
only Drew Barry came off the bench to spell Payton and occasionally
allow him to play shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   Payton wasted little time rebounding from Thursday's poor
performance. After making just 3 of 16 shots in a home loss to
Phoenix, Payton connected on four of his first seven shots against
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   He made both 3-pointers he attempted in the opening period, and
scored inside with Harper and Derek Fisher taking turns guarding
him. Payton finished with 10 points in the first quarter _ one more
than the nine points he totaled in Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Payton is amazing,'' Lakers coach Kurt Rambis said. ``I
thought he would get tired, but he just got better.''
</P>
<P>
   Things seem to get worse for the other starters.
</P>
<P>
   Baker missed 10 of his first 11 shot attempts, surprisingly
scoring six of his 10 first-half points from the free throw line.
Owens missed the two shots he attempted. Polynice went 2-for-5, and
Hawkins was 1-for-3 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Owens finished the game 1-for-4 from the field. Baker finished
with 16 points but shot 4-of-20 from the floor _ mostly jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can make that shot, but he's our primary low-post threat,''
Westphal said of Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baker: ``I had good looks. Maybe I rushed them a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles dominated the glass even though Dennis Rodman was
ineffective with a season-low six rebounds. The Lakers beat the
Sonics on the boards, 46-36. O'Neal just methodically worked the
paint. The Laker center scored a team-high 31 points and grabbed 11
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another killer for the Sonics was their inability to get back on
defense, which cost them several easy baskets down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't go by our schemes,'' Payton said. `` . . . We got
cherry-picked about six times. That's just not paying attention. We
were up four points with the ball (late in the fourth quarter).
We're not a ballclub that pays attention. When we didn't pay
attention and didn't do what we were supposed to, it cost us the
game.''

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Eight tourists, including an
American couple, are slashed to death deep in the Ugandan jungle,
apparently by Hutu militiamen targeting Britons and Americans. They
had been there last week in the hope of trekking up a slope full of
biting insects and stinging nettles to spend a brief hour in the
company of mountain gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department and the British Foreign Office had
issued warnings about fighting in western and northern Uganda, but
the park they were visiting, the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park,
was considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   This raises two important questions. Why weren't the tourists
warned that they were in a potentially dangerous region? And, on
the other hand, were they crazy to be there in the first place,
paying a fortune and risking malaria just to get close to a family
of gentle giants led by a 400-pound silverback who is perfectly
capable of ripping a man limb from limb?
</P>
<P>
   Now forget Uganda. In fact, forget all of Africa, the continent
comprising 15 of the 28 countries on the State Department's
``Travel Warning'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Think about Austria, the land of edelweiss. Austria is
instructive because most of the 38 people smothered by two
avalanches there last month were tourists _ skiers. Austria is also
instructive because late last year, the State Department briefly
cautioned travelers to be wary of going there, detecting vague
``threats to American interests.'' Nothing happened. Ultimately,
better weather reports might have saved more lives than deep
political intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, look at Egypt. The risks there are no secret.
Muslim fundamentalists trying to choke off the government's tourism
revenue killed dozens of tourists between 1992 and mid-1997. But
after a government crackdown, Egypt was considered a fairly safe
destination on Nov. 16, 1997; it was on nobody's ``don't go'' list.
The next day, 58 tourists were cut down at the Temple of Luxor, and
tourism dropped 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The point is simple, and particularly relevant at a time of
rising and increasingly exotic global travel: Predicting danger for
tourists is a crap shoot, tour operators and foreign service
officials alike say.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one ignores the fact that plane crashes and natural
disasters like mudslides and avalanches can happen pretty much
anywhere, political violence is remarkably unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known that Islamic fundamentalists would set off
a bomb last year in Kenya? Or, in a country like South Africa with
a minuscule Muslim population, that a few anti-American Muslim
fanatics would blow up a Planet Hollywood restaurant, killing not a
single American (clearly, Americans were the desired target) but
instead a South African banker, while maiming a British family?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have foreseen this,'' Sue Ockwell, a spokeswoman
for Acacia Expeditions in London, said of the attack last week in
Uganda, which killed four of her tour group's clients. ``The
Foreign Office didn't, and our local contacts had no sense of
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that  &UR; someone &LR;  could have intuited the
danger. Not too long ago, Hutu militias attacked a Ugandan village
and killed nearly everyone in it. Gorilla trekking in Rwanda and
the former Zaire died out because of guerrilla warfare. Moreover,
diplomats and journalists working in east Africa were aware that
some Hutu militants resent Americans and Britons.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the fundamentalists in Egypt, the Hutu militias had
never announced any hostile intent toward tourists. Wednesday, a
British newspaper reported that the Ugandan government had received
a threat in writing. Uganda denies it. ``There was no warning,''
said Arthur Kafeero, press officer at Uganda's London embassy. ``If
there had been, preventive action would have been taken.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, keeping travelers apprised of dangers is very much
on the minds of Western governments. Most of the 28 countries on
the State Department's ``don't go'' list, however, are fairly
obvious threats. They are either at war, or have public,
government-endorsed bouts of anti-American feeling. Among the
former are Bosnia, Angola, Rwanda, Burundi, the two Congos, Sierra
Leone and Guinea-Bissau. Among the latter are Iran, Iraq, the
Sudan, Afghanistan and Serbia. (The list's glaring exception is
Montserrat, which is in danger of being buried in volcanic ash.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet no country is on the list simply because it has a high crime
rate _ although consular information sheets on every country in the
world include warnings about crime. ``Just because a country isn't
on the travel warning list, it's important not to be lulled into
thinking it's completely safe,'' the State Department spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that crime is spotty, so it wouldn't be useful or
fair to stigmatize an entire country over its crime rate. For
example, crime has closed all the luxury hotels in downtown
Johannesburg, but tourists happily stay in newer hotels in safer
northern Johannesburg and then return to the airport for flights to
crime-free game parks and beaches.
</P>
<P>
   American tourism, of course, is not immune to the crime problem.
In 1993, after nine foreign tourists were killed in south Florida,
Germany put Florida on its ``don't go'' list. Yet no one can
credibly argue that all of America is unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ockwell of the British tour outfit said that in an effort to
get more timely safety updates, representatives of the British
travel industry recently met with officials from the Foreign
Office. Not surprisingly, that meeting was prompted by old news:
the killing of three British tourists kidnapped by Yemeni
tribesmen, and a government warning to Britons to shun Chile
because of resentment over Britain's detention of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator.
</P>
<P>
   The industry wanted better international coordination, and it
wanted site-specific warnings: Tour promoters thought remote parks
in Chile were safe for British tourists even if the capital,
Santiago, was dicey.

 JOHANNESBURG: was dicey. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the meeting's agenda illustrated the problem: Yemen was
discussed only after the fact; Uganda was not discussed. Foreign
travel dangers often get noticed only after the worst has happened.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, if any group of globetrotters should have been able
to live with some risk, gorilla tourists should have. There are
fewer than 600 mountain gorillas left on earth, and seeing them is
one of the coveted experiences in the growing field of adventure
tourism. The Uganda trek is expensive and hard, but ``everyone who
does it comes back saying they felt privileged,'' Ms. Ockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure tourists are expected to know they are taking
potentially fatal chances. No one imagines he or she will die at
the hands of terrorists, of course. And even factoring in
terrorism, the statistical risks are usually lower than those of
driving to work every day. Until the odds get stacked ridiculously
high against them, adventure tourists will keep signing up.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure tourism is a big industry here in southern Africa,
where even rental houseboats are advertised with swimming cages
that ward off crocodiles.
</P>
<P>
   Drifters Adventours, which sends small groups off with guides to
drive as far as Kenya _ camping out, driving through elephant herds
and going whitewater-rafting and bungee jumping on the way _ has
lost only 2 clients in 17 years. One was gored by a buffalo, one
got blood poisoning after a spider bite.
</P>
<P>

   But the meeting's agenda illustrated the problem: Yemen was
discussed only after the fact; Uganda was not discussed. Foreign
travel dangers often get noticed only after the worst has happened.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, if any group of globetrotters should have been able
to live with some risk, gorilla tourists should have. There are
fewer than 600 mountain gorillas left on earth, and seeing them is
one of the coveted experiences in the growing field of adventure
tourism. The Uganda trek is expensive and hard, but ``everyone who
does it comes back saying they felt privileged,'' Ms. Ockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure tourists are expected to know they are taking
potentially fatal chances. No one imagines he or she will die at
the hands of terrorists, of course. And even factoring in
terrorism, the statistical risks are usually lower than those of
driving to work every day. Until the odds get stacked ridiculously
high against them, adventure tourists will keep signing up.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure tourism is a big industry here in southern Africa,
where even rental houseboats are advertised with swimming cages
that ward off crocodiles.
</P>
<P>
   Drifters Adventours, which sends small groups off with guides to
drive as far as Kenya _ camping out, driving through elephant herds
and going whitewater-rafting and bungee jumping on the way _ has
lost only 2 clients in 17 years. One was gored by a buffalo, one
got blood poisoning after a spider bite.

<P>
   Later this month, the U.S. government will release new figures
showing how many Americans are behind bars, and the numbers will
reveal that the bull market for prisons is still charging ahead.
Nearly 1 of every 150 people in the United States is in prison or
jail, the Justice Department will announce, a figure that no other
democracy comes close to matching.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the total number of people locked up in federal and state
prisons and local jails will likely reach the 2 million mark,
almost double the number a decade ago, as the ranks of prisoners
grow enough each year _ to fill Yankee Stadium and then some. For
an American born this year, the chance of living some part of life
in a correction facility is 1 in 20; for black Americans, it is 1
in 4.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts failed to predict that the inmate population would
triple from 1980, and now nobody seems to know how to stop the
buildup. By all logic, prisons should be experiencing a few
vacancies, and the cost of arresting, prosecuting and putting away
an army of criminals should be at ebb. After all, the economy could
hardly be better, and crime has fallen steeply six years in a row.
But a prison peace dividend is nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the guessing game now is: At what point does the
world's largest penal system hit a plateau _ 2.5 million inmates, 3
million? Surely, if crime continues to fall, the number of new
prisoners must also fall.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. No matter how much crime plummets, the United States
will still have to add the equivalent of a new 1,000-bed jail or
prison every week _ for perhaps another decade, federal officials
say. Some even believe the prison boom could be permanent, at least
for another generation.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason is that so many of the new inmates are drug
offenders. In the federal system, nearly 60 percent of all people
behind bars are doing time for drug violations; in state prisons
and local jails, the figure is 22 percent. These numbers are triple
the rate of 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Americans do not use more drugs, on average, than people in
other nations; but the United States, virtually alone among Western
democracies, has chosen a path of incarceration for drug offenders.
More than 400,000 people are behind bars for drug crimes _ and
nearly a third of them are locked up for simply possessing an
illicit drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's internal gulag,'' is what Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the
nation's drug czar, calls the expanding mass of drug inmates. Many
of those have committed any number of crimes. But a growing number
of them have broken no laws other than the ones on drug use.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Congress and the states passed drug laws that
required judges to put people in prison _ even first-time
offenders, or those caught with small amounts of an illicit
substance. Mandatory minimum sentences, as they are called, leave
no room for a judge to consider special circumstances, or options
such as treatment instead of jail.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that more arrests would lead to more convictions,
which would put more people in jail, and the crime rate would fall.
That did happen.
</P>
<P>
   Another dividend was supposed to be a drop in drug use, but that
has not happened. Arrests of people who use drugs just hit an
all-time high, the FBI reported. At the same time, drug use has
gone up among the young, and for drugs like heroin or
methamphetamines. Over all, drug use has not budged for 10 years.
For virtually all other crimes, of course, the figures are stunning
_ with huge drops in murder, robbery and assault. Whether this is
because the United States will soon have 2 million people locked up
is subject to much debate.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the authorities who argue that the prison boom has
taken the worst criminals out of circulation _ and has thus been
the biggest factor in reducing crime _ are at a loss to explain the
drug-use figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in favor of the federal government ceasing and desisting
the war on drugs,'' said Dr. Morgan Reynolds, director of the
Criminal Justice Center at the Dallas branch of the National Center
for Policy Analysis, a free-market think tank.
</P>
<P>
   He described himself as being on the conservative side of the
debate over prisons and crime; he says the crime drop can be
directly attributed to the prison boom.
</P>
<P>
   But he is less sure that the federal government's war on drugs
has an effect on crime rates and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   For liberals and libertarians who have long claimed
incarceration has failed to do anything but run up the bill in the
drug war, conservative cover is welcome. Last week, Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., introduced a bill to restore discretion for judges
in sentencing low-level, nonviolent drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be getting to the point of diminishing returns _ the
more you expand the prison system, the more small fry you put in
there,'' said Marc Mauer, assistant director of the Sentencing
Project, a nonprofit group that has been critical of the prison
buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the architects of punitive drug policies now argue
that stuffing the prisons with ever more drug offenders is not a
wise investment. Edwin Meese, who was attorney general under
President Ronald Reagan, when most of the drug laws were rewritten,
has started to look favorably on treatment for low-level offenders
rather than jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders ought
to be reviewed,'' said Meese in an interview. ``We have to see who
has been incarcerated and what has come from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the laws that send drug offenders to prison with
reflexive certainty, there are now institutional incentives to keep
locking up more people _ a trend that some people call the prison
industrial complex.

   The stock price of the Corrections Corporation of America, the
nation's largest private jailer, has increased tenfold since 1994.
The company's stock is now privately held. But Corrections Corp.
has created a popular real-estate investment fund to get a return

<P>
   Unions representing prison guards are the fastest-growing public
employee associations in many states. In California last year, the
union was given a raise of 12 percent, which brought the salary for

<P>
   It is the rare rural community that rejects a new prison in its

</P>
<P>
   The prisons in California, as in virtually every other state,
are near capacity, even though the state has built 21 new
institutions in the last 15 years. Soon, it will cost nearly $4
billion a year to run the state's prison system. Should the
Legislature propose some change in the law that might bring down
the growth in prisons, they are likely to hear howls of outrage
from the union that has most benefited from the growth in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have a society committed to building new prisons and
keeping them, it's very difficult to close them down,'' said Mauer.
``Particularly in rural areas that come to depend on them. It's
like trying to close a military base.''
</P>
<P>
   The states also have an incentive to keep people in jail a long
time. A federal law passed in 1994 provides matching funds to
states to keep violent criminals in prison longer by denying
parole. This act and other so-called truth-in-sentencing laws are
reasons why the ranks of prisoners will not soon drop, even as
crime levels off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got crime going in one direction, and social policy
going in the other,'' said Dr. Allen Beck, the Justice Department's
lead statistician on criminal justice trends.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that may finally slow prison growth, said Beck,
are budget concerns. It costs taxpayers $20,000 a year to house and
feed every new inmate _ and that does not include the cost of
building new prisons and jails. The states are spending nearly $30
billion to keep people in jail _ about double the rate of 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are starting to balk. California legislative leaders
say they will build no new prisons in coming years, but they have
not said what they will do with excess prisoners. In Washington
state, a bill that would abolish mandatory minimum prison terms for
drug offenders has gained support from judges, prosecutors and
tough-on-crime Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was a pioneer state in enacting laws requiring long
lockups, with no chance of early release or leeway for judges to
consider other options. But prisons now are the state's
fastest-growing part of the budget _ even as crime has nearly
bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be difficult to change the pattern, with new prisons
rising in depressed rural areas. Cleaning up after a crusade, some
lawmakers said, has proven much harder than they anticipated.

   The definition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is subject to
interpretation by the Senate. But a charge card's expiration date
is etched in plastic.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, President Clinton ducked into Dolly's Books in Park
City, Utah, where he was spending a long weekend with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea. He picked out
two thrillers and two volumes about India and laid down his
American Express gold card to pay the $62.66. But the card had
expired the day before and was rejected by the American Express
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sosnik, the president's ubiquitous senior adviser, slipped
the boss $50 and Clinton sheepishly paid cash for the books.
</P>
<P>
   An American Express spokeswoman, Gail Wasserman, said the
company sends out new cards three to four weeks before a card
expires. The cardholder is required to acknowledge receipt of the
new card by calling a toll-free number. Clinton apparently never
saw the new card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people like you and me _ as opposed to dignitaries _ open
our own mail,'' Ms. Wasserman said. ``Some others get a lot more
mail and have people who do that for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A presidential spokesman said Clinton's new gold card was
waiting for him when he returned to the White House on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosnik is still waiting for his 50 bucks. ``He usually pays
back quickly,'' Sosnik said, ``but he hasn't yet.''

   The definition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is subject to
interpretation by the Senate. But a charge card's expiration date
is etched in plastic.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, President Clinton ducked into Dolly's Books in Park
City, Utah, where he was spending a long weekend with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea. He picked out
two thrillers and two volumes about India and laid down his
American Express gold card to pay the $62.66. But the card had
expired the day before and was rejected by the American Express
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sosnik, the president's ubiquitous senior adviser, slipped
the boss $50 and Clinton sheepishly paid cash for the books.
</P>
<P>
   An American Express spokeswoman, Gail Wasserman, said the
company sends out new cards three to four weeks before a card
expires. The cardholder is required to acknowledge receipt of the
new card by calling a toll-free number. Clinton apparently never
saw the new card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people like you and me _ as opposed to dignitaries _ open
our own mail,'' Ms. Wasserman said. ``Some others get a lot more
mail and have people who do that for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A presidential spokesman said Clinton's new gold card was
waiting for him when he returned to the White House on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosnik is still waiting for his 50 bucks. ``He usually pays
back quickly,'' Sosnik said, ``but he hasn't yet.''

   Hello. Must You Leave So Soon? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, the armed religious movement that runs Afghanistan,
has a problem, and his name is Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile and
suspected terrorist with a $5 million bounty on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghans, citing culture and custom, have said publicly that
they cannot expel a guest like bin Laden from their country, as the
United States has demanded. On the other hand, a senior Taliban
official said last week ``his presence is not a benefit to the
people of Afghanistan.'' The Taliban will never get international
recognition or foreign aid as long as they harbor him.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears that ``there is friction between him and the
Taliban,'' senior U.S. officials say _ so much friction that bin
Laden is being held under Taliban control, moving from village to
village, deprived of his satellite telephone, while the Taliban's
leaders try to figure out how do deal with him without being seen
to cooperate with the United States.

   A New Leader Is Elected in Nigeria
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria chose a former military ruler, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo,
to lead its first civilian government in 16 years, hoping to put an
end to one of the darkest periods in Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Obasanjo, still the only soldier in his country
to have stepped down voluntarily from power, was blemished by
serious fraud and the refusal by his rival, Olu Falae, to concede
defeat. But most international observers said the cheating had not
been significant enough to alter the outcome, given the margin.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of leader the general will be remains unclear. He is
respected internationally for his diplomacy, but remembered at home
for his strong hand during his tenure from 1976 to 1979. And while
he is often seen in the West as someone who has defended democracy,
he also has close ties with corrupt, retired generals who clung to
power under previous military regimes.

   A Deal to Save Privately Owned Redwoods
</P>
<P>
   In a $480 million deal officials called as historically
significant as the creation of Yosemite National Park, the federal
and California governments have bought 10,000 acres of ancient
redwoods from Pacific Lumber Co., including the largest privately
owned stand of ancient redwoods in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the decade-long saga leading to the Headwaters forest deal,
which was completed minutes before a March 1 midnight deadline, is
not over.
</P>
<P>
   While plans to provide public access to the primordial rain
forest are already underway, environmentalists say they will
continue to protest on Pacific Lumber property and file lawsuits
against the company and the government.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a 50-year habitat conservation plan that will govern
Pacific Lumber's logging operations. Opponents say the plan is
riddled with loopholes that undermine its purpose of protecting the
endangered spotted owl, coho salmon and marbled murrelet, a sea
bird that nests on the tops of old redwoods.

   High-Tech Purchase Brings Arrest of 2 Chinese
</P>
<P>
   To hear the Chinese tell it, two men arrested in the United
States in recent weeks were seeking high-tech gyroscopes for a
railroad project.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the U.S. Customs Service, and the men were violating export
control laws that bar the export of the gyros, which can be used to
hone missile guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects, Collin Xu and Yao Yi, are accused of
attempting to buy strategic goods from a a Boston-area military
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest, officials say, they were referred to a dummy
company established by Customs. Now investigators are trying to
find out where in China the gyroscopes were headed.

   A State Police Chief Resigns After Comments About Race
</P>
<P>
   Police departments in a wide variety of communities nationwide
have been accused of routinely using racial stereotypes as a tool
with which to target people for suspicion of involvement in crime.
</P>
<P>
   With that controversy as a backdrop, and accusations that the
New Jersey State Police in particular had unfairly singled out
black drivers to be stopped on state highways, Gov. Christie
Whitman swiftly dismissed the head of the State Police after he was
quoted as saying it was naive to think race was not an issue in
drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's issue of The Star-Ledger of Newark quoted Col. Carl
Williams as saying, in a wide-ranging interview: ``Two weeks ago,
the president of the United States went to Mexico to talk to the
president of Mexico about drugs. He didn't go to Ireland. He didn't
go to England. Today, with this drug problem, the drug problem is
cocaine or marijuana. It is most likely a minority group that's
involved with that.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the day was out, Whitman had a reply of her own: ``I
have valued Williams' service, and his career record is an
honorable one. However, his comments today are inconsistent with
our efforts to enhance public confidence in the State Police. I
have therefore asked for his immediate resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Marine Pilot Exonerated In Italian Alps Collision
</P>
<P>
   A jury of eight Marine officers took just over seven hours to
conclude that when an Marine jet in the Italian alps hit the cables
of a gondola system 13 months ago, killing all 20 aboard the
skiers' transport, it was an accident, not a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's lawyer, Frank Spinner, said that the purpose of the
court martial was to discover truth, and that ``we believe their
finding displays an act of courage and true integrity.'' But
relatives of German victims, who would have been called to the
stand to testify on the impact of the deaths if there had been a
conviction, were bitter, as were people in Italy when they received
the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot understand how it will ever get into my mind that a
system like this calls itself just,'' said Emmi Aurich, through a
translator, after the trial. Her son and daughter-in-law were among
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Of the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, she said, ``I hope and I pray
that he will get punished for what he did one day but not as
vengeance, just as reconciliation for our dead people.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Ashby could have brought a prison term of
more than 200 years if he had been convicted. He could still get up
to a year for obstruction of justice, as could his navigator, if
prosecutors have better luck with the next jury and show that the
reason the two took a videotape out of the jet's cockpit after the
accident is that they had something to hide.

   A Convict's Memoir With No Remorse

   In passing, Kaczynski tries to justify the campaign that killed

brother David, he notes, claim that violence and the taking of
human life is not the way to resolve problems. ``As a matter of

   A New Plan to Sell Waste Uranium
</P>
<P>
   For as long as the United States has been running nuclear
reactors and building nuclear bombs, it has been accumulating
depleted uranium, which is natural uranium with the most useful
kind, uranium-235, mostly taken out. All of it is in a chemical
compound that gives off toxic gas when exposed to water, and it is
stored in more than 50,000 steel canisters in various stages of
rusting away.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the Energy Department is asking the private sector
what it can do with the material, which comes to 1.5 billion
pounds. Uranium is about 30 percent more dense than lead, which
could make it useful for counterweights, or shielding radiation,
even though the uranium itself is slightly radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects to sell the uranium, or the fluorine it is mixed
with, at a price that would pay for emptying the canisters and
converting the contents into marketable forms. But sales might
defray part of the cost. With 1.5 billion pounds in hand, even
pennies per pound would help.

   Until recently, ``contentious'' was not a word associated with
``Washington Week in Review,'' the solid or stolid weekly PBS
get-together of mainstream journalists who never raised their
voices in disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   While over at the cable stations, a gabble of strong-lunged
television personalities were making reputations with passionate
encounters over the latest crowd-pleaser, ``Washington Week'' kept
doing what seemed in the cable commotion to come unnaturally,
reporting on subjects of consequence that its panelists knew
something about.
</P>
<P>
   But then Ken Bode, who had been the program's moderator since
1994 (and continues to serve as dean of Northwestern University's
Medill School of Journalism), quit or was bumped from his
television job, along with his producer Elizabeth Piersol. The
details are not agreed upon, but it appears that Dalton Delan, the
new head of programming at WETA, the Washington public station
responsible for ``Washington Week,'' was suggesting adding
ingredients like man-on-the-street interviews, appearances by
students and liberal-conservative clashes to give the half-hour
what has been described as more ``edge'' and ``attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The forces of righteousness came quickly to Bode's defense, and
whatever Delan's plans, they were put on hold or muddied
sufficiently to quell the indignation of the program's panelists
and its fans. Yet the dust-up leaves a nagging question: What is
the mission of public television these days, and who needs it?
</P>
<P>
   Delan, who came to PBS by way of cable, may reasonably have felt
that he had a mandate to refurbish the 32-year-old talking-head
program. The profusion of cable stations, some of which are doing
the sort of programming that Public Broadcasting could once call
its own, has sent the so-called noncommercial broadcasters into
something of an identity crisis. Looking for wildlife and wild
scenery? Try the Discovery Channel any week. Looking for children's
shows? There's Nickelodeon. In the mood for hard-edged
documentaries? HBO may come through. Old movies are never in short
supply. And if it's Washington news you're after, CNN has plenty of
that.
</P>
<P>
   PBS can make a case that its fare is by and large better, as
well as free to people without cable. Offerings like ``Nova,''
``Frontline'' and ``The American Experience'' have long been
network showpieces and remain the PBS vision of what it should be
doing. But the old-time monopoly of virtue is over. These days, the
once-proudly commercial-free network has plenty of commercials.
Tuning into ``The Newshour with Jim Lehrer'' or ``The Nightly
Business Report'' provides a cornucopia of silly slogans on behalf
of financial institutions. (The ``Newshour'' staff may have earned
its audience's trust that editorial blandishments from, say, Archer
Daniels Midland, will be resisted, but can one trust the innovative
Delan?)
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Teletubbies'' is a sly plug for the gay life remains
in dispute, but it is indisputably a merchandising bonanza that
exploits the youngest viewers of all.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is any claim that PBS refuses to pander to a
certain sort of audience taste, the fare during the current pledge
period _ self-help stuff, easy-to-take music and this and that _
tells a different story. The prolonged and witless pitches manage
to make network commercials seem almost intelligent even as they
test the patience of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet PBS retains a loyal and influential cadre of fans addicted
to ``The Newshour,'' ``Masterpiece Theater,'' ``Mystery'' and other
favorites. It's a classy constituency that has proved to be a
potent force when appropriation time comes around, and _ as
demonstrated by the Bode affair _ can join effectively in the
defense of endangered species like news programs about news.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the pledge period's upbeat pitches (``Wow, folks,
the fact that you are watching PBS confirms how special you
are!''), the future is shaky. Producers know, for example, that the
BBC and other British suppliers of the up-market goods that
American viewers have come to credit to PBS can now make their
deals with commercial cable networks that have deeper pockets than
public stations. And they also know that PBS serves a relatively
older audience in a time when youth is ascendant.
</P>
<P>
   So a new executive producer of, say, ``Washington Week in
Review,'' with its over-50-something viewers who by the
demographics of mortality are not likely to move in a happy
direction, may be tempted toward ``edge'' and ``attitude'' and
anything else that might conceivably lure a few more 30-somethings
if not high-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of this pledge period, while ``Washington Week'' is
preempted by programs providing health hints, money management and
Andrew Lloyd Webber, the producers may enjoy a respite from
controversy. But the forces operating on public television to keep
pressing the limits of commercial appeal remain compelling. Not
only is the fate of ``Washington Week'' far from settled, but, more
unsettling, the ideals that sparked PBS in the first place are
afloat in limbo.

   Until recently, ``contentious'' was not a word associated with
``Washington Week in Review,'' the solid or stolid weekly PBS
get-together of mainstream journalists who never raised their
voices in disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   While over at the cable stations, a gabble of strong-lunged
television personalities were making reputations with passionate
encounters over the latest crowd-pleaser, ``Washington Week'' kept
doing what seemed in the cable commotion to come unnaturally,
reporting on subjects of consequence that its panelists knew
something about.
</P>
<P>
   But then Ken Bode, who had been the program's moderator since
1994 (and continues to serve as dean of Northwestern University's
Medill School of Journalism), quit or was bumped from his
television job, along with his producer Elizabeth Piersol. The
details are not agreed upon, but it appears that Dalton Delan, the
new head of programming at WETA, the Washington public station
responsible for ``Washington Week,'' was suggesting adding
ingredients like man-on-the-street interviews, appearances by
students and liberal-conservative clashes to give the half-hour
what has been described as more ``edge'' and ``attitude.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty years after the meltdown at Three Mile
Island, the nuclear industry has succeeded in ways that were hard
to imagine in March 1979 as Pennsylvania cowered in fear and plants
around the nation subsequently lost their luster and scores of
half-built reactors were abandoned. The industry is doing better
now, but ironically extinction is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Today, reactors are quietly producing about one-quarter more
electricity each, and the level of radiation exposure to workers is
down, as is the number of automatic shut-downs. Uranium fuel is
cheap and plentiful, and, with low interest rates, so is nuclear
power's biggest ingredient, capital. The industry has also happily
achieved a lowered public profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``And everything seems to be falling apart,'' Michael Corradini,
a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Wisconsin,
said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear industry will be around for years to come, but seems
to have peaked in terms of the number of working reactors and their
share of power generated nationally. No reactors are being built;
the last ordered were Palo Verde 1, 2 and 3 in Arizona in October
1973, the month the Arab oil embargo began.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there has been an energy revolution, but it wasn't
nuclear. A barrel of oil, which has roughly enough energy to run a
small house for a month, sold for $12 in 1973; by 1979 it was $40.
Today it is back down around $12. These gyrations upward lured
utility companies into nuclear decisions that now look ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Millstone 3 reactor in Waterford, Conn., was far
over budget during construction in the late 1970s. Even after the
incident at Three Mile Island, consultants said it was still
worthwhile to finish Millstone if oil averaged $96 a barrel over
the reactor's lifetime. The Energy Information Administration, part
of the Energy Department, predicted that the price would be $100 by
the turn of the century. But oil is now about a 10th of that.
</P>
<P>
   Reactors are a bit like the Concordes, the supersonic transport
planes that first flew a few days before the Three Mile Island
accident, or the Apollo moon rockets, which made the last of their
flights to the moon a few years before. They are technological
artifacts of an era slipping into history.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning the best practices from one utility to another, policing
each other, getting more output from the reactors, the industry
essentially adopted the Greenpeace motto: a nuclear accident
anywhere is a nuclear accident everywhere. It vowed to have no more
meltdowns. Not counting the 1986 catastrophe at Chernobyl, where
the nuclear reactors are of a different design, the industry has so
far succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that the industry's performance is
greatly improved. James Riccio, a nuclear expert at Critical Mass,
a Washington-based nonprofit organization affiliated with Ralph
Nader, said that the plants operated more now because the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission had shortened the list of equipment that had
to be in perfect working order for them to run, and the number of
automatic shut-downs has declined because the number of manual
shut-downs is up. ``They've gotten more intelligent about what
they're doing,'' he said, ``but then again, they've had to.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other changes in the last 20 years. If two
decades ago nuclear power seemed forbidding and secret, today
anyone can log on to Nuclear Regulatory Commission Web site, which
offers detailed specifications for each reactor
(http://www.nrc.gov/AEOD/pib/pib.html). For Three Mile Island unit
1, the undamaged twin of the reactor that had the meltdown, the
data includes the identification numbers stamped on the water
pumps. Another table for Three Mile Island shows the temperatures
and pressures at which the emergency systems will automatically
start, with different numbers depending on how many coolant pumps
are running.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere technology is accelerating, too. Natural gas has
become cheaper to find and recover, and the system for turning it
into electricity has improved steadily. The newest plants produce
twice as many kilowatt-hours from a thousand cubic feet as the ones
that nuclear power was competing with in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The real reactor killer, according to Corradini and others, is
something that was not thought of in 1979 _ deregulation in the the
utility industry. Nationwide, power companies are fissioning into
companies that will distribute electricity and sell it to consumers
(like local phone companies) and other companies that will generate
power and compete to sell it (like long distance carriers).
</P>
<P>
   The companies that built the 104 reactors still operating
ordered them in the 1960s and early 1970s. Asked then which source
of power would be the cheapest in the next few decades, they had
guessed nuclear, knowing that if they were off by a few tenths of a
cent per kilowatt-hour, the consumer would pay or reap the
difference. Now, if they are asked the question at all, they say
natural gas. Today they are building nothing and buying power from
independent producers, none of whom seems inclined to place a
multi-billion-dollar bet on a reactor where the output might be
uncompetitive in 2010, or 2020 or 2030, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investment risk changed,'' said James Joosten, a nuclear
engineer and consultant and former official of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of industrialized
nations. ``In the old days, people used to talk about nuclear power
in religious terms, and say, `It's good and we need to do it and if
the public doesn't buy into it, we'll make them buy into it.'
Realistically, today it's a business decision.''
</P>
<P>
   By Joosten's estimate, if electricity is completely deregulated,
the market price will be about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour at the
wholesale level, a price that about 28 nuclear plants cannot
achieve. And if some states offer a one-time payment to their
utilities because they have to close such plants in the transition
to deregulation, then some reactor owners with marginal plants will
jump at that offer while they can get it.

<P>
   When computer consultant Gustavo Carreno received an e-mail
message at his Lisbon office last week asking for an appointment to
talk about universal time, an old concept recently repackaged by
the Swatch Group, the world's largest watch maker, he sent the
following response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well the thing is, I'm not that good on converting time but I
think there is a -5 hour of difference between Portugal/Lisbon and
New York, meaning that you'll have to add 5 hours to your local
time to get my time. So the best thing to do is to say that I'll be
available at my work fone from (AT)416 'till (AT)791.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that at (AT)786, or about one hour after the sun was
overhead in New York City, or 0552 Greenwich Mean Time, Carreno,
29, explained his enthusiasm for what Swatch is calling ``Internet
time.'' This way, when he meets with friends and colleagues online,
they ``have an understanding,'' he said. ``It's (AT)786 all around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swatch scheme, which divides the day into 1,000 ``swatch
beats'' equivalent to 1 minute and 26.4 seconds, is unabashedly
commercial. The system's meridian is located, conveniently enough,
over the Swatch building in Biel, Switzerland, where midnight
strikes (AT)000 beats. Swatch will begin selling a $70 watch that
tells Internet time, among other things, in the United States this
month. The product is already for sale in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has also made software that displays Internet
time on a computer screen available free from Swatch's site on the
World Wide Web. About 45,000 people downloaded it in January.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is not surprising that the notion of a world without
time zones strikes a chord even among some of the more
gimmick-weary Internet users. With its capacity to collapse
distance, the computer network has already managed to alter the
physics of space. And whether or not Internet time a la Swatch
catches on, the Internet seems to be responsible for an increasing
impatience with time as it has been kept thus far.

   ``There is something screwed up about our sense of time,'' said
Danny Hillis, a computer scientist who is spearheading an effort to
build a clock that will strike once every 10,000 years. (He wants
to encourage a longer view of the future.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our classical notion of time that we've inherited from the
industrial age doesn't fit with the way we live now,'' he said.
``Time zones made a lot of sense when we stayed in one zone. Now I
find I'm living on CNN time rather than my local time. I can call
you back at the end of the hour, but I have no idea which hour it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, cities set the time by the sun until the
late 1800s, when time zones were invented by the railroads to
coordinate schedules and avoid collisions. In the 1960s, after the
vibrations in a cesium atom were found to be a more reliable
measure that the rotation of the Earth, universal time became based
on a a calculation done in Paris of the average of atomic clocks.
(Most people still look to Greenwich, England, for the universal
time, established in an 1874 treaty.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet may already have warped the way its frequent
users experience time. In the technology industry, ``Internet
time'' has come to mean something like dog years, denoting the
ever-accelerating speeds of microprocessors, data transmission and
startup companies going public. The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's business school, for instance, recently buried an
Internet time capsule _ to be opened in five years.
</P>
<P>
   So now there are concerns that Internet time means abandoning
biological rhythms in favor of 24-hour computer clocks synchronized
to the nanosecond. But it has also increased the demand for the
correct time. The guardians of the Network Time Protocol, which
allows computers on the Internet to adjust their clock within
milliseconds of Greenwich time, say requests for the correct time
have doubled in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   For Nicolas Hayek, the founder and chief executive of the Swatch
Group, that is all the more reason why people will want to buy
Swatch's first Internet time watches. ``The Internet has made human
beings more globally conscious of being on a small planet where we
are all really equal,'' Hayek said. ``Internet time is the perfect
measuring stick for this era.''
</P>
<P>
   Judah Levine, a physicist at the time and frequency division of
the National Institute for Standards and Technology in Boulder,
Colo., is not so sure. After all, he notes, they're still sleeping
in China when New Yorkers are having breakfast, even if it's
(AT)430 in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the same problems with the Earth going around the
sun as we always did,'' Levine said. ``The Internet can't change
that.''

   When computer consultant Gustavo Carreno received an e-mail
message at his Lisbon office last week asking for an appointment to
talk about universal time, an old concept recently repackaged by
the Swatch Group, the world's largest watch maker, he sent the
following response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well the thing is, I'm not that good on converting time but I
think there is a -5 hour of difference between Portugal/Lisbon and
New York, meaning that you'll have to add 5 hours to your local
time to get my time. So the best thing to do is to say that I'll be
available at my work fone from (AT)416 'till (AT)791.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that at (AT)786, or about one hour after the sun was
overhead in New York City, or 0552 Greenwich Mean Time, Carreno,
29, explained his enthusiasm for what Swatch is calling ``Internet
time.'' This way, when he meets with friends and colleagues online,
they ``have an understanding,'' he said. ``It's (AT)786 all around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swatch scheme, which divides the day into 1,000 ``swatch
beats'' equivalent to 1 minute and 26.4 seconds, is unabashedly
commercial. The system's meridian is located, conveniently enough,
over the Swatch building in Biel, Switzerland, where midnight
strikes (AT)000 beats. Swatch will begin selling a $70 watch that
tells Internet time, among other things, in the United States this
month. The product is already for sale in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has also made software that displays Internet
time on a computer screen available free from Swatch's site on the
World Wide Web. About 45,000 people downloaded it in January.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is not surprising that the notion of a world without
time zones strikes a chord even among some of the more
gimmick-weary Internet users. With its capacity to collapse
distance, the computer network has already managed to alter the
physics of space. And whether or not Internet time a la Swatch
catches on, the Internet seems to be responsible for an increasing

remarkable turnaround in its thinking about the independent-counsel

Watergate scandal, lapsed in 1993. Republicans were reluctant to
extend the law in the shadow of the Iran-Contra investigation, but
were ultimately persuaded by President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno to renew the legislation. Five weeks after Clinton
signed the law, Kenneth Starr became the first of seven independent
counsels to be appointed under the act.

PARITY'S UNWELCOME FALLOUT: SEXUAL HARASSMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., S.C., Va., Ohio, N.J.)   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the public hugs of congratulation after games escalated
to private embraces in a school room, Amanda Henderson said, she
found it flattering that a veteran high school football coach would
take such an uncommon interest in her, a sophomore basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
   In what became a ritual, Henderson recalled, the coach, Joe
Sutton, refused to let anyone else tape her ankles before her games
for Indian Land High School in South Carolina and, to the vexation
of her female basketball coach, did not want anyone else around
when he taped them. He never missed Henderson's games, chose
Henderson as his student aide and showered her with gifts like the
basketball T-shirts she collected. During softball season, when he
served as an assistant coach, he parked himself at third base, her
position, and supervised her every move. Henderson thought he
wanted her to be a winner. But, she said, he gradually began to
demand a dividend for his devotion.
</P>
<P>
   The hugs and compliments were followed by invitations to spend
time with Sutton away from school. Henderson's parents became
suspicious and eventually mobilized a school board investigation
that resulted in Sutton's resignation in January 1998. Amanda
Henderson's name was added to a growing list of female athletes who
say they have been sexually harassed by their male coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist, the rise in reports of harassment by male
coaches is acknowledged to be an unanticipated byproduct of a
landmark victory for women: Title IX, the 1972 law barring sexual
discrimination at schools that receive federal money. As
participation in organized women's athletics has rocketed from
300,000 to 3 million student-athletes in the wake of Title IX,
creating a need for thousands of new coaches, the share of those
coaches who are women has dropped dramatically: at the college
level, the percentage of female head coaches of women's teams has
fallen to 47.4 percent, from 90 percent in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on sexual harassment in women's sport are minimal.
Researchers in the field say that schools have been reluctant to
pool data for a national survey, partly from a fear of creating a
general atmosphere of guilt. They say that the numbers would be
misleading anyway, because athletes, afraid of losing their spots
on teams, rarely report their coaches. But interviews with about 50
athletes, parents, coaches, administrators and researchers around
the country indicate that reports of harassment are on the rise,
and two current lawsuits against high-profile coaches _ Anson
Dorrance, the women's soccer coach at the University of North
Carolina, and Jesse Dwire, the women's tennis coach at Syracuse
University _ have put the issue in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big problem out there,'' said Don Sabo, a sociology
professor at D'Youville College in Buffalo who has developed
harassment workshops for coaches. Describing the special nature of
the relationship between athlete and coach, Sabo adds, ``It's all
about emotions, about trust, and about the body.'' When
scholarships come into play, it's about money, too.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of certainty over what constitutes an improper
relationship, or improper contact, between coach and athlete, as
well as vague school policies, have made sexual harassment on the
playing fields difficult to police, say experts like Dr. Joel Fish,
director of the Center for Sport Psychology in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue of sexual harassment within athletics, of
coaches trying to understand the boundaries of what's right and
wrong, of when to yell and when to pat her on the back, of whether
or not to hug, is still being defined,'' Dr. Fish said. ``There's
more opportunity for female athletes than ever before, but the flip
side is that there's more risk to those athletes because we haven't
developed policies, legislation, and screening processes to keep up
with the social progress made by Title IX.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators attribute the predominance of male coaches in the wake
of Title IX to various factors, including an upswing in male
applicants for jobs that did not previously exist or did not pay as
well as they do now, and a bias by some male athletic directors
against recruiting and hiring female candidates. (Men direct 80
percent of university athletic departments.)
</P>
<P>
   What is not disputed is that the men who now coach a majority of
women's teams are sometimes _ perhaps through no fault of their own
_ insensitive when it comes to dealing with female athletes.
</P>
<P>
   While female coaches are also accused of harassing female
athletes, such reports are far less prevalent, Sabo said. One
reason could simply be the numbers: in women's college track, for
example, just 18 percent of head coaches are women. In women's
swimming, the figure is 33 percent. Swimming, track, volleyball and
gymnastics are, according to Marie Tuite, the University of
Washington's senior associate athletic director, ``hot points''
when it comes to sexual harassment claims.
</P>
<P>
   Fish said, ``When you put a male in a position of power where he
can manipulate something of real meaning to an athlete, such as
playing time or a scholarship, then add in the possibility of a
young girl who may have a crush, you've got an extremely dangerous
mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it never became more physical than hugs, Sutton's
connection to Henderson had destructive consequences for both.
Henderson, accused of exaggerating Sutton's overtures, was
ostracized by her teammates. The school board's investigation of
Sutton turned up complaints that he had committed similar or worse
indiscretions with at least four other students. Sutton was
suspended in September 1997, resigned the following January and now
faces a charge of criminal sexual misconduct, based on allegations
of fondling made by a 1995 Indian Land graduate who came forward
during the Henderson investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried my whole junior year,'' said Henderson, now a freshman
at Gardner-Webb University in Boiling Springs, N.C. ``In my mind,
Coach Sutton went from being a nice guy to a pervert who lusts
after young girls and knows how to manipulate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's mother, Alana, said, ``It's like one big playground
out there for these con artists.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The university landscape was jolted last summer by the filing of
two sexual harassment lawsuits against established coaches and the
Division I athletic programs that employ them.
</P>
<P>
   At North Carolina, Dorrance, 47, whose teams have won 15
national titles, is the focus of a suit filed by two players.
Debbie Keller, a leading scorer on the U.S. national team and a
former college player of the year, has accused Dorrance of
inappropriate behavior that included uninvited sexual comments.
Melissa Jennings has accused Dorrance of creating a hostile
environment for her before cutting her from the team.
</P>
<P>
   Dorrance has denied the allegations, and Michael Hooker, the
North Carolina chancellor, has defended the university's handling
of Keller's and Jennings' complaints, saying they were ``thoroughly
investigated and appropriately responded to.'' The case is on hold
while a dispute over venue is settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit has been a catastrophe for us in women's soccer
because of the bad publicity,'' said April Heinrich, head soccer
coach at the University of Virginia. Still, Heinrich _ who played
for Dorrance at North Carolina and said she ``had no complaints''
with him then _ says the lawsuit could have positive ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it takes something like this before people's
consciousness gets raised and policies get enforced,'' Heinrich
said. ``I think institutions have a responsibility to educate their
coaches. We all assume a teacher is a professional at 23, but that
isn't really the case, and the line is a little bit gray about what
is and isn't acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither Dorrance nor Dwire is 23. The lawsuit against Dwire,
a 20-year veteran at Syracuse, is scheduled to begin March 29 in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The suit alleges that Dwire
massaged, fondled and propositioned two scholarship tennis players,
Kirsten Ericson and Dacia Kornechuk, and that Dwire and the
university retaliated against the players after they pursued a
complaint through the school's grievance system. After a university
panel recommended a two-year ban of Dwire in 1997, finding that he
had violated sexual harassment and discrimination policies, the
punishment was reduced to a three-month suspension.
</P>
<P>
   William Dealy, the lawyer for Ericson and Kornechuk, said
Syracuse officials, aware that the National Collegiate Athletic
Association has no policy on sexual harassment, had ignored
complaints about Dwire's sexual improprieties for years. Kevin
Morrow, a Syracuse spokesman, said neither Dwire nor any of the
dozen university administrators named in the suit would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Varchetto, the lawyer for Keller and Jennings, echoed
Dealy's complaint. ``The whole university mentality is hide your
head in the sand,'' Varchetto said. ``There's probably a higher
duty placed on the coach than a teacher because of the intimacy
athletics generates, but when it comes to appropriate behavior, I
don't think there's a fine line at all: conduct that would not be
approved of in the classroom shouldn't go on in the gym, either.''
</P>
<P>
   As administrators take notice of the rise in harassment
complaints, an awareness is increasing of the necessity of
re-educating coaches, both male and female, about what constitutes
acceptable contact on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to sit down with my coaches and make them aware that
what previously may have been acceptable, like patting a player on
the bottom, is not acceptable now,'' said Christine Grant, athletic
director at the University of Iowa. ``One on ones are risky; closed
doors are risky.'' At Stanford, where men coach 9 of the 15 women's
teams, the two athletic directors have asked university lawyers to
put a no-touching clause into their policy by next fall.
</P>
<P>
   But most athletic directors and coaches alike describe such a
policy, advocated by the Women's Sports Foundation, as unrealistic.
Laurie Priest, athletic director at Mount Holyoke, said: ``The
coach-athlete relationship is based on trust, and to cut off all
physical contact sterilizes the experience. I tell every coach I
hire that I have a no-tolerance policy when it comes to being
sexually involved with an athlete; that said, you've got to
continue to have your antennae up.'' &QL;

   Sometimes it is only too obvious when the line has been crossed.
The parents of a young New Jersey tennis player will never forget
the outrage they felt the night in December 1997 when their
daughter told them the real reason she wanted a new coach: her
coach at the time, Stuart Gerechoff of Nutley, N.J., had begun
fondling her when she was 12 and had coerced her into having
intercourse when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told us he'd been touching her and having sexual
intercourse with her,'' recalled the mother of the player, a county
champion who is now a junior in high school. ``She was shaking and
crying, and she said she hadn't wanted anyone to know because she
felt so terrible about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother said she should have seen the signals that Gerechoff
was too involved with her daughter: incessant telephone calls, a
barrage of gifts, an insistence that no one else coach her daughter
when the family went to the shore for summer vacations. ``And he
didn't want me around the courts at all,'' she said. ``When I told
him I didn't like all the hugging that went on after practices, he
jumped down my throat and said there was nothing wrong with it,
that he hugged everybody. He used to tell me how lucky I was that I
didn't have to worry about boys molesting her, that tennis was her
boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Through three years of trysts at Gerechoff's tennis club, the
player never let on that her relationship with her coach had
entered a forbidden dimension.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought it would be the end of her tennis career if she
told anybody,'' the mother said. ``He always told her she'd never
make it without him.''
</P>
<P>
   The player's parents initially welcomed Gerechoff, who ran the
Randolph Hills Tennis Club, into their home and, mistaking his
obsession for genuine interest in her tennis, gave him free rein.
After their daughter told them what was happening, they notified
the police immediately, and Gerechoff was arrested three days
later. He pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault in March 1998
and was sentenced last summer to eight years at the Adult
Diagnostic and Treatment Center in Avenel, N.J., a facility for sex
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really kind of lost it,'' said John McDonald, Gerechoff's
lawyer. ``He was smitten, but the fact that he loved her is no
defense to statutory rape.''
</P>
<P>
   At his sentencing, the 44-year-old Gerechoff apologized to his
wife and family, then offered an eerie apology to the player: he
said he loved her and wanted to hug her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a child loses her innocence this way, nothing can ever be
the same as it was,'' the player's mother said. ``These men are
monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she is away at Division II Gardner-Webb, where she
earned a basketball scholarship and plays for a male coach, Amanda
Henderson remains vulnerable to disturbing memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I see a male coach, I'm cautious; I'm wondering if
he's in it for the same reason Coach Sutton was, if he's another
manipulator,'' she said. ``I know my coach isn't like Coach Sutton,
but when I look around, I see plenty of them out there. I know what
they're up to; I know how easy it is to fall for it. In the
beginning, you just think he's being nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said she saw no reason to be suspicious of Sutton at
first, and she dismissed it when several boys from his football
team warned her about him. She said she began to heed the warnings
the summer before her junior year, when Sutton began calling her
when he knew she was home alone. ``I was starting to be afraid of
him by then,'' she said. ``Everybody hugged after games, but it was
happening with him all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, her parents had talked to the school principal and
requested that Sutton stay away from their daughter. When Sutton's
presence on the softball coaching staff that spring caused
Henderson so much discomfort that she quit in the middle of a
championship season, her parents went to the county's
superintendent of Schools. After that failed to produce action,
they went to the state board of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't back down just because the door slams in
their face at the local level,'' said Joe Henderson, Amanda's
father.
</P>
<P>
   With a lawyer's help and guidance from Sesame, a national
victim-assistance group, the Hendersons got an investigation.
Sutton was suspended, and in a closed-door session with the school
board in January 1998 his resignation was accepted with the proviso
that he not seek teaching or coaching positions in South Carolina
that put him in contact with girls under the age of 18. Those
conditions became public last fall when Sutton ran unsuccessfully
for a seat on the same school board that suspended him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a pattern of inappropriate behavior that warranted
his suspension,'' said John Taylor, the Lancaster County school
superintendent. ``In some sense, I think the system worked here.
It's hard to investigate these complaints because it's tough for
the kids to come forward, but I don't see how we can beef up our
harassment policy without putting our schools into some sort of
terror state.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Henderson felt that she was living in such a state after
she made her accusations. ``Somebody sent anonymous letters to the
colleges that were recruiting me, warning them I was a
troublemaker,'' Henderson said. This year her parents have
transferred her younger brother to a different high school; they
say it is because of the continuing backlash from his sister's
case. Henderson says she is reluctant go home for visits.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton is free on bail while awaiting trial on the criminal
sexual misconduct charge that grew out of the Henderson
investigation. Neither he nor his lawyer, W. Allan Nickles,
returned repeated telephone calls requesting comment.

<P>
   The cases of Amanda Henderson and of the New Jersey teen-ager
molested by her coach have, after significant pain and struggle,
reached some form of resolution. But other disputes can dissolve
into ``he said/she said'' battles that leave both sides feeling
damaged and frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The court documents recounting the sexual harassment complaint
of Denise Klemencic, a former distance runner at Ohio State
University, against Ed Crawford, an assistant track coach, read
like scenes from ``Rashomon.'' The way Klemencic sees it, the
actions of Crawford and Ohio State have wrecked her life. ``My
whole athletic career backfired because I wouldn't sleep with my
coach,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, now head coach of women's track at the University of
New Mexico, says that Klemencic's misinterpretation of a friendly
dinner invitation has blighted his reputation and exacted a mental
toll during five years of litigation. ``It's a nightmare when
somebody accuses you of this, because you're almost automatically
considered guilty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klemencic, now 29, says that after she rejected an attempt by
Crawford to date her in June 1992, he reneged on an agreement to
let her stay on as a volunteer coach at Ohio State and train for
the Olympic trials after her college eligibility expired. Ohio
State contends that she was not of Olympic caliber, and Elizabeth
Stanton, a lawyer who represented the university, said the school
offered to let Klemencic train with the team in 1992 but was turned
down. According to Klemencic, Crawford had ``poisoned the team''
against her.
</P>
<P>
   After Klemencic turned down a settlement offer from Ohio State
in December 1997, she sued Crawford in U.S. District Court in
Columbus, Ohio, last summer and lost. Her lawyer, Seymour Brown,
has requested a new trial. Klemencic also has an appeal pending in
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati,
protesting a court decision that excused Ohio State from liability.
Ohio State argued that its response to Klemencic's complaints was
sufficient. It issued a written reprimand stating that Crawford had
inappropriately pursued a personal relationship with her and a
warning against his continuing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted the coach fired,'' Stanton said, ``but it was the
university's position that this was not the type of activity that
would justify removing someone from their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Justus, who directs the NCAA's education department, has
acknowledged that the association's lack of a policy on sexual
harassment of athletes needs to be addressed. ``I've heard some of
the horror stories out there,'' she said. ``It's astonishing what
people get by with. The policy was in the plan to look at down the
road, but maybe we need to look at it sooner. For now, the final
recourse for athletes is litigation: the issue of harassment is so
complex, so laden with people's own biases and blind spots, that
the law and liability may be the only way to catch their
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Klemencic feels that every system of redress has failed her, and
she said she was $22,000 poorer for her efforts so far. ``But I
don't regret turning the settlement down,'' she said. ``That would
have been letting the school off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, 43, said that the possibility that the case could be
retried kept him on tenterhooks. He insisted his intentions toward
Klemencic were never romantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely hard to defend yourself against something that
didn't happen,'' he said. ``And it's a scenario that since then
scares the hell out of me whenever I'm alone with an athlete,
because it seems like half our job, as a coach, is being a
psychologist. Kids can be vindictive: tell a kid you're pulling
their scholarship and they're liable to turn around and accuse you
of anything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As draining as it can be, litigation may prove to be the most
effective tool in redefining the boundaries of proper behavior on
the playing field, just as it has been in the workplace. ``Let's
face it: folks don't want to get sued,'' said Dr. Fish of the
Center for Sport Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Carpenter and Vivian Acosta of Brooklyn College have
completed a study that documents the decline of female coaches and
administrators in college sports in the wake of Title IX. As sexual
harassment disputes threaten to become a legacy of the expansion of
women's sports, the researchers have their own suggestion for
curtailing them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you never set the line as an institution, it becomes
impossible to police it,'' Carpenter said. ``Bite the bullet, get a
policy that says amorous relations with students are verboten and
if you cross the line, you're out. The rule needs to be in writing
at the bottom of every coach's contract. There's no such thing as
consensual anything when one person has that much control over
another.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first signs that Dr. Barbara Zucker-Pinchoff's
life was about to come apart were small and seemingly innocuous.
</P>
<P>
   As she lay on an operating table at New York University Medical
Center in 1988, preparing for the birth of her second child by
Caesarean section, her nose began to itch. She felt terribly
congested, her hands started to swell and her face turned beet red.
She told her husband she thought she was allergic to the hospital's
air conditioning system.
</P>
<P>
   But then her blood pressure started to dive and she was headed
toward anaphylactic shock, a dangerous condition caused by an
extreme allergic reaction. As doctors rushed to take the baby from
her womb, others pumped her with epinephrine to raise her blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not the hospital air conditioner that caused her to
nearly die. Nor was it, as she had suspected, the drug she received
for pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   It was, she was shocked to discover later, an allergic reaction
to the latex gloves that covered the two sets of hands dipped
inside her during surgery. That allergy turned out to be so severe,
it ended her career as an anesthesiologist because she was unable
to wear the gloves or to be near others wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 percent of the country's health care workers are
allergic to latex, an allergy that was almost unheard of a decade
ago. Experts said the number could be as high as 17 percent among
those who work almost exclusively in hospitals and with patients'
fluids, such as nurses in emergency and operating rooms, since
allergies to latex worsen with exposure to the material.
</P>
<P>
   The illness affects roughly 3 percent of the general population,
and since the late 1980s, at least 30 people have died from
latex-related illnesses, experts on the allergy say. The number is
small compared with, for example, allergic reactions to penicillin,
which cause 400 to 800 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen state legislatures, including New York's,
have introduced legislation to limit the use of latex gloves in
hospitals and other medical offices or to develop committees within
their health departments to study the issue. No important proposal
has become law, however, often because of lobbying by glove makers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complain that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
been slow to act on the problem and has taken too long to even
consider regulating latex use in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Glove manufacturers say they are reluctant to turn out
alternatives because doctors complain that nonlatex gloves are less
comfortable and provide less protection. Hospitals balk at the cost
of the alternatives, which are usually about 30 percent more
expensive than latex. Further, many medical professionals hesitate
to admit that they could have the allergy, for fear of ruining
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely serious,'' said Anne Schott, a spokeswoman for
the New York State Nurses Association. ``Latex is everywhere in the
hospital environment, and if someone develops a serious allergy,
that is a huge impediment to a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharp rise in reported allergies, experts said, stems from a
sevenfold increase in the use of the gloves since 1987, when the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began recommending that
most health care workers wear them to protect against infection
from HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Natural rubber latex, derived from the sap of the rubber tree,
contains proteins that can cause allergies. The powder that
manufacturers sprinkle inside the gloves to help them slip easily
onto hands absorbs those proteins, and when the gloves are snapped
on or off, the powder is released in the air. Allergic reactions to
the gloves, from direct contact or inhalation of the powder, range
from hives to asthma to anaphylactic shock and even death.
</P>
<P>
   There is no known cure for latex allergies, but treatments for
the symptoms range from over-the-counter antihistamines, for the
mildest symptoms, to steroids, to epinephrine for shock. (Doctors
caution that not all hand rashes from gloves indicate a true latex
allergy.)
</P>
<P>
   The allergy is unpredictable, and it can be devastating. In some
people, allergies build up slowly through the years, starting with
hand rashes that later turn into a serious respiratory disease.
Others, like Dr. Zucker-Pinchoff, have no symptoms until the day
they find themselves in near-fatal shock.
</P>
<P>
   After a person becomes sensitized, routine chores can become
threatening, the elastic in a pair of stockings toxic, a trip to
the dentist impossible. Someone with the allergy, for example,
cannot use latex condoms, which are generally believed to offer the
best protection against HIV. infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children's birthday parties are a menace,'' Dr.
Zucker-Pinchoff said, since latex balloons can cause her to go into
a fit of wheezing and choking.
</P>
<P>
   Most troublesome is that those who are allergic to latex are
often made much sicker when they seek treatment because doctors'
offices and hospitals, where the air is thick with latex powder,
are the most dangerous places.
</P>
<P>
   This was true for Lieut. Harold Henderson, a military nurse in
San Diego who went into shock and died in 1997 during a hospital
stay for an allergic reaction to latex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had three heart attacks while I was there to pick him up,''
said his wife, Christine Henderson, adding that although the staff
knew he was allergic and tried to keep his room free of latex,
powder in a doctor's hair or something else probably caused the
fatal reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always in the back of my mind that he could die, but
you don't think that it is actually going to happen,'' she said.
``You think it is going to get better if you stay away from it
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the illness especially hard to manage, doctors said,
is the difficulty in diagnosing it, because the blood test most
commonly used is fairly inaccurate. ``One of the biggest dilemmas
is actually making the diagnosis,'' said Dr. Kenneth T. Kim, the
chairman of occupational health at the American College of Allergy
Asthma and Immunology. ``Not many people have access to the
well-tested skin prick test, which is in trial already and awaiting
FDA approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal agency held a conference on the latex
problem in 1992, it has not created any of the promised
regulations, other than the requirement that medical devices
containing latex be identified as a possible allergen. The agency
is considering requiring manufacturers to indicate on the label the
amount of protein and powder in their gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the agency say that drafting regulations for latex
is difficult because there is no universal agreement about how much
powder is dangerous to those who have yet to be sensitized to the
allergy, about how effective latex-alternative gloves are, and
about how much their higher costs could hurt hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A regulation has to be well-grounded in science,'' said Dr.
Bruce Burlington, the director of the FDA's Center for Devices and
Radiological Health. ``It is intended to be a thoughtful,
contemplative process that involves detailed analysis of economic
impact and a number of other factors. This is running along at
about average speed, given the scientific complexity.''

<P>
   Glove manufacturers, which have found themselves the subjects of
lawsuits, have tried to block legislation banning latex gloves. At
the same time, they are creating alternative products.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Johnson &AMP; Johnson, for example, have
written to state legislators arguing against bills that would ban
powdered latex in hospitals. Meanwhile, the company has been
producing low-powder gloves and options to latex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been putting forward the alternatives,'' said John
McKeegan, a company spokesman. ``But there is a demand out there
for powdered gloves, and they are the ones that sell the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Regent Medical has been very aggressive in marketing its
powder-free gloves, including surgical gloves called Biogel, which
have a powder substitute that helps the glove slip on. Yet
powder-free gloves make up only 5 percent of the company's glove
business, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of hospitals across the country _ including Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury,
Conn., and Olean Hospital in Olean, N.Y. _ have either banned latex
gloves or restricted them to certain parts of their buildings. But
in general, doctors, particularly surgeons, are extremely resistant
to nonlatex alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, even medical workers with the allergy resist change.
``They think, `I desperately need this high-paying job in this
prestigious teaching hospital, I need the medical insurance and I
cannot afford to acknowledge a latex allergy,''' said Gail Lenehan,
chairwoman of the Massachusetts Emergency Nurses Association's
Latex Allergy Task Force. ``I have heard female surgeons say they
live in a man's world and fear a bias against them, and residents
say they won't speak up because they are low on the totem pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some hospitals are starting to change. ``We wanted to be
a leader in this area,'' said Robert G. Hamilton, an associate
professor of medicine and pathology at Johns Hopkins, which is
becoming latex-free. ``Cost is the fundamental question. But we
purchased a sufficient volume of stretch vinyl, which resulted in
no change in cost.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, an increasing number of lawsuits are charging
manufacturers with negligence and product liability, or with
continuing to market a product that they know to be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Howell Rosenberg, a partner with Brookman, Rosenberg, Brown &AMP;
Sandler, a law firm in Philadelphia, estimated that about 250 cases
against glove manufacturers have gone to federal courts around the
country, up from about 25 cases two and a half years ago. His
office is handling a suit on behalf of all the Federal cases,
roughly 12 percent of which are from New York. Dozens more are
being tried in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to be closely watched,'' Rosenberg said.
``We are talking about lots of people, and the greatest number of
victims are in health care. That is a very significant segment of
the work force who are doing very important jobs.''

   TORONTO _ It's not easy being in the news business in Canada.
You stare at juicy American stories nearly every day while your own
pages fill with curling scores and wheat quotas. Oh, for a big,
page one blockbuster!
</P>
<P>
   In February, one of the two Canadian national newspapers now
locked in vicious competition thought it had a real scoop when it
breathlessly reported: ``U.S. believes North Korea would target
Montreal for a nuclear strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredible! The front-page article quoted Canadian legislators
just back from a NATO conference at the United States Army War
College. If tensions between North Korea and the United States
escalate, the Canadians said, Washington expected the wily
communists to pick a fight with America's wimpy non-nuclear
neighbor, knowing that dropping a nuke on say, Hoboken, would earn
them a nuclear drubbing.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few problems with the story. For one, the Army
College has no such scenario involving North Korea. ``Where it came
from, I don't know,'' said Lt. Col. Pete Pierce of the college
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the American press that hates to let go of a
good yarn. Even when the Canada bomb article bombed, newspapers
kept it going with the only weapon left in their arsenal _ humor.
Excerpts follow.

<P>
   _ By ANTHONY DePALMA
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The original report appeared Feb. 12 in The
National Post, the new flagship of the Southam newspaper chain. The
article had more prominence on the front page than news of the
expected acquittal of President Clinton that day:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Army officials say they expect Canada would be the first
target of a North Korean nuclear attack if tensions were to
escalate between the communist power and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to a war scenario being developed at the U.S. Army War
College, Montreal would be the Canadian city likely to be hit by
North Korea, which is suspected of having nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Three Canadian MPs were briefed about the war scenario during a
meeting of elected representatives from the 16 NATO countries in
Carlisle, Pa., last week, the National Post has learned.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army officials told the MPs they doubt North Korea would
attack the U.S. directly because it would result in massive nuclear
retaliation that would wipe the Asian nation off the map.
</P>
<P>
   American officials therefore think it more likely for North
Korea to hit U.S. interests indirectly by attacking a close ally
and a friend _ Canada _ that does not have nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The next day, the news hadn't exactly

   TORONTO _ It's not easy being in the news business in Canada.
You stare at juicy American stories nearly every day while your own
pages fill with curling scores and wheat quotas. Oh, for a big,
page one blockbuster!
</P>
<P>
   In February, one of the two Canadian national newspapers now
locked in vicious competition thought it had a real scoop when it
breathlessly reported: ``U.S. believes North Korea would target
Montreal for a nuclear strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredible! The front-page article quoted Canadian legislators
just back from a NATO conference at the United States Army War
College. If tensions between North Korea and the United States
escalate, the Canadians said, Washington expected the wily
communists to pick a fight with America's wimpy non-nuclear
neighbor, knowing that dropping a nuke on say, Hoboken, would earn
them a nuclear drubbing.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few problems with the story. For one, the Army
College has no such scenario involving North Korea. ``Where it came
from, I don't know,'' said Lt. Col. Pete Pierce of the college
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the American press that hates to let go of a
good yarn. Even when the Canada bomb article bombed, newspapers
kept it going with the only weapon left in their arsenal _ humor.
Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ANTHONY DePALMA
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The original report appeared Feb. 12 in The
National Post, the new flagship of the Southam newspaper chain. The
article had more prominence on the front page than news of the
expected acquittal of President Clinton that day:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Army officials say they expect Canada would be the first
target of a North Korean nuclear attack if tensions were to
escalate between the communist power and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to a war scenario being developed at the U.S. Army War
College, Montreal would be the Canadian city likely to be hit by
North Korea, which is suspected of having nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Three Canadian MPs were briefed about the war scenario during a
meeting of elected representatives from the 16 NATO countries in
Carlisle, Pa., last week, the National Post has learned.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army officials told the MPs they doubt North Korea would
attack the U.S. directly because it would result in massive nuclear
retaliation that would wipe the Asian nation off the map.
</P>
<P>
   American officials therefore think it more likely for North
Korea to hit U.S. interests indirectly by attacking a close ally
and a friend _ Canada _ that does not have nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>

stoked panic in Montreal. Au contraire, The Post reported:

   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ The students, mostly in sweat shirts and
jeans, sit around a long table dotted with soda cans and cookies
and consult their highlighted copies of Plato's ``Apology.'' Two
professors guide their debate over whether Socrates, on the verge
of execution, was arrogant or humble. Outside, the sun sets on the
neogothic campus.
</P>
<P>
   There could hardly be a more archetypal college scene than this
one in the University of Notre Dame's O'Shaughnessy Building, with
its seven stained-glass windows representing the seven liberal
arts, ancient disciplines from rhetoric to astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 10 students in this weekly seminar fit no typical
profile for Notre Dame or any university. They are current or
former residents of the South Bend Center for the Homeless, men and
women with the weathered features and oblique emotional balance of
those who have spent many nights in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem quaint, if not useless, to bring philosophical
literature to the homeless, an idea conceived in some pristine
ivory tower. But that is not how the students view it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us in the grip of addiction use this process to
rethink our lives,'' said Michael Newton, 50, originally of New
York, who has been homeless for 16 months. ``Socrates makes clear
that you have to have the courage to examine yourself and to stand
up for something. A lot of us have justified our weaknesses for too
long a time.''
</P>
<P>
   This class, which includes works by Shakespeare, Montaigne and
Melville, was inspired by Earl Shorris, a New York author, who
created a humanities course for the poor, although not necessarily
homeless, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are now seven such courses in the United States and
another 40 are planned in the next five years. Money is coming from
various sources, including the federal Department of Education,
foundations and state commissions on the humanities. Bard College
in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., is taking a central role and offering
credit to those who complete the courses that it is sponsoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King Jr. said years ago that a man can't ride
your back unless it is bent,'' said Louis Nanni, executive director
of the South Bend Center for the Homeless. ``This is just one more
way for our guests to straighten their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that these courses have impact. Shorris said
that the first course he offered at the Roberto Clemente Family
Guidance Center in New York in 1994-95 began with 31 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along the way,'' he said, ``one died of AIDS, three became
pregnant, two seriously ill. We had 17 who completed the course. Of
those, 14 earned six credits from Bard. Of those, 11 are enrolled
today in a four-year college, five of them at Bard.''
</P>
<P>
   Students in the eight-week course at Notre Dame earn a credit if
they do the reading, attend class regularly and pass the
examination. One student, Karyn Tanis, a former heroin addict who
has been something of a class star, has high hopes of starting
Notre Dame next fall with financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Other students say they love the feeling that going to class at
Notre Dame gives them, and the regimen of reading and discussion.
Their personal stories often have the weight of classic tragedy _
abuse, addiction, economic ruin _ and their relationship to the
texts can be deeply personal.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a recent class dealt with Melville's ``Billy
Budd,'' whose title character does not know his parents' identity.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Ferguson, 43, a recovering crystal methamphetamine
addict, who has lived at the homeless center since January, knows
that feeling. He was adopted as a child. When he found his birth
parents seven years ago, he discovered that they, too, were
addicts. The experience set him reeling. He lost his job, his wife
and his home, a story he shared in class.
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Ted West, 39, from Goshen, with sunken cheeks
and a handlebar mustache, explained the value of the course this
way:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come out of the fog of addiction, you thirst for
knowledge. You feel there is so much you missed. For 20 years, I
never had a goal beyond where my next glass of vodka was coming
from. When Socrates talks about the pleasure of knowledge, I know
exactly what he means.''
</P>
<P>
   He added by way of background: ``My health was miserable, my
life was failing. I was vomiting blood, I weighed 139 pounds. I was
hanging around with crazy people. I couldn't even light a
cigarette, I was so shaky. It took me a couple pints of vodka to go
to sleep at night. Now I need structure in my life, and reading
these books has become an important form of structure.''
</P>
<P>
   For the course's two professors, Clark Power and Stephen Fallon,
both in the program of liberal studies, teaching the homeless has
been a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound odd but I feel grateful to have the chance to
look at these texts through their eyes,'' said Power, who is a
developmental psychologist by training.
</P>
<P>
   When the issue of mortality came up, one student said simply,
``Anyone who has been an addict understands mortality.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Tempest'' was discussed, Fallon, a literary critic,
recalled: ``They grasped the mix of man and nature that Shakespeare
meant. They have insights into the texts I had not heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of teaching the great books beyond the traditional
classroom dates at least to the 1920s, when Mortimer Adler, the
psychologist who went on to become director of editorial planning
for the Encyclopaedia Britannica, began offering seminars in New
York City to working adults. It was, he argued, a requirement of
American democracy that all citizens become educated and
articulate.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Robert Maynard Hutchins further developed the great-books
idea for the public at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Shorris went to Chicago in the Hutchins era and was deeply
affected by his years there. But it was not until he was exploring
the nature of American poverty for a 1997 book, ``New American
Blues'' (Norton), that he had an insight into how the great books
could help the poor. It occurred, like an epiphany, when he met
Viniece Walker, a prisoner in the Bedford Hills Correctional
Facility in Westchester County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to teach the moral life of downtown,'' she told him
cryptically. It turned out she meant high culture: plays, museums,
concerts, literature. The way out of poverty, Shorris said he
believed, was politics. Ms. Walker was saying that to grasp
politics, to enter the public world, the poor first had to learn to
reflect. Art and the humanities were a gateway to reflection.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Shorris put it in his book and a September 1997 Harper's
Magazine article derived from it: ``The poor did not need anyone to
release them; an escape route existed. But to open this avenue to
reflection and politics a major distinction between the preparation
for the life of the rich and the life of the poor had to be
eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Shorris has formed a nonprofit organization, the Bard College
Clemente course in the humanities, whose board includes former New
York Mayor David Dinkins and Starling Lawrence, editor in chief at
W.W. Norton, which has donated to the courses many copies of its
books, including ``World Masterpieces Anthology.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Kempner, a philosopher, has been hired to direct the Bard
College program and the five-year expansion to almost 50 sites. Of
the existing seven courses, four are in New York City and one each
in New Brunswick, N.J., Seattle and Anchorage, Alaska. Abroad,
Shorris has started or is planning similar courses at the
University of British Columbia and in Yucatan, Mexico, and
Marseilles, France.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Bard College hopes to start courses in Los Angeles;
Philadelphia; Oklahoma City; Tampa, Fla.; Portland, Ore.; Boston;
Holyoke, Mass.; and two or three places in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The Bard courses all follow a rigorous pattern and are longer
and more extensive than the one offered at Notre Dame. Classes meet
twice a week for two semesters and cover a wider array of texts.
</P>
<P>
   The Notre Dame professors say they drew their inspiration from
Shorris but have limited their courses to eight weeks because of
the transitory nature of those living in the homeless center. But,
they add, a number of students continue from session to session.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Kazmierczak, 54, a former flower arranger and actor, is
one of them. He says the course has been a ``sanctuary, someplace I
can go where people appreciate me for my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kazmierczak elaborated: ``It is hard to find beauty when
you are in the situation we are in. But I have come to realize
through the reading that, in some ways, everybody is homeless. You
can be sitting in your fancy penthouse apartment looking out at the
world but your life can be hollow. Now my mind is active, I have
picked up a lost thread. Who knows? Maybe one day I'll write the
great American novel.''

   ALGERIA-UNREST (Algiers) _ The savage war between Algeria's
military rulers and Islamic guerrilla groups has taken at least
80,000 lives since it began in 1992. The vicious civil strife
erupted after the shadowy group of generals who hold real power in
this nation of 28 million people canceled a second round of
elections that were on the verge of securing a parliamentary
majority for a militant Islamic party. But now, to the surprise of
many Algerians, the situation has eased. A presidential election,
scheduled for April 15, has come alive, with 11 candidates
representing an array of political opinions, and a promise from the
army not to rig the ballot, as it has in the past. By John F.
Burns.

Central America, he will witness a region forged by one tragedy or
another over the last several decades, and more often than not,
forgotten in its intervals of renewal. The president is to open a
four-day visit to El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala on
Monday, the day after Salvadorans vote on a new president and
further cement a remarkable democratic transformation after 12
years of civil war that left more than 70,000 people dead. By
Mireya Navarro.

overview of America's Iraq policy. By Steven Lee Myers and Tim
Weiner.

   RELIGIOUS-RIGHT (Undated) _ Twenty years after the Rev. Jerry
Falwell's Moral Majority Inc. propelled religious conservatives
into a heavyweight force in American politics, the movement is
struggling without a clear political strategy and, for the first
time, a debate has even erupted among leading figures over whether
they should radically scale back their political efforts. By

   MARKETS-FUTURE (New York) _ In recent weeks, leaders of both the
New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, the nation's over-the-counter
market, have confirmed that they are considering a wide range of
new alliances that they hope will transform their institutions into
the stock markets of the future. Their initiatives are driven by a
frenzied competition for America's stock-trading business. While it
is too soon to predict which design will triumph, individual
Americans have a big stake in the outcome. If the transformation
works as its advocates hope, it could provide investors, big and
small, with better service at lower prices. But if it goes awry, it
could damage a national treasure: a stock market whose strength and
fairness have attracted foreign capital, fostered the growth of new
businesses, and provided investment opportunities for an
unprecedented number of people. By Diana B. Henriques.

<P>
   LATEX-ALLERGY (New York) _ Over 10 percent of the country's
health-care workers suffer from latex allergy, an illness that was
almost unheard of just a decade ago. And experts said that the
numbers are probably higher _ as high as 17 percent _ among those
who work almost exclusively in hospitals and with patients' fluids,
such as nurses in emergency and operating rooms, since allergies to
latex get much worse from heavy exposure to the material over time.
The illness affects roughly three percent of the general population
and since the late 1980s, nearly 30 people have died from
latex-related illnesses, according to Food and Drug Administration
figures. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

   WVA-WELFARE (Charleston, W.Va.) _ West Virginia has been hugely
successful at reducing its welfare caseload, pushing through a
reduction of 61 percent, fifth highest among the states. But as one
of the poorest states in the country, where unemployment is high,
jobs are scarce and the national economic boom is little more than
an echo, West Virginia has been unable to help many of these people

<P>
   SPORTS-SEXHARASSMENT (Undated) _ In an odd twist, the rise in
reports of harassment by male coaches is acknowledged to be an
unanticipated byproduct of a landmark victory for women: Title IX,
the 1972 law barring sexual discrimination at schools that receive
federal money. As participation in organized women's athletics has
greatly increased, creating a need for thousands of new coaches,
the share of those coaches who are women has dropped: at the
college level, the percentage of female head coaches of women's
teams has fallen to 47.4 percent, from 90 percent in 1972.
Statistics on sexual harassment in women's sport are minimal.
Researchers in the field say that schools have been reluctant to
pool data for a national survey. And they add that the numbers
would be misleading anyway, because athletes, afraid of losing
their spots on teams, rarely report their coaches. By Robin Finn.

   WASHINGTON _ In the space of a week, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has searched for a way to use the threat of U.S.
military power to end civil war in the world's smallest would-be
nation, Kosovo, and for a way to use U.S. economic power to change
the behavior of the world's largest and oldest nation, China.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign-policy conundrums, the two have little in common,
except that both are familiar and both have grown more resistant to
U.S. influence. Neither the last-ditch efforts to salvage a peace
proposal for Kosovo nor the ritualistic exchanges in Beijing last
week are likely to be recalled warmly in Albright's memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   But these radically different encounters have something odd in
common: They have come to mark the two extremes of the Clinton
administration's six-year struggle to bring coherence to U.S.
foreign policy in a time that often seems incoherent itself _ a
time of confusing ethnic and economic rivalries, of elbowing for
position in the pecking order of power.
</P>
<P>
   So as it begins the final quarter of its eight-year game,
President Clinton's team still trips over itself setting
foreign-policy priorities or fully explaining them to Americans, or
seeking leverage over foreign potentates, whether in a tiny corner
of the Balkans or the vastness of China.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that throughout the 1990s, both the
administration and its critics have flailed about for some grand
Unified Field Theory of Foreign Relations _ something as neat as
the concept of containment during the Cold War _ to define what it
should be doing, and in what order.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Michael Mandelbaum, a Johns Hopkins University
professor, issued a searing critique of the administration's
troubles separating the peripheral from the central; it resonates
more loudly today than ever. Kosovo, he says, is ``the ultimate
social work'' and has become ``something between a hobby and an
obsession'' for the administration. In contrast, he says, ``China
is truly important, the most strategically vital foreign-policy
problem we face.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, China policy _ like Japan and Russia policy _ is
endlessly bounced between the State Department and the Treasury,
and efforts at coordination are sporadic. Perhaps it is no surprise
that Albright's interchanges with Beijing last week about human
rights and China's integration into the world economy appeared to
have barely moved the conversation much beyond where it was in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the administration thought it had found something
approaching a Unified Theory _ that comprehensive economic
engagement and ``enlargement'' with great and small powers would
lead, sooner or later, to the spread of both free-market capitalism
and democracy. In Clinton's speeches, the two were usually tightly
linked, part of a web of global forces that was moving history
America's way. China was the great example, followed immediately by
Russia. But it didn't stop there:
</P>
<P>
   Economic engagement explained why peace talks in Northern
Ireland or the Middle East were always followed up by an economic
conference focused on creating jobs and ``enterprise zones'' in
hopes that prosperity would bring contentment, then hope, then
lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   But these are tough times for unified theories of all kinds.
``It's fair to say,'' one of Clinton's longest-serving aides mused
recently, ``that over time we have learned and relearned the lesson
that other countries shape their own destiny to a far greater
extent than we believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains why Clinton offered no grand theories in a
speech 10 days ago that was billed as an outline of his agenda for
the remaining two years of his presidency. The president delivered
what amounted to a list of agenda items: supporting peace (with the
use of as few U.S. troops as possible), supporting financial
stability (with the use of as little U.S. money as possible),
containing weapons of mass destruction and the countries and
terrorists who are trying to get hold of them.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing was any attempt to describe which items on the
list went to the heart of U.S. interests, or how they interrelated.
Even Clinton's critics expressed some understanding. ``Trying to
get the bumper sticker term for our foreign policy is a waste of
time,'' said Robert Zoellick, a former Bush administration official
who now heads the Center for Strategic and International Studies
here. ``But you can have a foreign policy with priority values,''
he said, ``rather than one that is case by case, reactive and
designed to immunize political threats at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there are plenty of grand theories kicking
around Washington. That, after all, is what out-of-power
foreign-policy wonks do. Samuel Huntington, the Harvard political
scientist, writes constantly about how ethnic tensions are the
nexis of the post-Cold War world. Others argue that the key to
modern U.S. hegemony is leadership, and thus the United States must
get involved in the Bosnias of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of contagious economic failure has given rise to
prescriptions for expanding the powers of international
institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, so that they can dictate domestic economic policy to
countries on the brink.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the old Cold Warriors, some of whom met over
lunch last week and raised the possibility of re-creating the
Committee on the Present Danger, a Reagan-era anti-communist group.
They spent the rest of lunch debating what constitutes the Present
Danger. A weakened Iraq? A starving North Korea? China in the midst
of its economic high-wire act?
</P>
<P>
   Their confusion arises from the difficulty in defining national
interest these days. And that is the real meaning of the Bosnia to
Beijing bookends.

   The Clinton administration came to power far from convinced that
Bosnia was a central interest of the United States, then decided
that the Balkans (along with Somalia and Haiti) must be, as the
horror of it all unfolded on television. But the reality is that
while Americans are perfectly happy to see the secretary of state
jetting around the world to strike peace agreements, their
willingness to put lives at risk for such causes is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, though, both the public and Congress have come to
recognize a second type of national interest: averting economic
implosions that could affect U.S. prosperity. Congress screamed
when the administration bailed out Mexico, a move that most now
believe avoided a long, ugly recession on America's border. By the
time the Asian crisis hit, the objections began to dissipate, and
there was barely a peep when the Treasury helped organize the
rescues of South Korea and Brazil.

Ever since the $17 billion IMF package failed last summer, both the
Russian economy and Moscow's relationship with Washington have been
in a downward spiral.

<P>
   And now comes China, the most complex case. No one doubts that
Chinese are enjoying greater economic freedom. Or that China is
cracking down on political organizers, reverting to elements of a
state-run economy and adding to the missiles facing Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   So Washington has reverted to a mixed message, encouraging moves
to get China into the World Trade Organization _ part of that web
of economic engagement _ while talking about building a regional
missile defense that drives the Chinese up the wall. The Chinese
say they recognize America's real strategy and it is both old and
familiar: containment. They may be wrong, but at least it's a
coherent theory.

   ALGIERS, Algeria _ As a muezzin's afternoon call to prayers rang
through the cobbled alleyways of Algiers' Casbah, Mouloud Takdjout
settled into a comfortable niche in the old city wall and watched
fellow Muslims hurry past.
</P>
<P>
   Dangling a cigarette from his mouth, the 50-year-old ``wall
man'' _ the nickname Algerians give to their millions of unemployed
_ tapped his foot to the mesmeric beat of a Berber pop song playing
on his transistor radio, and talked of an Algeria that may at last
be emerging from a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has an end, including this, and we are within sight
of the finish,'' he said, referring to the savage war between
Algeria's military rulers and Islamic guerrilla groups that has
taken at least 80,000 lives since it began in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The strife erupted after the shadowy group of generals who hold
real power in this nation of 28 million canceled a second round of
elections that were on the verge of securing a parliamentary
majority for a militant Islamic party. The Casbah, a maze of
streets in the old Turkish quarter of Algiers, became for most
people almost completely off-limits, its traditional vitality
dulled by the lurking presence of Islamic guerrillas who used it as
a base to mount bombings, ambushes and assassinations, terrorizing
Algiers as their allies outside the capital terrorized much of the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the dead were civilian women and children,
sometimes babies only a few months old. Often the killers cut
victims' throats, burned them alive, gouged out their eyes, or
hacked them to pieces. Few foreigners ventured into the legendary
Casbah, even with the posse of armed bodyguards that are every
visitor's inseparable shadows. Rumors of government complicity in
the violence abounded, but _ despite promises _ the generals never
allowed international human rights groups to probe the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to the surprise of many Algerians, the situation has eased.
A presidential election, scheduled for April 15, has come alive,
with 11 candidates representing an array of political opinions, and
a promise from the army not to rig the ballot, as it has in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   The group of generals who control the government, known to
French-speaking Algerians as ``Le Pouvoir'' _ The Power _ reached a
cease-fire pact in the fall of 1997 with the Islamic Salvation
Army, the guerrilla group that launched the war. Last September,
the retired general who held formal power as Algeria's president,
Liamine Zeroual, stunned the nation by announcing his resignation
19 months before the end of his five-year term, ushering in April's
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Many Algerians have concluded that a faction among the generals,
known as ``The Conciliators,'' have been so shocked by the years of
violence that they have concluded that they must begin transferring
at least a measure of power to elected politicians if Algeria is to
have any hope of ending its crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the power structure in the Soviet Union, we have
been ruled by a monolith, but it is a monolith with deep internal
fissures,'' said Hocine Ait-Ahmed, a 73-year-old presidential
candidate who was one of the nine men who, in 1954, met secretly in
France to found the National Liberation Front, the group that led
Algeria's war against France, which ended in independence in 1962.
``The generals are divided among themselves, and that has given us
a small opening that we must not fail to exploit.''
</P>
<P>
   Takdjout's laid-back demeanor in the Casbah was emblematic of
the new, more hopeful mood. Only 18 months ago, edicts by the Armed
Islamic Group, a breakaway guerrilla faction known for its
brutality, imposed a fearful conformity on the Casbah that included
mandatory attendance at prayers, bans on cigarette smoking and on
the sale of a popular tobacco snuff known as chemma, and on the
playing of music of any kind. There was also a prohibition on women
venturing out unveiled, or unaccompanied by close male relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cease-fire, the level of violence has plunged, to the
point where fewer than 200 people died in terrorist attacks during
the Muslim holy month of Ramadan that ended in February, compared
with more than 1,600 in the same period in 1998. Even former
partisans of the two political extremes, the generals and the
Islamic hard-liners, seem to have been so alienated by the violence
that they have turned against intolerant politics of all shades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Islamists? They are rubbish, killers and thieves, nothing
more,'' said Takdjout, his face shaded by a sailor's cap acquired
when he worked in the customs house in the port of Algiers. That
was before strife and plunging oil prices sent the Algerian economy
into a free fall, before he lost his job, and before Islamic
guerrillas burst into the home of his brother Omar, a policeman,
and shot him to death in front of his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   Like scores of other Algerians interviewed in the last 10 days,
Takdjout seemed equally disillusioned with the military rulers.
``They're finished now, the Islamists, and good riddance to them, I
say,'' he said. ``But it's finished for the generals, too.
Algeria's going to be a democracy, you'll see. It's the
international pattern, isn't it? Why should Algeria be an
exception?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Algerians are as quick to write off the Islamic
guerrillas or the political party, the Islamic Salvation Front,
which won the support of half the country's voters in the aborted
election in December 1991. With the party banned and its leaders
imprisoned or under house arrest, there is no way to know the
Islamic group's intentions. Foreign reporters, required to be
accompanied everywhere by government bodyguards, are told that the
Islamic leaders are not available for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Zeroual and the country's most powerful
generals, making it hard to assess how they see the future,
particularly the prospect that April's ballot might lead eventually
to a South Africa-style investigation into the past and into
alleged government involvement in massacres. &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Armed Islamic Group, at any rate, still shuns the cease-fire
and accounts for dozens of victims each month. Earlier this past
week, the group was blamed for an attack in the western Algerian
town of Ain Defla in which nine members of two families were killed
as they slept. The throats of four victims, all children under 10,
had been cut. Only days before, a bomb, also attributed to the
group, killed four people dining in a restaurant in Khemis Miliana,
also in western Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   The group, included on a State Department list of the world's
most dangerous terrorist organizations, has continued to tie up a
huge Algerian security force, possibly as many as 500,000 soldiers
and police officers. Little is known about the group beyond the
fact that some of its leaders trained as Algerian volunteers in the
Muslim guerrilla struggle against the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan. Western intelligence estimates have put its current
strength at about 3,000 men, but even this is little more than a
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the general uncertainty, Algeria's politics remain
extraordinarily opaque, as they have been since the army swept
aside Algeria's first President, Ahmed Ben Bella, only three years
after the independence war ended.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, riots in Algiers and other cities forced the
generals to accept a multise foreparty political system and an
independent press. But much remains unknowable. The men who
exercise real control remain shielded from public view, visible
only when their armored cars race up the hillside to heavily
protected compounds overlooking the Bay of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   Some things about the forthcoming presidential election have run
ominously true to past form.
</P>
<P>
   Two parties that effectively are controlled by the military
oligarchy, the National Liberation Front and the closely linked
National Democratic Rally, have chosen as their candidate Abdelaziz
Bouteflika, a 61-year-old former foreign minister. Bouteflika's
last role here was in the 1970's, under the dictatorial regime of
the country's first military ruler, Houari Boumedienne.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the last 16 years, until he returned to Algeria
last month, Bouteflika lived in Switzerland, where he is said to
have made a living acting as an adviser to Arab nations in the
Persian Gulf. Editors of the independent newspapers that have
sprung up in Algiers in the 1990s say they have little by which to
judge Bouteflika, since he made no public comments on Algerian
issues in years.
</P>
<P>
   More important, since entering the election, he has made no
policy statements and held no news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   About the only issue he has addressed has been his health,
following Algerian newspaper reports that one of his last calls
before leaving Switzerland was at a hospital in Geneva. Longtime
friends say that Bouteflika has suffered for at least 20 years from
kidney disease. Presenting his nomination papers this week,
Bouteflika was classically opaque. ``Just as some people exercise
their right to speak, I exercise the right to remain silent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the candidates arrayed against Bouteflika are several with
long histories of serving as civilian ministers in military-led
governments. Three of these are former prime ministers, including
an engineer, Sid Ahmed Ghozali, 61, who issued the edict voiding
the December 1991 elections in which the Islamic Salvation Front
appeared headed for a parliamentary sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The field also includes a moderate Islamic leader, Ahmed Taleb
Ibrahimi. Ibrahimi, a 67-year-old physician who spent five years in
French jails for his role in the independence struggle, was a
stalwart of military-led regimes through much of the 1970's and
1980's, rising to Foreign Minister. But partly because his father
was one of Algeria's leading Islamic scholars, he is expected to
draw support from voters who gave their ballots in 1991 to the
Islamic Salvation Front.
</P>
<P>
   This alone, many Algerians believe, could make him Bouteflika's
strongest challenger, assuming the generals hold to their promises
of allowing a free vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Ibrahimi and several other candidates remain fearful of a
backlash by a hard-line military group known among Algerians as
``The Eradicators,'' from their adoption of a military policy in
the early years of the violence that sought to eliminate the
Islamic guerrillas and their political leaders by whatever means
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   With Algerian newspapers putting every government electoral
maneuver on their front pages, Zeroual went on Algerian television
last month to offer personal assurances of a fair vote. This was
followed by an interview in the main army magazine, El Djeich, in
which the army commander, Gen. Mohammed Lamari, pledged neutrality,
saying the army's only concern was to ensure the security of the 16
million voters. Any suggestion to the contrary, he said, was
``pernicious and tendentious'' and aimed at deceiving Algerians.
</P>
<P>
   But political veterans note that the army has given similar
assurances before previous elections, then proceeded to oversee
rigging.
</P>
<P>
   Ghozali, the former prime minister, said in an interview that
attempts to sway the vote in Bouteflika's favor already had begun,
by using local authorities to help gather the 400,000 signatures
that backed his nomination papers, at least double the number
presented by any other candidate. ``Nothing has changed,'' he said.
``The Algerian Army has always been a political institution, and it
remains so now.''
</P>
<P>
   If the hard-liners stay their hands, said Ibrahimi, the moderate
Islamic candidate, he believes he can defeat Bouteflika and steer
Algeria toward a society that would be both democratic and Islamic,
but without the excesses of Islamic takeovers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most Algerians want is an Islam of tolerance and
moderation, not the Islam of Afghanistan,'' he said. ``Now, after
this trial of blood, with the winds of democracy blowing, we have a
chance to achieve that. If we succeed, we will create a model for
the rest of the Arab and Muslim world.''
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics see powerful reasons for the generals to see
Bouteflika elected and then act through him to protect their power.
That could thwart any probe of their past, although several
candidates, including Ibrahimi, have suggested an amnesty for all
but the worst outrages.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to answer suggestions of government complicity,
officials arranged for a reporter and photographer from The New
York Times to visit the so-called ``Triangle of Death,'' an area of
newly constructed townships 15 miles east of Algiers, where nearly
500 people were killed in two separate attacks in a month in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors in the poverty-ridden townships of Bentalha and Rais
seemed wary of blaming either Islamic guerrillas or the government,
mostly referring to ``terrorists'' when describing the attackers
who spent hours hacking entire families to death.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the nearly deserted townships made it clear that,
whatever the optimism elsewhere, the attacks destroyed faith in all
political groups, including the Islamic Salvation Front, which drew
overwhelming support from Bentalha and Ras in the 1991 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we vote for one candidate or another, it will make no
difference,'' said Malika Aboub, a 36-year-old who clutched her son
Krimo, 9, as she spoke. ``All we want is peace. Anybody who can
give us that will have our support.''

   TOKYO _ Last year, Japan seemed to bite its lip as it watched
China's economy continue to boom. Japan was suffering its worst
slowdown in more than half a century, and its rival was the only
Asian country to survive the Asian economic crisis with its
reputation enhanced. Commentators made invidious comparisons
between Chinese decisiveness and Japan's inability to confront its
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   All this was hard to take in Japan, Asia's largest economy, and
it hurt even more when President Jiang Zemin made a state visit in
November _ the first ever by a Chinese leader _ and told Japan how
terrible it had been in World War II. Nobody wanted China's economy
to collapse, but there was a bit of a yearning for China to stumble
and learn its vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Now that has happened. China's economy is showing signs of
frailty, even though officials still hope for economic growth this
year of 7 percent. And Japanese business executives and economists
are finding that they are looking at China's economy these days not
so much with resentment or envy as with apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very nervous about them following the same path as the
Japanese economy in the next five years,'' said Takashi Hoshino, a
China specialist and director for research at the Institute for
Socio-Economic Infrastructure and Services here. ``There are very
big problems in China. In particular, the situation of the
financial sector _ the banking problems _ their situation is quite
similar to Japan's recent experience.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also huge differences. Japan's economy is more than
four times the size of China's. China can still enjoy catch-up
gains that are unavailable to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But some Japanese see in China a bit of their own experience.
China has enjoyed the go-go growth that Japan went through in the
1980s. But since Japan's speculative economic bubble burst in the
early 1990s, it has taken eight years for the nation to come to
grips with fundamental problems that still need to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   As a communist country trying to make the transition from
command economy to the market, China obviously has problems Japan
never faced; its dying state sector claims about 40 percent of
total economic output. Japan, with 120 million people, can tap into
a savings pool of $9 trillion. China, with about 1.2 billion
people, does not have nearly as big a savings pool.
</P>
<P>
   But China also has the creeping burdens that have plagued Japan:
government spending on public works to boost growth, a practice of
lifetime employment, growing public debt and a broken financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   China's economy is expected to grow this year, while Japan's is
going to have to fight to reach zero growth. But like Japan, China
is facing the threat of deflation, as prices begin to sink, as
factories become idle and as inventories rise with products no one
wants.
</P>
<P>
   With ailing state businesses trimming wages and workers, Chinese
consumers are increasingly worried about the future, hoarding their
money, rather than spending it, which would help boost nationwide
consumption. As in Japan, the only big spender in China is the
government, which is pouring money into concrete, bricks and mortar
for bridges, dams and other projects, even if they crumble thanks
to hasty construction or corruption.
</P>
<P>
   And as in Japan, China's spending is swelling the budget deficit
to record levels. And the banking system, buckling under bad loans
amounting to 30 percent to 40 percent of the nation's total
economic pie, is reluctant to lend. China, like Japan, is caught in
a credit squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very jittery,'' said Fred Hu, a China economist at
Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. ``They are moving from a world of
cradle-to-grave welfare system to a very uncertain brave new
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic relations between China and Japan are complicated by
more than a century of profound political and military antagonisms.
Many Chinese are irritated that Japan has not apologized more
forthrightly for World War II atrocities. Even today, many young
Chinese say with remarkable bluntness that they hate Japanese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese worry that China could become a militarist bully
in the next century the way Japan was in the middle of this one.
``China can become as militaristic, as expansionist and as arrogant
as we were,'' said a Japanese legislator who travels to China
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the two largest economies in Asia could
both be ailing troubles many economists. Many Japanese recognize
that growth in China would help maintain stability in the region by
maintaining the flow of trade and a firm exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in the habit of rejoicing in the misfortunes of
others,'' said Sakaaki Numata, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign
Ministry. ``And I'm not quite sure what is happening in China can
be described as misfortune just yet.''

CLOSING OFF THE OPEN  
 SAFETY CONCERNS MAY SPUR ALCOHOL, CROWD CAPS

<P>
   PHOENIX -Sweeping changes to cut crowds at the Phoenix Open,
perhaps by limiting daily tickets or relying on expensive weekly
badges, are under consideration after a security incident this year
involving PGA Tour star Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Measures being discussed could significantly reduce attendance,
limit alcohol consumption and tone down the tournament's raucous
party atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Thunderbirds, who organize the tournament, and the
PGA Tour will work out specific solutions in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   One idea, kicked back indirectly to the Thunderbirds from the
PGA, would raise the minimum cost of admission to the tournament to
$150 or more for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Some think such a plan would slash the total crowds from this
year's 422,650 to around 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Matteucci, who recently was promoted to tournament
chairman for next year's Phoenix Open, said new policies will be in
effect by June 1. He said the proposed changes were prompted by the
nationally reported incident involving the gun-carrying fan, Brian
K. Murphy, during the final round of the tournament on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Murphy thing really caught people's attention,'' Matteucci
said of the scuffle that broke out between Murphy, a north Phoenix
resident, and Scottsdale police Officer Robert Rucker. Murphy, who
was found to have a pistol in his fanny pack, was arrested on
suspicion of felony assault on a police officer and disorderly
conduct. The case remains under investigation by the Maricopa
County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, changes will not be popular with all tour pros, or with
rowdy fans who routinely pack the 16th hole of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Magee of Paradise Valley, the runner-up in last week's
prestigious World Golf Championship Match Play tournament, said he
had heard the rumblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I heard (the PGA Tour) said to cool it, to get things
under control,'' Magee said. ``But I think the tour should leave
the Phoenix Open alone. Yeah, there's nothing like it in golf, but
what's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phoenix Open is a very unique event, and the tour wants to
make it just like every other tournament. If it's about the gun
deal, well, that's a really random thing. Besides, that guy wasn't
going to use a gun. And if it's about the 16th hole, you just get
over it. You suck it up for that one shot and then go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, maybe (the Phoenix Open) is the wave of
the future. Maybe our crowds in Phoenix are just getting the
players ready for the next generation of golf fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Other local pros, such as Billy Mayfair and Tom Purtzer, have
said frequently that they thought the tournament needed to tone
down its act. They could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After this year's incident, tournament organizers reacted by
banning guns at the TPC of Scottsdale, which is on federal
property. A special task force made up of Thunderbirds also has
been formed to address the issues of gallery control and security
in general, as well as traffic and parking concerns, Matteucci
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrote to (PGA Tour Commissioner) Tim Finchem and proposed
the task force to deal with our growing crowd challenges,''
Matteucci said. ``We're looking at a whole host of things that
would make for a more balanced environment for the players and the
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Open, the Thunderbirds eliminated beer sales
around the infamous 16th tee, where partygoers, mostly of college
age, tend to congregate. But beer was brought in from other
concession stands, and the 16th-hole gang still was able to scream,
sometimes with slurred speech, ``Get in the hole!'' after every tee
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Matteucci said that the Thunderbirds ``are definitely looking at
alcohol consumption issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the crowd behavior issues and alcohol are
intertwined,'' he said. ``It's just a little early to address any
solutions specifically, like when or where it's going to be served.
</P>
<P>
   Although Matteucci said the idea for the task force originated
with the Thunderbirds, he said he had heard reports out of Miami on
Tuesday that the PGA Tour Policy Board was told by Finchem's office
to ``do something about Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that, yeah,'' Matteucci said. ``But we don't think
there's any Band-Aid for this. That's why we formed the task force
to study a lot of factors.''
</P>
<P>
   The liaison from Finchem's office told the PGA Tour Policy board
at its meeting in Miami that the only way to control the Phoenix
Open was ``to reduce the size of the crowds significantly, like
they did in Dallas (at the Byron Nelson GTE Classic),'' according
to a source within the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be done by limiting daily tickets, or eliminating
them entirely with a weekly badge that would cost, say, $150, or
twice as much as a daily ticket ($20)'' the source told ``The
Arizona Republic'' on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Matteucci said that, essentially, that was the same rumor he'd
heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say that breaking attendance records is no longer a
top priority,'' Matteucci said. ``I think we've reached _ even
exceeded _ our capacity. And with more and more development going
on out there around the TPC (of Scottsdale), the tournament is
really getting squeezed to the point where we need some new
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Open annually tops the PGA Tour in attendance,
attracting 400,000 to 500,000 for the week. The Greater Hartford
Open and Byron Nelson rank second and third among other tour
events, although the PGA Tour does not keep track of attendance
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Butler, the vice president of business affairs for the PGA
Tour, said, ``The Phoenix Open is certainly a unique tournament
because of its large attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the size of those crowds is a detriment or
not. That's why we're only in the early stages of studying possible
changes,'' said Butler, who plans to meet with four members of the
Thunderbirds _ Matteucci, Tim Grant, Ray Artigue and Peter Callihan
_ during the week of March 22-28 at the PLAYERS Championship in
Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are deferring everything to the
Thunderbirds, who are going to give us their operational review of
the tournament, then we'll go from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily the size of the crowd that is the
problem, although it's a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler cited the Byron Nelson as a tournament that effectively
handled large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Salesmanship Club of Dallas, which is the host
organization for the Nelson like the Thunderbirds are for the
Phoenix Open, decided to cap the number of tickets sold before they
ran into any real problems,'' Butler said. ``Plus, the laws
instituted by the Texas Alcohol and Beverage Commission also cause
greater restraint than you have (in Arizona). At the Nelson, you
can only consume beer in certain, gardenlike areas. You can't just
walk around the tournament with a beer in your hand like (in
Phoenix).''
</P>
<P>
   Matteucci said the Thunderbirds hope to walk a fine line between
keeping the Phoenix Open's ``unique fabric'' and addressing and
effectively dealing with the security concerns of the tour and its
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, we create a city out there, and with it come all
the inherent issues and problems you have with a real city,'' he
said. ``At the same time, the tournament brings so many good things
to the community, such as $3 million in charitable contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   But like it or not, there's a new Phoenix Open on the way in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there definitely will be some changes for next year's
tournament, because we want the players to know we're interested in
their safety,'' Matteucci said. ``But, hopefully, they won't be so
dramatic as to take away from the tournament's uniqueness.'' &QL;

   Auschwitz. Dachau. Ping Fan. Changchun. In the shorthand of
World War II atrocities, some names are more recognizable than
others.
</P>
<P>
   But while Nazi scientists like Josef Mengele conducted hideous
experiments on concentration camp prisoners, their lesser-known
Japanese counterparts, led by Gen. Shiro Ishii, were waging
full-scale biological warfare and subjecting human beings to
ghastly experiments of their own _ and on a far greater scale than
the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine hundreds of Mengeles,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper of
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, who has been calling on
the Japanese to face up to their past as openly as the Germans
have.
</P>
<P>
   Ping Fan, built by Ishii, the mastermind of Japanese germ
warfare and its infamous Unit 731, was a camp of plague-bearing
fleas, rat cages and warrens for human guinea pigs. Changchun, 150
miles south, was another huge installation for germ tests on
plants, animals and people.
</P>
<P>
   Though not approaching the systematic exterminations by the
Nazis, the Japanese record of atrocities _ what victims call ``the
Asian Holocaust'' _ is still producing revelations more than 50
years after the end of World War II. The delay illustrates the
West's Eurocentric view of wartime suffering as well as striking
differences in the willingness of the two former Axis allies to
come to terms with their past.
</P>
<P>
   It has also thrown a harsh light on Cold War rivalries. As early
as 1949, the Soviet Union convicted 12 Japanese for biological war
crimes. Although the published transcript contained exhaustive
details of Unit 731's crimes, the accounts were largely ignored or
dismissed in the West as communist propaganda. The Allies did,
however, prosecute 5,570 Japanese, but none for biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, American and British scholars and
journalists rediscovered the germ war issue, adding new details of
U.S. involvement in covering up the crimes. The story has since
taken on a new momentum and questions of the guilt of Emperor
Hirohito persist. Justice Department officials, unfettered by the
State Department, are complaining that the Japanese are refusing to
provide data on suspected war criminals, who would be barred from
entering the United States, just as 60,000 Germans and other
Europeans are now.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a 1997 Japanese lawsuit by Chinese seeks
compensation for victims of Japan's germ warfare. Former members of
Unit 731 have been confessing crimes. Chinese researchers say they
keep uncovering new sites where anthrax, typhoid, plague and other
diseases were spread, wiping out perhaps hundreds of thousands of
Chinese. Another 10,000 or more Chinese, Russians and perhaps some
U.S. prisoners of war as well, researchers say, were killed in
ghoulish experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials insist they lack proof, although by other
accounts they have sealed wartime archives returned to them by the
U.S. authorities in the 1950s. With powerful right-wing and
militaristic factions long opposed to confessions of wartime guilt,
the Japanese publisher of a translation of ``The Rape of Nanking,''
the 1997 best-seller by Iris Chang (Basic Books), postponed its
publication.
</P>
<P>
   For decades after the war, veterans of Unit 731 and other
biological warfare detachments led Japanese medicine, say scholars
like Sheldon H. Harris, emeritus professor of history at California
State University at Northridge, and author of ``Factories of
Death'' (Routledge, 1994), on the Japanese germ war program.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in 1992 that the government officially acknowledged
that the Japanese army forced several hundred thousand Korean women
into prostitution in World War II, and it was only last year that a
Japanese court ordered the government to pay $2,300 each to three
plaintiffs. By contrast, Germany, in its schools and the press, has
dealt unflinchingly with its past and paid victims reparations now
amounting to about $80 billion, with private industry planning to
pay billions more.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese accountability for germ war atrocities got lost in the
Cold War. With the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Soviet Union and
the United States competed to snare Ishii's data. The Americans won
out, promising immunity from war-crimes prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dohini, a former lawyer on the U.S. prosecution team in
Tokyo, said recently he had no idea that the crimes had included
germ warfare. In December 1945, he said, he had carried a
top-secret message to the U.S. authorities in Tokyo. ``I assumed it
had to do with the emperor, because soon after, I discovered we
were not able to try him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He now calls the decision a big mistake, since revelations have
pointed to the monarch's knowledge of germ warfare. ``I don't think
there is any question of the emperor's guilt,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years after the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority Inc.
propelled religious conservatives into a heavyweight force in U.S.
politics, the movement is struggling without a clear strategy, and
for the first time a debate has erupted among leading figures over
whether they should radically scale back their political efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As the 2000 presidential campaign gets under way, religious
conservative groups are fractured and unable to coalesce around a
single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, some influential leaders are saying that the best
way to change America is not through politics but by building a
conservative base through the schooling of children at home or by
working to change the hearts and minds of people through Christian
preaching and the example of biblically inspired good works.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to a sense of exasperation, prominent religious
conservatives complain, is that they are not getting enough
attention from Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. That is because
many in the party, trying to erase the low popularity ratings for
Republicans in the wake of President Clinton's impeachment, are
seeking to shift the agenda from moral issues to practical ones
like education and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's acquittal in the impeachment trial last month,
Paul Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Foundation, a
conservative organization in Washington, wrote a widely circulated
letter declaring that attempts to restore morality ``through the
political process have failed'' and suggesting that conservatives
build up ``parallel institutions,'' like home schools and religious
radio.
</P>
<P>
   While no one argues that religious conservatives should stop
voting or caring about issues, Weyrich is by no means the only
religious conservative to question what is gained from pouring time
and money into highly organized political efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The cover article in the Feb. 27 issue of the conservative
magazine World was devoted to three Republican senators who had
left politics to focus on business or religion. One, Dan Coates of
Indiana, was quoted as saying, ``The political process is very
limited in what it can do for our spiritual and moral problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar idea forms a theme of ``Blinded by Might,'' a book by
two former Moral Majority officials, the syndicated columnist Cal
Thomas and the Rev. Ed Dobson, a pastor in Grand Rapids, Mich., to
be published later this month by Zondervan Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are looking in whole or in part to government to
correct the problems of America are looking in the wrong place,''
Thomas said in an interview. Instead, he said, Christians should
work to change the culture by following Jesus' commands to love
their enemies, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and visit the
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a call to retreat or surrender,'' he added. ``It
is a call for re-enlistment in a better army that provides better
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   His co-author, Ed Dobson, a native of Northern Ireland, said
that ``moral transformation will come one person at a time, one
family at a time, one street at a time, one community at a time.''
He added, ``It will not come from the government.''
</P>
<P>
   But such talk has led some religious conservatives to see a
white flag. Speaking before about 1,700 people at a Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., conference on Feb. 26, Gary Bauer, president of
the Family Research Council, declared, ``Words like `I give up'
should not be in our vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who is considering a bid for the Republican presidential
nomination, was followed to the podium by the Rev. James Kennedy,
whose Coral Ridge Ministries sponsored the gathering. Kennedy
paraphrased some of Churchill's wartime remarks, saying, ``Never
give up, never give up, never give up!''
</P>
<P>
   Power Diluted by Divisions
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the aftermath of Clinton's acquittal, some
religious conservatives have sounded discouraged. James Dobson,
president of Focus on the Family, told a magazine interviewer
recently that although he believed that social conservatives
represented a slight majority of the American public, they were
less politically active than liberals and often did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   For years many religious conservative leaders fashioned
themselves as power brokers in the Republican presidential
primaries, in which their followers were usually among the most
politically active, with influence far beyond their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   John Green, a political scientist who is director of the Ray C.
Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron,
said he did not believe that voting by religious conservatives
declined last year from the elections in 1994 and 1996. ``I expect
them to be fully energized next year,'' Green added.
</P>
<P>
   But as the 2000 campaigns gear up, religious conservatives are
balkanized among as many as a half-dozen candidates. The contender
who was emerging as a favorite, Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri,
decided recently not to make the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ashcroft's departure and the lack of a consensus around a
single candidate, it's going to be very hard to put Humpty Dumpty
back together,'' said Ralph Reed, the political strategist and
former executive director of the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of religious conservative groups to deliver a block
of voters has probably long been overstated. But the perception
that they are unable to rally behind a single candidate could lead
candidates to be even less eager to romance the groups.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster who founded the
Christian Coalition and who had supported Ashcroft, told reporters
in a recent interview, ``He would have been the favorite of some of
the people of the Christian Coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whom he supported now, Robertson did not express
enthusiasm for any prospect. Robertson, in fact, was perhaps the
last presidential candidate who truly energized religious
conservatives when he ran for president in 1988. His huge number of
devoted loyalists, particularly in Iowa, were called ``the
invisible army.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the frustration of overly high hopes has
contributed to a sense of disillusionment for some. ``There were
expectations that the religious right, monolithically thinking, was
expecting certain results from a Republican-controlled Congress and
it felt like Congress didn't deliver,'' said former Gov. David
Beasley of South Carolina, who played an important role in uniting
religious conservatives in his state behind Bob Dole in the 1996
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many in the Christian community expect that through the
political arena we can solve America's problems,'' Beasley said,
``and I do not agree with that. But I think the Christian community
has an obligation to be involved in the political process.''

</P>
<P>
   Some Even Question If They Have Power
</P>
<P>
   While many religious conservatives would agree with that, some
are not very optimistic about their political influence.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paige Patterson, president of the Southern Baptist
Convention, said that ``there is a lot of cynicism in evangelical
circles and in Baptist circles'' about politicians not fulfilling
their promises to support social conservative causes. ``Apparently,
once you go to work inside the Beltway, your radar collapses,''
Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   But others struck an optimistic note. Richard Land, president of
the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty
Commission, said he believed that there would be ``a profound
discussion in the year 2000 about the kind of society we're going
to have,'' a debate that would work to the advantage of
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell predicted in a recent interview that Vice President Al
Gore, because of his unstinting defense of Clinton, would not be
elected next year. ``I think you'll find activism at an all-time
high in the year 2000 among religious conservatives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the senior pastor of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in
Fort Lauderdale, said that a century-long rise in the number of
conversions to Christianity worldwide should inspire religious
conservatives. ``If you're running a marathon, and you get to
within 20 yards of the finish line, you don't quit while you're
ahead,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy noted that evangelical Protestants largely separated
themselves from American culture earlier this century. In the
1920s, after enduring ridicule in the Scopes trial for their
support of efforts to block the teaching of evolution,
fundamentalists withdrew from attempts to influence society.
</P>
<P>
   Forsaking Image of Irrelevancy
</P>
<P>
   But since the late 1970s, religious conservatives have said
separatism is a thing of the past, particularly when it comes to
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is hard work,'' said Randy Tate, executive director
of the Christian Coalition. ``To go back to the days when we were
on the irrelevant sidelines is not a formula to change the
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Random interviews among those at the Fort Lauderdale conference
indicated that many shared Tate's views. Barbara Harris, a pastor's
wife from Orlando, Fla., paraphrased a statement attributed to the
political philosopher Edmund Burke by saying, ``Evil triumphs when
good men do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Robinson, 61, a school administrator from Beaver Falls,
Pa., said, ``Rather than pulling back, Christians ought to go full
speed ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   A major challenge for religious conservatives in politics,
however, is the numbers they can field in major presidential
primary states. While the Christian Coalition has never been as
influential in New Hampshire as in Iowa, Steve Duprey, the
Republican state chairman in New Hampshire, was almost dismissive
of the group. ``They're one of 10 or 15 constituent groups,'' he
said. ``They're not a dominant block.''
</P>
<P>
   And nationally, voters in that block appear more fractured than
ever. Richard Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said: ``It's going to be very difficult for Christian
conservatives, much less the conservative wing of the party, to
reach critical mass. There's just no one perfect candidate for them
out there.''

   When a Guatemalan truth commission implicated the United States
in February in the creation of a killing machine that ravaged
entire Mayan villages in the 1980s, it raised questions that are
not likely to go away soon _ certainly not by the time President
Clinton visits Guatemala this week:
</P>
<P>
   How could a country that calls itself a beacon of democracy link
its military and intelligence agencies so intimately to Guatemala's
darkest, most reactionary forces? What was the nature of that
relationship over three decades? What were U.S. officials thinking
as 200,000 people were killed?
</P>
<P>
   Some answers, or at least clues, can be found in scores of
declassified documents the Clinton administration released to the
National Security Archive, a research group that aided the truth
commission in its research.
</P>
<P>
   From these documents, a narrative emerges _ the story of an
approach launched in the 1950s, when confident World War II
veterans set out to stop communism with a new kind of warfare that
would eventually be called counterinsurgency.
</P>
<P>
   It is well known that the CIA engineered a coup in Guatemala in
1954, and that Americans lavished training and equipment on a
series of rightist governments.
</P>
<P>
   What is less familiar is that, even as U.S. policies evolved in
other parts of the world, especially after the failures in Vietnam,
the policies in Guatemala did not. Washington's counterinsurgency
arsenal melded with the traditional brutality and racism of the
Guatemalan army to make a horrifying brew, and the effects
outlasted the global threat of communism itself.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts in 1954, when Gen. James Doolittle wrote a
report for a fellow World War II hero, President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, on how to use the CIA in the Cold War: ``There are no
rules in such a game. Hitherto acceptable norms of human conduct do
not apply.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, CIA officers were sifting through the documents of
an elected leftist government it had just overthrown in Guatemala,
assembling a list of suspected communists. The new rightist regime,
handpicked by the agency, used the list to eliminate by death any
potential opposition. That kind of coordination went on for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Newly declassified U.S. documents, for example, place a CIA
officer in the room where Guatemalan intelligence officers _ men
responsible for death squad killings _ planned their covert
operations in 1965. They show that CIA and other U.S. officials
played a key role in the latter 1960s in centralizing command
structures and communications of agencies that would be involved in
death squad killings for years. They contain CIA reports of secret
executions of Communist Party leaders by Guatemalan government
agencies in 1966 that Guatemalan officials publicly denied.
</P>
<P>
   They also show that the CIA station in Guatemala City knew that
the Guatemalan army was massacring entire Mayan villages while
Reagan administration officials publicly supported the military
regime's human-rights record. Even after the war was won, the
documents reveal, Defense Intelligence Agency officials knew that
the Guatemalan military was destroying evidence of torture centers
and clandestine graveyards in 1994. Not a word was uttered publicly
by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Through the decades, a lone voice of warning belonged to Viron
Vaky, a State Department official who had been the Number 2
official in the Embassy in Guatemala. In a long memo of dissent in
March 1968, he wrote that the ``indiscriminate'' violence of the
counterinsurgency tactics ``present a serious problem for the U.S.
in terms of our image in Latin America and the credibility of what
we say we stand for.'' Not shirking his own responsibility, he
added, ``I feel somewhat like Fulbright says he felt about the
Tonkin Gulf resolution _ my deepest regret is that I did not fight
harder within the Embassy councils when I was there to press my
views.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War had not been lost yet, but it was turning sour.
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights concerns led the Carter administration to cut off
military aid to Guatemala in the 1970s, and Congress shackled the
Reagan administration's efforts to resume it. But it was too late.
The CIA would retain strong influence in relations with the
Guatemalan government, to the frustration of U.S. ambassadors, well
into the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. training and planning could not be taken back. ``The
Reagan administration wanted to pretend the officers were good
people, but it was the Kennedy and Johnson administrations that
gave them muscle to create a murderous machine,'' said Piero
Gleijeses of Johns Hopkins University, an expert on Guatemala.
``That's when the Frankenstein was created.''
</P>
<P>
   The monster was a response to a real challenge: In the early
1950s, Guatemala's Communist Party had played a major role in the
government of Col. Jacobo Arbenz, who had expropriated the lands of
United Fruit Co., imported arms from Czechoslovakia and mourned the
death of Stalin. A decade after his overthrow, Cuban-backed
guerrillas threatened to take the eastern third of the country and
assassinated a U.S. ambassador. After every defeat, the left came
back, exerting control in the labor movement and universities and
gaining tens of thousands of Mayan supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Long after its humiliations in the U-2 and Bay of Pigs fiascos,
the CIA continued reaching into its bag of tricks to assure that
its 1954 success would not become unglued. That meant flying
intelligence flights over guerrilla positions in the 1960s and
giving advice and financial support to known human- rights
violators through at least the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the saddest chapters of American relations with
Latin America,'' said Frederick Hitz, the CIA inspector general
from 1990 to 1998. ``The United States felt responsible for what it
started by removing Arbenz, and essentially we were trapped. We
started something and didn't know how to get off the train.''
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush cut off Washington's tiny military aid
program following the unexplained 1990 murder of an American
innkeeper near an army base. Even then the CIA continued to give
monetary assistance to the military behind the back of the State
Department. Two senior CIA officers lost their jobs after
Congressional intelligence committees found that the CIA station in
Guatemala was keeping human rights violations secret from CIA
headquarters and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Following an investigation of the matter, Anthony Harrington,
who leads the Clinton administration's Intelligence Oversight
Board, expressed bewilderment. ``The board asked itself: the Cold
War's over _ what are we doing down there?''

<P>
   TOURISTS-DANGER-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ The killing of tourists
by rebels in Uganda raises the questions of why weren't the
tourists warned that they were in a potentially dangerous region,
and were they crazy to be there in the first place? But the reality
is simple, and particularly relevant at a time of rising and
increasingly exotic global travel: Predicting danger for tourists
is a crap shoot, tour operators and foreign service officials say.
By Donald G. McNeil Jr. (`i' category). WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ The U.S. crime rate is
plunging, but its prison population is exploding. No matter how
much crime drops, the U.S. will still have to add the equivalent of
one new jail or prison every week for perhaps another decade,
federal officials say. Some even believe the prison boom could be
permanent, at least for another generation. A big the reason is
that so many of the new inmates are drug offenders. By Timothy
Egan. (`a' category). WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-POWER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Twenty years after the meltdown
at Three Mile Island, the nuclear industry has succeeded in ways
that were hard to imagine as Pennsylvania cowered in fear in March
1979 and plants around the country subsequently lost their luster
and scores of projects to build reactors were abandoned. The
industry is doing better now, ironically, because it is marching
ever faster toward extinction. By Matthew L. Wald. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   PBS-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ The recent flap over proposed format
changes in `Washington Week in Review' revived a nagging question:
What is the mission of public television these days, and who needs
it? The profusion of cable stations, some of which are doing the
sort of programming that Public Broadcasting could once call its
own, has sent the so-called noncommercial broadcasters into
something of an identity crisis. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-TIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Internet encompasses all
the world's time zones, making for a considerable amount of
incompatibility in transactions and other online activities. A
watch-manufacturing company, Swatch, is trying to introduce a
standard Internet time system. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   COUNSEL-TEXT-REVIEW (Washington) _ Last week the Clinton
administration completed a remarkable turnaround in its thinking
about the independent counsel law, which President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno persuaded Congress to renew nearly five
years ago. Excerpts from congressional testimony and other
statements illustrate the history of flipflops on the statute.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-NEWSPAPERS-TEXT-REVIEW (Toronto) _ It's not easy being in
the news business in Canada. You stare at juicy American stories
nearly every day while your own pages fill with curling scores and
wheat quotas. Oh, for a big, page one blockbuster! In February, a
Canadian newspaper thought it had a real scoop when it reported:
`U.S. believes North Korea would target Montreal for a nuclear
strike.' Excerpts on how the story played out.
</P>
<P>
   NONSTORIES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With the end of the century
approaching, Americans are making lists. Lots of lists. The Top 100
Films. The Top 100 Books. Now, a list of the top 100 most
unimportant news events of the century.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CREDITCARD-REVIEW (Undated) _ For Clinton, another
charge dismissed. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-FOREIGNPOLICY-REVIEW (Washington) _ For six years, the
Clinton administration and its critics have flailed about for some
grand Unified Field Theory of Foreign Relations _ something as neat
as the Cold War concept of containment to define priorities. Recent
U.S. actions on Kosovo and China have something odd in common: they
have come to mark the two extremes of the the administration's
struggle to bring coherence to U.S. foreign policy at a time that
often seems incoherent itself. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-CHINA-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Japan seemed resentful and envious
as it watched China's economy boom last year. Japan was suffering
its worst slowdown in more than half a century, and China was the
only Asian country to survive the regional economic crisis
enhanced. But now that China's economy is showing signs of frailty,
Japanese executives and economists are viewing that situation with
apprehension. By Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-WARCRIMES-REVIEW (Undated) _ While German scientists
conducted hideous experiments on concentration camp prisoners,
their lesser-known Japanese counterparts were waging full-scale
biological warfare and subjecting human beings to ghastly
experiments of their own _ on a far greater scale than the Germans.
Taking decades to emerge, the Japanese record of atrocities is
still producing revelations. The delay illustrates striking
differences in the willingness of the two former Axis allies to
come to terms with their past. It has also thrown a harsh light on
Cold War rivalries. By Ralph Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   GUATEMALA-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ When a Guatemalan truth
commission implicated the U.S. in the creation of a killing machine
that ravaged Mayan villages in the 1980s, it raised troubling
questions. How could a country that calls itself a beacon of
democracy link its military and intelligence agencies so intimately
to Guatemala's darkest reactionary forces? Some answers, or at
least clues, can be found in scores of declassified documents the
Clinton administration released to the National Security Archive.

   JAPAN-WARCRIMES-REVIEW (Undated) _ While German scientists
conducted hideous experiments on concentration camp prisoners,
their lesser-known Japanese counterparts were waging full-scale
biological warfare and subjecting human beings to ghastly
experiments of their own _ on a far greater scale than the Germans.
Taking decades to emerge, the Japanese record of atrocities is
still producing revelations. The delay illustrates striking
differences in the willingness of the two former Axis allies to
come to terms with their past. It has also thrown a harsh light on
Cold War rivalries. By Ralph Blumenthal.

   GUATEMALA-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ When a Guatemalan truth
commission implicated the U.S. in the creation of a killing machine
that ravaged Mayan villages in the 1980s, it raised troubling
questions. How could a country that calls itself a beacon of
democracy link its military and intelligence agencies so intimately
to Guatemala's darkest reactionary forces? Some answers, or at
least clues, can be found in scores of declassified documents the
Clinton administration released to the National Security Archive.

   RELIGIOUS-RIGHT (Undated) _ Twenty years after the Rev. Jerry
Falwell's Moral Majority Inc. propelled religious conservatives
into a heavyweight force in American politics, the movement is
struggling without a clear political strategy and, for the first
time, a debate has even erupted among leading figures over whether
they should radically scale back their political efforts. By

   MARKETS-FUTURE (New York) _ In recent weeks, leaders of both the
New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, the nation's over-the-counter
market, have confirmed that they are considering a wide range of
new alliances that they hope will transform their institutions into
the stock markets of the future. Their initiatives are driven by a
frenzied competition for America's stock-trading business. While it
is too soon to predict which design will triumph, individual
Americans have a big stake in the outcome. If the transformation
works as its advocates hope, it could provide investors, big and
small, with better service at lower prices. But if it goes awry, it
could damage a national treasure: a stock market whose strength and
fairness have attracted foreign capital, fostered the growth of new
businesses, and provided investment opportunities for an
unprecedented number of people. By Diana B. Henriques.

   ALGERIA-UNREST (Algiers) _ The savage war between Algeria's
military rulers and Islamic guerrilla groups has taken at least
80,000 lives since it began in 1992. The vicious civil strife
erupted after the shadowy group of generals who hold real power in
this nation of 28 million people canceled a second round of
elections that were on the verge of securing a parliamentary
majority for a militant Islamic party. But now, to the surprise of
many Algerians, the situation has eased. A presidential election,
scheduled for April 15, has come alive, with 11 candidates
representing an array of political opinions, and a promise from the
army not to rig the ballot, as it has in the past. By John F.

   LATEX-ALLERGY (New York) _ Over 10 percent of the country's
health-care workers suffer from latex allergy, an illness that was
almost unheard of just a decade ago. And experts said that the
numbers are probably higher _ as high as 17 percent _ among those
who work almost exclusively in hospitals and with patients' fluids,
such as nurses in emergency and operating rooms, since allergies to
latex get much worse from heavy exposure to the material over time.
The illness affects roughly three percent of the general population
and since the late 1980s, nearly 30 people have died from
latex-related illnesses, according to Food and Drug Administration
figures. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

   SPORTS-SEXHARASSMENT (Undated) _ In an odd twist, the rise in
reports of harassment by male coaches is acknowledged to be an
unanticipated byproduct of a landmark victory for women: Title IX,
the 1972 law barring sexual discrimination at schools that receive
federal money. As participation in organized women's athletics has
greatly increased, creating a need for thousands of new coaches,
the share of those coaches who are women has dropped: at the
college level, the percentage of female head coaches of women's
teams has fallen to 47.4 percent, from 90 percent in 1972.
Statistics on sexual harassment in women's sport are minimal.
Researchers in the field say that schools have been reluctant to
pool data for a national survey. And they add that the numbers
would be misleading anyway, because athletes, afraid of losing
their spots on teams, rarely report their coaches. By Robin Finn.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Whether or not Colombia's main
guerrilla group proves to have been responsible for the kidnapping
and execution of three Americans this past week, the deaths have
ignited a political controversy in Colombia that is likely to
inflict a major setback on efforts to negotiate an end to the
country's long civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office last summer, Andres Pastrana, the president
of Colombia, has sought to bring a peaceful conclusion to that war,
responsible for the deaths of more than 30,000 people in the past
three decades. Informal talks started in January, but immediately
bogged down, and analysts said that right-wing opposition to
Pastrana's conciliatory approach, already strong, is certain to
grow as a result of the killings of the three Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious blow to the peace process, if it is proved
that the killers of these three Americans were the guerrillas,''
Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, a former foreign minister, told the Bogota
newspaper El Espectador. Daniel Garcia Pena, the government's
former chief peace negotiator, added that ``this type of attack
strongly affects the support of the United States'' for the
incipient negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Ingrid Washinawatok, Lahe'ena Gay and Terence
Freitas were found Thursday, bound, blindfolded and riddled with
bullets, in a field on the Venezuelan side of the Arauca River,
which forms part of the boundary between Colombia and Venezuela.
The three had gone to Colombia last month as part of an
international campaign by environmental groups to prevent an oil
company from drilling on an Indian tribe's ancestral lands.
</P>
<P>
   Both Colombian police and leaders of the U'wa tribe the three
Americans were visiting have blamed the country's principal
left-wing guerrilla group for the kidnapping. As of Saturday,
however, the organization, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, had not acknowledged either abducting or executing the
Americans, and news reports in Colombia have raised questions that
cloud the issues of who could have committed the crime and why.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group is a classic Latin American insurgency,
Marxist-Leninist in political orientation and therefore deeply
suspicious of ``American imperialism.'' For that reason, ordinary
Americans, whether missionaries, scientists, reporters, tourists or
engineers, are often regarded as envoys of the Central Intelligence
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the region where the Americans were kidnapped is one where
right-wing paramilitary groups also have been extremely active in
recent years. Those heavily armed groups, which also have a history
of abducting and executing people they regard as enemies, oppose
the government's efforts to negotiate an accord with the rebel
group and have recently stepped up their actions.
</P>
<P>
   As Colombian news organizations have been quick to point out,
the gunmen who seized the Americans on their way to a provincial
airport on Feb. 25 wore masks and civilian clothes. That form of
dress is more typical of paramilitary groups than of the
guerrillas, who usually wear uniforms and use bandanas when they
wish to cover their faces.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Venezuela's new president, Hugo Chavez, who took
office last month, has shown clear signs of sympathy for the
rebels, elements of whose left-wing ideology he shares. Colombian
news reports Friday and Saturday noted that dumping the bodies of
the Americans in Venezuelan territory is an act that unnecessarily
alienates the Venezuelan government, as well as solidarity groups
abroad, and is not in the rebels' long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This turn of events is totally inexplicable,'' Garcia Pena
said in remarks to El Espectador. He noted that the killings came
at a time when both the guerrillas and the United States were
engaged in ``the delicate process of unfreezing relations.''
</P>
<P>
   It has never been clear how much control the central command of
the guerrilla group maintains over its regional fronts. But the
rebel units in the Arauca region, where the Americans were
kidnapped are led by the brother of the group's second in command,
lessening the likelihood that the kidnappings and executions, if
carried out by the rebels, were a renegade action.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the Colombian government, State Department
officials late last year met in Costa Rica with rebels. State
Department officials have defended the decision, describing it as
an effort to obtain information about the fate of three American
missionaries kidnapped in 1994 and the group's involvement in drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to them is the right thing to do,'' a State Department
official said recently. ``They are very intelligent and shrewd, but
incredibly naive, and we got a glimpse of how unsophisticated their
world view is on some issues.''

FREE TRADE IN FRESH WATER? CANADA SAYS NO TO U.S. COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Alaska, Calif.)  (fb) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ For just about as long as there has been a border with
the United States, some Canadians have believed that Americans
covet their country and the resources it contains.
</P>
<P>
   A few conspiracy subscribers still believe Washington harbors
ambitions about northern expansion similar to those that provoked
the first armed incursion into what is now Canada in the 18th
century. And a certain type of Canadian is sure that free-trade
agreements are a plot to make Canada a commercial colony of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one subject that leaves a broad range of even
normally clear-eyed and level-headed Canadians looking for American
subterfuge _ fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   From the thunderous torrent at Niagara Falls to the perpetually
rainy coast of British Columbia, Canada is awash in more fresh
water than almost any other place on earth. But although it
contains 20 percent of the world's known freshwater resources,
Canada believes it has little or none to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have often disagreed, and over the years entrepreneurs
have come up with grand plans to get their hands on some of
Canada's water. In the late 1950s, American engineers devised a
plan to dam part of James Bay and divert the water to the American
Midwest. A similarly grandiose concept from the 1960s would have
sent water from the Yukon and Mackenzie Rivers in western Canada to
the American West.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans were never realized, but inventive entrepreneurs
have recently pursued more realistic projects, involving huge
tankers that would be used to ship fresh water out of Canada. Vocal
public opposition pushed the Canadian government to impose a
temporary ban on the bulk exports of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just a commodity,'' Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy
said after announcing a temporary nationwide moratorium earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium will be in place until all 10 provinces, which
share jurisdiction over lakes and rivers with the federal
government, can come up with a way to ban water exports
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the anti-American card on everything from Cuba to
Canadian culture usually goes over big in Canada. But with water,
it can make Canadians uncomfortable because it makes them appear
unconcerned about people in the southwestern United States and
other parts of the world who are not blessed with an abundance of
water.
</P>
<P>
   So while opposed to water exports, some Canadians recently have
taken to framing the issue in different terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the United States is going to send up an army to
take our water,'' said Maude Barlow, chairwoman of the Council of
Canadians, a national citizens group with 100,000 members. ``I
don't think they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlow and Axworthy say they believe that unless something is
done, bulk fresh water could become a commercial good covered by
the provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and
therefore subject to continental exploitation. Bottled water is
already covered by the pact, but some Canadians fear that any
export permit issued by a single Canadian province or American
state for bulk water would make it a tradeable good throughout
North America.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, any attempt simply to ban water exports would
actually acknowledge that fresh water in lakes and rivers is a
commodity and bring it under trade-agreement regulations.
</P>
<P>
   While Barlow concedes that trumpeting the American threat is
still the most effective way to round up public support, she now
preaches a different message, one involving sovereign rights, and
the question of Canada controlling its own resources regardless of
trade-agreement terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s I did cast it in more of a U.S.-Canada light,''
Barlow said. ``But privatization and trade agreements are cementing
rights so clearly that governments are going to forfeit the right
to make decisions on this soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every Canadian worries about the country's water supply
being sucked dry by thirsty foreigners. While some Canadians are
horrified by the idea of shipping fresh water, others have been
busy figuring out ways to get as much water out as quickly and as
inexpensively as possible to California or any other place in the
world that wants to buy it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One company in Newfoundland, McCurdy Enterprises, wants to
``harvest'' about 13 billion gallons of crystal-clear water a year
from Gisborne Lake, an 11-square-mile lake in remote Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   The water would be carried by pipeline five miles to the coastal
town of Grand LaPierre, where it would be loaded onto scrubbed,
single-hull oil tankers that can no longer legally be used to haul
oil.
</P>
<P>
   McCurdy Enterprises also plans to open a water-bottling plant in
Grand LaPierre that will employ 150 people. Local officials support
the project, as did the province until federal officials from
Ottawa leaned on them to adopt the temporary ban on water exports.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nova Group of Sault Ste. Marie applied for and was
granted a permit from the Province of Ontario to skim off 158
million gallons of water a year from Lake Superior and ship it in
bulk tankers to Asia. After word leaked out about the company's
permit, a storm of public protest arose and provincial leaders
revoked the license.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, British Columbia actually gave six Canadian companies
licenses to export bulk shipments of water. One of the companies
formed a joint venture with an American firm to provide
drought-afflicted Goleta, Calif., with water.
</P>
<P>
   But long before any tanker could be loaded, the province
reversed itself and imposed a moratorium on bulk-water exports that
continues today.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia eventually compensated the Canadian company in
the joint venture for the business it lost, but a similar offer for
the American partner has never been completed. The American
company, Sun Belt International, recently challenged the Canadian
government under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, arguing its claim had been ignored because it is
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting the same treatment,'' said Jack B. Lindsey,
chairman of Sun Belt International, ``and what we got were
stalls.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlow worries that the Sun Belt claim could somehow be used by
U.S. officials to pry away Canada's water. But she is more
concerned about the one big bulk-water-export project in North
America that is moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Water Corp., a Canadian company, has a bulk-water
purchase agreement with the small Alaskan community of Sitka to
siphon off 5 billion gallons of water a year from the glacier-fed
Blue Lake and export it to China. There, local handlers will put
the water into five-gallon jugs for sale to China.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Global, Fred Paley, is a Canadian who founded the
local company that received the settlement from British Columbia
for the nullified export license. Lindsey of Sun Belt is a
shareholder in Global as well. Paley said he could not help but
compare his experience in British Columbia with that in Sitka,
where the local assembly has welcomed him warmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about water from remote areas, flowing into the
Pacific Ocean,'' Paley said. He says he thinks exporting water
would not hurt Canada at all and would aid people in other parts of
the world. He said the position opposing water exports taken by
British Columbia and Ottawa is just plain wrong. ``There's no
reason why we Canadians shouldn't be exporting it,'' he said.

WEST VIRGINIA TRIMS WELFARE, BUT POOR REMAIN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, Miss., Wis., Wyo)   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. _ They cannot fit many more people into the
St. John's Episcopal Church auditorium, where free breakfast and
lunch are available daily to the needy. In recent weeks, volunteers
have set up tables on the stage to accommodate crowds now reaching
250 a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the church, at the West Virginia Health Right free
clinic, doctors are tending to so many patients, about 12,000 a
year, that plans are under way for a new building, three times the
size of the existing one. Patricia H. White, the administrator,
said the doctors are likely to see 15,000 patients this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sojourners, a shelter for women and families near the clinic,
has been at full capacity, 75 people, for months. ``At times, we're
overwhelmed,'' said Margaret Taylor, the director. ``But we've got
fold-out cots, cribs, even dresser drawers for babies.''
</P>
<P>
   These scenes and others around West Virginia reflect what people
who provide services to the poor here regard as the unintended
consequences of the welfare overhaul, in which the federal
government shifted responsibilities to the states and the states
imposed time limits for people to find work.
</P>
<P>
   Since West Virginia's system was expanded from nine counties in
its first year, 1997, to all 55 last year, West Virginia has
achieved an impressive caseload reduction of 61 percent, ranking
fifth in the nation. But as one of the poorest states, where
unemployment is high and the national economic boom is little more
than an echo, West Virginia has performed much better in paring
welfare rolls than in helping people find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, the state's caseload reduction has been
achieved by knocking off the rolls the families of poor disabled
children who were receiving Supplemental Security Income, a federal
program for people with special medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   And in a system that requires people to find jobs after two
years of receiving assistance and sets a five-year lifetime limit
on benefits, little more than a third of former welfare recipients
have found jobs _ well below the national average of about 50
percent, recent studies show.
</P>
<P>
   While the caseload reduction has saved the state money _ $63
million through last year _ it has also left thousands of people
who were on public assistance, including many with minimum-wage
jobs, to depend on free community services for the barest
essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates say that West Virginia is carrying the
cost-cutting ethos of the welfare overhaul too far. Recent federal
data showed that West Virginia had proportionately more unspent
federal welfare dollars from savings, about 65 percent, than almost
all other states.
</P>
<P>
   But as state administrators debate how to spend the savings,
people are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are families out there in terrible shape, and we don't
know how they are surviving,'' said state Sen. Martha Y. Walker,
chairwoman of the Senate's Committee for Health and Human
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   And people who provide services here predict that conditions
will grow worse as more people lose benefits in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of devastated people out there,''
said Sandy McGrath, assistant director of Sojourners. ``The state
jumped in too quickly for people to meet the guidelines without
doing the research on how it will affect them. Five years looks
good. But then you have circumstances like the job search,
arranging child care, finding transportation. How are they supposed
to do all that?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White, the clinic administrator, said: ``In three to five
years, we will be having more women being arrested. The reason is,
they are not going to let their kids go hungry. So they'll steal,
and we'll build more prisons to house them.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the state Department of Health and Human Resources
say the declining number of people receiving welfare benefits
proves that the new system is working.
</P>
<P>
   But they concede they were unprepared for the wide discretion
they got when the federal government shifted responsibilities to
the states to run their own welfare systems. Facing no major
objections from Gov. Gaston Caperton, the out-going two-term
Democrat, from state lawmakers or even from the state's leading
service providers, welfare officials said they believed the program
they began developing in 1995, West Virginia Works, would work.
</P>
<P>
   But a lack of middle-class jobs, along with a recent court
challenge attacking the state decision to count SSI as family
income for determining welfare benefits, has prompted state welfare
officials to admit they need to re-examine their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our program still needs tinkering,'' said Jack B. Frazier,
commissioner of the Bureau for Children and Families. ``Some
counties simply don't have the jobs to apply for. The employment
base is not there.''
</P>
<P>
   To ease the transition off welfare, state officials included
several amendments to the new time limits, like allowing recipients
just entering the work force to earn income that is not used to
determine eligibility for cash assistance and offering a 10 percent
increase in welfare benefits to a couple if they are married as an
incentive to promote family stability.
</P>
<P>
   But people like Ms. White and Ms. Taylor argue that officials
did too little to ease the sting, underestimating some of West
Virginia's indigenous characteristics that work against reform,
like rugged terrain that makes transportation a problem, the large
number of families who have relied on welfare for generations and
the lack of programs that adequately prepare people with virtually
no work skills.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions have contributed to chronic poverty in West
Virginia, a state of 1.8 million people. Last year, unemployment in
the state was 6.6 percent, the lowest in 20 years but well above
the national average of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, West Virginia has been among the most aggressive
states in reducing the percentage of welfare recipients, ranking
behind only Idaho (85 percent), Wyoming (84 percent), Wisconsin (77
percent) and Mississippi (64 percent).
</P>
<P>
   But aside from the largest category of former recipients in West
Virginia _ 35.3 percent of people who found jobs _ the next biggest
reason for the decline was the consequences of counting SSI like
all other unearned income, including child support and veterans
benefits, as income.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal welfare law gave states the option to count SSI
in determining welfare support. Idaho was the only other state to
count it as family income, and a spokesman for the state Department
of Health and Welfare said it had no plans to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Here, that decision alone accounted for almost a fifth of the
decline in the number of welfare recipients, saving $16 million.
But it also prompted legal action against the state by two mothers
of children receiving SSI benefits. The mothers argued in a
class-action lawsuit in federal District Court that that benefit
for children was unrelated to the overhaul of the welfare system
and should not be counted as income.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Sanders, 35, an unemployed woman who is not involved in
the lawsuit, is typical of those who would be helped by it. She
said she lost $149 in monthly welfare benefits when the state began
counting her 13-year-old son's SSI benefits of $494 as family
income. ``Even with that, it was hard to survive,'' she said after
lunch at the church. ``Now, I don't buy myself anything, clothes,
tennis shoes or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a judge ruled against the state and directed
officials to submit an outline explaining how family income would
be determined without using SSI benefits for children.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier said the state was preparing to comply with the ruling,
and two state lawmakers have introduced legislation that would
eliminate all SSI benefits from welfare considerations, measures
that are expected to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring welfare benefits lost through SSI is one way the state
plans to disburse savings. Frazier said officials also intended to
spend $20 million to raise monthly welfare benefits for the first
time in more than a decade; $8 million to help job prospects who
need such basics as eyeglasses and false teeth, and $8 million for
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. White and others worry that those efforts could fall
well short of the need if welfare recipients are held to the new
time limits or if the state economy takes a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad,'' said Wanda Long, who has been assistant
director of the church soup kitchen for nine years. ``A lot of
these people have apartments, and some even work small jobs. They
can pay for rent. But they have no money left over for food or
personal items, like soap powder. We usually give them a small can
of food or a sandwich or a container with leftovers. Otherwise,
they wouldn't have any supper.''

STOCK MARKETS, FACING THREATS, PURSUE CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Threatened by competitors that are grabbing a growing
share of the nation's booming stock-trading business, the United
States' biggest stock markets are trying to transform themselves by
forming alliances with their foes and adopting some of their
practices.
</P>
<P>
   If the transformation works as its advocates hope, it could
provide investors, big and small, with better service at lower
prices. But if it goes awry, it could damage a national treasure: a
stock market whose strength and fairness have attracted foreign
capital, fostered the growth of new businesses, and provided
opportunities for many millions of investors.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the New York Stock Exchange, where traders have
met on a central trading floor for 207 years, has said it might
build or buy its own electronic trading network, where brokers or
customers could trade stocks _ especially popular stocks like Intel
or Microsoft _ that are listed on other exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market, an electronic marketplace linked by
telephones and computer terminals, has acknowledged that it is
discussing possible alliances with private trading networks. And
the largest such network, the Instinet unit of Reuters Group PLC,
said it had talked with both Nasdaq and the New York exchange about
alternative ways to trade stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts fear that the changes afoot will shatter the
existing marketplace into many smaller and more volatile markets,
making it harder for investors to be assured of the best price for
their trades.
</P>
<P>
   They also worry that as the New York Stock Exchange competes
with other trading networks, it will be less insistent on enforcing
the tough standards it imposes on companies that want to be listed
there. Those standards, such as requiring that a majority of a
company's board be independent outsiders, are intended to protect
shareholders and are stricter than federal securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the changes could put pressure on the U.S. market to
allow big investors to operate with greater secrecy, to the
disadvantage of small investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition is a good thing, but it can have some unintended
consequences,'' warned John Coffee, securities law professor at
Columbia University and a member of advisory committees at both the
New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dangers, market officials and professional traders
say that preserving the status quo is no longer an option. As
technology improves, investors are demanding faster, cheaper ways
to trade securities _ and if the United States' existing markets
don't respond to those demands, someone else will.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get in the way of the market,'' said Frank Zarb,
chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which
operates both the Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange. ``The old
methods of exchanging stocks just no longer meet the needs of the
investing community.''
</P>
<P>
   That community has undergone drastic change in recent years.
Unprecedented numbers of Americans are trading stocks, directly and
through mutual funds and pension plans. Moreover, they have easier
access to the markets than ever before, thanks to low-cost online
brokerage accounts, Internet investing sites and the new trading
networks. Finally, they and their counterparts abroad are more
readily investing far from home.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has touched off a stunning acceleration in the
competition among the institutions that provide stock-trading
services, said Richard Grasso, the chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange and the Nasdaq, not-for-profit associations
accustomed to competing only with one another, now face a plethora
of new private trading networks called electronic communications
networks, or ECNs. The owners of these trading services aim to
profit by providing an electronic meeting place where stocks can be
traded, and by collecting commissions on each trade.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the New York exchange, a leader in foreign stock
trading, is anticipating a foreign threat. Now that Europe has a
single currency, a pan-European stock exchange may soon emerge,
perhaps this year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this competition, which one legal scholar said had
become ``as contagious as chickenpox in the third grade,'' is
driving down the commissions that investors pay to trade.
``Competition can create confusion, but on balance, the individual
investor is being empowered,'' said Hans Stoll, a finance professor
at Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
   But that confusion is unsettling, many market participants said.
``The technology is the tail wagging the dog,'' said Scott Saber, a
former trader and senior vice president at VIE Systems, an
institutional software provider. ``No one is saying: `Is this the
best way? How will this impact the market?' They just say, `We can
do this and make money.'''
</P>
<P>
   His concern, while echoed by others, does not do justice to the
time that both the NASD and the New York exchange _ and their
regulators _ have applied to the question of building a better
stock market. But it does reflect how problematic their preliminary
ideas are turning out to be.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Take the New York Stock Exchange's consideration of building or
buying its own electronic network for trading stocks not listed on
the exchange. Grasso, the exchange's chairman, said he expected to
report his opinion on the proposal to the board by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Big Board readily trades stocks of companies that
have not met its tough listing standards, it may have more
difficulty enforcing those rules, Coffee said.
</P>
<P>
   And some of those standards provide important protections for
U.S. investors, he added. For example, the New York exchange
requires listed companies to have wholly independent audit
committees and a majority of independent directors _ neither of
which is required under federal securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso insisted that protecting the standards and reputation of
the exchange would be paramount as his board considered adding a
second trading service. ``You may well be asking the question that
causes us not to do this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in electronic communications networks was actually
encouraged by rule changes intended to improve the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules allowed electronic communications networks to post
orders from their customers on Nasdaq computer screens. Each time
one of these orders was filled through the Nasdaq system, the ECN
received a small commission.
</P>
<P>
   Those potential profits encouraged big Wall Street firms and
others to form their own private trading networks.
</P>
<P>
   There are now at least a half-dozen of these private networks,
which make it harder for even professional investors to find the
best trading prices. ``The concept of a central marketplace has
gone out the window,'' complained Victor Babin, senior vice
president and director of equity trading for Oppenheimer Funds. ``I
now have to check four, five, or even six different markets to be
sure I'm getting the best price.''
</P>
<P>
   Market fragmentation is especially onerous for amateurs, said
William Freund, a market economist at Pace University. Individual
investors may not realize that low commissions for online trading
may not make up for the extra money they can spend if they do not
find the best market price for their shares.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq is trying to knit its market together again. By the end
of the year, for example, the prices at which trades are conducted
on ECNs will be included in Nasdaq's consolidated price quotations.
</P>
<P>
   It has also proposed more sweeping changes that would
incorporate features of the Big Board's face-to-face trading floor
into Nasdaq's electronic environment. Specifically, Nasdaq dealers
would be able to electronically match up buyers and sellers, for a
fee.
</P>
<P>
   That would help Nasdaq compete with the electronic trading
services, a senior market official said. But the NASD, like the Big
Board, has also been discussing the possibility of joining forces
with some of those trading services, notably Instinet, to create a
new Nasdaq structure.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb, of the NASD, would not discuss the talks, but Douglas
Atkin, chief executive of Instinet, said the conversations had
grown ``more frequent and serious in the past six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Instinet and many of its counterparts now have a substantial
competitive edge. Unlike Nasdaq and the Big Board, they allow
investors to trade anonymously. Influential investors like Fidelity
Investments can sell a substantial amount of stock more easily if
others do not know that they are shedding shares.
</P>
<P>
   But some market experts worry that Nasdaq and the New York
exchange will be pressed to extend the same secrecy to large
investors, or risk losing trading volume to the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign competition could ratchet up the pressure, Coffee said.
Some foreign exchanges do not require stock prices to be reported
as promptly as in the U.S. market. Nasdaq prices must be disclosed
within 90 seconds; in London, the deadline is 24 hours _ a boon to
major investors but a big disadvantage to smaller players.
</P>
<P>
   Both Grasso and Zarb said they were confident that market
leaders and the Securities and Exchange Commission could preserve
the transparency and fairness of the U.S. marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But they emphasized that regulators must take ``a leadership
role.'' With an informal nod from the SEC, the NASD is recruiting a
committee of top Wall Street executives to study how the public
will be affected by these pressures, senior market officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Americans face the possibility that their market
leaders may still be working on the ark when the rain begins. What
happens if stock prices plunge, spreading panic among the ranks of
newly empowered investors, before the marketplace has finished
reinventing itself?
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, market leaders agreed, investors will stampede back
to the time-tested institutions _ the Big Board and the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a downdraft,'' said Zarb of the NASD, ``the trading
comes back to us.''

COMMENTARY: POLICING THE POLICE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., D.C.)   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The idea,'' said Mary Frances Berry, ``is to do a
responsible piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she is not interested in trashing the New York
City Police Department. She would like to get factual information
about the extent to which police officers brutalize or otherwise
abuse civilians, and then recommend ways to curb the misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   So on May 26 the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which Ms.
Berry chairs and which has subpoena power, will hold a public
hearing in New York into allegations of misconduct by the police.
The hearing will be part of a wider inquiry by the commission into
the way the Police Department conducts its business and the impact
that has on the community at large.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir will
both be expected to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said the commissioners were aware that it was
sometimes difficult to ``balance'' the tough work of crime-fighting
and the need to exercise restraint when it is appropriate. ``We all
want to be protected from abuse or criminal behavior,'' she said.
``But at the same time it is better for both the police and for
residents that the police are respected and that they carry out
their duties in a way that is not itself a source of abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand that something be done about police misconduct in New
York has intensified since Amadou Diallo, an unarmed man with no
criminal record, was shot to death last month in a vestibule in the
Bronx by four plainclothes officers who fired a total of 41 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will not be trying to get to the bottom of the
Diallo case, Ms. Berry said, but rather will look at the overall
picture of police-community relations in New York. The allegations
of misconduct have run the gamut from killings that were not
justified to the harassment of thousands of innocent civilians on
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see how many incidents the police have been
involved in and the kinds of complaints that have been made,'' Ms.
Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Civil Rights is a bipartisan fact-finding
agency of the federal government. ``We are not asked to go out and
investigate and punish someone,'' Ms. Berry said. ``What we get are
complaints from people who feel they have not been taken seriously
by government agencies when they originally complained. Our job is
to be a watchdog over the enforcement by government agencies of
people's civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said that as part of its inquiry the commission will
request _ and subpoena, if necessary _ documents and other data
from the city and the Police Department. ``We'll look at the
regulations concerning the use of deadly force, for example, and
the whole issue of external regulation or oversight of the
department. We'd like information on the recruitment and training
of police. We'll look at the demographics in the city and the
qualifications required for police officer jobs, things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's findings and recommendations will be sent to
the President and Congress, and will be made public.
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of a number of cities the commission is focusing
on. It will soon file a report on the Los Angeles Police and
Sheriff's Departments and will likely investigate police misconduct
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the early-1980s the commission published a highly regarded
report on police misconduct across the nation that was titled ``Who
is Guarding the Guardians?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of its recommendations are still germane. Departments were
urged to step up their recruitment of ethnic minorities and women,
to establish psychological testing programs to screen out
candidates predisposed to violence or racism, and to improve
training in the use of deadly force and its alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said, ``For almost 20 years now the debate about
police and citizens has emphasized crime prevention and punishment,
which is all one would expect when citizens are concerned about
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no room in the debate for a serious discussion of
police misconduct or violations of civil rights, she said. But now,
with crime rates falling, that may be changing. It may be possible
now for the complaints of many long years to finally get an honest
hearing.

DOLE IS UNSURE IF REBELS WILL SIGN KOSOVO PEACE ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds., see also KOSOVO-REBELS)  
(fb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Clinton administration's hope of moving the Kosovo
peace plan much closer to completion was frustrated again Saturday
when its special emissary to the ethnic Albanians, former Sen. Bob
Dole, told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright here that he had
failed to clinch a deal with the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, speaking after consulting with Albright, who arrived here
after a trip to Asia, was relatively upbeat, saying that he had
been promised an agreement by the ethnic Albanians by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook for agreement from what the administration had
viewed as the most pliant side in the Kosovo conflict remained
uncertain. A key ethnic Albanian guerrilla leader, Hashim Thaci,
skipped the Albanians' meeting with Dole in Skopje, Macedonia, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most embarrassing, Thaci, a 29-year-old commander of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, could not be found, even after what an
administration official called a scouting party was sent to look
for him in Tirana, Albania, where he was believed to be. Instead,
Dole said he had two telephone conversations with another senior
guerrilla leader, Jakup Krasniqi. ``I told them every day they
waited was a respite for Slobodan Milosevic, who caused the problem
in the first place,'' Dole said in reference to the Yugoslav leader
whose forces have been fighting the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks on Kosovo are due to resume in Paris on March 15. By
then, the administration would like to have the ethnic Albanians
signed on to a peace deal and have offered Milosevic a
take-it-or-leave-it proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by press criticism in the United States and Europe of
Albright's handling of the Kosovo peace effort, her closest aide,
James P. Rubin, volunteered a series of statements defending
Albright to reporters traveling with her from Indonesia to London.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin acknowledged that the administration had ``misjudged'' how
easy it would be to win the approval of the ethnic Albanians at
Rambouillet, France, where peace talks were suspended without an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that Albright was right to push ahead despite what
he called the ``hard work'' and plethora of players. ``The fact
that the secretary of state is not able to fully obtain an
agreement in a relatively short number of days for the people
who've been fighting _ violently for many months and politically
for many years _ shouldn't be considered a mistake by the United
States,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the criticisms in the European press were charges that
Albright, by threatening airstrikes against Milosevic without
following through, had diluted the credibility of NATO. Some
administration officials have essentially agreed, acknowledging
that the threat of airstrikes against Milosevic as a way of getting
him to sign the peace deal had considerably weakened in the past
week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration was likely to send an American envoy,
probably Richard Holbrooke, to see Milosevic in the coming week,
officials said. The timing, and defined purpose, of such a trip
remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   In the usual tangled pattern of joint American-European
diplomacy toward Milosevic, the European nations of the Contact
Group _ Britain, France, Italy and Germany _ were unhappy about the
prospect of Holbrooke visiting Milosevic, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ambassador Wolfgang Petritsch of Austria, one of
three negotiators at the Kosovo peace talks, said the Europeans
thought that Holbrooke ``could complicate things if he started open
negotiations'' with Milosevic on the peace plan. Petritsch worked
for months with the American envoy Christopher Hill to draft the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, the spokesman said, would prefer that Holbrooke
concentrate on the Yugoslav leader's violations of the agreement of
last October. Holbrooke personally negotiated that agreement, which
called for a substantial reduction of Milosevic's security forces
in Kosovo, a province of southern Serbia whose population is 90
percent ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, and a senior
European Union envoy, Hans van den Broek, are due to see the
Yugoslav leader on Monday in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Several Washington officials said it was likely that the
administration would let the Europeans troop in to see Milosovic
and that Holbrooke would be kept as a trump card.
</P>
<P>
   With the ethnic Albanians' refusal to sign a peace deal taking
the pressure off him, Milosevic has been building up troop strength
in southern Serbia, on the borders of Kosovo. In the province
itself, Serbian police and Yugoslav soldiers have been taken out of
their garrisons.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say these additional troops may be poised for an
offensive against the ethnic Albanians, or in preparation for NATO
airstrikes against the Serbs. They violate troop levels set by
Holbrooke last October, but for Milosevic are a useful way of
signaling his own strength. Serbia and Montenegro together make up
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic stripped Kosovo's Albanians of broad autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement with the ethnic Albanians, whose rebel army has
been fighting the Serbs for the past year, has been a linchpin of
the administration's strategy in Kosovo. Without the ethnic
Albanians' signatures on the plan for 28,000 NATO-led troops to
oversee a three-year period of autonomy for Kosovo, the
administration remains in a weak position to pressure Milosevic.

<P>
   PREKAZ, Yugoslavia _ Several thousand villagers swarmed across a
hillside in north Kosovo on Saturday to watch parades of the Kosovo
Liberation Army on the first anniversary of its open battles with
the security forces of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 rebel Albanian soldiers, in combat fatigues and
berets, rifles across their chests, marched behind the red Albanian
flag, emblazoned with a two-headed eagle. Flanked by black-clad
special security troops, the senior guerrilla commanders who
watched included one of the most elusive, Suleyman Selimi, known as
Sultan, who was appointed chief of staff of the rebel army last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians of Kosovo were commemorating the massacre a
year ago by Serbian security forces of a top rebel, Adem Jashari,
and his clan at their compound in this northern Kosovo village.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre precipitated a full-blown conflict between the
rebel army and the Serbian security forces who had kept a tight lid
on Kosovo since 1989, when Milosevic stripped the region of broad
autonomy. Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are ethnic
Albanians, but the province is dear to Serbs as the cradle of their
medieval empire.
</P>
<P>
   The police stormed this village at dawn a year ago, and battled
with armed fighters for two days. Jashari became an instant martyr,
and events here did more than anything to galvanize Kosovo's
Albanians into widespread revolt.
</P>
<P>
   In the week before the Prekaz clash, ethnic Albanians and the
Serbian police had battled in two nearby villages after rebels
assaulted a police convoy. That week is now regarded as the first
week of Kosovo's undeclared war. About 80 Albanians, including at
least 25 women and children, and six Serbian policemen were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Western threats of force against Milosevic, his security
forces launched a scorched-earth assault last summer to try to
quell the revolt.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a million people fled their homes under bombardment
and took refuge in the woods and hills. By year's end, 2,000 people
were dead and at least 100,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, formed in the mid-1990s to fight for
independence from Serbia, meanwhile swelled.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian men in Kosovo took up arms, grabbing World War
II rifles until they could capture or buy a new automatic weapon,
often supplied to the rebels over mountain tracks from neighboring
Albania. Abroad, the Albanian diaspora raised money.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the ragtag peasant army has changed beyond
recognition. It now appears akin to a real army, the men outfitted
in new camouflage uniforms, carrying new weapons, including
anti-tank grenades and automatic weapons, alongside the standard
AK-47 rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its commanders were trained in the Yugoslav People's
Army before the breakup of Yugoslavia. Some even saw active service
in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   One of the seven zone commanders in Kosovo, an officer known as
Commander Drini, is an example. The 38-year-old commander had spent
18 years in the Yugoslav army, becoming a captain teaching at the
military college in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign military observers in Kosovo say the guerrilla leaders
understand that they cannot win the war against the Serbian police
and Yugoslav army, who have tanks, heavy weapons and far more guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better that NATO come and control the situation,''
Commander Drini said recently. ``Like firemen, because we are
matches to the fire.''

LOS ANGELES VOTERS TO DECIDE OVERHAUL OF CITY GOVERNMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To a Midwesterner, whose idea of big city
governance is the Daley dynasty of Chicago, or to a New Yorker,
steeped in the strong-mayor legacy of a La Guardia, Koch or
Giuliani, the government of Los Angeles can sometimes seem as
quaint and collective as a Quaker meeting. Here, the mayor can't
even fire his own department heads, much less make them cry.
</P>
<P>
   But Angelenos cherish the Progressive-era protections of their
City Hall, in which mayoral power is heavily filtered through
civilian commissions that oversee major departments like police and
fire, and where the 15-member City Council has long shared
important elements of executive authority.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no small miracle last month when not one but two
separate commissions charged with recommending changes in the Los
Angeles city charter agreed on a set of proposals that would amount
to the most significant overhaul in the government of the nation's
second largest city since 1925.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the City Council unanimously agreed to put the
recommendations to the voters in June, even as some council members
vowed to campaign against the measure because it could diminish
their power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end is infinitely better than I could have hoped for,''
said Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of
Southern California who helped draft the constitution of Belarus.
He also led the charter commission that was elected by the voters
two years ago, after Mayor Richard Riordan pressed for such a move,
in an effort to head off a drive for secession by the suburban San
Fernando Valley. This commission had the power to put its
recommendations directly on the ballot, and they would take effect
with voter approval.
</P>
<P>
   But the City Council, which has feuded bitterly with Riordan, a
millionaire Republican businessman, for most of his six-year
tenure, appointed a rival commission, whose recommendations
required approval by the council itself before going to the voters.
For a time, it seemed likely that voters would face competing and
possibly contradictory proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after months of sometimes fractious debate,
arm-twisting and compromise, the two commissions backed a single
joint proposal, which won the grudging support of both mayor and
council.
</P>
<P>
   Under the unified plan, the mayor would have expanded powers,
including the right to dismiss municipal department heads, subject
to an override by the council. Now, the mayor may make such
dismissals only after a majority vote by the council. Riordan had
wanted the power to dismiss managers at will.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some advocates of increased local control wanted the
commissions to expand the City Council from its current size, in
which members represent districts of some 250,000 people each and
five different council members represent parts of the valley
enclave of Van Nuys, for example. But instead, the proposal gives
voters the option of leaving the council the same or adding up to
10 new members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the mayor's authority has been
increased to a degree,'' said George Kieffer, a lawyer and the
chairman of the appointed commission. ``But by the same token,
we've increased the council's authority in a way that has not
generally resonated, by taking a lot of the rules and
specifications out of the charter and leaving them up to the
council to decide by ordinance.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there were some interesting twists. At one point,
Riordan, angered that he had not won all he wanted from the
compromise proposal, threatened to back only the elected
commission's recommendations, and because he has the kind of deep
pockets needed to finance a public campaign, that threatened to
scuttle any deal. But under pressure from longtime civic leaders,
including former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Riordan
reversed himself and backed the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new city charter will help people hold Dick Riordan
accountable,'' Riordan told a state commission on local government
on Friday, ``and also the next mayor and the next mayor,'' adding:
``Secession is simply not the answer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An early effort by Chemerinsky to include a ``bill of rights,''
, an enumeration of civil liberties for city residents, including
``reproductive autonomy,'' was quickly caricatured as a kind of
tie-dyed manifesto likely to unite a wide range of potential
opponents, and the idea was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``In part, I think it reflects the fact that it would be very
difficult to get the Bill of Rights itself passed today,''
Chemerinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading voices of discontent in the valley, the
Valley Industry and Commerce Association, threatened to oppose any
charter that did not call for creating an independent citizens'
commission to draw new City Council districts.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise plan would leave districting in the hands of the
council. But even this group now says it will take another look at
the proposal, and has not ruled out an endorsement, said its
chairman, Steve Lew.
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge for charter advocates: winning the support of
a majority of voters in a low-turnout municipal election in which
apathy often rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters have to be made aware of what this is and why they have
a stake in it, and why this is going to be better for the city,''
said Bill Carrick, a political consultant who works for Riordan and
expects to help sell the new charter this spring. ``That case has
to be made to the voters, and if it's not made in a serious and
aggressive way, the forces of the status quo will nit-pick it to
death.''

A NEW GAFFE, AND CANADIAN MOUNTIES PUT THE FORCE UNDER INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A casino license awarded in British Columbia last
December has triggered two sensitive police investigations. One led
to a raid on the home of the province's premier, Glen Clark, by the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The other is forcing the Mounties to
look at themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mounties' commercial-crime unit showed up at Clark's
East Vancouver home Tuesday night with a search warrant, a local
television news crew taped everything, including a frazzled-looking
Clark pacing inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This leaves the Mounties looking very insensitive and
authoritarian,'' said Paul R. Tennant, a political scientist at the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver. ``In my view they have
much to explain at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The video clip was broadcast on local television and across
Canada, triggering a political scandal in which calls for Clark's
resignation have already been heard. Clark, premier since 1996,
says he has done nothing wrong and will not step down.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Henley, a police spokesman in Surrey, British Columbia,
made it clear that ``it is not Clark who is under investigation.''
The police target is the local businessman, Dimitrios Pilarinos,
who won the license to open a charity casino. Clark has said he
played no part in reviewing the license application of Pilarinos, a
neighbor who built an addition to the premier's house.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's lawyer has accused local media of smearing the premier,
and Clark's supporters are angry at the police, who they believe
tipped off a local reporter about the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Henley denied that the police tipped off anyone, but he said an
internal investigation was launched anyway to determine if there
had been a leak.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Jackson, managing editor at the local television station,
BCTV, said there had been no tip. One of his reporters had covered
a raid earlier that day, Jackson said, and was playing out a hunch
that there would be another raid at the premier's house.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they sold the right to use their widely recognized
image to the Walt Disney Co. in 1995, the Mounties remain among
Canada's strongest, and usually most highly respected, symbols.
</P>
<P>
   But this is just the latest in a string of questionable
incidents that have tarnished their reputation. Most recently, the
police were harshly criticized when they admitted that they set the
bomb that blew up a gas well shed in Alberta. The explosion was
intended to flush out the person responsible for a series of
similar explosions but some Canadians questioned the force's
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to the Mounties' image, a public inquiry is
still proceeding in Vancouver over the way they handled student
protesters at an international economic conference in 1997.
Television crews caught the police subduing the students with
pepper spray, and the videotape has been replayed repeatedly on
national and local television.
</P>
<P>
   And the police were humiliated in 1995 when an intruder bypassed
guards and wandered around Prime Minister Jean Chretien's home in
Ottawa for half an hour before Chretien threatened him with a stone
carving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians are coming to grips with the fact that the RCMP is
not an infallible institution,'' said Allen Seager, director of the
Center for Canadian Studies, at Simon Fraser University. ``The role
of the police force is being reassessed on a wide front.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald E. Sparks, executive director of the RCMP Veterans
Association, said he does not believe the recent controversies have
dimmed the reputation of the Mounties in the minds of most
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get criticized but so does the FBI, so does the Secret
Service,'' said Sparks, who retired in 1982 as a staff sergeant.
``They're policemen, that's all. And they sometimes become handy
scapegoats for whatever goes on.''

<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ When President Clinton visits
Central America this week, he will witness a region forged by one
tragedy or another over the last several decades and, more often
than not, forgotten in its intervals of renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The president is to open a four-day visit to El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala on Monday, the day after
Salvadorans vote on a new president and further cement a remarkable
democratic transformation after 12 years of civil war that left
more than 70,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a miracle what's happened here,'' said Anne
Patterson, the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with the clamor of the 1980s, when the region's
upheavals dominated U.S. foreign policy, that change has occurred
nearly silently. Instead, it has taken one of the worst natural
disasters to rampage through the hemisphere in modern times _
Hurricane Mitch late last year _ to refocus attention here.
</P>
<P>
   With this visit, many Central American experts agree, Clinton
has a chance to engage the region once again _ with increased aid,
trade preferences and protected status of Central American
immigrants, for example _ and to nurture young democracies that
emerged only recently from armed conflicts and that remain fragile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, do we use this moment of political stability
to help strengthen the countries so they don't suck us back into
the whirlpool?'' said Robert Pastor, former national security
adviser for Latin America under President Carter, who now teaches
at Emory University in Atlanta. ``We still have the responsibility
to ensure that these small and vulnerable countries stand on their
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to the Cold War concerns that drove Washington's
interest here a decade ago, Clinton's agenda for this visit will
reflect the global issues of today _ free trade, immigration and
drug trafficking, in addition to repairing the damage from
Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   But past interventions and traumas still color the region's
relations with the United States. And they are especially likely to
confront Clinton in places like Guatemala, where just last month a
truth commission blamed Guatemalan military regimes assisted by
Washington for acts of genocide against that country's Maya
population during a 36-year war.
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping the armies of El Salvador and Guatemala wage
wars against guerrilla forces, the United States financed the
counterrevolutionary war against the Sandinista rebels, who took
power in Nicaragua in 1979, using Honduras as an operational base
for the contras.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who first visited the region in 1997, when he met with
Central American leaders in Costa Rica, will travel with Hillary
Rodham Clinton and on Monday and Tuesday will tour areas devastated
by the hurricane in Nicaragua and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to give the major address of the visit before El
Salvador's legislative Assembly on Wednesday, and then travel to
Guatemala for a round-table discussion on that country's moves for
peace on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he will meet with the presidents of the four
countries, and leaders from Costa Rica, Belize and the Dominican
Republic, at a summit conference in Antigua, outside Guatemala
City, before heading home.
</P>
<P>
   Of the previously war-torn areas Clinton will visit, El
Salvador, a country of about 5.8 million, has moved the furthest
toward consolidating peace. The former guerrilla movement, the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, is now the country's
leading opposition party, boasts the second-largest bloc in the
national assembly and controls a large and growing number of
mayoral posts, including the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The governing Nationalist Republican Alliance, a party founded
by extreme-right-wing leaders associated with death squads, has
undergone a remarkable transformation of its own and now accepts
the left's gains and negotiates with them on all levels of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the working-class neighborhood of San Jacinto,
several thousand euphoric supporters of the former guerrilla party
marched down a street past auto-body shops and hot-dog vendors,
waving red flags and chanting revolutionary slogans, though it was
clear that the change they sought would come only through the
ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   On a stage set up a few feet from the presidential offices here,
two former guerrilla commanders, Facundo Guardado and Nidia Diaz,
addressed the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be indifferent,'' Ms. Diaz, still going by her nom
de guerre, told them, closing out the campaign on Wednesday and
urging supporters to turn out for the vote, which her party is not
expected to win. ``It's your future, it's what's going to happen to
El Salvador, what is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   But peace has not come easily to this country. Since the 1992
political settlement that ended the war, U.S. aid to El Salvador
has dropped dramatically, as it has in the rest of the region, to
$34 million a year compared with $292 million in 1992 and more than
$500 million at the peak of the conflict, U.S. Embassy figures here
show.
</P>
<P>
   The country heavily relies on remittances sent home by
Salvadorans who left during and after the war and now live in the
United States. That money, an average of about $85 million a month,
or more than $1 billion a year, forms El Salvador's largest source
of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the possible deportation of some of the 1.2
million Salvadorans estimated to be living in the United States is
at the top of El Salvador's agenda for Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they are seeking legal status for
about 200,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans in the United States. But
a temporary suspension of deportation proceedings against
undocumented Salvadorans and Guatemalans _ whose numbers surged
after Hurricane Mitch _ expires Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's deputy chief of staff, Maria Echaveste, said last week
that the administration saw no need to extend the grace period,
because ``the countries can absorb the return of illegal
immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Zablah-Touche, El Salvador's minister of economy,
disputed that view and said his government would push for inclusion
of Salvadorans in the amnesty benefits granted to Nicaraguans in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are poor, small countries that have suffered internal
conflicts and now have had a decade of doing things right,''
Zablah-Touche said in an interview. ``But it's costing a lot and we
need a hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The help Central American governments uniformly want, and
contend best serves the interests of both sides, is a free-trade
agreement that would extend to Central America the benefits Mexico
receives under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration announced last week that it was
seeking temporary enhancement of the Caribbean Basin Initiative
program for textile and apparel Central American products as
another way to deal with posthurricane recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But the countries say that free-trade-agreement parity is
crucial to compete with Mexico for foreign trade and investment and
to generate jobs, and the topic is sure to dominate discussions at
the regional summit meeting with Clinton in Guatemala.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``These countries have undertaken in the last five years big
reforms _ reducing inflation, trying to put their house in order,''
said Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development
Bank in Washington. ``It'd do a lot of good if they had more
investments and more exports, and that's why cooperation with the
United States is extremely important.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of Clinton's trip, though, is to survey firsthand the
damage caused by Hurricane Mitch, which killed at least 9,000
people, left thousands more missing, mostly in Honduras and
Nicaragua, wiped out export crops, wrecked roads and wells and
caused damage estimated at $7 billion to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The president has asked Congress for $956 million in emergency
reconstruction funds for Central America and for the Caribbean
countries damaged by Hurricane Georges, in addition to about $300
million already spent on disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said their relief package also includes
a deferral of $600 million in interest payments for Honduras and
Nicaragua, the two severely indebted countries in Central America,
with an external public debt of $3.7 billion and $6.2 billion
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary assessment by international financial institutions
found that Hurricane Mitch affected about one quarter of the total
population of the four countries in one way or another. A sharp
fall in exports like bananas and coffee is expected, while
inflation, unemployment and fiscal deficits are sure to rise, the
institutions said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now people are trying to decide whether they're going to
move to Costa Rica or the United States or whatever, or whether
they think they might have a livelihood for themselves in their own
country,'' the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development, Brian Atwood, said at a news briefing in Washington
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency comes at a time when the countries are still
grappling with the political and social effects of the violence
that ripped apart their societies. More than nine years after their
civil war ended, Nicaraguans remain divided to the point of
paralysis on economic and political issues.
</P>
<P>
   In El Salvador, one of the highest crime rates in Latin America
is attributed to the availability of arms after the war, the number
of former combatants without jobs, and the disintegration of
families, which caused many children to grow up without one or both
parents.
</P>
<P>
   But the aftermath is starkest in Guatemala, where a war of over
three decades caused more than 200,000 deaths and disappearances
and the exile or displacement of thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   Many Guatemalans and Central American experts say Clinton, who
is visiting at a critical moment in the efforts to maintain peace,
should give his unequivocal endorsement to carrying out peace
accords brokered by the United Nations in 1996 and bringing war
criminals to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Some also advocate that Clinton acknowledge U.S. support of
repressive armies and offer an apology in light of the truth
commission's report, which recommended that Guatemala's president
and guerrilla leaders, who have regrouped as a political party, ask
the forgiveness of all Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a National Security Council spokesman, said he
could not rule out that Clinton would not address the matter. ``We
have to acknowledge the past but also work toward the future,'' he
said. ``We're trying to move forward to deal with issues of the
future.''

HANDFUL OF STATES STILL TAX THE POOR AND THE VERY POOR
</HEADLINE>
  
(Attn: N.J., Kan., Miss., Ky, Ala., Hawaii, Ill., Va.)  (fb) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After seven years in which surging revenues have allowed 41
states to cut taxes, 19 states continue to tax the incomes of those
below the federal poverty line, according to a study by a
Washington research group. Six of those states, including New
Jersey, tax people who have so little money that even if they
doubled their income, they would still be officially classified as
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, two more states, Kansas and Mississippi,
revised their income tax laws to exempt the poor, according to the
study, by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit
organization that studies how government policies affect low-income
people.
</P>
<P>
   Taxing the incomes of poor people at a time when governments are
trying to move people off welfare and into work illustrates how tax
policies can create obstacles to welfare reform. Most people
leaving welfare find only low-income jobs, often just the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, changes in the tax system can help efforts to move
people off welfare and into work,'' said Scott Mackey, chief
economist for the National Conference of State Legislatures. ``That
is why a handful of states have adopted or expanded their earned
income tax credit program, to provide more of an incentive to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Nichols, an author of the budget center's study,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Income tax relief,'' Nichols said, ``is one of the simplest
ways states can help low-income working families to meet the costs
of child care, transportation and other expenses and thereby become
self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky imposes the heaviest income tax burden on poor
families, followed closely by Alabama and Hawaii, the budget center
said. Kentucky taxes the incomes of families of four making as
little as $5,000. A family making the federal poverty-line income _
which was $16,655 last year for two parents with two children _
paid $550 in Kentucky income taxes last year, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Jim Wayne, a Democrat, said Kentucky had a
progressive tax system in the 1940s, when the state first taxed
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, because taxes haven't been adjusted for inflation for a
half-century, Kentucky's system is regressive,'' Wayne said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone earning $19,000 would pay Kentucky income, sales,
property and other taxes equal to 10.5 percent of income, he said,
compared with only 8.2 percent for someone earning $214,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky is tripling its standard deduction over three years as
part of a strategy to reduce the income tax burdens on the working
poor, said Melissa Forsythe, press secretary to Gov. Paul E.
Patton, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, which has passed some of the biggest tax cuts in the
country over the last few years, is another of the six states that
tax people making less than half the poverty line. The other states
are Alabama, Hawaii, Illinois and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In Trenton, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and Joseph V. Doria
Jr., the minority leader, have sponsored a bill that would remove
200,000 low-income people from the state income tax roles. Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman has said she supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first time in recent decades that a majority
of states exempted the poor from their income tax systems, the
budget center said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 42 states with an income tax, the budget center said, 23
now exempt families of three or four whose incomes are at or below
the official poverty line.

U.N. TO USE PEACE-PRIZE MONEY FOR MONUMENT TO PEACEKEEPERS
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Almost 11 years after winning the Nobel Peace
Prize for its peacekeeping efforts in trouble spots around the
world, the United Nations has finally decided to spend the money on
a monument commemorating all peacekeepers who lose their lives on
duty and has invited Sweden and Norway to help select a design.
</P>
<P>
   The organization tentatively plans to erect the memorial on the
esplanade outside the visitors' entrance to its New York
headquarters, thus making it accessible to the public, said
Assistant Secretary-General Alvaro de Soto, who is in charge of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thinking of something very sober, not at all flashy or
innovative,'' said de Soto, who hopes the memorial can be finished
at the latest by next year's millennial General Assembly. The heads
of state of all the countries in the world are being invited to
come to the United Nations for that celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden and Norway were asked to propose a short list of possible
designs because Alfred Bernard Nobel, the inventor of dynamite and
founder of the prizes that bear his name, was himself a Swede.
However he entrusted the awarding of his Peace Prize to Norway,
which was then governed by Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope to speed up the process of choosing a design
after the United Nations had spent so much time trying to decide
what to do with its prize money, which thanks to compound interest
has grown from $339,000 to around $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly we didn't want the design issue to get buried for
another decade in the United Nations committee system,'' said
Shashi Tharoor, executive assistant to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan. But the final decision on which design to choose will be
Annan's.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish government has nominated Bo Grandien, director of
the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Art, to the two-member jury that
will select a short list of possible designs. Norway's nominee is
Per Boym, who heads Copenhagen's Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   De Soto said the United Nations has created a number of
guidelines for the judges. It has ruled out an eternal flame,
largely because the city of New York is worried about a potential
fire hazard. It has also excluded any kind of fountain because of
the cost of maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The monument will not carry the names of the roughly 1,580
military and civilian peacekeepers who have died on active service,
to avoid the awkward problem of whether to include those who died
from natural causes _ or in drunken driving accidents.
</P>
<P>
   After the original Nobel Peace Prize check was handed to the
secretary-general at that time, Javier Perez de Cuellar, on Dec.
10, 1988, at a ceremony at Oslo University, the world organization
found it could not agree on how to use the money.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of
peacekeeping, the United Nations said it would give a specially
designed crystal medal to the family members of all peacekeepers,
civil and military, who died on active service, paying for them out
of its own funds rather than the Nobel Prize money.
</P>
<P>
   But there will not be any presentations for a while. Under U.N.
procurement rules the organization must get bids from many crystal
manufacturers before it places a bulk order.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Myiot, the French-born director of peacekeeping, throws
up his hands in Gallic despair. ``How long will it take? That's
what I keep asking myself. I have no idea.''

WASHINGTON TALK: MOTIVATION FOR FIXING SOCIAL SECURITY POLITICAL
NOT PRACTICAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Without any changes, the Social Security system
will remain solvent well into the next century. So why are the
politicians here, who normally put off difficult decisions as long
as possible, tackling the subject now in the absence of a crisis?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, most economists and social policy analysts believe that
acting now is the responsible course to take. Ultimately, they say,
a crunch is bound to arrive because so many baby boomers will be in
retirement, and the sooner the shortfall is addressed, the more
gradually the remedies can be applied and the less painful they
will be.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason President Clinton and the Republicans who control
Congress are seriously talking this year about the herculean task
of overhauling the Social Security system has almost nothing to do
with long-term responsibility and almost everything to do with the
politics of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when economic forecasters unexpectedly began
projecting large federal budget surpluses, Republicans eagerly
began to discuss ways of returning this money to the public in the
form of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, the president played his wild card. The issue,
he asserted, was not, as Republicans maintained, whether the
surplus should go for tax cuts or government spending. Rather, he
said, it was whether the money should be used to give tax benefits
to the wealthy or to save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans knew they could not win that argument. The most
popular government program ever created in this country, Social
Security was begun by Democrats during the New Deal over Republican
opposition, and it has been the Democrats' strongest suit ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Clinton has triumphed and Republicans have been
badly burned every time he has created a contest between Social
Security and Medicare on one hand and tax cuts on the other.
</P>
<P>
   So Republicans took another tack. They proposed strengthening
the system by allowing workers to invest at least some of the
Social Security taxes withheld from their paychecks in private
stock market accounts that would be preserved for their retirement.
This meshes the public's infatuation with the booming stock market
and the Republicans' ideological preference for a private
retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is now joined. And as counterintuitive as it seems,
since no sword is hanging over their heads, the president and
congressional leaders seem committed to try to pass the most
sweeping legislation in terms of the number of people affected
since at least the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and possibly since the
Great Society era of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But two immediate problems are standing in the way.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the crucial matter of how burdensome and
politically distasteful it will be to put Social Security on sound
footing depends in large part on how big the shortfall in the
financing will be and when it will appear. That in turn depends on
how well the economy and the stock market perform over the next
generation. And no one can predict that with any confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the Clinton administration and the
Congressional Budget Office were projecting large budget deficits
indefinitely. But the economy has been so strong that forecasts
show a surplus of about $4.5 trillion over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, Social Security actuaries projected in the
spring of 1997 that Social Security reserves would be insufficient
to pay benefits in 2029. The economy over the next year was so much
stronger than anticipated that, last April, the actuaries pushed
the date back by three years, estimating that the system would
remain sound until 2032.
</P>
<P>
   The economy was even stronger in 1998, and it is a safe bet that
the date of insolvency will be extended even further when the
actuaries make their 1999 report next month.
</P>
<P>
   An even more difficult problem politically is that the ultimate
solution to Social Security's long-term financial difficulty will
require higher taxes, lower retirement benefits or both. So far,
neither side has been willing to concede that.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, in fact, have not agreed on a specific Social
Security proposal. At the request of Rep. Bill Archer, D-Texas, who
heads the House Ways and Means Committee, Kenneth J. Kies, a
prominent tax lawyer and lobbyist who is the former chief of staff
of the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation, is drafting a
measure for Republicans in the House to use as a starting point.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the Republican plan would use the budget surplus
to give workers a tax cut if they invested in stocks and bonds in
private retirement accounts within Social Security. If the market
improved, their retirement benefits would increase.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the market turned sour or they made bad investments,
workers would be guaranteed that their retirement benefits would
never be lower under the new Social Security plan than under the
current one. So they could invest, not risking a dime.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like an unrealistic free lunch, it is. But
Clinton and his allies can hardly complain. The proposals he made
in his State of the Union message _ using most of the surplus to
pay off the national debt and transferring bonds from the general
treasury into Social Security reserves _ are just as misleadingly
pain-free.

WEEKS OF BOMBING LEAVE IRAQ'S POWER STRUCTURE UNSHAKEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS and TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Next week, an American diplomat named Frank
Ricciardone will take on a new job. His mission is as simple as it
is difficult: unify the fractured Iraqi opposition, topple Saddam
Hussein and build a democratic nation from the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been pursuing the same goal on
three tracks: bombing Iraq in a slow-motion war, succoring the
opposition with words and ideas, plotting to subvert the pyramid of
soldiers and spies that supports the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the United States has been striking Iraq from
the air for 10 weeks now, and this week American planes loosed the
biggest barrage of bombs since December. At last count, American
and British jets have bombed Iraq on 30 separate days _ roughly
every other day _ since Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The jets have struck at least 104 targets, 4 more than they hit
during the major American and British barrage over four days last
year, damaging or destroying surface-to-air missile sites,
anti-aircraft artillery, radar towers and communications centers.
In a report to Congress on Wednesday, President Clinton said Iraq's
air defenses had been ``degraded substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are working to do is to help create the political and
military conditions that will permit a successful change of the
regime,'' said Walter B. Slocombe, under secretary of defense for
policy,
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon officials are among the first to acknowledge that
bombs alone cannot topple Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The American military commander in the Persian Gulf region has
said repeatedly that the task of creating a legitimate alternative
to Saddam appears hopeless for now, given the disunity of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the hope for a coup rests on the impact of the tons of
bombs falling on Iraqi military sites. But allies of the United
States in the region, especially Saudi Arabia and Turkey, are
increasingly impatient with the American program of bombs and
bombast.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no clear evidence so far that the bombings have
eroded Saddam's power structure, best envisioned as a pyramid of
perhaps 100 trusted men, sitting atop half a million soldiers,
spies and political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Ricciardone, the State Department official named
to the newly created position of policy coordinator, has said he
envisions a sudden demise for the regime in Iraq, a country he does
know.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, during the Iran-Iraq war, he helped try to
normalize relations between the United States and Iraq. He was
second-in-command of the shuttered American Embassy after the 1991
Persian Gulf war, working out of Amman, Jordan and London.
</P>
<P>
   He is one among many in the administration who sees political
thunderclouds gathering over Saddam, though no one will predict
when a storm might occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most likely, there will be a military coup,'' he said this
past week in an interview with a newspaper in Ankara, Turkey, where
he is ending a stint as deputy chief of the American Embassy. ``It
will be very sudden and without warning.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which confirmed the content of his
remarks, said Ricciardone could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger,
said that Saddam's repeated efforts to shoot down American or
British jets over Iraq showed his weakness, not his strength. ``His
ineffectiveness in stopping us has undercut him to some degree,''
Berger said in an interview. The challenges are meant ``to
demonstrate his power,'' he added. ``Instead he looks
ineffectual.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official said that Saddam is ``nervous
and off-balance.'' Another official, who also spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said: ``We think we see Saddam flailing. We
are working toward a slow whittling-down of his power, his
authority and his nerves. There are reports of military guys
perhaps not following orders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not spent a penny of a $97
million fund created by Congress to finance Iraqi opposition, one
indication of its thinking about the likelihood of its success.
</P>
<P>
   There is understandably some revulsion in the Arab world about
superpowers plotting insurrections in the region. Few in the
administration have any idea who or what could succeed Saddam,
except perhaps chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of these sensitivities, the administration has
tried to draw as little attention as possible to the air strikes. A
week ago, in a major foreign policy speech nearly 7,000 words long,
Clinton devoted one sentence to Iraq and said nothing about the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, too, is giving out less and less information about
the bombing, withholding the familiar grainy videos of attacks and
refusing to discuss the damage in detail. Military officials say
their silence is an effort to minimize sympathy that might be
generated in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. military official said the bombing of Iraqi
communications sites and command centers appears to have reduced
the central government's ability to communicate effectively with
military units.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said, ``The morale of Iraqi air
defenses is pretty low.'' It is not so low, however, that Iraqi
radar operators have refrained from tracking American planes and
giving pilots the justification they need to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pounding, there are signs Iraq is able to recover.
In his report to Congress this week, Clinton said Iraq had repaired
an oil refinery that had been damaged in December's raids. The
refinery has resumed generating illegal profits for Saddam's
government. A senior administration official said Iraq had also
``made an effort to reconstitute'' military facilities destroyed in
the raids as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says it is trying to balance risks against rewards.
The delicacy of that balance was clear last week when American jets
attacked two radio towers that the Pentagon said relayed messages
to Iraqi air defenses but that also, it turned out, controlled the
flow of oil through Iraq's pipeline to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who arrived for a
week-long visit to the Persian Gulf region, indicated publicly that
the strikes on the towers were a mistake. ``We're very sensitive to
that and we want to make sure we don't disrupt the flow of oil
going into Turkey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By disrupting the U.N. program that allows Iraq to sell oil for
food and medicine, the United States had handed Iraq a public
relations victory, officials and diplomats said, creating some
sympathy for the suffering of ordinary Iraqis and building some
momentum for an end to the attacks. ``It's really one of those
traps Saddam's trying to draw us into,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest trap would be losing an American pilot. The Pentagon
has increased the number of helicopter-borne emergency rescue teams
dispatched to the region, standing by to dart into Iraq on a rescue
mission should a plane go down.

CAPE COD TOWNS ARE PROTECTING LAND
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass.)  (fb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDWICH, Mass. _ A half mile east of Quaker Meeting House Road
and just south of the Midcape Highway are two well-paved roads that
lead to nothing, a situation that delights Sandwich town officials.
</P>
<P>
   Using most its share of a new Cape Cod fund to preserve
undeveloped land, the town will buy 275 acres, blocking
construction of 75 large houses that the two roads were supposed to
serve. The fund, called a land bank, was approved by Cape Cod
voters last November to help the Cape's 15 towns buy and protect as
much as possible of their undeveloped land. It is financed by a 3
percent surtax on local real estate assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping the towns limit further residential and
commercial building, money from the land bank will help them
preserve well sites and rain-water collection areas for badly
needed fresh water on the rapidly developing Cape.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Carbonell, executive director of the Cape Cod
Commission, the Cape's regional planning body, which led the fight
to establish the land bank, said it was not intended to block all
new construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be more development and there should be,''
Carbonell said. ``What the commission and the towns need is a
better tool to help control that building and retain the quality of
life that has made the Cape a magnet for so much new construction.
The land bank helps do that.''
</P>
<P>
   About 38 percent of the Cape's 412 square miles have been
developed. Another 28 percent had already been protected, leaving
about 34 percent still available to the towns or the developers.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwich, on the northwest corner of the 70-mile-long peninsula,
will receive $726,000 from the land bank this year and will use
about $625,000 of that for the 275 acres, which is the largest
single use of land-bank money so far.
</P>
<P>
   The surtax will raise about $8.8 million this year and the state
will make a one-time contribution of $15 million. Each town's share
of the land-bank money will be the amount that the surtax raises on
its real estate assessments. The surtax will add between $50 and
$60 each year to most property owners' tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   The acreage that Sandwich is buying adjoins the privately owned
Round Hill Country Club's 18-hole golf course, which the town
expects to buy with a private loan, and pay off with green fees.
Both parcels will be joined with the 500-acre Maple Swamp, a
conservation area with hiking trails, which the town already owns.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Teehan, chairman of the Sandwich Board of Selectmen, said
that the two parcels were the largest area of privately owned land
left in the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now those 75 houses won't be built, and with the golf course
and Maple Swamp, we'll be able to keep 1,000 acres clear of further
development forever,'' she said. ``And I'm happily telling you
that, thanks to those land-bank funds and matching state money, the
town won't have to levy any additional taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the town of Orleans has used land-bank money to buy
eight acres of prime forest that could have been developed and the
town of Barnstable bought 25 undeveloped acres of well sites near
Cotuit.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Cape's 15 towns have appointed committees to study
the best use of their land-bank money.
</P>
<P>
   The Town of Truro's committee has proposed buying land that will
provide more well sites for its water and for a green belt along
Route 6. Provincetown expects to use land bank money to help buy 25
acres near Shankpainter Pond, which had been approved for
development. Included is a rare quaking bog that is the habitat of
several species of exotic plants and some unusual animals.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past decade the permanent population of Cape Cod
has been increasing by at least 5,000 people a year. The population
now exceeds 205,000, a number that more than doubles when tourists
arrive in the summer. Every drop of fresh water on the Cape must
come from wells that must be replenished yearly by rain collected
at open sites.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, developers obtained permits to build 2,226 houses,
one of the largest numbers of annual permits on record for the
Cape. In 1998, traffic engineers counted more than 34 million cars
and trucks crossing the Cape's two bridges in both directions,
nearly double the number that crossed in 1978. And the hydrologists
are now predicting that by the year 2020 more than 10 million
gallons of fresh water will have to be added to each day's supply.

NATHANIEL SAMUELS, EXPERT ON THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY, DEAD AT 90
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nathaniel Samuels, an investment banker who served as
deputy under secretary of state for economic affairs during the
Nixon administration, died at his home in Manhattan on Tuesday, his
family said. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels, who had been an early proponent of global markets and
was instrumental in helping revive international finance in Europe
and the United States after World War II, was named to the position
of deputy under secretary in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chicago, Samuels graduated with a bachelor's degree from
Harvard University in 1930. After studying law privately, he
practiced law in Chicago until 1942, when he entered the Army.
</P>
<P>
   It was Samuels' wartime experience that led him to abandon his
law career for the world of international finance. He spent one
winter in the vaults of the Bank of France, studying the dossiers
of German industrialists to help determine how best to help Germany
after the war. He served as a first lieutenant and later joined the
Mission for Economic Affairs for the U. S. Embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Samuels joined Sofina, an international investment and
engineering firm in Brussels. He took a leave of absence in 1952 to
work for the Mutual Security Agency in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels joined the New York investment firm of Kuhn, Loeb &AMP; Co.
in 1955 and headed its international business. He was responsible
for bringing the first loan for the government of Mexico to the
international capital market in 50 years. He became the firm's
managing partner in 1966 and returned after he resigned from the
State Department in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels became chairman of the Louis Dreyfus Holding Corp., a
New York commodities firm, in 1973. He also served as a director of
numerous companies and as chairman of the U.S. operations of the
Olivetti Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels was also a member of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington and chairman of the executive
board of The Washington Quarterly, a journal of international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Dr. Mary Hyman Samuels;
two sons, Geoffrey, of Manhattan, and Neil, of Doylestown, Pa.; two
sisters, Gertrude, of Beverly Hills, Calif.; and Shirley Rife of
Chicago; and two grandchildren.

DR. FRANKLIN S. COOPER, 90, RESEARCHER IN SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Franklin Seaney Cooper, a pioneer in speech research whose work
was later applied to computerized speech synthesis, died on Feb. 20
in Palo Alto, Calif., where he lived. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his work was theoretical and seemed arcane. But in 1973,
he served on a panel with five other experts who were asked to
investigate the nature of the 18{-minute gap in a tape made by
President Richard M. Nixon in the Oval Office, which became a part
of the Watergate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Cooper's career was mostly dedicated to less
well-known research. Born and raised on a farm in Robinson, Ill.,
and educated at the University of Illinois, where he got his
bachelor's degree, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
where he earned his Ph.D., Cooper first worked for General Electric
in Schenectady, N.Y., as a research engineer, then left it in 1935
to join Caryl P. Haskins in founding the Haskins Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   At Haskins in the 1950s, he played an important role in
developing an electromechanical machine to synthesize speech. He
wanted to codify how speech was perceived and understood and how
noise and distortion affected the understand of it.
</P>
<P>
   He did extensive experimentation with speech patterns. His
approach enabled Cooper and his colleagues to determine which
elements in speech carried the information needed for
understanding. He also analyzed how words were formed and the
relationship between the gestures people make and phonetics.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Cooper served under Vannevar Bush,
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's science adviser, as head of the
liaison office of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research. His
wartime service earned him a certificate of merit from President
Harry S. Truman in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as a consultant to the United Nations on atomic
power, and was involved in the postwar years in the effort to bring
atomic energy under international control.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper taught approaches to phonetics at both Columbia
University and the University of Connecticut and maintained a
research affiliation with Yale University. He was given an honorary
doctorate by Yale and was elected to the National Academy of
Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He married Frances E. Clem in 1935; she died in 1991. Among his
survivors are two sons, Alan Kent Cooper of Palo Alto and Robert
Craig Cooper of Amherst, Va.; four grandchildren; and two
great-grandchildren.

 &HT;    Faith healing questioned in Colorado woman's death
 &HT;    By Shannon Joyce
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Rather than take her grandmother to the
hospital before she died, Jana Colosimo watched members of her
grandmother's church pour a mix of bleach and water over her bed
sores and then cover them with lard and gauze.
</P>
<P>
   Colosimo's grandmother, a member of the General Assembly and
Church of the Firstborn, had fallen, probably breaking her hip, but
the church's strong belief in spiritual healing and the rejection
of medical help for the sick kept her from seeing a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Colosimo and her sister, Deborah Davis, said they respected
their grandmother's desire to live without medical care, but said
they believe she would have gone to a doctor before her death if
church members had not kept such a close watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A simple, medical technique could have taken care of it,''
Davis said. ``I believe she would have been alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The same may be true for a Clifton infant who died last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa County Sheriff's Department is investigating the death
of Warren Glory, the 18-day-old infant son of two church members.
Paramedics were called to the Glory home Feb. 28, after Warren went
into cardiac arrest. He died at St. Mary's Hospital that night of
pneumonia and bacterial meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Prell, a sheriff's department spokeswoman, said
authorities suspect the child did not receive medical care for his
illnesses because of his parents' religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa County Coroner Rob Kurtzman said both diseases are ``very
treatable'' with a course of antibiotics and hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters said Warren's situation is not unique within the
church. Members do not seek medical attention for any type of
illness or receive immunizations against childhood diseases,
Colosimo said, leaving the children of the congregation susceptible
to health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, Colosimo said many members still go to the dentist, visit
eye doctors, and sometimes use birth control pills or
over-the-counter pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   Their grandfather, Marion Paul Brown, was one of the founding
elders of the Grand Junction branch of the church. After his death
in the 1960s, both Colosimo and Davis severed their ties to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said she decided when she was still in grade school that
she wouldn't stay with the church because of the reliance on faith
healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at that young age, I knew I couldn't live with that
tenant,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Because their mother married outside the church, both Colosimo
and Davis received medical care throughout their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Colosimo said she believes her grandfather would have embraced
some of the modern medical advancements that have been developed
since his death, especially in the case of children.
</P>
<P>
   The church derives its belief in healing prayer from a passage
in the New Testament. The verses, outlined in a pamphlet from a
church member called ``General Assembly and Church of the
Firstborn: Who We Are and What We believe,'' come from the fifth
chapter of the book of James.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the
church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the
name of the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the prayer of the faithful shall save the sick and the
Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall
be forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   Before their grandmother died, Colosimo and Davis said her house
filled with members of the church, who prayed and anointed her with
oil. As her pain grew more intense, Davis said she helped her
grandmother hide pain medication from the church elders.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Encyclopedia of American Religions, the
90-year-old church does not have paid clergy, and a loose
organization of church elders lead services and other church
activities. No official membership rolls are kept, and researchers
estimate the church has about 30 congregations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the church does not have trained faith-healers like
those found in Christian Science, but uses the church elders to
pray for the sick and anoint them with oil.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Christian denominations that do not believe in
medical treatment, the church has faced several court battles over
the death of its young members.
</P>
<P>
   The church has been investigated three times on the Western
Slope:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1982, 14-year-old Travis Drake died after his appendix
ruptured. Drake had been sick for about a week with stomach cramps,
but a coroner's jury ruled his parents did not realize the extent
of his illness and they were not prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1987, Luck Long died 10 hours after he was born in a
difficult, at-home breech delivery.
</P>
<P>
   _ The parents of Angela Sweet, a 7-year-old Delta girl who died
in 1990 five weeks after her appendix burst, received a three-year
deferred sentence and probation for her death. The court also
ordered the parents to report any life-threatening situations for
their other 10 children.
</P>
<P>
   Under Colorado law, a parent can be prosecuted for the death of
a child if medical care was not provided, even for religious
reasons. Mesa County District Attorney Frank Daniels said the law
clearly states that if a child is in a life-threatening situation,
the parents must seek medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Faith healing is recognized as medical treatment under the law
if the fees are allowed to be deducted as medical expenses by the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or if insurance companies recognize
the expense as reimbursable, and if the treatment has a success
rate equal to that of regular medical care.

 &HT;    Universal, Disney vie for summer supremacy
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Everyone worth their mouse ears at
Disney World knows that this summer will belong to crosstown
competitor Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   So both Disney and Universal are gearing up for the summer with
new additions. Let the games, and fun, begin!
</P>
<P>
   Don't eat until AFTER you try these thrill rides.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Universal opens a $2 billion expansion that includes a
22-ride theme park called Islands of Adventure. And while Disney
has more of almost every-theme-park-thing, it's lacking thrill
rides.
</P>
<P>
   Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain are fun, sure _ when
you're 10. Disney will open a coaster at Disney-MGM Studios in
June, but Universal tops that with two new monster coasters.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's ready to go with two monster roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
   The Incredible Hulk Coaster has 100-foot loops and a top speed
of nearly 60 mph. The Dueling Dragons roller coaster features
tracks that also take speeding riders up to 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The two roller coasters have three near misses, coming within 12
inches of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Another hotly anticipated Universal ride is the Adventures of
Spider-Man, combining a ride with filmed 3-D action, live actors
and special effects.
</P>
<P>
   The 110-acre Islands of Adventure is made up of five sections.
Seuss Landing and Toon Lagoon will appeal to elementary-age kids
while their older brothers and sisters will head to thrill
ride-filled Marvel Super Hero Island and The Lost Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Jurassic Park is an animatronic-filled area based on the Steven
Spielberg film and featuring an interactive water ride that
involves five-story dinosaurs and an 84-foot plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Why go all the way to Portofino, Italy, when you can go to a
sort-of-exact replica at Universal? The 750-room Portofino Bay,
which opens this summer, has a spa and eight themed restaurants and
lounges arranged around a bay like its sister city in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The new Islands of Adventure, and CityWalk's
restaurants/shopping/nightclubs will double Universal's size.
</P>
<P>
   Now open at CityWalk is Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, the new,
relocated Hard Rock Cafe and concert venue, NASCAR Cafe, Bob Marley
cafe, The Groove nightclub, CityJazz and Pat O'Briens.
</P>
<P>
   Open in April is Motown Cafe, Emeril's Restaurant, Pastamore and
Latin Quarter plus a dozen specialty shops including All-Star
Collectibles (sports), Fossil, Cigarz, Tabasco Country Store and
The Universal Studios Store.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-screen Universal movie theater opens in May and an NBA
restaurant this summer.

 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSET WEST, South Africa _ The partners move through the
bustle of an upscale mall in this Cape Town suburb, shaking hands
and calling greetings.
</P>
<P>
   One is a black man, Bantu Holomisa, 43 and elegantly dressed in
a tailored suit. Most of the customers are white and pass without
recognizing him. Those who stop are usually black and dressed in
the uniforms of maintenance men and salespeople. They clasp
Holomisa's hand as if he were a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him is a white man, Roelf Meyer, 51, who is natty too,
and often talking on his cellular phone. Meyer was once the golden
boy of the National Party, which ran the former white supremacist
government. But these days, he and Holomisa are trying to do
something never done in South Africa: build a new multiracial
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need you, man,'' Meyer says to an eager white customer, who
pumps his hand.
</P>
<P>
   When Holomisa and Meyer first teamed up they largely were
dismissed as a curiosity _ odd bedfellows who had each been forced
out of his own party. But one recent poll suggests they already may
have won over as much as 9 percent of voters. That is twice the
goal they set when they formed their United Democratic Movement
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even they seem a little amazed.
</P>
<P>
   They operate on a shoestring. Neither takes a salary. They have
only seven paid employees in their national office. In the mall,
they are trailed by volunteers handing out photocopies of their
fliers. One clutches a half dozen of the party's yellow baseball
caps. It is all they can afford to give out.
</P>
<P>
   They have just come from doing 15 minutes on the local radio
station. The studio is a small glass enclosure near a grocery store
in the mall and the noise of the shopping carts could be heard
through the walls. Children came up to the glass and made faces at
them as they talked. But they were smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UDM is about uniting the country,'' said Holomisa. ``It's
about creating a new political home for those who are not
satisfied. It's about narrowing the gap between the haves and the
have-nots because as you know we have this unfortunate past. Roelf
and I were at one stage opponents, but we are working together
now.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the Holomisa-Meyer team _ Holomisa is the party
president and Meyer is his deputy _ to win South Africa's second
post-apartheid elections, which are scheduled to take place June 2.
But suddenly they seem like contenders to push aside the crumbling
former National Party and the Zulu-focused Inkatha Freedom Party to
become the biggest opposition party. Political analysts are
wondering whether they might have the potential some day to
challenge President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 elections, the National Party won about 20 percent
of the vote; the Inkatha Freedom Party about 10 percent. But polls
show a sharp drop in their support, perhaps by as much as half. The
only other opposition party that is growing at the moment is the
liberal, largely white-supported Democratic Party, which won about
2 percent of the vote in 1994. Polls show it may now win 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Feb. 24 found Holomisa to be the
third-most-popular politician in the country, behind President
Mandela and his heir apparent, Thabo Mbeki. Mbeki is virtually
assured the presidency if the African National Congress, as
expected, wins the elections.
</P>
<P>
   But putting together a new party in South Africa is not easy.
While the established parties get public campaign money based on
the number of seats they have in Parliament, the United Democratic
Movement gets nothing. Raising funds from corporations or
international donors has yielded little, both candidates say. For
the time being, Meyer says the African National Congress seems
unbeatable and Mandela's moral authority looms so large that there
is little interest in an opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Both Holomisa and Meyer are outcasts from their former parties,
the African National Congress and the National Party, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Both are often called boyish. Holomisa has a mischievous kind of
charm while Meyer seems as straight an arrow as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Holomisa was once one of Mandela's proteges and a member of his
Cabinet. But in 1996, in a spectacular fall from grace he was
drummed out of the African National Congress for insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   Holomisa's sin was to continue to repeat allegations of
corruption against other party officials. But the final straw
appeared to be when he disclosed that Mandela had accepted a large
campaign contribution from Sol Kerzner, a casino owner who was
under investigation for bribery. Holomisa began his career in the
army in Transkei, one of the apartheid-era enclaves carved out for
blacks and called homelands. In 1987, as a young major general, he
led a bloodless coup taking over from notoriously corrupt
officials. Then, in defiance of the South African government, he
allowed the outlawed African National Congress to operate in his
territory.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he was capable of colorful, if questionable,
statements. But these days, Holomisa, is more polished and often
funny. He criticizes the African National Congress for failing to
deliver on housing, crime, jobs and medical care. Sure, he says,
there is free treatment at health clinics for young children. But
go there and there is only one kind of treatment _ Panado, South
Africa's Tylenol. ``You get the Panado, whether you have ear
problems, eye problems or you are vomiting,'' he deadpans.
</P>
<P>
   He gives the government credit for delivering on new license
plates. ``They have done that,'' he says. ``I give them credit for
that. In the Eastern Cape, where I come from, we have changed them
three times since 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issues, the United Democratic Movement offers a little
for everyone. The party has outlined an anti-crime strategy that
includes having a referendum on reinstituting the death penalty.
Many blacks support the death penalty even though the African
National Congress has been adamant in its opposition.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the United Democratic Movement opposes
affirmative action, which is a stand many white voters would
appreciate. The African National Congress has passed legislation
making affirmative action programs mandatory. On employment, the
United Democratic Movement would have the government more actively
involved in job creation. For the time being, the governing party
is counting on market forces.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys indicate that the United Democratic Movement has
attracted supporters from across South Africa's racial spectrum
roughly in proportion to the breakdown in the population. At the
same time, they also show that large numbers of voters still do not
know much about the party.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As Holomisa and Meyer moved through the mall, many of those who
stopped to talk to them were intrigued by their partnership. ``It's
so good for the country, if it can work,'' said John Lombard, a
retired teacher who was having coffee with his wife, when Holomisa
approached. ``Others have people of color but not like two leaders.
This is a new breath of air.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer resigned from the National Party, now called the New
National Party, in 1997. Trained as a lawyer, he had been a key
player in negotiating the country's peaceful transition to a modern
democracy and then in the writing of its new constitution. But his
belief that the National Party had to, in effect, dissolve itself
and try again was too much for many of the old-timers. He soon
found himself sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of handshaking, baby-kissing campaigning Americans are
so used to is new here. But Holomisa shows clear signs of getting
the hang of it. Meyer still looks shy, particularly when the
twosome moves from the mall to an area outside where black workers
congregate.
</P>
<P>
   Holomisa does little to bail him out and laughs at his partner's
awkwardness. ``It doesn't matter,'' he says generously. ``Because
the people respect him.''

 &HT;    Daring, dramatic circus vaults, tumbles into Disney's world
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Cirque du Soleil's new show at Disney World is a
daredevil circus _ and its nerves of steel extend all the way to
the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Adult tickets are $59.89 (kids 3 to 9 cost $47.92) for the
nearly two-hour Cirque show, La Nouba, created just for Disney.
That's nearly $18 more than a one-day ticket to any of Disney's
four theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high price, Disney workers quiz the crowds
leaving the Cirque show La Nouba with a five-page survey that
includes: ``Was it worth the money?''
</P>
<P>
   And so far, price seems to be no object. Since the Dec. 23
premiere _ 10 shows each week _ La Nouba has played to 90
percent-plus capacity crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price has not been a consideration,'' says Karl Holz, Downtown
Disney vice president after seeing initial survey results.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest question seems to be ``What was your favorite
act?''
</P>
<P>
   Was it the woman doing a one-arm handstand atop the head of a
man walking a high wire three stories above the stage?
</P>
<P>
   Or the teen girls flipping Chinese yo-yos with dizzying
precision while tumbling over and under one another?
</P>
<P>
   Or the shirtless Russian, muscles stretching, straining, his
arms like wings as he ``flies'' by simply hanging on to red cloth
banners?
</P>
<P>
   This sophisticated circus is a far cry from P.T. Barnum. There
are no freaks, tiger tamers or human cannonballs. In La Nouba,
circus athletes star with cutting-edge lighting, exotic costumes
and live music that runs from techno to light opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is possible here,'' says Carmen Ruest, La Nouba's
artistic coordinator. ``We are dream sellers.''
</P>
<P>
   La Nouba plays at the 1,671-seat theater built especially for
Cirque at Downtown Disney West Side, which also features
restaurants such as the Wolfgang Puck Cafe and nightclubs including
The House of Blues.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first stand-alone theater for the Montreal-based
Cirque du Soleil (Circus of the Sun), which also has shows at two
Las Vegas hotels. This spring seven different Cirque shows will be
running around the world including Alegria, opening near Biloxi,
Miss., at the Beau Rivage casino/resort. As Quidam tours Europe,
Saltimbanco tours Australia. A new show begins a three-year North
American tour soon in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   La Nouba at Disney is set to run 10 years with new acts rotated
in regularly. The show is written and directed by Franco Dragone,
who's created 10 of Cirque du Soleil's 11 shows since '84. He was
inspired by his 17-year-old son Luca's coming of age. La Nouba is a
French term (faire la Nouba) meaning to live it up, to party.
</P>
<P>
   There is no literal storyline. Dramatic visual symbols let you
create a story much as color and shape let you interpret a
painting.
</P>
<P>
   La Nouba is Mad Max meets Timothy Leary as marching columns of
drab, identically dressed ``urbanites'' are contrasted by the color
and flair of those playing on trapeze, high-wire and trampolines.
</P>
<P>
   There are also tricks on bicycles and savvy clown skits. A door
and frame raised 34 feet above the stage offers an aerial show.
Performers locked into giant wheels spin, turn, dodge and dance
with each other.
</P>
<P>
   When Disney targeted Cirque du Soleil as a can't-miss Downtown
Disney adult attraction, Guy Laliberte, Cirque du Soleil
co-founder, feared sharing creative control. But Michael Eisner,
Disney CEO, had a simple offer: We'll build the theater, you build
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Disney owns the $27 million theater made to resemble a
futuristic circus tent. Cirque built the $13 million La Nouba with
a cast of 66 performers. The partners split profits through the
12-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe's pied piper is Laliberte, a pony-tailed, high school
dropout who worked Quebec streets playing accordion, stilt walking
and eating fire before forming Cirque 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Laliberte is Cirque du Soleil's creative boss. Co-founder Daniel
Gauthier runs the business side. After surviving the early days
touring Canada with an 800-seat tent and a $1.5 million Canadian
government grant, the men broke into the U.S. market with a 1987
show that stunned critics at the Los Angeles Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, 18 million people have seen Cirque du Soleil shows
in 120 cities.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1,500 people on the Cirque payroll including 435
performers from 30 countries. Salaries run from a beginner's
$21,000 to a veteran's $175,000. Besides liberal health insurance,
each show is staffed by a masseuse/physical therapist and a
chef/nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of employees is just smart business, says Americas
division general manager Jacques Marois from his Montreal office.
``It's very grueling to work for Cirque du Soleil. This is no Club
Med. It's really, really tough on the performers to do what they do
10 times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   While falling backward three stories to a trampoline, and
popping back to ``walk'' up the side of a building may look easy,
it isn't. The heaving chests of the lean, muscled performers taking
bows tell you how tough each act is.
</P>
<P>
   Finding talent is Cirque du Soleil's ongoing drama. Cirque
talent scouts recruit retired gymnasts, tumblers and other athletes
in the hopes they can be taught theater.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Henderson, 27, is a recent hire for La Nouba. The
Bloomington, Minn., native, a five-time teen-age national
trampoline champion, describes his 1997 Cirque audition as ``Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every little thing you could think of,'' he recalls.``I had
people standing on my shoulders. `Can you tumble?' And then came
dance. That was toughest for me and it was for Debra Brown,''
Cirque's choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing she said was `Show me you.' I was afraid of
that,'' he laughs. ``I don't even remember what I did but I just
started going. You can't be shy about doing what they ask. Knowing
that, I just went for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly learned Cirque du Soleil's No. 1 obsession: quality
control.
</P>
<P>
   Every show has a resident ``guardian of the concept'' and
another cross-checker who visits regularly such as artistic
director Chantal Tremblay a former Cirque dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come in, I'm fresh,'' she says, ``I will look at the
show and see, whoops, we're missing timing, that focus isn't
right.''
</P>
<P>
   From obsessive quality control to a guy who can do a handstand
on a stack of eight kitchen chairs, the survey says that this show
is worth $59.89.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' says Downtown Disney's Holz. On those after-show
surveys, he says, ``you hear comments like `That's the best
entertainment bargain I've ever gotten', `It was worth every penny
of it' and `I've got to figure out how I can come back again and
real soon.'''

 &HT;    Disney debuts: Test track thrills, rockin' coaster, `Fantasmic!'
show
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ So far, Epcot's General Motors Test Track is
known more for the glitches that keep closing it down than for its
high-speed thrills. It is open now for what Disney calls ``sneak
previews,'' but won't officially open until March 17.
</P>
<P>
   Disney Imagineers and GM engineers based this ride on various
proving grounds and test tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The 5 1/2-minute ride's payoff is the final minute, the
high-speed test that takes riders at a top speed of 65 mph with a
50-degree banked curve. You get plastered against the set with the
kind of G-force rush that creates roller coaster fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   But this ain't Space Mountain or Busch Gardens' Kumba. It's a
very brief thrill that usually comes after a very long wait.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend more than an hour shuffling in a ``pre-show'' line
that snakes through a large, very bright testing garage with
videos, noise and news about how cars are tested.
</P>
<P>
   When you get to the ride, it's a convertible following a track
through a building. You and five other passengers experience
various tests such as hill climbing, braking, suspension and ride
handling. It's bumpy, zig-zaggy and even hot and cold when you go
through a temperature tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   This part of the ride creates a strong feeling of been-here,
done-this. When you seem ready to crash into a big door, you may
recall a similar near-crash on the defunct Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
</P>
<P>
   But give the designer a shrewd award. The coolest part of the
ride, the speed test, takes you on a track that wraps outside the
front of the Test Track building. With mirrors, those waiting in
line see you fly past and it cements them in the line for the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   Test Track replaces GM's World of Motion (1982-96).
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Movies is the third of Disney's lowest priced resorts
at $74 to $104 a night (depending on the season). Half the rooms
are ready now with the other half available in April.
</P>
<P>
   From check-in to the food court to the gift shop to the rooms,
the new Movies Resort mirrors neighboring All-Star Sports and Music
Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Each All-Star resort has 1,920 rooms, and the buildings are
located near Disney's Animal Kingdom. The icons that define the
Movies Resort include three-story statues of Pongo and Perdita from
``101 Dalmatians'' and Buzz Lightyear from ``Toy Story.'' The
resort's 10 buildings have themes related to other Disney movies
including ``Mighty Ducks,'' ``Fantasia,'' and ``Love Bug.''
</P>
<P>
   The main pool is a Mighty Ducks theme with a giant hockey mask.
A kiddie pool features ``Fantasia'' water spouts and accompanying
symphony. Proving that Disney does not lack confidence in its
films, the Movie Resort's theme includes ``Fantasia 2000,'' due in
theaters at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   One new twist at Movies is soap/shampoo dispensers instead of
bars in the showers. (Just like a truck stop restroom.)
</P>
<P>
   The food court is a series of theater marquees such as Rialto,
Lyric, Grand. There's a bakery. Breakfast is $5 to $6 per person
with lunches a few bucks more. You can eat dinner _ pasta, pizza,
burgers _ for under $10.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasmic! is a new outdoor stage show behind The Twilight Zone
Tower of Terror at the Disney-MGM Studios. The 6,500-capacity
Hollywood Hills Amphitheater is filled _ half seated, half standing
_ an hour before the 7 p.m. show each night. (Show times can change
with park hours.)
</P>
<P>
   This is a good show if you invest as little time as possible
waiting. (Many late arrivals get the VIP rows that are empty at
showtime.)
</P>
<P>
   Against the night backdrop, Fantasmic! is performed on a big
stage sandwiched between a 1.9-million gallon moat and a man-made
mountain. You'll see Mickey Mouse's imagination under assault by
every famous Disney villain from Cruella de Vil to the Lion King's
Scar.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the audience who don't know there's a storyline,
this is simply a parade of Disney characters. The 25-minute show
includes 50 performers on cliffs and the waterway, fireworks,
music, thunder and lightning. A highlight is seeing a film
projected on a ``screen'' of spraying water.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasmic! premiered at California's Disneyland in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Rock 'n' Roller Coaster opens late summer at the
Disney/MGM Studios. It'll be Disney's second roller coaster. Space
Mountain at the Magic Kingdom is the first. The new indoor roller
coaster will take you on the road with a rock band rushing to a
recording session. The band, promised to be one we've all heard of,
will provide original music that goes with the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin, an interactive Magic Kingdom
ride, is great for mid-kids (age 8 to 12).
</P>
<P>
   Two kids (or adults) ride and shoot in an ``XP-37 space
cruiser'' that you can make spin in a full circle. You want to spin
because to your right and left are targets both riders are trying
to hit with a ``laser cannon.''
</P>
<P>
   Zap a target and watch the digital score climb on your
dashboard. The object is to save the universe and, while you're at
it, capture the evil Zurg. The targets you aim for are Emperor Zurg
insignias.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz Lightyear replaces the generic Take Flight that closed in
January '98 at the Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is the new addition to Animal Kingdom, Disney's fourth
theme park that opened last April.
</P>
<P>
   Here, you walk the Maharajah Jungle Trek with six Asian tigers
and a roost of giant fruit bats that you can see up close along
with a Komodo dragon, deer and tapir. There's also an aviary.
</P>
<P>
   The Kali River Rapids' 12-person raft ride opens this month.

Though the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation's stated tax-exempt
purpose is to foster amateur sports development, little has been
spent on youth athletics. A community Olympic development program
which pledged to pump $1 million into kids sports programs in
Atlanta has yet to get underway nearly three years after the Games,

TAKING NEW MEASUREMENTS FOR JEFFERSON'S PEDESTAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ In a room just across the road from
Monticello, the hilltop mansion of Thomas Jefferson, a group of
scholars struggled this weekend to understand the character of the
third president now that it has taken on a dimension that
historians almost unanimously denied for two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Most people at the meeting agreed that DNA data reported last
November, along with the available historical evidence, now makes
it between probable and almost certain that Jefferson had a hidden
family with Sally Hemings, one of his slaves. The DNA data showed
that at least one Hemings descendant bore the same Y chromosome as
that of the Jefferson family.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, should historians think about Jefferson? Should he
be banished from the pantheon? Condemned as a hypocrite who
preached liberty but practiced slavery, who urged equality but
exercised a master's sexual rights over a slave? Or can the case be
made that he acted honorably within the standards of the time and
that his private life should have no bearing on his public
standing?
</P>
<P>
   Anger both at Jefferson's tolerance of slavery and at the
historians who have long denied that he had an interracial
relationship was expressed by Annette Gordon-Reed, a professor at
New York Law School. ``Women harvested his crops while he sat
writing letters and thinking great thoughts,'' she said in a paper
written for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he died penniless, the majority of them were scattered to
the four winds, losing family, home and friends. All these
activities _ all of these things done to black women _ have been
taken in and washed clean of their import for those who style
themselves as the keepers of Jefferson's flame.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's chief defender at the conference was Jack Rakove of
Stanford University. Acceptance of the liaison with Hemings, Rakove
suggested, added little to the existing problem of reconciling
Jefferson's commitment to equality with his life as a slave owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as the relationship complicates the problem of
understanding Jefferson's private life, including the psychology of
slave holding, it does not fundamentally alter or even enlarge the
essential public dilemma,'' Rakove said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, he noted, ``was born into a world which was only
beginning to understand that slavery was an evil of a kind
radically different from the other wrongs of life.'' And it was
Jefferson's commitment to equality and religious liberty, he noted,
that kindled the forces by which, many years later, slavery was
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than resolving the debate about Jefferson, the new
ingredient has made the brew more complex. Dr. Gordon-Reed compared
it to the Dreyfus affair, a medley on which everyone can project
their own political passions. Saying that the public has shown more
interest in the Hemings story than President Clinton's advisory
commission on race, she added, ``There is, apparently, nothing like
a story involving race, sex and interracial family lines to capture
the American imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's conference of about a dozen historians was
organized by Peter Onuf, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation
professor of history at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Before now, historians' record on the Jefferson-Hemings
relationship has not been distinguished for its accuracy. Although
Jefferson was first accused of having a family with Hemings during
his first term as president, in a newspaper article of 1802,
historians have long dismissed the possibility as an invention of
Jefferson's political enemies and as being incompatible with his
character.
</P>
<P>
   Winthrop Jordan, of the University of Mississippi, seems to have
been one of the few historians who clearly stated that the liaison
was a possibility, and in 1968 he documented that Jefferson had
been present at Monticello, despite his many absences, at the
conception of all of Hemings' then-known children.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the most recent biographer of Jefferson, Joseph J.
Ellis of Mount Holyoke College, wrote in his 1996 book, ``American
Sphinx,'' that within the community of Jefferson specialists,
``there seems to be a clear consensus that the story is almost
certainly not true.''
</P>
<P>
   It took two outsiders to the profession to correct the record.
Dr. Gordon-Reed, marshaling the available historical evidence
through a lawyer's eyes, laid out a compelling case for the
plausibility of the liaison in her book, ``Thomas Jefferson and
Sally Hemings,'' published in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Foster, a Tufts University professor of pathology who
lives in Charlottesville, then collected the DNA data from
descendants of the Jefferson and Hemings families, which he
reported in November.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, Ellis first among them, quickly accepted the new
evidence and in the papers commissioned by Onuf have already
developed many new insights into the remarkable institution of
Jefferson's public and shadow families.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Watched by a quizzical bust of Jefferson that dominated the
room, several of the historians suggested that despite the unequal
nature of the relationship, a true bond may have existed between
them during the 35 years of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved him, probably, and he her _ as it has been for most
marriage partners through the ages _ in a framework of profound
inequalities as to power and freedom,'' said Dr. Rhys Isaac of
Latrobe University in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hemings probably first became Jefferson's mistress when she was
sent as a girl to Paris, where he was ambassador in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   Though she could have claimed her freedom in France, she
returned to Monticello on the condition that all of her children be
freed, according to the memoirs of her son, Madison Hemings.
Because of that leverage, their relationship would perhaps have
been less coercive than otherwise, said Joshua Rothman of the
University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Philip Morgan, of the Institute of Early American
History and Culture, said that in Jefferson's hierarchical world,
their relationship may have differed little from that of master and
slave. ``I am impressed by how little we know about the
Jefferson-Hemings relationship. In all of Jefferson's
correspondence, he mentions her only once,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Other historians pointed out several reasons to suppose that
Hemings was more than just another slave in Jefferson's eyes. Her
mother was the slave mistress of Jefferson's father-in-law, John
Wayles, making her the half-sister of Jefferson's beloved wife
Martha. She was said to be fair-skinned, though no portrait of her
survives. Several historians suggested that Jefferson might have
seen her as part of his own world.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Dianne Swann-Wright, of the International Center for
Jefferson Studies, objected to any attempt to portray Hemings as
other than black. She and Dr. Lucia Stanton of the Thomas Jefferson
Memorial Foundation have conducted a survey among Hemings'
descendants, charting their uneasy pilgrimage between the black and
white worlds.
</P>
<P>
   All of Hemings' children were freed after Jefferson's death, as
he had promised. As they were fair-skinned, some passed in white
society. More recently, members of the family have been marrying
blacks, the two historians said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's troubled legacy was implicit in the remarkably
complicated structure of his household at Monticello. The white
family and the black family lived together, yet the black family
was never publicly acknowledged. Jefferson's sons with Hemings were
taught carpentry and the violin, but he seemed never to have
treated them as his children either in public or in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not in the habit of showing partiality or fatherly
affection to his children,'' Madison Hemings said in his memoir.
</P>
<P>
   The last word on Jefferson may belong to Henry Adams, a
historian. ``Excepting his rival Alexander Hamilton,'' Adams wrote,
``no American has been the object of estimates so widely differing
and so difficult to reconcile. ... A few broad strokes of the brush
would paint the portraits of all the early presidents, ... but
Jefferson could be painted only touch by touch, with a fine pencil,
and the perfection of the likeness depended upon the shifting and
uncertain flicker of its semitransparent shadows.''

EFFORT TO INCREASE CHILD IMMUNIZATION IS UNDER ATTACK IN IDAHO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN STUEBNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho _ Jim Hawkins has a tough time understanding why
parents would not immunize their children from preventable diseases
like polio and hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins is Gov. Dirk Kempthorne's point man on a new initiative
to lift the state's immunization rates from a rank of 49th in the
nation to no lower than 10th. Hawkins contracted polio, hepatitis
and rheumatic fever while growing up in north Idaho in the late
1940s and early 1950s, when no vaccines were available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was isolated for three months, and I was told that I might
not live through it,'' Hawkins said of his bout with polio in 1948.
``We need to give kids a chance at starting a healthy life. I
didn't have that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Hawkins, who retired recently as director of the state's
Department of Commerce, pushes a bill in the Idaho Legislature to
create a statewide computerized immunization registry, he is
running into opposition from the Idaho Christian Coalition and
receiving hate mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried that the government wants to keep medical
records on every man, woman and child, and we'll have no right to
privacy,'' said Nancy Bloomer, executive director of the Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christian Coalition members also question the need for
certain vaccinations, and cast doubt on their effectiveness, Ms.
Bloomer said. Shots can cause bad side effects, too, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kempthorne and Hawkins are beginning to see at least one
reason why Idaho's immunization rates have hovered in the 70
percent range _ certain religious and anti-government groups do not
want the government telling them how to raise their children.
Followers of paramilitary groups and white separatists do not want
their children's names or Social Security numbers on any kind of
public lists.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Idaho State Senate passed the statewide
registry bill 26 to 6, advancing the measure to the Idaho House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, State Sen. Jack Riggs, a physician in Coeur
d'Alene, noted that under the bill, parents must sign a form before
their children's names can be placed on the registry. No one is
obligated to be on the list, he said. A state survey of parents
indicates that more than 95 percent want their children to get
vaccinated against diseases, he said, adding that they just forget
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they're on a registry, they'll get a reminder phone call
or a postcard,'' Riggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Computerized registration links immunization data from
hospitals, health clinics and private doctors, making it easier to
keep track of vaccination records inside or outside the state.
Keeping track of shots can be difficult because children need about
20 shots by the age of 5.
</P>
<P>
   Low vaccination rates in Idaho have led to outbreaks of whooping
cough (pertussis), measles and rubella, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Idaho's effort, Hawkins is studying how other states
have achieved success. In Maine, which leads the nation with a 90
percent rate, the keys to success include providing free vaccines
to all medical providers, developing a two-state computerized
registry with New Hampshire and mail-out reminders, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal in Idaho, Hawkins said, is to give children a
healthy start, which should prepare them for school, college and a
promising career. ``We want give our children the best chance to
succeed in life,'' he said.

METS NEED TO REVIEW '92 IF THEY'RE TO PASS THIS YEAR'S CHEMISTRY
TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ If the New York Mets have not learned from
history, are they doomed to repeat it? That is a question hovering
over their heads as the Mets try to meld a new group of name
players into a cohesive unit and avoid the kind of meltdown that
scuttled the 1992 team, which was bolstered by a series of bold
moves.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen represented one of those moves. The Mets
acquired him in a trade with Kansas City, signed Bobby Bonilla and
Eddie Murray as free agents and hired Jeff Torborg as their highly
paid manager. As a result, they were a popular pick for the
division championship.
</P>
<P>
   Because of physical breakdowns, though, they fell far short.
They also had a chemistry problem, Saberhagen said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare this year's Mets with the Mets he joined six
years ago, Saberhagen, now a member of the Boston Red Sox, said:
``They have a great team on paper. We had the same thing in '92.
They've got a lot of different personalities on that team. It's a
matter of getting them all to blend and jell together and become a
team and not go out and play as individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen was one of the players whose injuries undermined the
Mets' chances in 1992. A sore arm left him unable to pitch after
May 15. Later in the season, Bonilla and Howard Johnson suffered
disabling injuries less than a week apart, and the Mets doubled
their deficit in the space of a week, falling from five and a half
games out on Aug. 2 to 11{ behind on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Not far below the surface, however, was a condition that was
just as devastating, Saberhagen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed like it was one thing after another,'' he
recalled. ``It was never baseball. I don't think we had a really
close-knit team. There were a few guys here and a few guys there,
not like the team we had here last year where everybody goes out to
dinner, hangs out together, always shooting the bull together.
Everybody was friendly on that Mets team, but everybody kind of had
their groups that they hung out in.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen attributed the condition to a difference in
personalities, which were never merged into a championship effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like living on a block and liking some of your neighbors
and not liking other neighbors,'' he said. ``You have to live with
them, but it doesn't mean you have to associate with them off the
field. When you see them around, you say hello, but you don't
invite them over to dinner. That was pretty much it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do baseball people place so much emphasis on team chemistry?
(Jim Frey, former manager and general manager and nonconformist,
used to say, ``Give me a three-run home run and I'll show you good
team chemistry.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play as a team on the field and get together and hang
out off the field, you don't have any problems,'' Saberhagen said.
``If you have a problem with somebody, it's talked about, you don't
go behind somebody's back. It just makes things a lot easier when
everybody gets along and everybody has one common goal and plays
hard to win ball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who will be 35 years old next month, said he did not
know if the current Mets team harbors the potential for problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a lot of superstars together, that can possibly
happen,'' he said. ``I'm not saying it's going to, but it's always
a possibility. I think the best guy they have over there to stop
that stuff is Johnny Franco. Johnny doesn't put up with any
nonsense. If he sees things happening, he's the one guy who could
possibly keep the team clicking on all cylinders.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco, the relief pitcher, who has Saberhagen's baseball card
above his locker at Port St. Lucie, was in his third season with
the Mets in 1992. Why didn't he oil the cylinders then?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was my place to stop it then,'' he said.
``But now I'm the elder statesman. You know what to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   And is there anything he has to look for?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still going to have your little cliques here and
there,'' he said, ``but the last few years everybody's pretty much
hung out together.''

</P>
<P>
   Mel Rojas played baseball for eight months in New York _ two
months in 1997 after the Mets obtained him from the Chicago Cubs
and all of last season. He did not enjoy himself, and his record
reflected it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of trouble pitching in New York,'' said Rojas, the
relief pitcher, who also had trouble pitching in Chicago. ``I don't
feel comfortable in that city. I really don't like that city. When
I played in Montreal, I said I don't like to play in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't he like to play in New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many Latin people there,'' said Rojas, a native of the
Dominican Republic. ``Every time I play there, they're looking for
me and call me everywhere. All my friends call me. I couldn't get
good concentration in that city. There are a lot of distractions
over there. I don't like that city.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, who last season had a 6.05 earned run average and allowed
a .305 batting average and 101 base-runners in 58 innings, said he
welcomed his trade to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I didn't want to go back over there,'' he said.
``I said I want a trade anywhere, but I don't want to go back to
New York. The thing is I don't like that city. Any place but New
York. I've never liked New York. I feel comfortable here so far. I
can't say anything about the city in Los Angeles. It's got to be
better than New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to clarify Rojas' position, he doesn't like New York.
</P>
<P>
   A Personal Hitting Coach
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Baerga has nothing against New York; he just doesn't like
what he did there. Playing for the Mets, he had the two worst
seasons of his career. He was depressed enough to do something
about it. He hired a personal hitting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Morales, who was a coach in Cleveland when Baerga played
there, was his choice, and Morales worked with him in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `I really need you to find what I'm doing
wrong,''' said Baerga, now with the St. Louis Cardinals. ``I sent
him some videos before he came to Puerto Rico. He watched me
hitting a lot so when he came down, we talked about what I was
doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At the ball park where Baerga and Morales worked, the second
baseman had a friend tape his batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we went to my house and watched tapes from Cleveland and
the Mets,'' Baerga said. ``The way I hit before, I used my legs and
body. With the Mets, I was just using my hands. The power wasn't
there. We worked for a week and a half, and it was really good.''
</P>
<P>
   It's early in the exhibition schedule, but Baerga said he feels
he has regained his old hitting form. ``I feel it in the way I hit
the ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The work has also produced positive results for the coach.
Baerga talked to Tony La Russa, the Cardinals' manager, about
Morales, and La Russa agreed it would be a good idea to have
Morales in camp as an extra hitting instructor.
</P>
<P>
   But even better, Baerga said, ``They might keep him after the
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   A More Relaxed Pace
</P>
<P>
   The look was different. Standing near the batting cage on a
Minnesota Twins practice field in Fort Myers, Joe McIlvaine wore
sneakers and blue jeans, a sign of relaxation. He can afford to
relax these days because he is no longer a general manager, but a
scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``As general manager, you are responsible for a lot of people,''
said McIlvaine, officially a special assistant to Twins General
Manager Terry Ryan. ``A lot of people report to you. A lot of
people are dependent upon your decisions. The difference in this
job is I don't have anyone really reporting to me, except the Latin
American guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get back to your hotel, the phone doesn't have the
red light on. When you used to go back before, you'd have your list
of 15 calls from people who were looking for you or who needed
advice or needed a decision. You're more of an independent doing
what I'm doing. You make your own schedule and go do it.''
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine, who scouts players at all levels, is doing what some
other Mets executives suggested he was doing _ whatever he
preferred _ leading up to his dismissal as their general manager
during the 1997 season. No one said it publicly, but privately
people said McIlvaine often was not available for meetings and did
not take care of matters he was asked to handle. In short, they
said, he had lost interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things said that weren't accurate,''
McIlvaine said, obviously still not pleased with the picture that
was painted then. ``I chose silence. I didn't want to get into the
public debate about things like that. If that's the way they felt,
fine. But I was a professional. I was there to do my job and I did
my job.''
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine still lives in the New York area and closely follows
the team for which he worked so many years. ``I enjoyed my 15 years
with the Mets,'' he said. ``I'm realistic. Things like that are
going to happen to you. It's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine, who worked his way up through the scouting ranks,
said he plans to remain in baseball at whatever level he finds
himself. ``I'm a baseball lifer,'' he said. Does he want to be a
general manager again? ``If the opportunity came along again, I
would have to consider it,'' he said, ``but I'm not going to jump
into something just because it's a general manager's job.''  &QL;

MICHAEL HIGGINS, INNOVATOR IN GLASS DESIGN, DEAD AT 90
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (rk) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Higgins, a pioneer designer of glass, died at his home
in Riverside, Ill., on Feb. 13. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining prominence in the 1940s, the Higgins name has come
to stand for technologically daring glass, objects with bold
textures, saturated colors and patterns inspired by the 1950s and
'60s and the art of Miro, Calder and the Surrealists.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins and his wife, Frances, collaborated so closely that they
signed their works simply Higgins. They began working more than
five decades ago, firing up kilns in their tiny Chicago apartment.
Today their mass-produced platters, dishes, bowls and trays are
avidly collected and sold at auction on the Internet, while their
studio-made pieces can be found at the American Craft Museum, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of American glass after Louis Comfort Tiffany was
a quiet story,'' said David McFadden, chief curator at the American
Craft Museum in New York. ``The Higginses, along with a few others,
were lone voices in the wilderness keeping interest in the material
alive. People like Michael Higgins proved to be a touchstone for
what American ingenuity and creativity could do in the field of
glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins was born in London on Sept. 29, 1908. His father was a
judge. He studied at Eton, where he was a King's Scholar, and went
on to Cambridge University and the London Central School of Arts
and Crafts. In 1947 he moved to Chicago, where he ran the visual
design department at the Institute of Design and met Frances
Stewart, a graduate student. They were married in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   At first the couple sold pieces at arts festivals and crafts
fairs and to department stores like Marshall Field, Gump's and
Bloomingdale's. Their unusual technique is called slumped glass, in
which layers of colored glass are laid over shallow molds, drawn on
or decorated with bits of enamel, foil or wire, then sandwiched
between more layers of glass. Mrs. Higgins preferred drawing, while
Higgins' works more often used the cut pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 they went to work for the Dearborn Glass Company, an
industrial glass manufacturer, where they refined their skills and
made mass-produced tableware, including saucers, bowls, platters,
paperweights and an astonishing array of ashtrays all bearing the
distinctive gold ``higgins'' stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The Higginses were part of the first generation of studio glass
workers to be recognized in an international exhibition, ``Glass
1959,'' organized by the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 they began to work for Haeger Potteries with the goal of
moving beyond mass production, said Donald-Brian Johnson, the
co-author of ``Higgins: Adventures in Glass'' (Schiffer Books,
1997), only to find that the new company expected them to maintain
their extraordinary output. One year later they bought back their
equipment from Haeger and opened their own studio in Riverside,
near Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   With a revived interest in the optimism and the inventiveness
exhibited by American design of the 1950s and 60s has come a
renewed appreciation for Higgins Glass and its upbeat style. The
workshop's annual open house in Riverside, held on the first Friday
of every December, attracts hundreds of buyers eager to purchase a
new one-of-a-kind mobile or piece of jewelry or tableware.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Mrs. Higgins, there are no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The Higginses had a down-to-earth attitude toward their craft.
``We offer you no polysyllabic mystique, nor any fervent analysis
of our approach to our work,'' they wrote in an introduction to a
New York gallery exhibition of their work in 1985. ``It is just
what our lives steered us into doing for our joint living, and we
like it most of the time.''

   SPORTS-SEXHARASSMENT (Undated) _ In an odd twist, the rise in
reports of harassment by male coaches is acknowledged to be an

participation in organized women's athletics has greatly increased,
creating a need for thousands of new coaches, the share of those
coaches who are women has dropped. And female athletes, afraid of
losing their spots on teams, rarely report their coaches. By Robin

COMEBACK KID SETS HER SIGHTS ON SENIOR YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Moving in the ``a'' national news file, the ``k'' editorial news
file and in the ``n'' California news file.) 
(Dennis McCarthy is a Daily News columnist) 
By DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The comeback kid lay in the post-op recovery room
at Kaiser Foundation Hospital, eyes closed, trying to focus on what
her doctor was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is president of the United States?'' Dr. Bruce Enos asked
last week, whispering into the ear of 16-year-old Kristina Lopez,
the cheerleader who had to drop out of St. Genevieve's High School
because of her epileptic seizures and then was banished from a
sideline appearance because she wasn't a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton,'' she murmured, still a little groggy from a
four-hour surgery to remove her right temporal lobe and hopefully
end the seizures she has been experiencing through her teen years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dangers of this delicate operation is a temporary
loss of short-term memory. Enos had to know if the teen-ager still
had hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is his girlfriend?'' the doctor then asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky,'' Kristina whispered, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Enos laughed and squeezed her hand. Then the doctor walked over
to the waiting room in the West Los Angeles hospital where more
than a dozen people _ family and friends of Kristina _ were
nervously waiting and praying to hear the words he was about to
tell them.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback kid was doing great, the doctor said. Better than
anyone could hope.
</P>
<P>
   Christine and Alfred Lopez hugged each other and let out sighs
of relief. Step one _ the biggest step _ on their daughter's
comeback trail was over, they knew.
</P>
<P>
   There was still a long way to go, but maybe _ just maybe _
Kristina would be doing what she promised she would be doing come
this September _ even if no one really believed her.
</P>
<P>
   Hold her head high and walk through the front doors of St.
Genevieve's High School for her senior year _ strong and healthy,
able to wear her silver and blue school colors again and lead her
schoolmates in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   A far cry from the last time she was with the friends and
teachers she had known at the school since first grade _ rising to
become one of the school's honor students and cheerleaders before
her epileptic fits forced her to drop out in May and attend home
school.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Kristina ran crying from the student body after
being told by school administrators to get off the sidelines of the
homecoming football game because she was no longer a student there.
</P>
<P>
   She had been warned earlier in the week she couldn't lead cheers
at the game, but when the other cheerleaders saw her up in the
stands dressed in her uniform, sitting with her parents, they waved
her down at halftime to help them fill candy bags for the other
team's cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   It was important to her, this little bit of school camaraderie
she could still hang on to. She missed her friends, missed her
school. After all, she had done nothing wrong to leave it but get
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it would be OK just to stand on the sidelines with the
other cheerleaders at halftime at the biggest game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   She was wrong. It wasn't OK. In front of the whole student body
and her parents, she was told to leave. The Archdiocese of Los
Angeles would later uphold the administrators' decision to kick
Kristina off the sidelines because she was no longer a student
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students do not have the right or authority to countermand a
decision by the administration,'' said the Rev. Gregory Coiro, a
spokesman for the archdiocese. ``While Kristina might have thought
it was OK to go down there because they (the other cheerleaders)
asked her, she had already been told she couldn't (by school
Principal Maria Denis).
</P>
<P>
   ``She shouldn't have been on the sidelines at all.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kristina's parents and friends finally found her after she
ran from the sidelines that night, she was sitting behind the
bleachers, alone in the dark, crying.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote at the time that I thought the school's administrators
showed a pretty cold heart that night, certainly not a charitable
one for a sick teen-age girl having her whole life come unglued
because of uncontrollable epileptic fits.
</P>
<P>
   I still think they were terribly wrong. No one in the
administration at St. Genevieve's ever called or sent a note
apologizing for that night, Chris and Al Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter was hurt, angry and embarrassed by what happened
to her, but she was also determined. She wasn't going to let a few
adults defeat her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my operations are a success, I want to return to St. Gen's
and graduate with my class in 2000,'' she told me in November.
``That's my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the comeback kid took the first step in that dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is remarkable what she has done,'' said Lynn Burlin,
who befriended Kristina after she read the column. In 1995, Burlin,
then 23, underwent similar operations to end her epileptic
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of myself in Kristina and wanted to help her
through this period because I knew it would be tough,'' said
Burlin, who works for the Epilepsy and Brain Mapping Program at
Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, one of the country's
largest and most experienced comprehensive epilepsy treatment
centers for children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few months, Burlin has been preparing Kristina for
what would lie ahead and what to expect _ ``telling her all the
things the doctors don't tell you,'' Burlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristina, resting on the couch at home Thursday _ next to a vase
with a dozen carnations and a get-well card sent by the
administrators at St. Genevieve's, said Burlin gave her courage
when she was very scared, which was most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking going into surgery, Lynn did it, I could do
it,'' Kristina said. ``Be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one, not even Burlin and the doctors, ever imagined how
strong this young girl can be when she sets her mind to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were calling her the miracle, comeback kid at Kaiser
Hospital,'' Burlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually takes two to three weeks to recover enough to go
home after these surgeries. Kristina was home in a week, which is
very, very remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to the comeback kid.
</P>
<P>
   Her senior year of high school is coming up, and she doesn't
have a lot of time to waste getting ready.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The comeback kid lay in the post-op recovery room
at Kaiser Foundation Hospital, eyes closed, trying to focus on what
her doctor was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is president of the United States?'' Dr. Bruce Enos asked
last week, whispering into the ear of 16-year-old Kristina Lopez,
the cheerleader who had to drop out of St. Genevieve's High School
because of her epileptic seizures and then was banished from a
sideline appearance because she wasn't a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton,'' she murmured, still a little groggy from a
four-hour surgery to remove her right temporal lobe and hopefully
end the seizures she has been experiencing through her teen years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dangers of this delicate operation is a temporary
loss of short-term memory. Enos had to know if the teen-ager still
had hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is his girlfriend?'' the doctor then asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky,'' Kristina whispered, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Enos laughed and squeezed her hand. Then the doctor walked over
to the waiting room in the West Los Angeles hospital where more
than a dozen people _ family and friends of Kristina _ were
nervously waiting and praying to hear the words he was about to
tell them.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback kid was doing great, the doctor said. Better than
anyone could hope.
</P>
<P>
   Christine and Alfred Lopez hugged each other and let out sighs
of relief. Step one _ the biggest step _ on their daughter's
comeback trail was over, they knew.
</P>
<P>
   There was still a long way to go, but maybe _ just maybe _
Kristina would be doing what she promised she would be doing come
this September _ even if no one really believed her.
</P>
<P>
   Hold her head high and walk through the front doors of St.
Genevieve's High School for her senior year _ strong and healthy,
able to wear her silver and blue school colors again and lead her
schoolmates in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   A far cry from the last time she was with the friends and
teachers she had known at the school since first grade _ rising to
become one of the school's honor students and cheerleaders before
her epileptic fits forced her to drop out in May and attend home
school.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Kristina ran crying from the student body after
being told by school administrators to get off the sidelines of the
homecoming football game because she was no longer a student there.
</P>
<P>
   She had been warned earlier in the week she couldn't lead cheers
at the game, but when the other cheerleaders saw her up in the
stands dressed in her uniform, sitting with her parents, they waved
her down at halftime to help them fill candy bags for the other
team's cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   It was important to her, this little bit of school camaraderie
she could still hang on to. She missed her friends, missed her
school. After all, she had done nothing wrong to leave it but get
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it would be OK just to stand on the sidelines with the
other cheerleaders at halftime at the biggest game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   She was wrong. It wasn't OK. In front of the whole student body
and her parents, she was told to leave. The Archdiocese of Los
Angeles would later uphold the administrators' decision to kick
Kristina off the sidelines because she was no longer a student
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students do not have the right or authority to countermand a
decision by the administration,'' said the Rev. Gregory Coiro, a
spokesman for the archdiocese. ``While Kristina might have thought
it was OK to go down there because they (the other cheerleaders)
asked her, she had already been told she couldn't (by school
Principal Maria Denis).
</P>
<P>
   ``She shouldn't have been on the sidelines at all.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kristina's parents and friends finally found her after she
ran from the sidelines that night, she was sitting behind the
bleachers, alone in the dark, crying.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote at the time that I thought the school's administrators
showed a pretty cold heart that night, certainly not a charitable
one for a sick teen-age girl having her whole life come unglued
because of uncontrollable epileptic fits.
</P>
<P>
   I still think they were terribly wrong. No one in the
administration at St. Genevieve's ever called or sent a note
apologizing for that night, Chris and Al Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter was hurt, angry and embarrassed by what happened
to her, but she was also determined. She wasn't going to let a few
adults defeat her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my operations are a success, I want to return to St. Gen's
and graduate with my class in 2000,'' she told me in November.
``That's my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the comeback kid took the first step in that dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is remarkable what she has done,'' said Lynn Burlin,
who befriended Kristina after she read the column. In 1995, Burlin,
then 23, underwent similar operations to end her epileptic
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of myself in Kristina and wanted to help her
through this period because I knew it would be tough,'' said
Burlin, who works for the Epilepsy and Brain Mapping Program at
Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, one of the country's
largest and most experienced comprehensive epilepsy treatment
centers for children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few months, Burlin has been preparing Kristina for
what would lie ahead and what to expect _ ``telling her all the
things the doctors don't tell you,'' Burlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristina, resting on the couch at home Thursday _ next to a vase
with a dozen carnations and a get-well card sent by the
administrators at St. Genevieve's, said Burlin gave her courage
when she was very scared, which was most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking going into surgery, Lynn did it, I could do
it,'' Kristina said. ``Be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one, not even Burlin and the doctors, ever imagined how
strong this young girl can be when she sets her mind to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were calling her the miracle, comeback kid at Kaiser
Hospital,'' Burlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually takes two to three weeks to recover enough to go
home after these surgeries. Kristina was home in a week, which is
very, very remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to the comeback kid.
</P>
<P>
   Her senior year of high school is coming up, and she doesn't
have a lot of time to waste getting ready.

CRITICS FEAR UNION MUSCLE DILUTING CALIFORNIA EDUCATION REFORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRY HARDY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO -- &UR;  &LR; Nobody really wants to discuss it. Nobody wants
to make the new governor mad. Nobody wants to kill a fragile deal
when everybody wants to believe there is a quick fix for
California's failing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a glaring hole in Gov. Gray Davis' school reform
plan, one that critics say could fundamentally defeat the entire
effort to improve public education.
</P>
<P>
   Although principals could be fired if their schools don't
perform well and students could be denied diplomas, there is no
provision to make it easier to get rid of bad teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about the governor wanting his victory, but there
is nothing approaching accountability for teachers in these reforms
_ this is truly the `Emperor Has No Clothes' story,'' said state
Sen. Ray Haynes, R-Riverside, one of the few willing to publicly
protest Davis' centerpiece education plan. ``The teachers unions
are cashing in all their chips. They gave to the governor and
helped get him elected _ this is where they get their payback.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Assemblyman Tom McClintock, R-Granada Hills: ``It's all
symbolism and very little substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other lawmakers and education groups want to sidestep the
issue. Not only are the reforms the governor's No. 1 priority, but
the bills are authored by such heavy-hitting lawmakers as Assembly
Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Sacramento insiders warn of the ``delicacy'' of the
situation, and wonder how to explain the unequal accountability
provisions in ``politically correct'' terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the governor's proposal makes it easier to fire an
incompetent teacher, and without that, there is no real way to
change what's going on in our schools,'' noted one education
insider who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's education experts, as well as union officials,
deny that Davis is going soft on teachers. Education Undersecretary
Sue Burr said the governor is committed to doing what is necessary
to improve California's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to fire teachers. Our goal is to improve the
teaching force we have,'' Burr said. She added that charges that
Davis was paying back unions were absolutely untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bergan, president of the California Federation of Teachers,
agreed, saying that her organization was pushing for reforms and
better teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bergan said her organization appreciates that Davis' plan
included more attention and support to teachers, but it has
reservations about the speed of implementation and provisions that
make accountability mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the bill we would write,'' Bergan said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Davis administration, as well as outside
education experts, say teachers' acceptance of the education
reforms is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, some say, recent events in the Los Angeles
Unified School District could point to more problems ahead for
implementation of the governor's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers union, United Teachers Los Angeles, recently
convinced a majority of the Los Angeles school board to grant
instructors a pay increase without tying the raise to performance.
</P>
<P>
   During negotiations, union leaders were even unwilling to
approve accountability measures for their worst 150 teachers _ out
of a 36,000-strong teaching force _ who received unsatisfactory
evaluations. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Given the Los Angeles school board's unwillingness to adopt
accountability reforms for its instructors _ and with the same
attitude coming from Sacramento _ critics believe that reform of
public schools throughout the state will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at our history, I'm not optimistic about our future,''
said Eli Brent, president of the Associated Administrators of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare occurrence when teachers are fired within the LAUSD
and even rarer for a teacher to be forced out because of
incompetence, said Howard Friedman, assistant general counsel for
the school district. In an average year, there are eight to 10
cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That includes cases that range from molesting to abuse to
actual incompetence _ and that is the rarest type of case,''
Friedman said. ``Getting to the point of dismissal for an
incompetent teacher is such an encumbered, laborious process that
there is a tendency not to want to take on a task that takes 30
percent to 40 percent of your time.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than a year to document an incompetent teacher and
bring the case for action before the school board. If the teacher
fights dismissal, then the cases go before the Commission on
Professional Competence. Rarely, if ever, does the district prevail
there on incompetency cases, Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD is not alone in this problem. For that reason, many
districts with successful reform plans, such as the Chicago school
district, have included expedited measures to fire teachers. And
many experts believe that those potential severe consequences are a
key part of reform plans.

SACRAMENTO: reform plans.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruno Manno, a senior fellow at the Annie E. Casey Foundation in
Baltimore, a nonprofit organization that looks at education reform
and other efforts for disadvantaged children, agreed. He said
successful accountability plans must have three components: clear
standards, a way to assess progress, and rewards and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These efforts have to be across the board, for kids, for
principals and for teachers _ and some would say even for
parents,'' Manno said. ``Systems that lack those components are
full of holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' goals for education reforms are making their way through
the Legislature on a fast track, with an eye on final approval by
the end of this month. They call for intensive reading instruction
for struggling students; an exit exam for students before receiving
their diploma; peer review and support for teachers; and an
accountability system that would rank all 8,000 schools and set up
rewards and sanctions for the 430 worst-performing campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Within those bills are provisions for increased teacher training
and support. Individual teacher evaluation is mostly addressed
within the peer review law, authored by Villaraigosa. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Carl Cohn, superintendent of the Long Beach Unified School
District, said he believes Davis is gambling with California
schools' success by pushing the largely untried peer review system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a one-size-fits-all answer for the 1,000 districts
in California,'' Cohn said. ``What evidence does Gray Davis have
about the efficacy of this type of approach? I don't believe he has
any.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was first written as a mandatory plan, teachers
unions successfully won an amended, voluntary version that requires
any peer review system to be collectively bargained.
</P>
<P>
   However, districts that do not participate will lose part of
$419million in state teaching assistance funds.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers will go through peer review automatically if they are
given an unsatisfactory performance evaluation. Or instructors can
ask for help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point out that the evaluation process ends with a
report.
</P>
<P>
   As one education expert, who asked not to be named, said: ``So
what if an evaluation goes into a file? These teachers are still
tenured, and tenure goes on a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the accountability system bill, the measure provides for
a series of increasingly serious actions if a school does not
improve student achievement _ as evaluated by test scores and
attendance. Under those provisions, all teachers at failing schools
can be transferred. The principal, however, faces the threat of
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Van Nuys, pushed through an
amendment that would allow the principals at failing schools to be
fired only if they have had control of the school's budget,
curriculum and personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The laws do not allow teachers to be evaluated by their
classrooms' test results, except for a small part of the exam that
is now aligned to state standards.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock, who voted for the two education bills that have come
before the Assembly _ the reading initiative and peer review _ said
he did so reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very small step in the right direction, but the bills
won't likely translate into anything effective because they are so
badly framed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Davis has a Democrat-controlled Legislature behind
him, the governor missed a chance to implement real reforms,
McClintock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is controversial and threatening,'' he said. ``When you
go the way of a centrist, you have no intention of changing the
status quo. When this is all over, the school system will be
slightly more expensive and slightly less productive than the year
before.''

T. NORMAN HURD, 88, ROCKEFELLER'S CONFIDANT
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   T. Norman Hurd, a budget director for the state of New York
under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and the governor's close
confidant, died on Feb. 27 at his home in Loudonville, N.Y., a
suburb of Albany. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd, who earned his doctorate in agricultural business
management at Cornell University, was budget director under Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey from 1950 to 1954 and under Rockefeller from 1959
to 1971, when Rockefeller named him director of state operations.
From 1956 to 1958, Hurd was a member of the State Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1971, he had become Rockefeller's treasured factotum and
was admired by colleagues in state government for his attention to
detail. Hurd was ``noted for boiling down pages of detail into
understandable notions for the governor,'' The New York Times said
that year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Hurd was appointed secretary to the governor by
Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd served in that post for the rest of Rockefeller's tenure as
governor and also under the next governor, Malcolm Wilson. After
Rockefeller became vice president in 1974, Hurd joined his vice
presidential staff as a special assistant.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, his name was mentioned in a furor involving
N.Y. state political figures and the nursing home industry. One
state commission issued a report in 1976 that said Rockefeller was
to blame for political influence, official neglect and poor care
that it said were rife in the nursing home industry while he was
governor. But the report said that Rockefeller and Hurd regarded
their repeated interventions in nursing home matters as ``mere
courtesies,'' and that they had denied that they had had an
intimidating effect on civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd was active in the affairs of the Nelson A. Rockefeller
Institute of Government, based in Albany, and was an editor of the
book ``Rockefeller in Retrospect: The Governor's New York Legacy''
(1984).
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Michigan, and worked on a family farm from until
he was 17. He graduated in 1931 from Michigan State College and
received his doctorate in 1936. He taught agricultural economics on
the Cornell campus and became a full professor in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Anne Wolstenholme Hurd, died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd is survived by a son, Hollis T. Hurd of Pittsburgh; two
daughters, Linda Hurd Ewing of West Lafayette, Ind., and Sandra
Hurd Hennemeyer of St. Louis; three grandchildren; one
great-grandchild; a brother, Russell, of Detroit; and two sisters,
Frieda Broadway and Mary Bricker, both of Yale, Mich.

THE SAILORS OF WINTER: IN THE COLD, COLD SEA 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: NY, NJ, Conn.) (fb) 
 By CAITLIN KELLY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARCHMONT, N.Y. _ Larchmont Yacht Club, which began its
frostbiting program in 1932, has the oldest winter fleet in the
Northeast, says Stanley Bell, a former racer and frostbiter who has
headed the club's race committee for 19 years. Despite the many
skeptics (Sailing? In the winter?), frostbiting has its
accomplished devotees. It is absolutely not a place for beginners
to come out and test their skills.
</P>
<P>
   When a day of racing means the wind-chill is minus 15 and the
water temperature can kill you, recreational racers stay close to
the fire while the truly hard-core head for the water. And several
big-boat racers who enjoy top positions in summer regattas
skippering their 40- to 45-footers find themselves pushed to the
middle of this small, fast fleet by the intense competition, Bell
said. This weekly nautical ferocity on Long Island Sound comes
contained in 11.5-foot Interclub dinghies.
</P>
<P>
   Larchmont's frostbiting fleet, which officially numbers 72 but
usually fields 60, includes the Mallory Cup winner Bill Healy, who
drives 90 minutes from Niantic, Conn., to enjoy the high-level
competition. Racers range in age from 15 to 68, and include many
college all-Americans, sailmakers and the former Olympic silver
medalist Steve Benjamin. Six to eight women regularly compete.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Point Yacht Club, in Westport, Conn., races 14-foot Lasers
in the winter, with a fleet of about 60, according to the club
manager, Stephen Shaw. Cedar Point, which has had a frostbiting
fleet for 15 years, has 24 to 10 boats out every Sunday. They are
single-man boats, and being an Olympic class, attract serious
racers who want to stay in shape year-round. While frostbiting,
with its use of small boats, bundled-up competitors, shorter, more
numerous races and eccentric dedication, invites comparisons to
adult bumper cars, it is as serious as big-boat action.
</P>
<P>
   Don Woodsworth of Northport, N.Y., was out on a sunny, crisp
Saturday recently at Larchmont wearing a red hat with earflaps, a
drysuit, black bike shorts over the top and yellow rubber gloves
with olive-green army-surplus wool liners. He looked, as did most
of the racers, like a cross between Captain Nemo, the Michelin Man
and a mad scientist. He laughed, and didn't care: frostbiters are a
breed apart from the blue-blazer, pressed-khakis crowd. ``It's the
only exercise I get in the winter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Norton, a manufacturer of kitchen counters from Ramsey,
N.J., was out on the water, too, competing with fellow American
Yacht Club members in a team event against sailors from Seawanhaka,
a club in Oyster Bay on Long Island. In the summer, Norton usually
races a Thistle out of Nyack, N.Y., on the Hudson River, but takes
out a winter membership at American in Rye, N.Y., in order to
frostbite. There, they race 30 11-foot Cook 11's. Norton, who
happily admits to being obsessed with frostbiting, said that he
even races in winds up to 25 knots although these small craft start
tipping in winds as low as 10 to 12 knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tippy boat downwind,'' he said. That Saturday,
Norton was wearing long johns, sweat pants, wool socks inside heavy
construction boots and ski gloves. Most of his competitors wore
drysuits, one-piece rubber affairs that seal at the neck and
wrists. You step in, squat deeply to burp out all the air, then
have a friend zip up the suit across the width of your shoulders.
Since frostbiters expect to fall into the water, and often do,
staying warm and mostly dry, is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first go in, it's not so bad,'' Norton said. ``Then
you thank God you're wearing your drysuit and your life jacket.
You're paralyzed after about 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   What attracts Norton to frostbiting is competition. ``I'm racing
here against guys who own and race Mumm 30's, Etchells, Sonars,''
he said. ``You're getting to compete against all the best in a boat
we all can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Mooney, a graduate student in marine biology who was
representing Seawanhaka, says the club's frostbiting fleet includes
20 Lasers, 4 Vanguards and 6 Dyers. ``I like the crowd that does
it,'' she said. ``It's a different atmosphere, a more cohesive
group.''
</P>
<P>
   The winds are fiercer in winter, she notes, the water freezing,
the fleet skilled. ``A lot of people just don't have the confidence
to frostbite,'' she said. ``I discourage beginners from trying it.
It can get very shifty and very puffy so it's a lot easier to
capsize. We sail close to shore and that tends to exaggerate the
puffs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not a sport likely to be overrun with devotees,''
Woodsworth said. ``People either think it's dangerous or not
enjoyable.'' Dozens of grinning red-cheeked faces on the line tell
a different story.

   ``Gloria Brady, Gloria Brady, 1959,'' she cried. ``Remember what
you did in Mrs. Robinson's Latin class?''
</P>
<P>
   The former Cassius Clay scrunched up his face at the former
Gloria Brady and clucked his tongue as he threw three short
upper-cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remembered!'' she said. Her own face became a girl's
again. ``Oh, we were so serious in that class. Mrs. Robinson wanted
us to make something of ourselves. We loved it when you stuck your
head in. It was a breath of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the executive producer of an African-American arts program,
Asantewa turned to the gathering audience of students and teachers.
``We laughed at him,'' she said. ``He had a rinky-dink bike. He
said he was going to be a champion boxer. We teased him, but he
never got mad. He just cuddled you. He's what he always was. He
gave us kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   If the visit to Ali's old high school had not been at the sudden
whim of a reporter, it might have seemed like the perfectly
orchestrated photo op and sound bite for the 57-year-old former
champion's most ambitious project since he first challenged Sonny
Liston for the heavyweight title 35 years ago. He and his wife,
Lonnie, also a Louisville native, are leading the development of an
$80 million downtown riverfront center that will celebrate Ali as
boxer, social lightning rod, Muslim and Parkinson's disease patient
as a way to reach adolescents with messages of racial, gender,
religious and ethnic healing and tolerance. The Alis, who live on
an 80-acre farm in Michigan with their adopted 8-year-old son,
Asaad, say they hope to relocate to 25 acres or so outside
Louisville once the center is closer to reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just don't call it a museum,'' said Lonnie Ali, his
42-year-old fourth wife. ``This is about what he stood for, what he
paid a price for. I want it done while he's alive so the kids who
come can actually touch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali is touchable. In fact, he seems to derive his energy from
the affection of strangers. His voice rarely rises above a phlegmy
whisper that must often be interpreted by Lonnie. His gait is
frequently unsteady and his facial expressions depend more on
twinkle and glow than mobility. But he has no trouble communicating
_ when he feels engaged. Bored at dinner here with a reporter he
had known since 1964 (``If I had a lower IQ, I might enjoy your
interview,'' he said amiably), he took off his shoes under the
table and napped between courses. He would happily wake to greet
visitors who apologized for disturbing his meal but just had to
tell him how much he had meant in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   It was only his wife's stern warnings that could keep him from
offering the visitors one of his inappropriate jokes. Somehow, they
seemed endearing from an athlete who claimed to have thrown his
Olympic medal off the Second Street Bridge in 1960 after he was
denied restaurant service because of his color. He might ignore
Lonnie to ask, ``What did Abraham Lincoln say when he woke up from
a two-day drunk?'' While his audience blinked in confusion, he
would answer himself, ``I freed who?'' and burst into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie would roll her eyes in mock despair. She revels in his
``lightness,'' she says, and imagines that he is cloaked with a
holy innocence that allows him to believe that the universe will
protect him no matter what he says or does. So far, despite
injurious ring defeats, three divorces, worldwide controversy,
serious illness and financial setbacks, he has been protected.
</P>
<P>
   When she married him 12 years ago, she said, his affairs were in
``disarray.'' In late 1996, after he lighted the Olympic torch in
Atlanta with shaking hands, he became the world's darling in ways
that eluded him even when he floated like a butterfly and stung
like a bee.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, according to Louisville politicians and boosters,
the city has become serious about honoring Ali as a native son and
using his celebrity to raise its visibility and ranking among other
smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an international airport now and international
companies, and we want people to visit us,'' said Mayor David
Armstrong at City Hall, while Ali dozed at his conference table.
``What better person to open a window to help us think about and
understand tolerance, and to appreciate our differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali snapped awake at that, and while his wife tensed for a joke,
he merely said, ``The schools are integrated now.''
</P>
<P>
   The city donated a site on the Ohio River said to be worth $10
million, near the Louisville Slugger Museum and factory and the
performing arts center.
</P>
<P>
   State aid and private contributions raised by board members
total about $30 million, according to Larry G. Townsend, pro bono
chairman of the Muhammad Ali Center. Townsend, who attended Ali's
first pro fight here when both were 18, is chairman of Riverboat
Development Inc., which operates a nearby gambling casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an institution for dreamers,'' said
Townsend, who was secretary of commerce under the former governor
John Y. Brown. Along with the former mayor Jerry E. Abramson, Brown
was a prime mover of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie is a tall, handsome woman whose light-skinned, freckly
face is reminiscent of Ali's mother. Their mothers were friends and
neighbors. Lonnie says she determined at 17 that she would someday
marry the champ. While waiting out two wives, she graduated from
Vanderbilt and received a master's in business administration from
UCLA. Lonnie is as mystical as she is practical. She says that her
preparation included, besides the degrees, martyrdom in a previous
life as a nun in South America. Born Catholic, she converted to
Islam in 1982, four years before marrying Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fanatical about protecting him and his name because he
means too much to the world,'' she said. ``America has a way of
tearing down its heroes. I've assumed a responsibility, like Rachel
Robinson or Jeannie Ashe or Coretta Scott King.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Ali woke up from dinner to ask, ``If a Mexican, a
Puerto Rican and a black guy are sitting in the back of a car, who
is driving?''
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie shook her head. ``Oh, Muhammad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A policeman,'' he said. He milked his laugh, then returned to
sleep mode.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, he seemed tired and eager to go up to his room
until he was spotted by a crowd of business people drinking in the
lobby. As they surrounded him, patted him, told him how good he
looked, he plucked a red handkerchief from his jacket pocket. He
made it vanish inside his fist. The crowd applauded. Ali did it
again, and then explained the trick, which involved a false thumb.
He said it was a sin to deceive people; he didn't want anyone to
think he had magical powers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she thought there was something slightly pathetic about
this lobby lounge act, Lonnie shrugged. ``He loves to entertain and
they want to be entertained.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At Central High, it was hard to get beyond personal
hero-worship. Students knew he was ``the Greatest,'' and he
referred to them as ``my people.'' The administrators, who were
close to his age, were just as star-struck. His former classmate,
Gloria Brady, was entranced. ``We loved to just look at him, he was
so cute,'' she said. ``He hasn't changed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The last official stop of the Alis' 24-hour visit was a meeting
with the mayor. As a weary Ali lumbered up the City Hall steps,
throwaway cameras began clicking and flashing in front of the faces
of 20 young men and women. They were Catholics and Protestants from
Ireland and Northern Ireland who had recently arrived in neutral
Kentucky to get to know each other in a peace and reconciliation
program called Wider Horizons. They had interrupted their own
ceremonial visit when they heard Ali was on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16- to 21-year-olds were toddlers at best when Ali
last fought, in 1981. But they said they knew all about him, his
life and his career. Pictures snapped, they flowed down the steps
in a tide of love. Ali's step quickened as he climbed to meet
them. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE HEAVYWEIGHT THINKER WHO LIKES HIS CHESS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTRUN, Pa. _ In a black tank top, black-and-blue tights, white
boxing shoes and a white cap, Lennox Lewis was on display for the
last time here at the Caesars Brookdale resort among the bare trees
in the Poconos. Soon he would be in a limo Friday night on the way
to a midtown New York hotel to await next Saturday's heavyweight
title showdown with Evander Holyfield at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Lewis moved around the ring in the resort's Fun and
Fitness Center, his trainer, Emanuel Steward, assessed the World
Boxing Council champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technical things, he's done everything I've wanted him to
do since I took over four years ago,'' Steward said. ``Like
balance. I'm big on balance. He's definitely improved that. But he
could be a little crisper with his delivery. Put more punches
together rather than looking to throw the big right hand. And he
could utilize his left jab more instead of pawing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still doesn't always throw punches instinctively,'' the
boxing sculptor of Thomas `Hit Man' Hearns and several other world
champions said. ``He has a tendency to think too much.''
</P>
<P>
   To think too much?
</P>
<P>
   ``To hesitate,'' he said. ``Against Zeljko Mavrovic, he had
chances to end the fight, but he hesitated when he should have been
throwing punches. He won, but the fight went the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does he hesitate?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a chess player,'' Steward said. ``I wish he wouldn't play
chess so much. When he's playing chess, sometimes he'll take 20
minutes to think about making a move. In boxing, you don't have
time to think. Boxing is instinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Steward ever had a boxer who plays chess?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox is the first one I've had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To kill time in their training camps, most boxers play cards,
listen to music or just sleep. Oscar De La Hoya sometimes plays
golf. Before dethroning Jack Dempsey as the heavyweight champion in
1926, Gene Tunney was seen reading, of all things, Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   But a chess player? Lennox Lewis apparently is unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play two or three games at once, but I don't,'' the
English heavyweight was saying now after his workout. ``I'm not the
best player in my camp. Frazzle beats me.
</P>
<P>
   Frazzle, alias Scott DeMercardo, accompanies Lewis on the
heavyweight's morning roadwork.
</P>
<P>
   But if thinking too long about chess moves translates to Lewis'
hesitating instead of throwing punches instinctively, it hasn't
caused Lewis to hesitate about why he thinks he will unify the
heavyweight title by ending Holyfield's reign as the champion of
both the World Boxing Association and the International Boxing
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win,'' Lewis said, ``all I need to do is just be right on
the night. Assert myself. Do everything I'm supposed to do. Evander
Holyfield has never seen no one like me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Holyfield has seen Mike Tyson for 11 rounds and three
rounds, and won twice. He's seen George Foreman for 12 rounds, and
won. He's seen Buster Douglas for three rounds, and won. He's also
seen Riddick Bowe for 12, 12 and 8 rounds, and won only once. He's
seen Michael Moorer for 12 and eight rounds, and won once and lost
once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holyfield has no particular strength,'' Lewis said. ``He has a
good left jab, a good left hook, good combinations, but they only
work against somebody who's there to be hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Holyfield, who usually disdains making a
prediction, has proclaimed that he will stop the 33-year-old Lewis
in the third round of their scheduled 12-round bout, an almost
instant Garden sellout that will be available on TVKO pay-per-view.
The prediction stunned Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Evander to do that was peculiar and funny, but I'm trying
to think of a better word,'' he said. ``Just say the audacity of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with chess perhaps subconsciously causing Lewis to
hesitate before throwing punches, Steward believed that the
6-foot-5-inch Lewis, whose wingspan is 6{ inches longer than
Holyfield's, will win because he is a naturally stronger boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holyfield's a weight lifter; he's artificially strong,''
Steward said. ``Lennox is like George Foreman and Sonny Liston
were, naturally strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has a 34-1 record, with 27 knockouts, losing only to
Oliver McCall in a second-round knockout that dethroned him as the
WBC champion in 1994. He regained the title in 1997 when McCall
wouldn't fight. He has retained it against Henry Akinwande, Andrew
Golota, Shannon Briggs and Mavrovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect Holyfield to be very aggressive,'' Steward said,
``but he has to alter his whole style because he's not used to
fighting taller guys. He has to try to get inside, but that won't
be easy. And whenever Lennox has been in a big fight, he has always
been more aggressive. Exceptionally aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a heavyweight who plays chess, Lennox Lewis can't afford
to think too much.  &QL;

MICROSOFT WILL ALTER SOFTWARE TO PROTECT PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J.)  (Eds: This story now appears on page 1 of the New York Times.) 
(lb) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft Corp. moved to defuse a potentially
explosive privacy issue on Saturday, saying it would modify a
feature of its Windows 98 operating system that has been quietly
used to create a vast database of personal information about
computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft conceded that the feature, a unique identifying number
used by Windows and a handful of other Microsoft products, had the
potential to be far more invasive than a traceable serial number in
Intel Corp.'s new Pentium III that has privacy advocates up in
arms. The difference is that the Windows number is tied to an
individual's name, to identifying numbers on the hardware in his
computer and even to documents that he creates.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the Windows number with all these data, the
company said, could result in the ability to track a single user
and the documents he created across vast computer networks. Hackers
could compromise the resulting database, or subpoenas might allow
authorities to gain access to information that would otherwise
remain private and unavailable. Privacy advocates fear that
availability will lead to abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely sensitive to any privacy concerns,'' Robert
Bennett, Microsoft's group product manager for Windows, said. ``The
software was not supposed to send this information unless the
computer user checked a specific option.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the option to collect the information had been
added to the software so that Microsoft support employees would be
able to help users diagnose problems with their computers more
accurately. He said the Redmond, Wash., software giant had never
intended to use the data for marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to altering the way the registration program works
in the next maintenance release of Windows 98, Bennett said
Microsoft technicians would look through the company's databases
and expunge information that had already been collected as a result
of earlier versions.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also exploring the possibility of creating a free
utility program that would make it possible for Windows users to
delete the serial-number information from a small database in the
part of Windows system known as the registry, where it is now
collected.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been discussing the issue with a Cambridge, Mass.,
programmer who contacted the company last week after discovering
that the Microsoft Office suite of business software was creating
unique numbers identifying a user's personal computer and embedding
them in spreadsheet and word-processing documents.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the programmer, Robert M. Smith, who is the president
of Phar Lap Software Inc., a software tools development company,
notified the company that he believed the practice created a
potential privacy threat.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said last week that they were using the
number in the company's software in an effort to find a unique
identifier to keep components from colliding with one another in an
increasingly complex world of networked computers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith said that the number, in effect, created a
``digital fingerprint'' that could be used to match a document
created by a word-processing or spreadsheet program with a
particular computer.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after further studying the ``registration wizard''
_ the software module that enables customers to register their
copies of Windows 98 operating system for support and updates _
Smith discovered that the number, known as a Globally Unique
Identifier, was being transmitted to Microsoft as part of a list of
registration information that generally includes the owner's name,
address, phone number, certain other demographic information and
details about what hardware and software are on or attached to the
user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft never asked me if it was OK to send in this number,
and they never said it was being sent,'' Smith said. ``They are
apparently building a database that relates Ethernet adapter
addresses to personal information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethernet adapters are cards inserted in a personal computer that
enable it to connect to high-speed networks within corporations,
and from there out to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy erupted just weeks after Intel, maker of the
most widely used processors for machines that run Windows, agreed
to enable computer manufacturers to disable a serial number in its
new Pentium III computer chip so that it was not visible to
software or on a network without the computer user's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy activists have been attacking both companies, arguing
that identification numbers can be easily misused to permit the
creation of electronic monitoring systems that track a computer
user's behavior in cyberspace, or dossiers of personal information
about individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has sparked a heated debate over the fundamental
technology of modern computer networks and software systems, which
routinely employ serial numbers to identify individual computers
and software modules known as ``objects'' that can be shared by a
number of programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Intel number identified only a computer. The Windows
number identifies a person. And because the Windows number created
a potential linkage between individuals and confidential documents
they created, privacy advocates said they were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is horrendous,'' said Jason Catlett, president of
Junkbusters, a consumer privacy organization based in Greenbrook,
N.J. ``They're tattooing a number into each file. Think of the
implications. If some whistleblower sends a file, it can be traced
back to the person himself. It's an extremely dangerous feature.
Why did they do it?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups have long warned about the dangers of centralized
information and the dangers of monitoring electronic behavior. The
privacy community has been discussing the implications of the Intel
Pentium III serial number with Intel, and while some privacy
advocates acknowledge that the number can play an important role in
protecting both privacy and security, others have called for a
boycott of Intel, arguing that the likelihood of misuse of the
number is extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fear of a centralized Big Brother, they add that the
rise of the Internet has made it possible for individual companies
to freely use detailed personal information for commercial ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the absence of legal rules that limit the
collection and use of personal information,'' said Marc Rotenberg,
director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington. ``It's clear to me that large Internet companies such
as Microsoft, AOL and Netscape will try to squeeze out privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives said on Friday evening that they had
developed the feature for technical reasons related to the need to
distinguish among millions of different hardware and software
objects on the Internet but had never considered the privacy
implications.
</P>
<P>
   According to Microsoft software engineers, the roots of the
company's numbering system go back to a system developed by
computer researchers at the Open Software Foundation in Cambridge
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to develop technology that would enable computer
systems to communicate across a network, a numbering system known
as a Universally Unique Identifier, or UUID, was established as
part of a software standard known as the Distributed Computing
Environment, or DCE. Microsoft relied on this standard when it
developed a remote computing capability for Windows known as Object
Linking and Embedding, or OLE.
</P>
<P>
   The company's designers changed the UUID term to GUID, or
Globally Unique Identifier, and it is widely used by software
applications today. For example, the GUID is used in setting
``cookies'' _ files that Web sites write to a visitor's hard drive
to identify the user later and to track his or her travels through
the Web.

 &HT;    Holyfield: `Stronger than I ever have been'
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He is at the strangest of crossroads, a 36-year-old
eager to take hold of not only this era in his profession but
others, a champion who visualizes a globe-trot to open the new
millennium and close his career while at the same time somewhat
returning to the start line of his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm stronger today than I ever have been before,'' said
Evander Holyfield, and though he could have been speaking of his
physical strength, he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Already holder of the WBA and IBF heavyweight title belts,
Holyfield aims to bring boxing's other major alphabet accessory to
his collection Saturday when he meets WBC champion Lennox Lewis at
New York's Madison Square Garden. The winner will be the first
unified heavyweight champion since Riddick Bowe defeated Holyfield
in 1992, only to fracture the crown one month later by literally
throwing the WBC belt in a garbage can rather than fight a
mandatory bout against Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Bowe's ill-fated decision was one Holyfield would never make,
for as he said, ``When you're the unified champion and you say
you're the best, nobody can say, `Well, that's just a matter of
opinion.'''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who completed training for Lewis last week in
Houston, feels certain he will smother any lingering doubts that he
is the division's best. The greater battle in public opinion comes
in his personal life, having acknowledged six months ago that he
fathered two more children out of wedlock since his marriage to his
second wife, Janice, in 1996. Although adultery was a basis for
Holyfield's first divorce and he already had fathered three
out-of-wedlock children, the latest admission set off a firestorm
of criticism in the public and the media, especially with the
backdrop of his very public religious convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Evander and Janice Holyfield went through several counseling
sessions but those have since ceased, and Evander says the two are
separated. He will not discuss the future of the marriage. He says
only that he has had extensive counseling himself for, what he
terms, ``the problems I've had,'' and adds, ``I feel like now I'm a
better man.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater inner strength has been needed to fend off the public
attacks. Most recently, Lewis called Holyfield a ``hypocrite,'' and
reiterated his remarks this week, adding, ``I'm only saying what
people think. If I say I don't drink and I drink, I'd be a
hypocrite. I'm just citing reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield is taking the barbs in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way things will change is by changing your life and
not doing those things any more,'' he said. ``This is what I did.
But I've been able to construct a better life for myself. Was it an
embarrassment for myself? Yeah. But it was more embarrassing when
it happened than when the story was told. As a matter of fact, when
the story was told, I was more relieved. You know, when you do
something dumb, it's going to come to life at some point in time.
People came up to me and said, `You met with a writer to talk about
that? For what?' But I said, `Well, it was the truth. It's not like
anybody made me go out and do it.' The question is, how did it
inspire you? Did it inspire you to be better or did it inspire you
to be sneaky? It inspired me to be better. I pray and I thank God
for giving me the knowledge to change. I was able to get
counseling. The family's a lot better. If you hurt your family, the
whole thing is to not hurt them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Holyfield did not want her husband speaking publicly of
the affairs in September, but Evander said, ``To me it was better
at that time than, all of sudden, if we were to get divorced, have
people say, `Oh, he's gonna leave that girl. Look what he did to
her.' Now, whatever happens, people are going to realize, `Well, he
made a bad decision in that relationship.' But this is the reason
these things happen. There was no love.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield actually believed the criticism could have been much
worse. He attended a Braves game shortly after the admission and
recalled people cheering for him. ``My attorney turned to me and
said, `I thought they were going to boo you,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield had prepared his children for cruel jokes from
classmates, but he said, ``Thankfully, that didn't happen. . . . I
had told them, `Look, your daddy made some mistakes, and somebody
asks you about this, you just say, ``He taught us not to make the
same mistakes so we wouldn't have to suffer like him.'''''

   Life is good, Holyfield says. He is finally living in his
54,000-square foot, $18 million dream house in Fayette County, even
if the decorations have taken a bigger bite out of his budget than
he expected. To furnish the formal living room alone cost $450,000.
But when his decorator sent him a bill for $250,000 for ``bows and
mirrors,'' he drew the line. ``I told her to take it all back,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that finances are a problem. He will earn at least $20
million Saturday, bringing his career ring earnings to $205
million, including $92 million in the last five fights. He could
have afforded the bows and mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Of more importance to Holyfield right now is his legacy. Ring
Magazine recently placed him as the third greatest heavyweight in
history behind only Muhammad Ali and Joe Louis. Holyfield smiled
when asked about that, and then said, ``I'm not done fighting
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he will be soon, although he has said that before.
Before being beaten by Michael Moorer in 1994, Holyfield vowed to
retire in 1996, exclaiming, ``When they snuff out that Olympic
flame, they can snuff me out, too.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about that now, he said, ``I told the truth. They did
snuff me out. But I never said my flame wouldn't be lit again. My
new career started with God. God started promoting me.''
</P>
<P>
   An improbable rebirth in the sport followed. The medical
clearance from the Mayo Clinic after a misdiagnosed heart ailment.
Uneven performances again men were more comfortable, because they
were intimidated by his knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary said, ``Every time we'd take a break, all the men would be
over there by my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taylors also went coastal with their fly rods, guiding
mainly for redfish at Bray's Island Plantation in South Carolina
1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Taylors have had fun, which is a suggestion
both have for the frustrated angler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had days when I've taken some guys down the river that
were tight as banjo strings,'' he recalls. ``We got halfway down
the river, and I'd drop the anchor. I'd sit cross-ways in the boat
and say, `I'm taking a nap. When y'all want to go on down the river
let me know. We're going to enjoy this day. Y'all need to chill out
a little bit. It's not only about catching fish.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not just about catching fish. If a man wants to go
lean up against an old mossy oak tree on the side of the river and
not even string up his rod, that's still fly fishing.

 &HT;    Pricey private streams jump with trophy trout
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIAWASSEE, Ga. _ You don't just lean from the banks of the
Chattahoochee River and catch trout the size that they grow on this
short stretch of stream south of Lake Chatuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They average 22 inches here,'' says Lee Howard, manager of the
Upper Hi Fly Fishing and Outfitters in Hiawassee, whose store also
runs the Hiawassee River Trout Lodge, which includes five cabins
located along the trophy trout stream. ``The biggest one I've ever
gotten out of here was 34 inches (a brown trout). And it probably
weighed 15 or 16 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Places like the Hiawassee River Trout Lodge offer trout-fishing
experiences thought to be available only in a Rocky Mountain
stream. The memory comes at a cost, however. The Hiawassee stream
costs $150 per night for a cabin, but you can also pay a $125 rod
fee for a day's fishing without lodging. Other private streams _
the Brigadoon on the Soque River and Nacoochee Bend on the
Chattahoochee River near Helen _ have similar pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Some cheaper alternatives exist, including state-run Duke's
Creek, Water's Creek and Smith Creek _ the ``lower-income version
of trophy waters,'' says Jeff Durniak, Wildlife Resources Division
regional fisheries supervisor based in Gainesville. It takes only a
$2 parking pass at Duke's and Smith, and a WMA stamp to fish
Water's. There's a 15-angler limit at Duke's, but no limit at the
other two.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for solitude and huge trophies, it's hard to compete with
the private folks,'' Durniak said.
</P>
<P>
   A positive of private streams, he said, is that the owners tend
to be conservation-minded. ``Those proprietors are pretty strong
advocates of trout stream protection,'' he said. ``The more
advocates of conservation the better.

 &HT;    Iverson's leap forward
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the voting were done today, any writer worth the
ink on his or her shirt would jot ``Allen Iverson, Philadelphia
76ers'' on the top line of the NBA's most valuable player ballot.
And he would do it for no reason other than the guy has earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson has been labeled as the epitome of the Generation X
player. That is, one who received a lucrative contract before
earning it, whose attitude and respect for the game have been
questioned, who is far more interested in commercials and sneaker
deals than winning. All that, and he wears his hair in braids and
is more aloof than personable.
</P>
<P>
   Then the 76ers 6-foot guard goes out this season and becomes the
best player in the league. No longer is he the rookie guard who
darted around the court recklessly, forcing up shots from all
angles under duress, while the 76ers took so many defeats.
</P>
<P>
   In his third pro season and second under coach Larry Brown,
Iverson is a paradox _ he plays with a noticeable calm while
inflicting damage in volatile fashion. In the past, he could not
turn that trick, his eagerness to establish himself prompting
selfishness and wildness.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Iverson went into the weekend as the league's No. 1
scorer at 29.1 points a game, which is impressive enough. But more
significant is that he so far has helped turn Philadelphia into _
gulp before saying it _ a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers were 10-6 after Friday's 89-78 loss to the Miami Heat
that ended a six-game winning streak, the longest for the franchise
in 13 years. And each of the victories had a similar theme. Philly
would hold opponents to less than 90 points on one end, and Iverson
would dazzle on the other.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 32.1 points and 7.0 assists during the half-dozen
triumphs, but ``I would rather win than score a lot of points,'' he
said. ``I believe God gave me my talent and gifts. I've just taken
advantage of it and made myself better. I'm willing to work. I want
to use all my ability in a team game. I want to win
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   He is on the correct path. The fact that Iverson is traveling it
with controlled explosion signifies that he's catching on to what
Brown has tried to establish for the last year. He's still
unguardable, but his decision-making has been mostly exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says Iverson is ``playing the game the right way.''
Translation: He is less reliant on long-range jumpers and more
dependent on his unparalleled quickness and speed to penetrate into
the gut of the defense, creating for himself and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The coach made the former Georgetown star an off guard despite
his lack of height, and starts Eric Snow at the point. The move has
taken some of the ball-handling chores off Iverson, who led the
league in turnovers as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen is a point guard with a shooter's mentality,'' Brown
said. ``But he's at his best when he doesn't have all the
ball-handling responsibilities. He's gotten better because he
realized that he couldn't do it by himself. He's making the effort
to improve. He's grown up a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Iverson, who was selected the NBA Player of the Month for
February: ``I show that you can be smaller and still have an impact
on the game. I'm a little quicker, but I also want to be a good
all-around player. Quick is good, but you have to know when to pass
and when to take the shot.

 &HT;    With H.O.O.P., Cato hopes to help
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kelvin Cato, now of the Portland Trail Blazers, last
week released a children's book he wrote called ``H.O.O.P.''
</P>
<P>
   Cato, a 6-foot-11 center, kicked off the NBA's Reading Month
calendar with the unveiling at Portland's Martin Luther King Jr.
Elementary School before 800 students. The letters stand for Help
Out Other People.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and father pushed me to read and do my homework
every day when I was a kid,'' Cato said. ``Now, I have the
opportunity to reach out to kids and teach them how important
reading is through my book. I had such a great time writing this
book over this past year that I plan to create a series in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``H.O.O.P.'' is a colorful, rhyming book about an NBA player who
implores youths to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt: ``I play basketball in the NBA. Hard work and
dedication have given me the right. You won't see me in a gang or
looking for a fight. . . . I stay off the streets at night. My
dream for you _ learn to read and write. . . Have faith and go to a
steeple. Help out other people.''
</P>
<P>
   A CRYING SHAME
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a grand year so far for Seattle's Vin Baker.
First, he showed up for training camp at least 15 pounds
overweight, which affected his mobility, which has affected his
play.
</P>
<P>
   His frustrations reached an apex in San Antonio last week when
he scored just two points, then sat in front of his locker after
the game and wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel awful, just terrible,'' Baker said. ``I feel bad about
my game. I just am not happy with Vin Baker right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And with good reason. He missed 18 straight foul shots to start
the season and is shooting 16 percent from the line. His scoring
average is just over 11 a game, down from 19.2 last year.
</P>
<P>
   But he could be on the rebound. He scored 16 the next outing
against the Spurs and 31 against Sacramento, including a key late
perimeter jumper.
</P>
<P>
   THEY SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominique was one of the best to ever play the game. Now he
can't get in the game. That's the worst way to go out, and I don't
want it to be like that. I just want respect, and he doesn't get
any respect. It's really sad, and I don't want to be that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Magic guard Penny Hardaway said of former Hawk Dominique
Wilkins, who's stranded on the Magic bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it has been (disappointing). It'll all work out.
Sometimes, it's one of those roads you travel. You can't worry
about it. As long as you have my health and my strength, you should
play as long as you feel good,'' Wilkins said of his role with the
team.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To Portland's Brian Grant. Considered trade bait much of his
time with the Trail Blazers, Grant has become a younger version of
Dennis Rodman, leading the league in rebounding while helping
Portland evolve into a serious contender.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To Seattle's Olden Polynice. The SuperSonics big man gave ``the
finger'' to fans at Sacramento's Arco Arena who booed him as he
left the court last week, drawing a $5,000 fine from the NBA.
``(The fans) threw things at me,'' said Polynice, who played for
the Kings for 4 1/2 seasons. ``I'll tell you, if one of them had
hit me, they were going to get dropped.

 &HT;    Doc to coach Spurs?
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Greg Popovich probably will save his coaching position
until he is relieved during the offseason. The reason is the
schedule. The Spurs are in a stretch with 14 of 18 games against
sub-.500 teams, so they'll look better than they are. But there are
problems. Popovich is disliked in San Antonio for the high-handed
manner in which he dumped then-coach Bob Hill on the eve of center
David Robinson's return from a serious back injury two years ago.
Minority owners want him out. One San Antonio columnist, Kevin
O'Keefe, resigned when his bosses told him to stop ripping
Popovich. Attendance is off and the push for a new arena is
stalling. So, who's out there as a prime candidate when Popovich
moves upstairs to concentrate on his general manager job? Why,
ex-Hawks guard Doc Rivers, the Spurs (and TNT) game commentator.
Rivers wants to coach and his other option figures to be in
Washington. Meanwhile, Portland has offered Rasheed Wallace to the
Spurs for San Antonio icon Robinson. It would be a risky political
move for San Antonio, but the Spurs haven't said no, yet.
</P>
<P>
   NO CENSURE FOR MAVS
</P>
<P>
   NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said the league won't take
action against the Mavericks for playing four starters 12 minutes
or less in last week's 80-65 loss at Utah. Mavs coach Don Nelson
admitted he was resting his best players for a home game against
Sacramento (Dallas won it). ``We've had that happen at the end of
the season, when games don't count because a team's playoff
position is already set, and that we don't allow,'' Granik said.
``But I don't think we want to get involved in telling teams how to
play and who they should play.''
</P>
<P>
   BARKLEY SPEAKS
</P>
<P>
   Rockets forward Charles Barkley is impressed with his own quick
recovery from cartilage repair on his left knee. ``I'm very
encouraged. I'm in a lot less pain than when I started, before I
had the surgery. As long as I don't have the swelling, I'll be
fine.'' That leaves Barkley to express other concerns, like NBC's
appetite for the Lakers. ``NBC thinks because they show the Lakers
every weekend they're a championship team. And y'all think because
y'all tell (Lakers guard) Kobe (Bryant) he's Jordanesque, he's
going to be the next Michael Jordan. They're not and he's not. And
I'm sick of hearing it.''
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS' CHARADE
</P>
<P>
   The ``interview process'' in L.A. with Lakers assistants Kurt
Rambis and Larry Drew for fired coach Del Harris' job was a joke.
Rambis was known to be the heir apparent for months, ever since
people close to both Shaquille O'Neal and Bryant put the word out
both wanted him, which also sealed Harris' fate.WEBBER'S PLOY
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber says he is absolutely out of Sacramento after the
2000-2001 season, when his contract runs out, a ploy to get the
Kings to trade him. Skeptics think Webber is playing so well as a
ploy to make a trade appealing for other teams. The key: If he is
still a King, watch his performance after Thursday's deadline.

 &HT;    Avalanche banks on Fleury
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Colorado Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix
views things, the importation of Theoren Fleury should not have
come as any great surprise because, by his count, ``I've traded for
20 players in the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid by Lacroix was that it's hard to imagine another
trade in NHL history that put a team in such a strong position for
a Stanley Cup title and at the same time set up the front office
for an avalanche of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche had long since rebounded from an awful start
(0-4-1, then 17-19-4 before a 12-game winning streak) in part
because of the improved goaltending of Patrick Roy. Acquiring
Fleury from the cash-strapped Calgary Flames _ by which the Flames
kissed off any playoff hopes, although they likely would've lost
the unrestricted free agent after the season _ adds depth to an
offense that already had Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic, Adam Deadmarsh,
Valeri Kamensky and Claude Lemieux. (The Avalanche, in fact, scored
seven goals in the last 22 minutes at Florida Wednesday without
Fleury, who is out indefinitely with a sprained knee.)
</P>
<P>
   The risk? If Lacroix and Fleury speak the truth, there has been
and will be no talks about a contract extension until after the
season. Lacroix called the trade ``purely a hockey decision; it's
not a business matter,'' and Fleury reiterated his desire to test
the free agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado already has sacrificed one of its top prospects (to be
determined) and two players (left winger Rene Corbet and defenseman
Wade Belak) in the trade. If Fleury re-signs, the Avalanche also
will send a first-round pick to Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Colorado moving into the new Pepsi Center next season,
there may not be enough revenue streams to support this team's
growing payroll. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Forsberg will be a restricted free agent after this season and
will command a salary of $8 million to $10 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fleury already has turned down a deal averaging $6.25 million
per year and is expected to land at about $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Avalanche already has signed three key players to
lucrative extensions _ Roy ($7.5 million next season) and
defensemen Sandis Ozolinsh ($4 million) and Adam Foote ($1.2
million).
</P>
<P>
   Factoring in Sakic, who will earn $2 million in the final season
of his deal next year, Lemieux ($2.5 million) and Deadmarsh ($1.8
million), the Avalanche would be committing at least $34 million
for eight players in 1999-2000 if it retains Fleury. That equals
their current payroll for 23 players.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado also has four players scheduled to become unrestricted
free agents after this season: Kamensky, Sylvain Lefebvre, Alexei
Gusarov and Warren Rychel.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix's choice basically is this: 1) re-sign Fleury and be
certain to lose money _ no matter how many ``Fleury'' jerseys are
sold at the concession stands; 2) lose Fleury and get nothing for
the three players.
</P>
<P>
   Well, possibly nothing. If the Avalanche wins the Cup, would
that suffice? Is this merely an expensive, short-term rental?
Lacroix would only say, ``Our ownership wants to win. That's why we
did this. Whatever happens after that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the impending contract talks, Lacroix, a former player
agent, said, ``It's just another file on the pile. We've gotten
commitments lately from Foote and Ozolinsh and Roy. We've been
negotiating hard for seven or eight months with Forsberg. The key
thing now is we have a chance to win the Stanley Cup and build a
relationship with Fleury. But I'm not going to talk about
hypothetical situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix had quietly explored a Fleury trade for two months and
decided to make the move after a Calgary-Los Angeles deal fell
apart three weeks ago when the Kings wanted assurances from Fleury
that he would sign an extension. Colorado had four first-round
draft picks and seven in the first two rounds last season, felt it
could deal because of its depth, although many of the amateurs
remain unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Lacroix's win-now/worry-later attitude is playing
well with his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about next year or whatever is going to
happen,'' Roy said. ``The urgency on our club is right now, not
tomorrow. When you have (stars) like we have, it's something that
you have to look at right away. Maybe tomorrow will be too late.

 &HT;    Hello, I must be going
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Art Williams was back in Atlanta this week to get the
battery in his pacemaker replaced. Presumably, the former insurance
executive was under a bit of strain during his brief but costly run
as owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Williams sold the team for
$100 million, $17 million less than he bought it for 10 months
earlier. But his actual losses will come close to $40 million.
Despite the Lightning's problems on the ice and at the gate, it's a
sweet deal for billionaire Bill Davidson, who also gains control of
the Ice Palace and developmental rights to six acres surrounding
the arena. This was a real-estate deal more than a hockey deal, and
for that reason Tampa fans can be certain the team isn't going
anywhere and Davidson is in this for the long haul. Williams
cleaned up a lot of the mess left by previous ownership but he was
slammed by fans and media recently when he stopped coming to games,
saying he couldn't take the losses, and then deciding to bail out
of his investment quickly. Perhaps trying to repair his image, the
former Georgia high school football coach said of the discounted
sale price, ``If I wanted to auction this thing off, I think I
could get substantially more money, but I wanted to make sure we
had the right owner. I am willing to sell at a discount because
there's no doubt Bill Davidson will be a better sports owner than I
was.''

   GLOVE STORY
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, already shaky defensively, took an obvious step back
when goalie Tom Barrasso was hit on his glove hand by a shot that
shattered a bone and will sideline him for four to six weeks. But
the Penguins could be hurt offensively as much as defensively by
Barrasso's absence. Barrasso arguably is the best puck-handling
goaltender in the league and often intercepts dump-ins by opponents
and starts the Pens' transition game with an outlet pass. His
replacement, Peter Skudra, is weak in that area and probably is too
paranoid about being the No. 1 stopper to spend time worrying about
outlet passes. Coach Kevin Constantine said of Barrasso, ``He gets
the puck by himself out of our zone five to 10 times a game and
takes some of the pressure off us breaking out.''

<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia is making a strong push for Montreal's Mark Recchi
(scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent) or Vladimir
Malakhov before the March 23 trading deadline. ... One interesting
sidelight to Mario Lemieux's bid to lead a new ownership group for
the Pittsburgh Penguins is the former star's refusal to join Pens
co-owner Roger Marino in a takeover bid. Why? Lemieux is suing
Marino for $31.4 million in deferred salary and blames him for
taking the team into bankruptcy. ... Nothing is going right for the
Islanders. Interim coach Bill Stewart totaled his 4x4 truck when he
was cut off by a dump truck. Stewart coached despite having a
concussion. No jokes. ... Buffalo's Matthew Barnaby, who continues
to seek a trade, suited up the first time in two weeks the other
night.

 &HT;    Goaltending the hot topic in Dallas
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ``Big D'' in Dallas is for decision. With the
Stars continuing to win despite the absence of Brett Hull, many in
the Dallas area are focusing on other matters _ such as what the
team will or should do with its goaltending situation. The Dallas
Morning News actually is running a cyberpoll asking, ``Are you
confident Ed Belfour can do the job in the playoffs?'' despite the
fact Belfour is 28-9-8 with a 1.98 goals against average and .912
saves percentage. General manager Bob Gainey also is hearing calls
to train backup Roman Turek (11-2-2, .190, .922) before the Stars
lose him to the Thrashers in the expansion draft. Dallas could be
helped by adding a speedy forward to an aging team.
Belfour-bashers, meanwhile, are convinced the team should protect
Turek, not the veteran, in June. It's conceiveable that if Gainey
does not trade Turek, and that seems unlikely now, the decision on
who to protect will be based on the team's playoff success.
Postscript: So far, 73 percent of those polled have confidence in
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. STORIES
</P>
<P>
   If Los Angeles doesn't make the playoffs, it can blame the
goalie of the crosstown Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Guy Hebert, whom the
Ducks wisely signed to a new contract recently, stopped 33 of 34
Kings shots in a 2-1 win recently and has allowed only three goals
in 122 shots in four games against L.A. this year. The teams
clearly are headed in opposite directions. While the Kings continue
to struggle in what could be coach Larry Robinson's final days, the
Ducks had won 11 of 14 going into the weekend and are 9-2-4 within
the Pacific Division. Anaheim's Paul Kariya said the team can't
afford to get overly confident, especially in light of the fact
only three of the 11 wins during the streak came against winning
teams (Philadelphia, St. Louis, Phoenix). ``It's important when
things are going well to almost bring everyone down sometimes and
remember where we came from and how hard we have to work to
maintain it.'' ... One day in Robinson's life last week: 1) He got
an early phone call that one of his horses died of a heart attack
on a farm in Florida; 2) The Kings lost to the Ducks; 3) After the
game, he learned his mother, Isobel, 78, died near Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Flames general manager Al Coates admission after the Theo Fleury
trade: ``It's fair to say this wasn't our first choice, we wanted
to sign Theo. But frankly and simply it was something we couldn't
do here in Calgary, we can't pay that kind of salary for one player
on our team. It's impossible.'' ... For what it's worth, Fleury and
Colorado stars Peter Forberg and Joe Sakic all share the same
agent, Winnipeg's Don Baizley. Fleury and Forsberg will get new
deals after this year, Sakic after next season, after which Baizley
will be able to purchase half of Canada with his commissions. ...
Count Anaheim's Teemu Selanne among those who favor shootouts to
break ties. ``The fans now leave with 10 minutes left in the game,
but they would stay for the penalty shots,'' he said. ``If you play
four-on-four in overtime (which is being tested in the AHL), if the
ice is bad you can't do anything. Penalty shots are good for the
players and the fans. Maybe not for the goalies.

 &HT;    Don't rile Pitino
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fans in Cleveland learned not to mess with coach Rick
Pitino's young Celtics players.
</P>
<P>
   It happened after Celtics center Eric Riley went up with
Cavaliers center Vitaly Potapenko for a rebound and came down with
a headlock grip. Potapenko, wearing a mask to protect a previously
broken nose, took exception and shoving ensued. Riley was called
for a foul. He and Cavs forward Shawn Kemp were called for a double
technical.
</P>
<P>
   That's when a fan got on Riley and Pitino fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you to criticize anyone,'' Pitino said. ``What an
athletic body you've got. Have another beer. ... I can't believe
you're calling somebody else a CBA player. You making fun of
somebody's body? That's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   CAMBY IN DOGHOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby played himself out of the Knicks' rotation after
Shawn Kemp twice went right over him to score.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy gave Camby another chance in another
game, but he got one basket and one rebound in nine minutes to go
with two blocks. So, the next night against the physical Heat,
Camby sat and watched for the entire game. Next night, he didn't
play again. ... Miami is holding on to Terry Mills, who can't play
because of continued knee problems. The Heat figures his $1.15
million salary may be needed to even a trade, but he's played his
last game for the team.
</P>
<P>
   VAN HORN ON FASHION
</P>
<P>
   About those bizarre new Nets uniforms _ a V-neck jersey
described as cool-metal gray _ New Jersey forward Keith Van Horn
said, ``To tell you the truth, I could care less. I couldn't care
if I was in a tank top and a pair of OP (Ocean Pacific) shorts.
It's just a uniform.'' ... Is this possible? 76ers guard Allen
Iverson's mom, Ann, went to high school with Rick Mahorn, Iverson's
newest teammate.
</P>
<P>
   DALY ON RODMAN
</P>
<P>
   Magic coach Chuck Daly says he never had a chance to be reunited
in Orlando with Lakers forward Dennis Rodman. ``I think he wanted
to go to L.A. all along. I never really thought we had a chance to
get him here. I think he may have started that in order to get some
leverage or something with the Lakers. I think Los Angeles provides
him with just the type of stage that he was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Still pro-Rodman, Daly says, ``He can help educate your people
and because he's willing to do it. He'll do all of the rotations;
he'll do all of the dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love watching Dennis play.''
</P>
<P>
   Krause patient with Floyd
</P>
<P>
   Bulls general manager Jerry Krause says he's pleased with new
coach Tim Floyd: ``General managers generally know what they give a
coach. They know if they give them a 40-win team, a 50-win team. We
gave Phil (Jackson) 60-win teams and he did what he was supposed to
do. We can't give Tim the same kind of team. Our job is to get back
to where we can get Tim the same type of players we gave Phil.''
... Charlotte's Bobby Phills agrees. After losing to the new-look
Bulls, Phills moaned, ``There's no excuse to lose to this Bulls
team.

 &HT;    Bratzke tops Colts' new defensive look
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With a 12th-rated offense that includes a nucleus of
young stars led by quarterback Peyton Manning and tailback Marshall
Faulk, coach Jim Mora went into the spring intent on improving an
Indianapolis Colts defense that ranked No. 29 and squandered five
second-half leads. So far, the results are encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bill Polian added defensive ends Chad Bratzke
and Shawn King, linebacker Cornelius Bennett and strong safety Chad
Cota and signed tackle Ellis Johnson to an extension. The Colts
should land a premier linebacker prospect, likely Chris Claiborne
of Southern Cal, with the fourth choice in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Polian noted last week that if Heisman Trophy tailback Ricky
Williams slips to fourth, as some now think probable, the team
would have a tough time passing him. But Polian probably is
posturing, priming the pump for a potential trade-down with a club
desperately seeking Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The key to turning around a defense that produced only 38 sacks
last year is Bratzke. The Colts are gambling a $9million signing
bonus that his career-best 11 1/2 sacks in '99 were no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Few defenders have as big a motor as Bratzke, but it will be
interesting to see how many sacks the former New York Giants right
end gets now that he won't be with one-gap rushers Michael Strahan,
Robert Harris and Keith Hamilton. Giants officials say only five of
Bratzke's sacks came when he beat a tackle one-on-one, with the
balance coming on combination stunts. He had 8 1/2 sacks his first
four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   MILLER TRYING COMEBACK?
</P>
<P>
   His career ended with a series of concussions, but former
Falcons quarterback Chris Miller is contemplating a comeback at age
33. Miller, who hasn't played since December of '95, recently
worked out for Seattle coach Mike Holmgren and threw the ball very
well. Agent Frank Bauer confirmed that Miller received a positive
evaluation from a Chicago-based neurologist and Seahawks team
doctors are following up with analysis of their own.
</P>
<P>
   TIP SHEET
</P>
<P>
   Former Falcons personnel director Ken Herock will assume the
same position in Green Bay after the draft. The move will reunite
Herock with his best friend, Packers GM Ron Wolf, and son Shaun
Herock, a scout for Green Bay. ... Fueling speculation that
Philadelphia will use the second pick in the draft on a
quarterback, the club had six representatives at the workout of
Central Florida's Daunte Culpepper last week. The Eagles contingent
included new coach Andy Reid, who also attended the workout of
Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb. ... Pittsburgh offensive left
tackle Will Wolford may be reconsidering his retirement. Ralph
Cindrich, agent for the 13-year veteran, is trying to get the
Steelers to release his client. Wolford would then try to find a
Super Bowl contender willing to let him play guard for a year or
two. ... San Diego is close to a deal for quarterback Jim Harbaugh
from Baltimore. Chargers coach Mike Riley still will meet on
Monday, though, with Mark Rypien. ... Giants linebacker Jesse
Armstead has been a no-show at offseason workings, and his absence
is probably a sign he wants his contract reworked. ... Former
Virginia safety Anthony Poindexter, a certain first-rounder before
blowing out his knee, conceded his rookie season in the NFL ``could
be a redshirt year for me.'' ... Minnesota has targeted cornerback
Champ Bailey in the draft and is working to move up for a shot at
the former Georgia star. The Vikings, who lost starting corner
Corey Fuller in free agency, will offer both their first-round
draft choices and wide receiver Jake Reed. ... Some scouts are
wondering how Oregon quarterback Akili Smith scored 12 on the
Wonderlic IQ test at an all-star game and a 37 on the 50-question
quiz at the combine.
</P>
<P>
   MCKITTRICK AILING
</P>
<P>
   The situation hasn't received the attention afforded Walter
Payton, but longtime 49ers offensive line coach Bobb McKittrick
also is in need of a liver transplant. The former Marine has cancer
of the bile duct and likely will need to have his gall bladder
removed as well. Yet McKittrick, 63, has continued to work and is
pragmatic about his condition. ``You see `Saving Private Ryan,' and
the boat comes up and and bow drops, and you've got to go out
because that's what you're paid to do,'' he said. New team
president Bill Walsh has suggested McKittrick cut back his
schedule, and coach Steve Mariucci has asked tight ends coach Pat
Morris to help with the line.
</P>
<P>
   JETS JUGGLING
</P>
<P>
   The addition of free agent linebacker Roman Phifer means Bill
Parcells will accelerate efforts to trade 1997 first-rounder James
Farrior, and it accentuates the dubious job the Jets coach has done
with his first two drafts in New York. Parcells had 23 choices but
got just two starters, offensive tackle Jason Fabini and defensive
tackle Jason Ferguson (formerly of Georgia), in those drafts. In
'97 Parcells could have taken offensive tackle Orlando Pace or
defensive tackle Darrell Russell, both of them superior prospects.
Instead he traded down twice, collected extra middle-round picks
and chose Farrior, who has been inconsistent as a weakside 'backer.
Phifer, a superb athlete who has been a chronic underachiever in
his eight-year career, will get more chances to blitz under Jets
defensive boss Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   GIANTS MERRY-GO-ROUND
</P>
<P>
   As if the addition of free agent Kerry Collins wasn't enough,
the track record of Giants coach Jim Fassel also suggests starting
quarterback Kent Graham will be unemployed by next spring. In 1997,
Fassel publicly backed Dave Brown in preseason, replaced him with
Danny Kanell at midseason, then discarded him. Last spring Fassel
announced Kanell would be unchallenged for the starting job,
supplanted him with Graham at the 10-game mark and then cut Kanell
two weeks ago. Now Fassel is saying Graham is his starter. The
four-year, $16.9 million contract awarded Collins by GM Ernie
Accorsi, including a $5 million signing bonus, suggests
otherwise.FALCONS FODDER
</P>
<P>
   The New York-to-Suwanee pipeline that helped net Kanell might
not be turned off yet. The Falcons maintain an interest in free
agent guard Greg Bishop, a four-year starter for the Giants. ...
Coach Dan Reeves has a high regard now for Kanell, but in the 1996
draft he wanted then-GM George Young to select defensive lineman
Shane Burton, and not the quarterback, in the fourth round.

 &HT;    Waddell won't change much with Orlando Solar Bears
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thrashers GM Don Waddell doesn't figure to make any
radical changes with the IHL's Orlando Solar Bears, signed as the
team's top minor-league affiliate. Why? Waddell was Orando's GM for
the first two seasons before moving on to Detroit and hired the
team's current coach, Curt Fraser, and assistant Peter Horachek.
Fraser went 147-78-21 (.640) in his first three seasons and is
34-24-2 this year.
</P>
<P>
   John Weisbrod, who replaced Waddell as GM, said it shouldn't be
assumed the entire roster will be stocked with Atlanta prospects
next season. The current agreement between the teams leaves open
the number of players the Thrashers will supply next season because
of the uncertainty of who will make the NHL roster and who will be
worth retaining in the organization. Weisbrod anticipates about a
50-50 split of personnel on the roster between prospects and
unattached players. ``There will be more competition for jobs next
year because the talent pool will be expanded,'' Weisbrod said.
``But I wouldn't say everybody's job will be in jeopardy.
Traditionally we turn over about half our roster every year. Even
with the influx of players from Atlanta, this may not be much
different. It's just hard to tell right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential No. 1 pick in the amateur draft _ and a potential
Thrasher _ is back on the ice. Center Patrik Stefan, an 18-year-old
Czech playing with the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the IHL, returned
last week after missing three months with a concussion and bruised
spinal column. Stefan, who is rated as the top prospect by the
NHL's Central Scouting, must be feeling better because he scored
the Ice Dogs' first goal in his first game back. Stefan wore a neck
brace for a few weeks, but his agent, Rich Winter, said the long
absence was primarily precautionary.
</P>
<P>
   CLASS OF '99
</P>
<P>
   Of 66 previous winners of the Calder Trophy for the NHL's Rookie
of the Year, only nine came out of the college ranks, most recently
North Dakota goalie Ed Belfour in 1991 (with Chicago). But three of
the top four rookie scorers in the league this season are from
college. The current rookie leaders:
</P>
<P>
   Player (Team) _ College/Juniors _ G-A-Pts.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Muckalt (Van.) _ Michigan _ 16-18-34
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Jan Hrdina (Pitt.) _ Juniors (Seattle) _ 9-22-31
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Morrison (N.J.) _ Michigan _ 8-22-30
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Oleg Kvasha (Fla. ) _ Europe (Russia) _ 10-10-20
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Briere (Phoe.) _ Juniors (Drummondville) _ 8-11-19
</P>
<P>
   FACE-OFF: TEEMU SELANNE
</P>
<P>
   _ Team, pos: Anaheim, RW.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hometown: Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: Had 34 goals, 45 assists, 79 points through 54 games,
third in the league. Named the NHL's player of the month for
February, with 25 points (12 goals) in 13 games to lead the Mighty
Ducks, who were 10-3-0. Last week scored his 300th career goal in
his 464th game, the sixth fastest to 300 in league history. Coming
off consecutive 50-goal seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ On what makes a great goal scorer: ``Great scorers can read
what other players are going to do. A lot of great scorers are not
real good skaters. But they know where the puck is going to be and
they know where other players are. I also try to study goalies so
that I know where their weaknesses are.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the two-ref system: ``It's a different game but I like it
because there are a lot of things one referee can't see. They
should give the referees more power to call different things, like
whether somebody is standing in the crease (during a goal). That
shouldn't be decided by an official upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rule changes that need to be implemented: ``The biggest thing
they should do is after overtime I would be happy to see penalty
shots (a shootout). It would make the games much more exciting if
they did that.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, snow fell at the rate of 1 inch per hour across
portions of Pennsylvania as a strengthening low-pressure center
crossed the Middle Atlantic States.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, this low will further intensify as it draws energy
from the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, a swath of
heavy snow will fall over interior New England with over a foot of
windswept snow occurring from the White Mountains of New Hampshire
to central and northern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the low, very gusty winds from the northwest will import
unseasonably cold air into the Great Lakes on Sunday with the
strongest winds occurring across eastern sections of this region.
</P>
<P>
   As the frigid air gathers moisture in transit over the unfrozen
lake waters, snow showers will form southeast of Lake Erie and over
central New York. Meanwhile, dry and cooler air will surge into the
Southeast on Sunday but it will stay warm over southern and central
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of light snow will develop in the northern Plains as winds
from the south direct increasingly moist air northward. Meanwhile,
patchy rain will occur farther south near a warm front draped
across the Red River Valley. Some light sleet could fall in Kansas,
especially on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snow will accompany a jet-stream disturbance crossing the
mountains of northern Arizona and southern Utah on Sunday. Patchy
clouds and lighter rain showers will speckle the lowlands of the
interior West. Elsewhere, light rain should arrive Sunday afternoon
in western Washington while the remainder of the West Coast stays
dry and cool.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Of Lions and Lambs
</P>
<P>
   For much of the Northeast, March has had a stormy start with
episodes of heavy snow and strong winds from the Middle West to New
England. The weather folklore ``in like a lion, out like a lamb''
would suggest that the month will end on a more tranquil note. Much
folklore began in early America as farmers carefully observed
nature in hopes of finding clues to upcoming weather. Though
individual observations may have been accurate, the conclusions
that were drawn were not universally true. Indeed, there is no
known reliable connection between the weather at the start and at
the end of March.

METS' NOMO IS HAVING A WILD TIME AT SPRING TRAINING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Publicly, the Mets are saying that Hideo
Nomo's control is back to where it was a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``His command has been very impressive,'' Bob Apodaca, the
pitching coach, recently insisted. It is a sentiment that has been
echoed by most of the team's brass.
</P>
<P>
   But when Nomo was asked on Friday about the control that has
gradually deserted him over the last two seasons, his response was
telling on the eve of his first spring start.
</P>
<P>
   With no translator around, Nomo _ who was scheduled to toss a
couple of innings against his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers,
here Saturday _ understood the question immediately.
</P>
<P>
   How has your control been on your fastball? ``So-so,'' the
Japanese pitcher said in English, shrugging his shoulders to
punctuate the response.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Mets' front office will even suggest that Nomo is
still the pitcher whose wildness caused him to walk 56 batters in
892/3 innings last season after the Mets had acquired him from the
Dodgers on June 4. And that is probably because it is too early to
tell, what with Nomo _ and the rest of the pitchers _ throwing
mostly on the side thus far.
</P>
<P>
   There are lingering questions about the soundness of Nomo's
shoulder, but it is in the best interest of the Mets not to
acknowledge them. Nomo, who was dropped from the team's rotation in
the final month of last season, signed a one-year deal for $2.975
million this season.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Mets decide that Paul Wilson _ who threw an
impressive two innings in Friday night's exhibition opener, an 8-4
victory over Montreal in Jupiter, Fla. _ is major league ready, the
Mets might try to peddle Nomo somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   And if there are no takers, the Mets could always release the
30-year-old right-hander later this month. The Mets' budget has
climbed over its owner-mandated preseason target of $65 million to
nearly $68 million, a figure that ranks the team among the top five
in the major leagues. Should the Mets release Nomo this month, they
will have to pick up either one-sixth of Nomo's salary or
one-fourth, depending on the date of the release.
</P>
<P>
   Should Nomo begin this season with the Mets, his contract
immediately becomes guaranteed. But General Manager Steve Phillips
and members of his staff scoffed at suggestions that Nomo was still
struggling and that he could become a candidate for early release.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff is every bit as good as it ever was,'' Apodaca said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But that was true last year, when opposing batters hit .226
against him (lower than against both Kevin Brown and John Smoltz).
Left-handers particularly struggled against Nomo, batting only
.210.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that Nomo could not find the plate. And the
problem is continuing. Since his arrival from Japan in 1996, Nomo's
strikeouts have slipped each year from 236 to 234 to 233 to 167.
His walks, however, have risen from 78 to 85 to 92 to 94.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent side session, Nomo appeared to be high with his
fastball when he was throwing out of the windup. His command,
however, appeared sharper out of the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Later, his catcher that day, the rookie Mike Kinkade (who is
normally an infielder), said that Nomo's control appeared to be
fine. And another player who has caught Nomo this spring, Todd
Pratt, reported that the pitcher's control was above average _
compared with his velocity, which seemed to be just average.
</P>
<P>
   If Nomo's command has indeed returned, his re-emergence as a
dominating force could help transform what looks like a solid Mets
rotation on paper to one of the best in the league. Nomo was
considered an ace early on with the Dodgers. Should he establish
himself this season as a solid No. 2 pitcher behind Al Leiter, the
Mets might seriously have a chance to challenge the Braves'
decade-long dominance of the National League East.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But should Nomo struggle, the back of the Mets' rotation looks a
little suspect. Rick Reed has tired badly over the last two
seasons. Bobby Jones is 12-15 since opening the 1997 season with a
12-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   And Masato Yoshii, who was surprisingly re-signed by the Mets
for $5 million over the next two seasons, has shown a propensity to
allow home runs, as he did again during the first inning Friday
night. The Expos' young star Vladimir Guerrero tagged Yoshii for a
two-run shot well beyond the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, therefore, seems to be a key to a veteran Mets staff. This
week, manager Bobby Valentine cautioned that Nomo's spring
statistics may not be indicative of how will he fare this year.
Valentine said that Nomo's numbers in the spring have always been
high, because he concentrates first on his fastball, then his
curve, then finally his forkball _ and sometimes throws only one
pitch an entire outing. But there is no question that Nomo needs to
harness his fastball if he is to be effective this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spring he really has been focused on the fastball,''
Apodaca said. ``He recognizes it is the pitch he was most
inconsistent with last year.''

WEEKS OF BOMBING LEAVE IRAQ'S POWER STRUCTURE UNSHAKEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(Subs to clarify time elements in grafs 1, 3, 19, 25.)  By STEVEN LEE MYERS and TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This week, an American diplomat named Frank
Ricciardone will take on a new job. His mission is as simple as it
is difficult: unify the fractured Iraqi opposition, topple Saddam
Hussein and build a democratic nation from the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been pursuing the same goal on
three tracks: bombing Iraq in a slow-motion war, succoring the
opposition with words and ideas, plotting to subvert the pyramid of
soldiers and spies that supports the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the United States has been striking Iraq from
the air for 10 weeks now, and last week American planes loosed the
biggest barrage of bombs since December. At last count, American
and British jets have bombed Iraq on 30 separate days _ roughly
every other day _ since Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The jets have struck at least 104 targets, 4 more than they hit
during the major American and British barrage over four days last
year, damaging or destroying surface-to-air missile sites,
anti-aircraft artillery, radar towers and communications centers.
In a report to Congress on Wednesday, President Clinton said Iraq's
air defenses had been ``degraded substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are working to do is to help create the political and
military conditions that will permit a successful change of the
regime,'' said Walter B. Slocombe, under secretary of defense for
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon officials are among the first to acknowledge that
bombs alone cannot topple Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The American military commander in the Persian Gulf region has
said repeatedly that the task of creating a legitimate alternative
to Saddam appears hopeless for now, given the disunity of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the hope for a coup rests on the impact of the tons of
bombs falling on Iraqi military sites. But allies of the United
States in the region, especially Saudi Arabia and Turkey, are
increasingly impatient with the American program of bombs and
bombast.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no clear evidence so far that the bombings have
eroded Saddam's power structure, best envisioned as a pyramid of
perhaps 100 trusted men, sitting atop half a million soldiers,
spies and political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Ricciardone, the State Department official named
to the newly created position of policy coordinator, has said he
envisions a sudden demise for the regime in Iraq, a country he does
know.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, during the Iran-Iraq war, he helped try to
normalize relations between the United States and Iraq. He was
second-in-command of the shuttered American Embassy after the 1991
Persian Gulf war, working out of Amman, Jordan and London.
</P>
<P>
   He is one among many in the administration who sees political
thunderclouds gathering over Saddam, though no one will predict
when a storm might occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most likely, there will be a military coup,'' he said last
week in an interview with a newspaper in Ankara, Turkey, where he
is ending a stint as deputy chief of the American Embassy. ``It
will be very sudden and without warning.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which confirmed the content of his
remarks, said Ricciardone could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger,
said that Saddam's repeated efforts to shoot down American or
British jets over Iraq showed his weakness, not his strength. ``His
ineffectiveness in stopping us has undercut him to some degree,''
Berger said in an interview. The challenges are meant ``to
demonstrate his power,'' he added. ``Instead he looks
ineffectual.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official said that Saddam is ``nervous
and off-balance.'' Another official, who also spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said: ``We think we see Saddam flailing. We
are working toward a slow whittling-down of his power, his
authority and his nerves. There are reports of military guys
perhaps not following orders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not spent a penny of a $97
million fund created by Congress to finance Iraqi opposition, one
indication of its thinking about the likelihood of its success.
</P>
<P>
   There is understandably some revulsion in the Arab world about
superpowers plotting insurrections in the region. Few in the
administration have any idea who or what could succeed Saddam,
except perhaps chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of these sensitivities, the administration has
tried to draw as little attention as possible to the air strikes.
On Feb. 26, in a major foreign policy speech nearly 7,000 words
long, Clinton devoted one sentence to Iraq and said nothing about
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, too, is giving out less and less information about
the bombing, withholding the familiar grainy videos of attacks and
refusing to discuss the damage in detail. Military officials say
their silence is an effort to minimize sympathy that might be
generated in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. military official said the bombing of Iraqi
communications sites and command centers appears to have reduced
the central government's ability to communicate effectively with
military units.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said, ``The morale of Iraqi air
defenses is pretty low.'' It is not so low, however, that Iraqi
radar operators have refrained from tracking American planes and
giving pilots the justification they need to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pounding, there are signs Iraq is able to recover.
In his report to Congress last week, Clinton said Iraq had repaired
an oil refinery that had been damaged in December's raids. The
refinery has resumed generating illegal profits for Saddam's
government. A senior administration official said Iraq had also
``made an effort to reconstitute'' military facilities destroyed in
the raids as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says it is trying to balance risks against rewards.
The delicacy of that balance was clear last week when American jets
attacked two radio towers that the Pentagon said relayed messages
to Iraqi air defenses but that also, it turned out, controlled the
flow of oil through Iraq's pipeline to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who arrived for a
week-long visit to the Persian Gulf region, indicated publicly that
the strikes on the towers were a mistake. ``We're very sensitive to
that and we want to make sure we don't disrupt the flow of oil
going into Turkey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By disrupting the U.N. program that allows Iraq to sell oil for
food and medicine, the United States had handed Iraq a public
relations victory, officials and diplomats said, creating some
sympathy for the suffering of ordinary Iraqis and building some
momentum for an end to the attacks. ``It's really one of those
traps Saddam's trying to draw us into,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest trap would be losing an American pilot. The Pentagon
has increased the number of helicopter-borne emergency rescue teams
dispatched to the region, standing by to dart into Iraq on a rescue
mission should a plane go down.

 &HT;    Parched Florida faces new threat from raging fires
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM COAST, Fla. _ Tara Cromer doesn't need any state officials
to warn her that fire-scarred Florida is dry and in danger of a new
round of wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   After last summer's blazes singed her new home with $39,000 in
damage and turned her neighborhood's lovely pine forest into
blackened stumps and cinders, Cromer has a nose for the slightest
whiff of wood smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up one morning and smelled smoke and almost crawled out
of my skin,'' Cromer said, standing in the once-lush Seminole Woods
neighborhood, now a sooty plain. ``My husband had to calm me down.
They were doing a controlled burn nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cromers and thousands of other Floridians who lived through
last summer's wildfire nightmare are worried by the unusually dry
winter _ and the prospect that a dry spring could lead to another
dangerous summer.
</P>
<P>
   NO RELIEF IN SIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Weather experts are not encouraging, saying the current
large-scale pattern that has brought a mild, dry winter to the
South will likely continue into the spring and maybe even the
summer. Mobile, Ala., just experienced its driest February on
record.
</P>
<P>
   The experts warn that the wildfires that have already broken out
in Florida, South Carolina and other states may get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a regionwide event,'' said Michael Helfert, director of
the Southeastern Regional Climate Center in Columbia, S.C. ``The
long-range climate forecast is for more of the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter is normally fire season in Florida and other parts of the
South, as dry conditions lead to what are typically small fires
that are relatively easy to control.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida has seen more than its routine number of fires this
winter, jumping from the expected 8 to 10 fires a day to 20 to 30
fires each day statewide. Thunderstorms last week did little to
alleviate the dryness, which contributed to more than 250 wildfires
that had burned more than 5,000 acres by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to sound alarmist, but we're entering drought
conditions in many parts of the state and there doesn't appear to
be any relief in sight in the short term,'' said state
meteorologist Andy Devanas. ``And the long-term forecast doesn't
look favorable, either.''
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of Central Florida, drought index readings have
topped 600 on an 800-point scale, with 800 representing bone-dry.
Several parts of the state hit the high 700s last summer, when
Florida was consumed in a frightening wildfire inferno.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 acres burned, destroying 342 homes. The fires
were so bad officials closed a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 95
and ordered the evacuation of an entire county _ Flagler, just
north of Daytona Beach. The crisis hit on the Fourth of July
weekend, prompting the cancellation of Daytona Beach's Pepsi 400
NASCAR race, which cost the state's precious tourism industry
millions.
</P>
<P>
   This winter's fires haven't remotely approached the scale of
last summer's disaster. The largest fires are burning hundreds of
acres, not thousands, and so far only two mobile homes have been
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   But last weekend, a fire prompted evacuation of the Gatorland
tourist attraction in Kissimmee, while thick smoke combined with
fog just west of Orlando triggered several car wrecks that sent a
dozen people to the hospital Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Just like last summer, authorities suspect some of the fires
have been deliberately set, and they are warning that any arsonists
caught will be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Climatologists say the culprit in the latest round of disturbing
weather is another large-scale phenomenon with a catchy nickname.
Last summer, it was El Nino, a warming of Pacific Ocean waters that
disrupted the jet stream and caused massive, worldwide weather
events, including Florida's desertlike drought.
</P>
<P>
   Now El Nino _ named for the Christ child by South American
fisherman because it usually appears around Christmastime _ has
been displaced by its ``sister,'' La Nina, an infusion of cold
water in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Nina is typically strongest from March to May, which means
the dry, warm weather in the Southeast will continue,'' Helfert
said. ``It's not unusual for La Ninas to last for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted Florida officials to warn the public to clear
brush and overhanging trees away from their homes, creating a clear
zone of 30 feet or more around any structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not have a short memory,'' said Gene Madden, spokesman
for the Florida Division of Forestry. ``We're also urging people
with large properties to conduct prescribed burns to remove the
fuel that helped cause last summer's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   UNDERBRUSH CURTAILED
</P>
<P>
   Officials are hoping they won't see a repeat of last year's
fiery disaster. One factor in their favor: This winter's drought is
holding back the underbrush, although a prolonged drought will
leave whatever remains on the ground bone-dry. Last winter Florida
was deluged with heavy rains, which sparked the growth of thick
underbrush, creating more fuel for the summer fires
</P>
<P>
   Anyone taking the fire threat lightly should visit Flagler
County and neighborhoods such as Seminole Woods. What were once
lush hideaways with homes tucked onto forested lots are now barren
moonscapes marked by stumps and mounds of blackened debris.
</P>
<P>
   The Cromers bought their home just four months before last
summer's fires nearly destroyed it. Once they couldn't even see the
house across the street because the trees were so thick, but now
they watch huge trucks roar down I-95 more than a mile away across
the blackened plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we moved here was for the trees and the
privacy,'' said Mark Cromer. ``Now people are starting to put up
privacy fences. They don't want to have to walk outside and look at
this.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, the Rev. David Vannoy's family is just
finishing rebuilding the home they lost to last summer's fires.
While losing the house was bad enough, the family almost got
trapped when they tried to escape the blazes and had to drive down
a road surrounded by roaring flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``A firestorm is unlike anything you've seen,'' Vannoy said.
``It creates its own wind that just pushes it along. It's like a
tidal wave, except it's fire.

WEST'S BOSNIA MOVE MAY HURT KOSOVO BID

<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary _ Just before peace talks on Kosovo are due to
resume, the United States and its allies are sending contradictory
signals to Belgrade, making it less likely that President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia will capitulate on American terms.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the West opened a new front of diplomatic
confrontation with Milosevic, this time in Bosnia. The Western
envoy who essentially runs Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, fired the
elected Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, and announced that
the strategic northern Bosnian town of Brcko was to be taken out of
Bosnian Serb hands.
</P>
<P>
   Officials asserted that the timing was coincidental, but the
unseating of an elected official may increase Milosevic's anger
with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with the United States and Europe on the verge of a
trade war over bananas, Europeans in NATO are increasingly
skeptical about American pressure for a bombing campaign against
Belgrade, senior NATO-nation diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has not responded to egregious Yugoslav violations of an
October cease-fire agreement _ largely, the diplomats say, because
the rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army have also violated the
agreements in a worsening but predictable Balkan cycle of attack
and reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are openly embracing one side in a situation
where the fighting and the blame are not, unfortunately,
one-sided,'' a senior NATO-nation diplomat closely involved in
Kosovo said Saturday, pointing to another ambush of a Serbian
police patrol by the rebels. ``When we say we do not want NATO to
be the KLA's air force, some of us actually mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough language ``is fine in its place,'' the diplomat said.
``But in the end there is going to have to be a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   While American officials _ including President Clinton on Friday
_ repeat threats of NATO bombing if Milosevic does not capitulate
and allow foreign troops on sovereign Yugoslav territory, the State
Department announced on Friday that American diplomats would now
return to Belgrade. So-called nonessential staff and families had
left Belgrade in February in a big show intended to underscore the
credibility of NATO's threat to bomb Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Their return now is sure to send the opposite message: that NATO
airstrikes are more remote than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Friday's twin moves in Bosnia were not connected.
But senior American officials had said the timing of the Brcko
decision, originally scheduled for March 1, would be affected by
the state of the negotiations over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs are cooperating on Bosnia, a senior American
official said in late February, ``we don't want Brcko to hit them
in the teeth at the same time as Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Serbs are not cooperating, and the firing of
Poplasen, the Bosnian Serb president, combined with Brcko, may have
been intended to remind Milosevic of the risks he is running.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Balkans invariably produce unintended consequences.
Poplasen, a hard-line Serbian ally of Milosevic, was freely elected
in September in Western-monitored voting. One reason he won was the
open embrace Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright gave his
rival, Biljana Plavsic, who had broken with Karadzic and supported
the Dayton peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Poplasen was fired, according to Westendorp, for not supporting
the Dayton accord and not allowing a more moderate acting prime
minister, Milorad Dodik, to be confirmed in office.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodik, a Western favorite, quit on Friday, because he could
not stomach the Brcko decision. Dodik had long said he would resign
``on moral grounds'' if Brcko, which straddles the narrow land
corridor linking Serbian holdings in eastern and western Bosnia,
was taken from Bosnian Serb jurisdiction. On Friday, he did just
that, leaving Western diplomats scrambling to get him to change his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Bosnian Serb who is in the country's joint
three-man presidency, Zivko Radisic, also resigned. That leaves the
political structure created by the Dayton accord to run Bosnia in
disarray. The Bosnian Serb vice president also declined to assume
the presidency after Poplasen was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   As the victims and refugees mount again in Kosovo, Albright
insists that ``force is the only language Milosevic understands.''
But Milosevic is also looking for benefits and sweeteners for
handing over a prize as big as Kosovo, and Washington has thus far
offered none.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs argue that if Milosevic understands only force, that is
also true of Kosovo's Albanians, who traditionally have sustained
feuds for generations. Both sides are also prepared to take
apparently illogical risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dress in Western clothes and drink espresso,'' said
Aleksandr Tijanic, a Serbian journalist and former information
minister. ``But our minds are Oriental, like the Albanians. The
Americans are reasonable people and expect others to be reasonable.
But for honor, pride and revenge, we very often act against our own
interests.''

STATE DEPARTMENT PUTS SNAG IN ORIOLES-CUBA EXHIBITIONS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAINES CITY, Fla. _ Representatives of Major League Baseball,
the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban government went into a meeting
in Washington Friday night with a deal in principle for a game in
Havana March 28, but they emerged early Saturday with nothing set
and the game in possible peril.
</P>
<P>
   The representatives planned to meet again Saturday to try to
salvage the game that, a participant in the meeting said, had been
put on hold by State Department objections to the proposed
recipients of any proceeds from the game.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, the participant said Saturday, had told
the commissioner's office and the Orioles to make an agreement with
the Cuban government, which they did. ``But then,'' the person
said, ``they came in and said conditions had to be changed. That
happened about four times last night.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball people who attended the Friday meeting expected it
to be relatively brief, perhaps an hour and a half, the person
said, with the topics of discussion the logistics for the game in
Cuba and a possible second game in Baltimore. They expected to put
in place the deal in principle reached earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   But eight or so hours later, shortly after 4 a.m., the meeting
broke up with no agreement. ``The hangup,'' the participant said,
``was over the issue of the proceeds.''
</P>
<P>
   The people negotiating the game believed they had dispensed with
that issue because no proceeds from the Havana game are expected.
But the State Department representatives who attended the meeting
opposed the agreement baseball and Cuba had reached and refused to
approve the game.
</P>
<P>
   Among those present at the meeting were three representatives
from the State Department, four from the Cuban government, Sandy
Alderson of Major League Baseball, Peter Angelos of the Orioles,
William Schweitzer, the American League lawyer, and Michael Weiner
and Tony Bernazard of the Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this past week, Alderson had said a decision on the game
would be reached by the end of the week. He didn't say that was a
deadline, but there realistically is a deadline. Commissioner Bud
Selig has set a meeting for 7:30 a.m. Monday at his office in New
York to put details for the game in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a deal in place before then, there won't be a
game,'' the meeting participant said.
</P>
<P>
   If the game is played, the Orioles are expected to take the
players who will start for them during the season. ``They aren't
interested in losing,'' said a person with knowledge of the team's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   If the Havana game is scheduled, a second game could be played
in Baltimore next month. The Orioles' preferred date is April 3,
but the game could be played later in April. The Orioles are not
scheduled on three consecutive Mondays, April 12, 19 and 26. &QL;

LEOPOLD H. JUST, 95, DESIGNED BRIDGES AND HIGHWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leopold H. Just, a Latvian-born sojourner who came to
New York to study medicine, took an engineering detour through
Brooklyn and ended up building highways and bridges all over the
world, died on Feb. 25 at a nursing home in Newport, R.I. He was 95
and as a partner in the Ammann &AMP; Whitney firm of consulting
engineers had had a hand in designing virtually every major bridge
in New York City from the George Washington to the Verrazano.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear where Just got his desire to be a doctor. His
father made a fortune importing fruits and vegetables. But by the
time Just was ready to go to college, he had decided on a career in
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that shortly after he arrived in New York in
1921 to begin undergraduate studies at City College, his father's
business failed.
</P>
<P>
   So, inspired by an uncle in Pittsburgh who was an engineer, Just
switched his sights to engineering and began working with the
consulting firm of Moran &AMP; Proctor even before earning a degree in
civil engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in
1929. He earned a law degree from New York University two years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Although he apparently went to law school primarily to satisfy a
general thirst for knowledge, Just said later that it had helped
him negotiate engineering contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The event that gave his career its eventual shape came in 1931
when Just left Moran &AMP; Proctor and joined the Port of New York
Authority (as it was known at the time), where he came to the
attention of its legendary Swiss-born chief engineer, Othmar H.
Ammann, who became known as New York's master bridge builder.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Just helped design parts of the George
Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel, then left in 1938 to
design tunnels and ventilation buildings for the Pennsylvania
Turnpike Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to New York in 1940, he became a structural engineer
with Ammann, who had established his own consulting practice after
leaving the Port Authority and designing the Golden Gate Bridge in
San Francisco, which in 1937 eclipsed the George Washington as the
world's longest suspension bridge.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two years working on the La Guardia Airport
pedestrian bridge over the Grand Central Parkway and other Ammann
projects, Just joined another consulting company, Frederic R.
Harris Inc., specializing in harbor structures, floating dry docks
and the like, before returning to Ammann in 1944 as chief
draftsman, a post he continued to hold after Ammann, an
acknowledged steel genius, teamed up with a renowned concrete man,
Charles S. Whitney, to create Ammann &AMP; Whitney in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Just, who became chief engineer in 1952 and a
partner in 1958, was in the center of a whirlwind, supervising as
many as 100 engineers, designers and draftsmen at a time as the
firm undertook a variety of far-flung projects, including highways,
bridges and tunnels; railroad, airport and waterfront buildings;
dams, military installations and other structures.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Just, who specialized in bridges and highways,
played a central role in designing the Walt Whitman Bridge in
Philadelphia, the Throgs Neck Bridge linking the Bronx and Queens,
the lower level of the George Washington Bridge, and, most notably,
the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge linking Staten Island with Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   At the time it opened in 1964, the Verrazano, with a central
span of 4,260 feet, was the world's longest suspension bridge, and
among the complications Just had to contend with was the unsettling
fact that because of the curvature of the earth, the 690-foot-high
towers are 1| inches farther apart at their tops they are at the
waterline.
</P>
<P>
   From 1964 until his retirement in 1970, Just was a man on the
move as the Ammann &AMP; Whitney partner in charge of international
operations, among them a 150-mile highway in Bangladesh, a jet
hangar in Karachi, a 100-mile highway in Iran, an airport terminal
in Athens and military installations in the Philippines, Thailand
and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   His many other projects included work on the New York State
Thruway; the Garden State Parkway; the Wisconsin, New Jersey, Ohio
and Connecticut Turnpikes; Dulles Airport, the Long Island
Expressway and the Washington Metro system, and though his work on
the Verrazano was clearly his peak achievement, he was proudest of
an earlier project _ the 330-foot Harlem River pedestrian bridge to
Wards Island.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the Verrazano, it is a pipsqueak bridge, but it
had special meaning to Just as the first one he had full charge of.
</P>
<P>
   As for his medical aspirations, Just, a longtime Manhattan
resident whose survivors include his wife, Evelyn; a brother, Max
of Meaux, France; three sons and five grandchildren, did not so
much abandon his dreams as defer them for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Although two of his sons, Edward, a consulting engineer in
Dallas, and Robert, a banker in Baltimore, resisted their father's
urgings, his other son, Samuel, of Jamestown, R.I., became a
doctor.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When Bill and Susan Winkler decided to send their
daughter Caroline to the Renfrew Center for treatment of her eating
disorder, they knew it was a $16,000 commitment. They also knew
people with eating disorders often need to return for further
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to think about it as if it were another deadly
disease,'' Susan Winkler says. ``If Caroline had cancer and we knew
going in that we had to spend $16,000 for three weeks of treatment,
we wouldn't even hesitate. Then if the cancer came back and she had
to go for more treatment, we certainly wouldn't be disappointed in
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents would go to any expense to save their children.
Why should this be any different?''
</P>
<P>
   But many parents can't afford five-figure medical fees out of
their pockets, whatever the stakes. Unlike treatments for most
deadly diseases, treatment for eating disorders is rarely covered
by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   How many people, wondered Caroline, go without that treatment
because their families don't have the money? The internationally
renowned Renfrew Center is expensive, but good treatment for eating
disorders doesn't come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, she began establishing a foundation to fund
treatment scholarships soon after her return from Renfrew in late
January. It's called the SOS Foundation, for Save Our Selves, a
term used repeatedly in her treatment at Renfrew.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler also hopes to talk to as many people as she can about
eating disorders, whether at school assemblies or at creative
seminars following, for example, a prom fashion show. ``I want to
help some people's lives,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation still is being established, but people can
contact Winkler by e-mail at sosfound(at)glasscity.net or by mail
in care of 679 Lyons Road, Centerville, OH, 45458.

 &HT;    Family, medical professionals help recovery from anorexia
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    EDs: EMBARGOED for Monday, March 8
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ So that's what a heart attack feels like,
Caroline Winkler thought. She knew anorexics' hearts gave out
eventually, but could that really be happening to her? She had been
starving herself for less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   She still weighed more than 90 pounds at 5 feet 6 inches. She
didn't actually consider herself anorexic. Anorexics were supposed
to be real thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought she was dying,'' Winkler's mother, Susan,
says of those moments last summer. Only at the hospital did the
Winklers learn Caroline had suffered not a heart attack but a panic
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Panic attacks aren't typical symptoms of anorexia, but
psychological symptoms in general are, says Kara Fowler, Winkler's
registered dietician at Nutrition Access Inc. in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   She says few people understand that food is not the underlying
problem for people with eating disorders, but a way they cope with
psychological issues. Like a flu patient's sore throat, food is a
symptom rather than a cause, so regular meals don't cure anorexia
any more than a cough medicine cures flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason Caroline has done so much in moving toward
recovery is her recognition that this is not about food and weight
and appearance,'' Fowler says. Winkler hopes her story will help
others recognize and treat eating disorders across the spectrum
from anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa to compulsive and binge
eating.
</P>
<P>
   If the first panic attack had an up side, Susan says, it was
that Winkler finally started seeing she had a problem. Progress was
excruciatingly slow and erratic even from there, but Winkler's four
or five panic attacks a day, and the insomnia that limited her
sleep to two or three hours, made it more inconvenient to minimize
her weight.
</P>
<P>
   So did the edict from executive director Dermot Burke of the
Dayton Ballet, where Winkler danced with the second company. She
had to gain weight before she could perform, he told her. Dancing
in her condition would be too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still in denial that there was anything wrong with me,''
Winkler says. ``I said, 'I just have a fast metabolism.' I told
people, 'I eat.' I did eat some, so I wasn't anorexic. That would
have meant not eating at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And those wakeful nights weren't doing much for Winkler's
patience and disposition, so anybody who cared to discuss eating
habits with her was probably in for a verbal beating. Her parents
persisted, though, and finally talked her into seeing what a
psychiatrist had to say about whether she had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Good, she thought. Maybe this will get them off my back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's wrong with my mother, saying all this
about me,'' Winkler told the psychiatrist as Susan sat in the
waiting room. After a half-hour session, the doctor shared his
diagnosis of ``borderline anorexic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Borderline!?'' Susan responded. ``It takes her an hour and a
half to eat an English muffin in the morning. She picks the
particles apart. She cooks for all of us and doesn't eat.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening Susan went online, found a Web site called
``Something Fishy'' and left a desperate phone message for a
nutritionist listed there. Fowler called back and recommended a
Cincinnati psychiatrist, Dr. David Seltzer, who has moved to
Kokomo, Ind., since Christ Hospital closed its eating disorders
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom went in with me that time,'' Winkler says. ``This
doctor was smart. He made me talk about myself and my feelings. And
I went into a panic attack. That's how he diagnosed me. Anorexics
cannot talk about themselves or their feelings because it scares
them to death.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, loath as she was to admit her disease, Winkler was
also terrified of what it was doing to her. The heart-pounding,
hyperventilating panic attacks were awful, bringing a sense she was
about to die. ``It felt like something was coming to get you, like
your heart was going to explode,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how hard she and her parents tried, Susan says
Caroline just couldn't eat. ``It wasn't that she didn't want to. I
remember holding her, just sobbing. She said, 'Am I ever going to
be normal again?' You can't imagine how devastating that is to a
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The simplest of common knowledge was not obvious to Winkler.
``To her,'' Fowler says, ``half a bagel was what you needed for
most of the day.'' Her mother called it a major accomplishment the
first time Caroline put butter on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler worked her way up to normal-sized meals, and then on
Thanksgiving, she ate a hearty dinner. ``At first I thought it was
wonderful, but then I was worried she'd go the other way and start
purging,'' Susan says.
</P>
<P>
   She was right. Winkler ate normally through the holiday season,
but she often threw up her meals. Her weight was up from her low of
90, but still under 110.
</P>
<P>
   Then two days before Christmas, a discount store greeter falsely
accused Winkler of shoplifting. Susan was with her, talking to the
greeter and store manager, when another customer pointed her out
derisively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caroline seemed to dissolve into a puddle on the ground,''
Susan says. After that, she could hardly keep any food down. ``I
must be a bad person,'' she kept saying. ``Everyone keeps getting
mad at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Christmas dinner was some string bean casserole and a sweet
potato. That's all she ate the whole day, and it would be fairly
typical for the next two weeks. She already knew she was going to a
clinic for eating disorders in Philadelphia that Fowler had
recommended, the Renfrew Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the reservation on Christmas Eve,'' Susan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared of dying,'' Winkler says. She also thought often
about Gabriel, her 18-month-old nephew. ``I adore him,'' she says.
If nothing else, she had to get better for Gabriel, and for the
child of her own she hoped to have someday if she ever gained
enough weight to start menstruating.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler checked in at Renfrew on Jan. 6. The staff started her
on a high-calorie diet, but nothing looked good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was food,'' she says. Some days, all she could handle was
the liquid Ensure or Instant Breakfast that Renfrew required as a
minimum for patients to stay in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The medical exams turned up bigger problems than the bald spots
that had developed. For starters, Winkler had osteopenia, a disease
of low bone density on the threshold of osteoporosis. The body
can't absorb calcium without estrogen, doctors told her, and her 8
percent body fat was less than half what she needed to produce
enough estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't be able to exercise hard for a year. She wouldn't
be able to rejoin Dayton Ballet II or any dance company.
</P>
<P>
   Her lower intestines had stopped working, too, because she had
abused laxatives for three years.
</P>
<P>
   She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which used to be called
manic depression. There's a clear connection between clinical
depression and eating disorders, Fowler says. Scientists aren't
sure which causes which, but they see some of the same brain
chemical disruptions in patients who have either disease without
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Obsessive-compulsive disorder was another diagnosis. Winkler
knows beyond doubt she was obsessed with food, and Fowler says
malnutrition alone can trigger those thought processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an obsessive checker,'' Winkler says. ``I check to make
sure doors are locked. I check to make sure the stove's off. I
check to make sure my heart's beating.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, she was obsessed with being perfect. Both parents
have successful businesses and her only sister is in medical
school. ``My family is perfect,'' she says. ``I had to be
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   As frequently is the case with depression patients, the problems
underlying Winkler's eating disorder were misconceptions. The rest
of her family isn't perfect, of course, and it certainly wasn't
true that she had to be sick for her father to pay attention to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just a delusion I had created in my mind, that he
wasn't very interested in my life,'' she says. ``It gave me
something to worry about and I just kept building and building on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelation has made them much closer, she says. They still
don't have a lot in common, but there's that mutual interest in
each other. ``He has apologized a thousand times, even though he
had nothing to apologize for. I love my parents to death, and I
wouldn't trade them for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   What shocked Bill Winkler most was to learn that anorexia wasn't
about the food. ``So if you make food the issue _ and virtually
everybody does when you see someone wasting away _ you're ignoring
what are the real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the strategy Caroline recommends. ``Say, 'Is there
something wrong? Is there something that's bothering you?' Don't
say, 'Why aren't you eating?'''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell anorexics they're thin or beautiful, either, she
says. ``Thin'' just reinforces the problem, and ``beautiful'' is a
word they don't even hear. ``Their self-esteem is so low.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest change for Winkler has been dismantling the anorexic
shield that protected her from the world. It was so much easier
just to fantasize about food whenever a bad break or a tough
decision came up. ``It's very scary because I don't know what I
like,'' she said before returning from Renfrew.
</P>
<P>
   That same morning, she told her Renfrew psychiatrist she was
sad, and the doctor said he was glad to hear it. She had always
been so bubbly and giggly, and now she was showing a real emotion.
Now, the doctor said, she was ready to start healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sad about what I had done to myself,'' Winkler said.
``I'm sad I have osteopenia and I can't dance.''
</P>
<P>
   She's up to 114 pounds now. Her hair looks great, she's sleeping
well and she's had only one panic attack since she returned from
Philadelphia on Jan. 23. Medication has her bipolar and
obsessive-compulsive disorders under control. She's eating a little
more than the normal 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day.
</P>
<P>
   With the ongoing help of her family, friends, therapist,
doctors, nutritionist and Burke and his staff, Fowler says she's
doing great so far.
</P>
<P>
   She can't imagine going back to a room full of mirrors, though,
and that's how dance studios are built. As much as she loves
dancing, she has decided in therapy that she used it along with
anorexia to escape her feelings, and it also became an excuse for
being thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I can ever go back to looking at myself in the
mirror every day and being worried about weight,'' she says. ``But
I do miss it terribly.''

psychological issues. Like a flu patient's sore throat, food is a
symptom rather than a cause, so regular meals don't cure anorexia
any more than a cough medicine cures flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason Caroline has done so much in moving toward
recovery is her recognition that this is not about food and weight
and appearance,'' Fowler says. Winkler hopes her story will help
others recognize and treat eating disorders across the spectrum
from anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa to compulsive and binge
eating.
</P>
<P>
   If the first panic attack had an up side, Susan says, it was
that Winkler finally started seeing she had a problem. Progress was
excruciatingly slow and erratic even from there, but Winkler's four
or five panic attacks a day, and the insomnia that limited her
sleep to two or three hours, made it more inconvenient to minimize
her weight.
</P>
<P>
   So did the edict from executive director Dermot Burke of the
Dayton Ballet, where Winkler danced with the second company. She
had to gain weight before she could perform, he told her. Dancing
in her condition would be too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still in denial that there was anything wrong with me,''
Winkler says. ``I said, 'I just have a fast metabolism.' I told
people, 'I eat.' I did eat some, so I wasn't anorexic. That would
have meant not eating at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And those wakeful nights weren't doing much for Winkler's
patience and disposition, so anybody who cared to discuss eating
habits with her was probably in for a verbal beating. Her parents
persisted, though, and finally talked her into seeing what a
psychiatrist had to say about whether she had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Good, she thought. Maybe this will get them off my back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's wrong with my mother, saying all this
about me,'' Winkler told the psychiatrist as Susan sat in the
waiting room. After a half-hour session, the doctor shared his
diagnosis of ``borderline anorexic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Borderline!?'' Susan responded. ``It takes her an hour and a
half to eat an English muffin in the morning. She picks the
particles apart. She cooks for all of us and doesn't eat.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening Susan went online, found a Web site called
``Something Fishy'' and left a desperate phone message for a
nutritionist listed there. Fowler called back and recommended a
Cincinnati psychiatrist, Dr. David Seltzer, who has moved to
Kokomo, Ind., since Christ Hospital closed its eating disorders
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom went in with me that time,'' Winkler says. ``This
doctor was smart. He made me talk about myself and my feelings. And
I went into a panic attack. That's how he diagnosed me. Anorexics
cannot talk about themselves or their feelings because it scares
them to death.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, loath as she was to admit her disease, Winkler was
also terrified of what it was doing to her. The heart-pounding,
hyperventilating panic attacks were awful, bringing a sense she was
about to die. ``It felt like something was coming to get you, like
your heart was going to explode,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how hard she and her parents tried, Susan says
Caroline just couldn't eat. ``It wasn't that she didn't want to. I
remember holding her, just sobbing. She said, 'Am I ever going to
be normal again?' You can't imagine how devastating that is to a
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The simplest of common knowledge was not obvious to Winkler.
``To her,'' Fowler says, ``half a bagel was what you needed for
most of the day.'' Her mother called it a major accomplishment the
first time Caroline put butter on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler worked her way up to normal-sized meals, and then on
Thanksgiving, she ate a hearty dinner. ``At first I thought it was
wonderful, but then I was worried she'd go the other way and start
purging,'' Susan says.
</P>
<P>
   She was right. Winkler ate normally through the holiday season,
but she often threw up her meals. Her weight was up from her low of
90, but still under 110.
</P>
<P>
   Then two days before Christmas, a discount store greeter falsely
accused Winkler of shoplifting. Susan was with her, talking to the
greeter and store manager, when another customer pointed her out
derisively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caroline seemed to dissolve into a puddle on the ground,''
Susan says. After that, she could hardly keep any food down. ``I
must be a bad person,'' she kept saying. ``Everyone keeps getting
mad at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Christmas dinner was some string bean casserole and a sweet
potato. That's all she ate the whole day, and it would be fairly
typical for the next two weeks. She already knew she was going to a
clinic for eating disorders in Philadelphia that Fowler had
recommended, the Renfrew Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the reservation on Christmas Eve,'' Susan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared of dying,'' Winkler says. She also thought often
about Gabriel, her 18-month-old nephew. ``I adore him,'' she says.
If nothing else, she had to get better for Gabriel, and for the
child of her own she hoped to have someday if she ever gained
enough weight to start menstruating.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler checked in at Renfrew on Jan. 6. The staff started her
on a high-calorie diet, but nothing looked good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was food,'' she says. Some days, all she could handle was
the liquid Ensure or Instant Breakfast that Renfrew required as a
minimum for patients to stay in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The medical exams turned up bigger problems than the bald spots
that had developed. For starters, Winkler had osteopenia, a disease
of low bone density on the threshold of osteoporosis. The body
can't absorb calcium without estrogen, doctors told her, and her 8
percent body fat was less than half what she needed to produce
enough estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't be able to exercise hard for a year. She wouldn't
be able to rejoin Dayton Ballet II or any dance company.
</P>
<P>
   Her lower intestines had stopped working, too, because she had
abused laxatives for three years.
</P>
<P>
   She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which used to be called
manic depression. There's a clear connection between clinical
depression and eating disorders, Fowler says. Scientists aren't
sure which causes which, but they see some of the same brain
chemical disruptions in patients who have either disease without
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Obsessive-compulsive disorder was another diagnosis. Winkler
knows beyond doubt she was obsessed with food, and Fowler says
malnutrition alone can trigger those thought processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an obsessive checker,'' Winkler says. ``I check to make
sure doors are locked. I check to make sure the stove's off. I
check to make sure my heart's beating.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, she was obsessed with being perfect. Both parents
have successful businesses and her only sister is in medical
school. ``My family is perfect,'' she says. ``I had to be
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   As frequently is the case with depression patients, the problems
underlying Winkler's eating disorder were misconceptions. The rest
of her family isn't perfect, of course, and it certainly wasn't
true that she had to be sick for her father to pay attention to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just a delusion I had created in my mind, that he
wasn't very interested in my life,'' she says. ``It gave me
something to worry about and I just kept building and building on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelation has made them much closer, she says. They still
don't have a lot in common, but there's that mutual interest in
each other. ``He has apologized a thousand times, even though he
had nothing to apologize for. I love my parents to death, and I
wouldn't trade them for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   What shocked Bill Winkler most was to learn that anorexia wasn't
about the food. ``So if you make food the issue _ and virtually
everybody does when you see someone wasting away _ you're ignoring
what are the real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the strategy Caroline recommends. ``Say, 'Is there
something wrong? Is there something that's bothering you?' Don't
say, 'Why aren't you eating?'''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell anorexics they're thin or beautiful, either, she
says. ``Thin'' just reinforces the problem, and ``beautiful'' is a
word they don't even hear. ``Their self-esteem is so low.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest change for Winkler has been dismantling the anorexic
shield that protected her from the world. It was so much easier
just to fantasize about food whenever a bad break or a tough
decision came up. ``It's very scary because I don't know what I
like,'' she said before returning from Renfrew.
</P>
<P>
   That same morning, she told her Renfrew psychiatrist she was
sad, and the doctor said he was glad to hear it. She had always
been so bubbly and giggly, and now she was showing a real emotion.
Now, the doctor said, she was ready to start healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sad about what I had done to myself,'' Winkler said.
``I'm sad I have osteopenia and I can't dance.''
</P>
<P>
   She's up to 114 pounds now. Her hair looks great, she's sleeping
well and she's had only one panic attack since she returned from
Philadelphia on Jan. 23. Medication has her bipolar and
obsessive-compulsive disorders under control. She's eating a little
more than the normal 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day.
</P>
<P>
   With the ongoing help of her family, friends, therapist,
doctors, nutritionist and Burke and his staff, Fowler says she's
doing great so far.
</P>
<P>
   She can't imagine going back to a room full of mirrors, though,
and that's how dance studios are built. As much as she loves
dancing, she has decided in therapy that she used it along with
anorexia to escape her feelings, and it also became an excuse for
being thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I can ever go back to looking at myself in the
mirror every day and being worried about weight,'' she says. ``But
I do miss it terribly.''

DRASTIC MEASURES TO SAVE COD ARE DISCUSSED IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Maine, Mass, N.H.) (Eds: fyi, Paul Molyneaux of Whiting, Maine, was a commercial
fisherman for 20 years.) 
 (fb) 
 By PAUL MOLYNEAUX   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKLAND, Maine _ At the beginning of this century, New
England's cod fishery was dominated by dorymen fishing with baited
hooks. When the Bay State Fishing Company introduced the first
trawler, the Spray, in 1905, the dorymen railed against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scrapes and tears and scrapes and tears the fishing
grounds,'' the fisherman William H. Thomas wrote in the 1913
program of the Master Mariners' Association in Gloucester, Mass.
``Let this method alone,'' he warned, ``and not many years hence a
dearth of fish will be certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 86 years later, the sad state of New England's fisheries in
general, and the cod fishery in particular, is well established.
Fishermen and regional regulators are under increasing pressure to
come to terms with the federal Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996
before any more damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   The act was designed as a holistic approach to fisheries
management that would restore fish stocks and ocean habitat while
preserving fishing communities. As enforced so far, however, the
act has failed on every count. Scientists see Gulf of Maine cod
stocks continuing to collapse. Little has been done to protect
habitat beyond the ancillary benefits of temporarily closed areas,
and fishing communities are in need of life support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing inshore areas forces people to get bigger boats so
they can get offshore, it cripples small coastal communities, and
it does nothing to protect habitat,'' said Paul Cohan, president of
the Gulf of Maine Fishermen's Alliance. ``Let's face it, big
draggers beat the hell out of the fishing grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who run small boats _ gillnetters, trawlers and hook boats
under 60 feet _ from the ports around Gloucester, Mass., and
Portsmouth, N.H., say they are hardest hit. Area closings to
protect cod stocks, primarily in the inshore waters between Cape
Cod and southern Maine, have left them nowhere to fish. Their
increasing frustration culminated last November when they asked the
New England Fishery Management Council to shut the entire Gulf of
Maine to all fishing for at least three years. A compromise plan
was passed in January after three days of arduous and emotional
meetings. The compromise closed more areas offshore while allowing
fishing inshore with more restricted trawling gear.
</P>
<P>
   Vito Calomo, executive director of the Gloucester Fisheries
Commission, backed the inshore fishermen's demand for closure at
the Nov. 16 meeting of the council's groundfish committee. ``We
finally, after 375 years of being fishermen, are united,'' Calomo
said. ``These people feel they can't survive, and we're telling you
we can't make it. Do you really believe I want to close the fishing
industry down?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation. I don't say it's bad management,
overfishing, pollution. I say it's a combination of everything. If
anybody could come up with a way to solve this problem, I'd be the
first one behind you. But we've been pounding our heads for years,
and it doesn't seem like it's coming back. We listen to the
scientists and they paint a very, very bleak picture, and we look
at our fishermen dwindled down, people out of the industry. We need
to work together, the management, the fishermen, industry people;
we need to work together to solve this problem. We don't know what
to do anymore, so we're saying, close it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The council, which regulates fisheries in Federal waters off the
five coastal New England states, was shocked by the closure demand,
but some members understood the fishermen's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most fishermen realize there is no way to meet the
requirements of the Sustainable Fisheries Act,'' said Jim Kendall,
a council member from New Bedford, Mass., ``and not many years
hence a dearth of fish will be certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor spawning success, often blamed on pollution and loss of
habitat to trawler damage, has led to continued declines in cod
despite cutbacks in landings. The current assessment calls for ``as
close to zero mortality as possible'' for Gulf of Maine cod and
increased efforts to minimize bycatch, cod caught incidentally in
other fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total allowable catch this year is 772 metric tons,'' said
Kendall. ``They caught almost that much just in the month of June
last year. Bycatch alone will fill the quota and shut the fishery
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohan, of the fishermen's alliance, was among those who
initiated the shutdown demand, but he came back to the table at the
December, and January council meetings in an effort to work out a
plan that would meet federal targets and allow inshore boats to
fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to close the whole Gulf of Maine, let stocks
rebuild, get some sort of government relief package to keep us
alive, and take a hard look at how we fish,'' Cohan said. ``But we
realized the political fortitude to do that did not exist, within
the industry or on the council.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise was passed on Jan. 28 after meetings with a
conspicuous police presence to insure the security of council
members. The new plan will close more areas offshore, allow more
fishing inshore and require trawlers to use less intrusive gear
inshore. But it will also allow fishing in areas with high
concentrations of cod. A trip limit of 200 pounds a day, included
in the plan, means that fishermen will have to dump any excess cod
back into the ocean, dead.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive to discard overages is hard to ignore. One council
member, Jim O'Malley, asked the council to take a hard look at the
issue. ``I have reports of vessels offshore fishing on flounder in
areas where they were getting a lot of cod,'' he said, ``and
railroading the cod over the side so they could keep fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another council member, Tom Hill, a former charter boat
operator, said there was one sure way to deal with discards. ``You
cannot regulate a single species in a multispecies fishery without
closing large areas for extended periods of time,'' he said.
``That's what has worked on Georges Bank, and it's the
internationally accepted norm. Every bone in my body tells me the
compromise is a mistake, but I voted for it. The inshore fishermen
tell us they can fish in areas with high concentrations of cod and
not catch cod, and I think we have to give them a chance. But this
is the last roll of the dice and all their money is on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a bitter pill to swallow for the recreational
industry that is accountable for only 4.5 percent of the total
landings to have to close this fishery and essentially hand the
resource over to the people who destroyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Inshore fishermen say they know what is at stake and can avoid
cod through gear modifications coupled with their intimate
knowledge of the areas they fish.
</P>
<P>
   Niaz Dorry of Greenpeace asserts that myopic attention to the
requirements of the Sustainable Fisheries Act has led to a
merry-go-round of collapsing stocks and ineffective regulation. ``I
am thoroughly disgusted with the process and the contention that
everything is being done to meet SFA when most of the requirements
of SFA are being ignored,'' she said. ``There are provisions that
call for the landing of all bycatch, and habitat-impact statements
for all gear.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees ``regulators focusing on rebuilding targets, and
fishermen focusing on maintaining their communities, while ignoring
the far-reaching goals'' of the fisheries act.
</P>
<P>
   Dorry also said environmentalists who talk about gear impact,
without consulting fishermen, ``are continuing to live in ignorance
of the wisdom of fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the solutions coming out of the industry address the
concerns of the environmental community better than what the
managers are coming up with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fisheries act was intended to protect the resource for the
entire nation. Access to fish, either directly through recreational
fishing or indirectly through commercial fishermen, is what matters
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Casella, director of the Sea Party Coalition, which
represents more than 2,000 recreational fishermen, said his group
was ready to do whatever it took to rebuild cod stocks despite the
industry's low impact on the fishery.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the future of cod and other species, Dorry
recommended that consumers ask questions when they buy fish: Where
does it come from and how was it caught? ``Buy fresh fish,'' she
said, ``because it is more likely to have been caught in a
low-impact fishery, and whenever possible buy local.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stock assessment is expected to call for more drastic
closures to protect other stocks such as hake and plaice (dab), and
many participants think closing the Gulf of Maine and subsidizing
fishermen is inevitable. But what that means is worth pondering.
</P>
<P>
   A moratorium in Newfoundland, established in 1992 to rebuild the
collapsed cod stocks, has cost the Canadian government $3 billion
so far, and it is a long way from over. Scientists say Gulf of
Maine cod could take eight years to recover, even with no fishing
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Finlayson, assistant commissioner of Maine's Department of
Marine Resources, said of the latest plan, ``We're buying one more
year for the boats that can still fish.'' &QL;

   The long-rumored deal that has Glen Rice going to the Los

   Rice, who underwent elbow surgery before the season, is expected
to be dealt to the Lakers with J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong for
Jones and Elden Campbell by the middle of March.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte coaching staff is leery of losing the team's
leading scorer, but it appears the deal is nearing completion. One
of the main holdups: Rice's wife is about to give birth to the
couple's first child, and Rice does not want anything to interfere
with the pregnancy, the team official said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers playing as well as they have been since the
season began, a trade could upset team chemistry. And Rice has
often felt that his skills would be hampered with the Lakers, where
he would become the No. 3 option on offense behind Shaquille O'Neal
and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   But a reliable long-distance shooter is perhaps the one weapon
keeping the Lakers from getting over the hump in the playoffs. With
a team like Utah rotating on defense and forcing the Lakers into a
half-court game, kicking it out to a player of Rice's caliber could
make even more of a difference than having Dennis Rodman under the
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Bulky Is Beautiful for Kemp  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A portly, less mobile Shawn Kemp has endured every imaginable
crack about his weight so far this month. But more than one-quarter
into the short season, he has somehow managed to prove that bigger
is better for his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I used to dunk and they criticized me for
the dunk,'' said Kemp, who at a less-than-svelte 280 pounds is
averaging 20.2 points and 9.3 rebounds per game. ``They said I
couldn't be an All-Star because I dunked too much. So in order to
get the respect from the people, I felt like I had to change my
game. I actually felt bad because I was dunking the ball so much. I
led the league in dunks one year, and they told me that was the
wrong thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That hardly explains why he came to training camp near 303
pounds and carrying a few rolls of pork over his game shorts. But
he slimmed down to about 291 when the season started and kept
dropping pounds. He is using his bulkier frame to get position and
easy baskets. The results have been less highlight-reel dunks but
more production inside.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This week, an American diplomat named Frank
Ricciardone will take on a new job. His mission is as simple as it
is difficult: unify the fractured Iraqi opposition, topple Saddam
Hussein and build a democratic nation from the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been pursuing the same goal on
three tracks: bombing Iraq in a slow-motion war, succoring the
opposition with words and ideas, plotting to subvert the pyramid of
soldiers and spies that supports the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the United States has been striking Iraq from
the air for 10 weeks now, and last week American planes loosed the
biggest barrage of bombs since December. At last count, American
and British jets have bombed Iraq on 30 separate days _ roughly
every other day _ since Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The jets have struck at least 104 targets, 4 more than they hit
during the major American and British barrage over four days last
year, damaging or destroying surface-to-air missile sites,
anti-aircraft artillery, radar towers and communications centers.
In a report to Congress on Wednesday, President Clinton said Iraq's
air defenses had been ``degraded substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are working to do is to help create the political and
military conditions that will permit a successful change of the
regime,'' said Walter B. Slocombe, under secretary of defense for
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon officials are among the first to acknowledge that
bombs alone cannot topple Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The American military commander in the Persian Gulf region has
said repeatedly that the task of creating a legitimate alternative
to Saddam appears hopeless for now, given the disunity of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the hope for a coup rests on the impact of the tons of
bombs falling on Iraqi military sites. But allies of the United
States in the region, especially Saudi Arabia and Turkey, are
increasingly impatient with the American program of bombs and
bombast.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no clear evidence so far that the bombings have
eroded Saddam's power structure, best envisioned as a pyramid of
perhaps 100 trusted men, sitting atop half a million soldiers,
spies and political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Ricciardone, the State Department official named
to the newly created position of policy coordinator, has said he
envisions a sudden demise for the regime in Iraq, a country he does
know.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, during the Iran-Iraq war, he helped try to
normalize relations between the United States and Iraq. He was
second-in-command of the shuttered American Embassy after the 1991
Persian Gulf war, working out of Amman, Jordan and London.
</P>
<P>
   He is one among many in the administration who sees political
thunderclouds gathering over Saddam, though no one will predict
when a storm might occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most likely, there will be a military coup,'' he said last
week in an interview with a newspaper in Ankara, Turkey, where he
is ending a stint as deputy chief of the American Embassy. ``It
will be very sudden and without warning.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which confirmed the content of his
remarks, said Ricciardone could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger,
said that Saddam's repeated efforts to shoot down American or
British jets over Iraq showed his weakness, not his strength. ``His
ineffectiveness in stopping us has undercut him to some degree,''
Berger said in an interview. The challenges are meant ``to
demonstrate his power,'' he added. ``Instead he looks
ineffectual.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official said that Saddam is ``nervous
and off-balance.'' Another official, who also spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said: ``We think we see Saddam flailing. We
are working toward a slow whittling-down of his power, his
authority and his nerves. There are reports of military guys
perhaps not following orders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not spent a penny of a $97
million fund created by Congress to finance Iraqi opposition, one
indication of its thinking about the likelihood of its success.
</P>
<P>
   There is understandably some revulsion in the Arab world about
superpowers plotting insurrections in the region. Few in the
administration have any idea who or what could succeed Saddam,
except perhaps chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of these sensitivities, the administration has
tried to draw as little attention as possible to the air strikes.
On Feb. 26, in a major foreign policy speech nearly 7,000 words
long, Clinton devoted one sentence to Iraq and said nothing about
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, too, is giving out less and less information about
the bombing, withholding the familiar grainy videos of attacks and
refusing to discuss the damage in detail. Military officials say
their silence is an effort to minimize sympathy that might be
generated in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. military official said the bombing of Iraqi
communications sites and command centers appears to have reduced
the central government's ability to communicate effectively with
military units.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said, ``The morale of Iraqi air
defenses is pretty low.'' It is not so low, however, that Iraqi
radar operators have refrained from tracking American planes and
giving pilots the justification they need to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pounding, there are signs Iraq is able to recover.
In his report to Congress last week, Clinton said Iraq had repaired
an oil refinery that had been damaged in December's raids. The
refinery has resumed generating illegal profits for Saddam's
government. A senior administration official said Iraq had also
``made an effort to reconstitute'' military facilities destroyed in
the raids as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says it is trying to balance risks against rewards.
The delicacy of that balance was clear last week when American jets
attacked two radio towers that the Pentagon said relayed messages
to Iraqi air defenses but that also, it turned out, controlled the
flow of oil through Iraq's pipeline to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who arrived for a
week-long visit to the Persian Gulf region, indicated publicly that
the strikes on the towers were a mistake. ``We're very sensitive to
that and we want to make sure we don't disrupt the flow of oil
going into Turkey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By disrupting the U.N. program that allows Iraq to sell oil for
food and medicine, the United States had handed Iraq a public
relations victory, officials and diplomats said, creating some
sympathy for the suffering of ordinary Iraqis and building some
momentum for an end to the attacks. ``It's really one of those
traps Saddam's trying to draw us into,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest trap would be losing an American pilot. The Pentagon
has increased the number of helicopter-borne emergency rescue teams
dispatched to the region, standing by to dart into Iraq on a rescue
mission should a plane go down.

IVERSON GETS THE POINT BY MOVING AWAY FROM IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Allen Iverson, Philadelphia freedom once meant driving the
length of the court, and then using the defense and his teammates
for pylons. He would score spectacularly and often. But the 76ers
would invariably drop another game, after which Iverson would shrug
his shoulders and exclaim, ``What more do you want me to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Now look who's all grown up.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three years after the 76ers made him the No. 1 pick in
the 1996 draft, the days of frustration for the young team and the
young guard are nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
   Through 14 games, Iverson is leading the NBA in scoring at 28.8
points per game. He is also averaging six assists and 5.4 rebounds
and is most responsible for Philadelphia's best start since the
1990-91 season.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers are 10-6 going into Sunday's game against Washington.
They are ahead of the Knicks in the Atlantic Division and in solid
contention for a playoff spot in this lockout-shortened year.
</P>
<P>
   Their accomplishments have much to do with Iverson's making a
huge adjustment: converting from point guard to shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I have learned a lot from my first two seasons,''
Iverson said in a national conference call with the news media
before scoring 34 points in a loss to Miami on Friday. ``Playing
shooting guard has taken a lot of pressure off of me and I think my
teammates are doing a great job of getting me the ball in spots
where I am moving and creating scoring opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Named the NBA's player of the month for February, Iverson is the
first Philadelphia player to be chosen for the award since Charles
Barkley in November 1988. Wilt Chamberlain was the last member of
the 76ers to lead the league in scoring, when he averaged 33.5
points a game in 1965-66.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely playing the best ball of his career,'' coach
Larry Brown said. ``He listens to everything I say, he does
everything I ask of him and he's playing harder than ever. He's
been absolutely phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Isiah Thomas is regarded as one of the greatest little men to
play the game. Though Iverson is still a few years away from
becoming a genuinely great player, his game already is striking.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years ago, Iverson symbolized much of what was
wrong with the NBA. It wasn't just that he monopolized the ball; he
was one of the worst examples of the NBA's crop of shoot-first and
pass-later point guards.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson believed that as long as he looked good on the floor,
losing could be tolerated. After all, he was one of only two
players from the 1996 draft to have his own signature line of
sneakers before his team won a game.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he refused to disassociate himself from the
unsavory characters of his past just because he was successful.
While he has not cut ties to his friends, professing loyalty, he
has made an effort to keep his personal and professional lives
separate, which has meant no hangers-on at practice or on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Though the last infraction Iverson was involved in was in August
1997 _ he was a passenger in a car that was found to have marijuana
and a concealed weapon inside it _ the bad-guy label is still in
the back of the public's mind.
</P>
<P>
   On the court at the least, Iverson, who routinely butted heads
with Brown in his first two seasons, has accepted his new role and
flourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year, I didn't know the NBA game at all,'' he said.
``I knew the college game because of coach John Thompson, and I
knew how to play high school ball because of my high school coach.
Now coach Brown is teaching me the whole, overall NBA game. I know
it takes time and I have a long way to go, but that has been the
difference, learning how to play the game a little bit more.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of Brown, he added: ``He came in with the identity of being hard
on point guards. And that is true. He knows that is where a team
really starts and that is where it ends _ at the point-guard
position. We started out kind of rocky, but once we got to know
each other and understand each other better, we started to have a
great relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson scored 32.4 percent of the 76ers' points during
February, and had 30 or more points six times (Philadelphia was 4-2
in those games) including 46 points against San Antonio on Feb. 12.
He scored 10 or more points in a quarter 14 times and 20 or more
points in a half six times, and extended his double-figure scoring
streak to 27 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he's also won the respect of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just unstoppable,'' Aaron McKie said. ``To be so little,
he's so tough. He gets knocked down, gets right back up and is
ready to play.''

UNDATED: scientific complexity. '' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glove manufacturers, which have found themselves the subjects of
lawsuits, have tried to block legislation banning latex gloves. At
the same time, they are creating alternative products.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Johnson &AMP; Johnson, for example, have
written to state legislators arguing against bills that would ban
powdered latex in hospitals. Meanwhile, the company has been
producing low-powder gloves and options to latex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been putting forward the alternatives,'' said John
McKeegan, a company spokesman. ``But there is a demand out there
for powdered gloves, and they are the ones that sell the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Regent Medical has been very aggressive in marketing its
powder-free gloves, including surgical gloves called Biogel, which
have a powder substitute that helps the glove slip on. Yet
powder-free gloves make up only 5 percent of the company's glove
business, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of hospitals across the country _ including Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury,
Conn., and Olean Hospital in Olean, N.Y. _ have either banned latex
gloves or restricted them to certain parts of their buildings. But
in general, doctors, particularly surgeons, are extremely resistant
to nonlatex alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, even medical workers with the allergy resist change.
``They think, `I desperately need this high-paying job in this
prestigious teaching hospital, I need the medical insurance and I
cannot afford to acknowledge a latex allergy,''' said Gail Lenehan,
chairwoman of the Massachusetts Emergency Nurses Association's
Latex Allergy Task Force. ``I have heard female surgeons say they
live in a man's world and fear a bias against them, and residents
say they won't speak up because they are low on the totem pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some hospitals are starting to change. ``We wanted to be
a leader in this area,'' said Robert G. Hamilton, an associate
professor of medicine and pathology at Johns Hopkins, which is
becoming latex-free. ``Cost is the fundamental question. But we
purchased a sufficient volume of stretch vinyl, which resulted in
no change in cost.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, an increasing number of lawsuits are charging
manufacturers with negligence and product liability, or with
continuing to market a product that they know to be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Howell Rosenberg, a partner with Brookman, Rosenberg, Brown &AMP;
Sandler, a law firm in Philadelphia, estimated that about 250 cases
against glove manufacturers have gone to federal courts around the
country, up from about 25 cases two and a half years ago. His
office is handling a suit on behalf of all the Federal cases,
roughly 12 percent of which are from New York. Dozens more are
being tried in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to be closely watched,'' Rosenberg said.
``We are talking about lots of people, and the greatest number of
victims are in health care. That is a very significant segment of
the work force who are doing very important jobs.''

3 VICTIMS IN COLOMBIA DEFENDED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wis., Hawaii, Calif.)  (fb) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three Americans who were killed while on a mission to help
the Uwa people of Colombia had distinguished themselves in the
United States and in international organizations as passionate
defenders of the environment and of the rights of indigenous
people, associates said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Washinawatok, 41, of Brooklyn, began fighting for the
rights of American Indians as a teen-ager in her own backyard, on
the Menominee Reservation in Keshena, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Freitas, 24, a California native who had recently moved
to Brooklyn, had spent much of the last three years trying to focus
attention on the Uwa tribe's battle to preserve its land from oil
exploration. The Uwa ``considered him one of theirs,'' a friend
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii, chairwoman of the Pacific
Cultural Conservancy International, worked to bring educational
opportunities to indigenous people and recognition for her own
Polynesian culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are so committed and courageous,'' said Laurie
Parise, executive director of the Rainforest Foundation U.S., a
10-year-old organization in New York City, who knew two of the
slain Americans. ``They knew the danger, but they still went down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok grew up on the Menominee Reservation, where a
tribal spiritual leader gave her the name Peqtaw Metamoh when she
was a child. It means Thunderbird Woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her whole life was about humanity, about respecting people's
ability to be who they are,'' said Apesanahkwat, the chairman of
the Menominee Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok was a co-chairwoman of the Indigenous Women's
Network and was active in forums sponsored by the United Nations
and other international groups on Indian and women's rights issues.
Since 1992, she was also a member of the board of directors of the
American Indian Community House in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok's advocacy work began early. At age 14, she helped
her father, James, organize on the reservation, and three years
later came to New York City as an intern with the International
Treaty Council, which monitored Indian rights in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Ali el Issa, her husband of 16 years and a former Rite Aid drug
store manager, said he last spoke with his wife a week before she
was kidnapped. ``I told her, if it's not safe, come back. Don't use
your sympathy, use your brain.'' El Issa said she responded, ``I
feel I am with my people, like I'm back on the reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has a son, Maehki, who is 14.
</P>
<P>
   Freitas, a graduate of the University of California at Santa
Cruz, was trained as an environmental biologist and worked in
various environmental law projects after college. His passion was
not for books and formulas, though. It was for the wild, said
Leslie Wirpsa, a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his natural habitat to be out in the woods,'' she said,
adding, ``His spirit is inextricably linked to the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Freitas had been involved with the Uwa fight to keep oil
companies from drilling on their land for nearly three years and
founded a group called the Uwa Defense Working Group.
</P>
<P>
   He helped bring an Uwa tribal leader to California last year for
public debates with representatives of Occidental Oil and Gas
Corporation, the Bakersfield, Calif., company whose affiliate,
Occidental de Colombia, has been trying to explore for oil on and
near the Uwa lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Uwa considered him one of theirs,'' Wirpsa said. The
feeling was mutual. ``He was awestruck when he was in the Uwa
territory,'' she added. ``I remember when he showed us a slide _
red birds against a rich verdant green backdrop _ and you could
feel his heart jump when he showed that slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Melina Selverston, director of the Coalition for Amazonian
Peoples and their Environment, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group,
said Freitas had received death threats on his telephone answering
machine that he believed came from paramilitary groups in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Gay, 39, was a native Hawaiian of Scottish, Mohawk and French
descent, with varied interests and talents. A photojournalist and
writer, she led delegations of indigenous Polynesians to various
international forums and was active in Hawaii in fighting for their
official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her work was her passion,'' John Livingstone, who described
himself as Gay's common-law husband, said in a telephone interview
from his parents' home in Connecticut. ``She dedicated her life to
indigenous causes and saving traditional cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiian elders had trained her in what Livingstone called
traditional anthropology, and she was using those skills to trace
the history of the royal family from which she was descended.
</P>
<P>
   Gay understood the dangers in Colombia, where she was exploring
the possibility of setting up an education program modeled on one
she had established in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took my heart,'' Livingstone said, sobbing. ``She was the
love of my life. She was just a phenomenal, beautiful person, and
it was a senseless brutal act.''

EDITORIAL: BALKAN GHOSTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, March 7:
</P>
<P>
   With ethnic violence in Kosovo, and politicians warning that
NATO will need to occupy Bosnia for years to come, it seems to many
Americans that a durable peace in the Balkans is a hopeless goal.
The conflicts stem from ancient hatreds, people say. They can be
buried for years or decades, but they always return.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is dangerous to underestimate the weight of history,
it can be just as mistaken to overestimate it. Ancient hatreds in
the Balkans have produced cycles of killing and revenge. That
provides the climate for more explosions of hate. But combustion
requires the addition of other factors very much of the present.
For lasting peace in the Balkans, and in other regions with
similarly troubled pasts, the world must be able to spot and
prevent those conditions before violence begins.
</P>
<P>
   While religion is the only important way in which Serbs, Muslims
and Croats differ, the Bosnian war was not about religion, but
about the past. Virtually every person who has ever picked up a
pistol or sword in the Balkans claimed to be fighting to save his
own ethnic group from a repeat of the physical or cultural
annihilation it suffered in the past. The persistence of fear,
however, does not necessarily mean the persistence of war. Balkan
wars over the centuries encompassed various parts of a region that
stretches from Austria to Turkey. Most of these nations are now at
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting breaks out when two events mingle in an atmosphere of
fear. One is a sudden political change, when one order has broken
down and a new one has not yet taken its place. This is what
happened in 1991. It was the manipulation of ethnic fear by
Slobodan Milosevic that provoked non-Serbian ethnic groups to
separate from Yugoslavia, fearful they would be persecuted under
his rule. The establishment of Croatia and Bosnia as independent
states left Serbs there in a minority. Having been slaughtered in
World War II by Croats, and to a lesser extent by Muslims, Serbs
worried that the Serbian minorities could be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The other necessary ingredient is a demagogue with a television
station. Milosevic in Serbia and Franjo Tudjman in Croatia have
exploited and encouraged fear to keep themselves in power.
Milosevic's propaganda machine rarely told Serbs to kill their
neighbors. It just warned them _ falsely _ that their neighbors
were coming to kill them. That was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Cooling hatreds after a radioactive war like Bosnia's or
Kosovo's requires time and an imposition of new rules that calm
fears. Tito did this in Yugoslavia after World War II. Class took
the place of ethnicity. It might still be working had Milosevic not
been allowed to exploit nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia must develop strong guarantees of minority rights _
strong enough to be universally trusted _ and a political system
mature enough to reject nationalist leaders before they do harm.
Until it can, and this is likely to take a long time, some form of
peacekeeping may be needed, or at least a promise that NATO forces
will return quickly if violence resumes. In Kosovo, a fragile,
contested peace is the the best that can be expected while
Milosevic remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to prevent outbreaks of hatred than to end them.
Macedonia is an example of how this can be done. Ethnic Macedonians
and Albanians, determined not to repeat the mistakes of their
neighbors in Kosovo, have formed a coalition government. The U.N.
peacekeeping force there, just vetoed by a vengeful China angry
that Macedonia recognized Taiwan, should be reconstituted as a NATO
mission immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing ethnic violence requires foresight. The world watched
Milosevic's growing crackdown in Kosovo for years, but did nothing
until the problem became virtually incurable. The West should have
increased the pressure on him to restore the self-government he
robbed from Kosovo when he came to power. No one can change
history, but much can be done to keep it from repeating itself,
even in the Balkans.

EDITORIAL: A NEW TACK FOR REPUBLICANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, March 7:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton put Republicans on the defensive when he
proposed to tap most of the budget surplus in the next 15 years to
shore up Social Security and pay down the national debt, not to cut
taxes as they wanted. Most voter surveys show that Americans
embrace Clinton's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in their first formal response to the president's budget,
the Republicans have tried to outdo him by setting aside even more
money for Social Security than Clinton proposed. They would also
defer their tax cuts for at least two years. Their new approach is
a step in the right direction. But it has many flaws, including
unacceptable cuts in Medicare and other domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican move reflects a clear recognition that the
party's lawmakers cannot be seen as less than zealous about
protecting Social Security. At present, the system generates a
surplus, but it is due to slip into insolvency in the next 15 years
as baby boomers start to retire. For many years the Social Security
surplus has been used to pay for other spending in the budget, and
the Republicans now say they want to end that practice right away.
The problem with such a step is that it would require steep budget
cuts next year. The Republicans already have said they want
spending increases in defense and some education programs, so the
cuts would have to come in myriad other programs that they have not
yet specified.
</P>
<P>
   There always are places to find budget savings. The White
House's proposal for an increase in cigarette taxes would provide
some revenue to avoid cuts. Rep. John Kasich, chairman of the House
Budget Committee and a likely presidential candidate, has long
promised to get tough on unnecessary federal subsidies to business
known as ``corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if these savings materialize, it is doubtful that the
Republicans can reach their goal without gutting vital programs in
health, nutrition and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The new Republican budget is a little more realistic on tax
cuts. It deals a rebuff to Kasich, the House's biggest advocate of
immediate across-the-board tax cuts, by recognizing that there is
not enough money available for significant tax cuts right now. But
the plan violates common sense by proposing tax cuts for the years
ahead. No one can be sure what the economy will look like in three
years, and tax cuts should not be enacted until Congress figures
out how to rescue the nation's other big program threatened with
insolvency, Medicare, which is due to run deficits in less than 10
years. The White House's call for Medicare reform, including an
expansion of some services like prescription drugs, ought to be one
of this Congress' biggest priorities.
</P>
<P>
   For all their problems, the Republicans are to be commended for
beginning to wrestle with the budget problems. Nothing can be done
unless each positive step by one side is met with a positive
gesture by the other side. The conventional wisdom in Washington is
that in the current poisonous atmosphere, Congress and the White
House cannot think big thoughts or do big things. The new
Republican budget proposals are vague and full of pitfalls, but
they could also hasten serious negotiations and compromises in
everyone's interest.

 ANALYSIS: LOOKING PAST A SINGLE PILOT, SCRUTINY SHIFTS TO MARINE
CORPS 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ Capt. Richard Ashby alone, and not the
Marine Corps, was on trial in the court-martial that ended on
Thursday with his acquittal on charges of involuntary homicide and
manslaughter for flying his Prowler jet into gondola cables in the
Italian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not look good for the Marine Corps, which emerged as
a sort of unindicted co-conspirator in the accident that resulted
in the charges. Twenty people were killed when their ski gondola
plummeted near Cavalese on Feb. 3, 1998, after Ashby's jet cut the
cables 360 feet above the ground, ostensibly while he was trying to
maintain an altitude of 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Information presented at Ashby's court-martial and drawn from
related investigations indicates that the corps had no program to
be sure its pilots were up-to-date on all rules, that the Marine
Corps sent crews on routes so infrequently that they could not be
expected to maintain proficiency, and that it equipped crews with
charts lacking important features _ most significantly, the
existence of the gondola ski lift.
</P>
<P>
   If an investigation showed that a civilian airline involved in
an accident had had similar problems, that airline would face a lot
of orders from regulators, and maybe worse.
</P>
<P>
   In both the civilian and military worlds, though, prosecutions
of airline pilots are rare, partly because pilots who err badly
seldom live to be defendants. Even airlines and other aviation
companies that commit major lapses seldom face criminal charges. In
that sense, the prosecution of Ashby was unusual by any measure.
</P>
<P>
   But the acquittal does not mean that no one was responsible,
only that prosecutors did not persuade at least six of the eight
jurors that enough of the blame was Ashby's that he should go to
prison. (The court-martial of his navigator, Capt. Joseph
Schweitzer, is scheduled for this month but is now uncertain.)
</P>
<P>
   The jurors declined requests for interviews, having been warned
by the judge that other charges were pending, including one for
obstruction of justice against Ashby. Their ballot sheets were
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   But a Marine spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Ellen Haddock, said it was a
``reasonable explanation'' that if jurors failed to assign enough
blame to Ashby to convict him, then some of the blame must lie with
the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   One likely spot to look for accountability is in the failure of
officers in Ashby's squadron to keep track of incoming information,
identify what was important and then require all pilots to read the
information. Another problem was the failure of the Marine
squadrons, which rotated through the Aviano Air Base in Italy, to
coordinate with the Air Force squadron, which was assigned there
permanently, on the flow of information.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, the defense argued that there were communications
failures within the Marine Corps and between the Marines and the
Air Force, which was supposed to provide information for the
Marines. The Air Force had warned its own pilots of a local rule
prohibiting flight below 2,000 feet, but paperwork on file in the
Marine office gave minimum altitudes as low as 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps, though, says it is learning from the accident.
It is reviewing its procedures for all flights, Haddock said, and
has put ``increased emphasis on receipt, maintenance, dissemination
and accountability of safety-of-flight information.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, when aircraft squadrons deploy to new
places, their commanders must ``personally brief the commanding
general about the training and operations that will be conducted
during the deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the near term, the assurance President Clinton gave on
Friday to the Italian prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, that the
Aviano accident would not be repeated, may rely more on following
existing rules than on making procedural changes. American
warplanes at Aviano are strictly adhering to a 2,000-foot altitude
restriction, the existence of which was not known to all pilots
before the crash, and the Prowler pilots are not flying any
low-altitude missions from Aviano.

   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ The emir of Bahrain, a key U.S. ally in
the Persian Gulf region, collapsed and died Saturday at the age of
66 after a meeting with visiting Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The emir, Sheik Isa bin Sulman Al-Khalifa, had ruled the tiny
island nation since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He was immediately succeeded by his son Sheik Hamad bin Isa
Al-Khalifa, 49, in what by all appearances was a smooth transfer of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Hamad, who had been crown prince, had already held the title of
commander in chief of Bahrain's armed forces. He is said to share
the pro-Western orientation that has made Bahrain an important base
for U.S. military operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the transfer of power marks the end of an era for
Bahrain, where the emir had been a dominant force for nearly four
decades. It may also offer a foretaste of what lies in store for
several other Persian Gulf monarchies whose leaders are in
questionable health.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi ruler, King Fahd, 79, has been hospitalized several
times in the past three years; the monarch's brother, Crown Prince
Abdullah, 77, is now running the kingdom on a day-to-day-basis.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, in Bahrain at the start of a nine-country tour of the
Middle East, said he had been ``stunned and saddened'' to learn of
Isa's sudden death. The cause, according to Bahraini officials, was
a heart attack that the emir suffered just minutes after the two
ended a half-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Isa had suffered heart problems in the past; he visited
Cleveland, Ohio, last year to undergo heart treatment. He had shown
no recent signs of ill health.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that Cohen, who arrived Saturday night in
Riyadh, the Saudi capital, on the second leg of his journey, had
offered to stay in Bahrain to attend Isa's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Bahrain said that as many as 10,000 people attended
the funeral, and that flower petals were strewn on the capital's
streets. Bahrain state radio said that Hamad had earlier informed
an emergency Cabinet meeting of his father's death and that he was
taking power under the kingdom's laws.
</P>
<P>
   Isa's death was announced to the people of Bahrain after state
television began broadcasting recitations from the Koran, the
Islamic holy book, a standard practice after the death of a leader
in the Muslim world. The scenes were reminiscent of those played on
Jordanian television just one month ago, after the death of King
Hussein, another key U.S. ally.
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain's new emir, Hamad, is an experienced military commander
who graduated from the British military academy at Sandhurst. As
crown prince since 1964, he presided over a buildup of Bahrain's
armed forces, and has been seen as a strong proponent of Bahrain's
emerging partnership with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials say he has shown no indication that he would
back away from the arrangements that have made Bahrain the
headquarters for the United States' 5th Fleet, which patrols the
Persian Gulf. Nor, they say, has he voiced opposition to
arrangements that, in a series of recent crises, have allowed U.S.
warplanes to be in Bahrain for possible use against Iraq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hamad inherits an emirate whose strength as a banking and
financial capital has helped to make up for its relative lack of
oil, though it remains a poor cousin among its Persian Gulf
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   There are also deep domestic strains, particularly between
Bahrain's majority population of Shiite Muslims and the more
prosperous Sunni minority, headed by the Al-Khalifa family, which
controls nearly all power and privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, those strains have played out in a campaign of
low-level violence, including bombings and other attacks, that have
claimed more than two dozen lives.
</P>
<P>
   Under Isa, Bahraini authorities responded with a heavy hand,
sending security forces into the streets and arresting scores of
Shiite activists, many of whom remain in jail. As commander of
Bahrain's military forces, Hamad has been closely identified with
that policy.

SPORTS COLUMN: WITH JARVIS AND CALHOUN, TENSION RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese kicked off Big East
Tournament week he acknowledged Pearl Washington, the former
Syracuse star. Then Tranghese recalled the Big East championship
game in 1984 between Syracuse and Georgetown, a game still
remembered as one of the fiercest championship games in Big East
history with Michael Graham decking Syracuse's Andre Hawkins, the
game going into overtime and Jim Boeheim storming off the podium,
knocking over a folding chair as he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really had to be there,'' Tranghese said. Like many fans
of the era, the commissioner longed for that time when the Big East
was legendary.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalries were forged not by teams or institutions but by
personalities. John Thompson and Rick Pitino going at it, with
Thompson calling Pitino a ``young punk'' and Pitino shouting:
``Grow up, John.'' Or Lou Carnesecca calling Rollie Massimino a
``Hollywood Hotdog'' a year after Massimino led Villanova to the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities faded and the thrill was gone as well. But
there was a resurgence of bad blood and angst over the last week.
In its 20th anniversary, the Big East got the championship game it
has craved: Connecticut, which for the last eight years has set the
standard in the Big East and St. John's, the conference's nerve
center.
</P>
<P>
   The tension was back, largely because St. John's was back.
</P>
<P>
   In January UConn overcame a 12-point deficit and handed St.
John's a 78-74 defeat at Madison Square Garden. After that loss,
Jarvis said: ``We can play with them _ and we can beat them. And
they know it. The day will come, I hope sooner than later. We will
beat them. In our house. Madison Square Garden. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing friendly about this rivalry. The tension
between the coaches is expressed through their respective players.
Ron Artest, St. John's sophomore forward, said of Connecticut,
``They're one of the more arrogant teams we play.''
</P>
<P>
   This tension has deep roots. Calhoun, 56, and Jarvis, 53, first
met as players: Jarvis at Northeastern, Calhoun at American
International. In 1972, Calhoun was hired to coach Northeastern,
effectively passing over Jarvis, who had been an assistant at
Northeastern since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, who would put Northeastern on the national map, hired
Jarvis as freshman coach. Jarvis held the job but continued to
teach physical education at Cambridge Rindge and Latin High school.
</P>
<P>
   He left after a season and took a job as assistant coach at
Harvard then got his first head coaching job in 1985 when he became
head coach at Boston University. Last night's championship game
marked the eighth time Calhoun and Jarvis have met. Calhoun led the
series 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the two grew out of Calhoun's one loss _ an
80-71 defeat in December 1986 in a game at B.U. It was Calhoun's
fifth game at UConn.
</P>
<P>
   The team bus was involved in an accident beforehand and UConn
wanted to postpone the game. B.U. told the Huskies they would have
to forfeit if they didn't show. Before the game Calhoun told
reporters about the accident and said Jarvis did not give his team
enough time to warm up. Calhoun vowed never to play B.U. again.
</P>
<P>
   The schools did not meet again until a 1990 match during the
opening round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament. When a reporter asked Calhoun how he felt about playing
against a Jarvis-coached team, he said: ``You don't have to be
dance partners to respect somebody. My relationship with him has
been very good _ because we're 100 miles apart.'' In 1993, Jarvis
and Calhoun served on the staff of Kansas Coach Roy Williams for
the U.S. 22- and-under team and apparently mended fences.
</P>
<P>
   But for two coaches with the same stubborn, ego-centric
personalities, no fence will stay mended for long. The relationship
took another turn last year when Jarvis and Calhoun were honored at
the America East Conference 20th anniversary banquet. Jarvis spoke
first, offering insights and comments about his accomplishments.
When Calhoun stepped up to podium that was close to a wall, he said
he was surprised there was enough room to accommodate Jarvis and
his ego.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd way that only those who have followed the Big East
from the beginning can know, the Calhoun-Jarvis feud and St. John's
resurgence answers a larger question: Will the Big East ever
recapture its glow of the 1980s? If Calhoun's relationship with
Jarvis is any indication, the answer is a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese put his finger on it earlier this week. What makes the
Big East so tantalizing is the mix and clash of personalities. In
this conference, it's never business, it's personal. UConn and St.
John's-Jarvis and Calhoun. This is a rivalry worth watching.  &QL;

<P>
   Dominique Moceanu hears people talking: ``The girl is fat. She's
out of shape. She'll never make it back.''
</P>
<P>
   She hears these voices when she goes to the gym. Four months is
a lifetime when you're 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Why didn't you train?' but I said, `Why do you
think?''' Moceanu blurted. ``I couldn't focus. I felt the world on
my shoulders. I didn't want to go in there and hurt myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She took four months off, not just to avoid the beam and the
mat, but to survive a vicious public scandal. Last October, Moceanu
left home after her father, Dumitru Moceanu, was suspected of
discussing a possible hit against her female coach and a male
adviser, claiming she was involved with the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is a family friend, with a wife and a child,'' Moceanu
said the other day. ``His family was helping me when I had problems
with my father. I remember thinking at one point, `They've got me
in the same category as Monica Lewinsky.' It's the climate of the
times. Everybody is so cynical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference, though,'' Moceanu added. ``Monica
and the president did those things, but I never even kissed
anybody. I've never had a boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu's father, who denied the allegations that he
contemplated a hit, has been ordered to avoid all contact with his
daughter at least until next October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been through so much,'' Dominique Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
   She is living in Colorado Springs in a dormitory room provided
by the U.S. Olympic Committee. She has gone back to the gym with a
different body than the slender child who was part of the
gold-medal American gymnastics team at the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   In jeans and a sweater, wearing makeup, Moceanu comes off as
more mature than the 25-year-old Lewinsky, whose interview Moceanu
watched carefully Wednesday night. Moceanu described Lewinsky as
``an airhead'' and said she will survive her own hideous exposure
to the American gossip machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made me grow up in a hurry,'' she said, her voice lower
than the standard disassociated singsong of most female gymnasts
and skaters.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu has time and empathy for others. She was in New York
last week to promote the 10th Special Olympics for the mentally
retarded, to be held from June 26 through July 4 in Research
Triangle Park, N.C. At the Axelle Fine Arts Galerie in Soho,
Moceanu posed with the official poster for the games, by artist
Fabienne Delacroix, and praised the Special Olympics, founded by
Eunice Kennedy Shriver in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games do so much for people,'' Moceanu said. ``They give
them dreams, they motivate them. I can relate to that because every
athlete learns to overcome injuries. I can appreciate other
people's struggles more, now that I have been through this.''
</P>
<P>
   She learned about pain in 1996 when she competed while
recuperating from a stress fracture in her tibia. Afterward, the
gold medalists capitalized on their celebrity, but her earnings
were controlled by her father back in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Moceanu left home, charging her father with
squandering most of the money in an ill-conceived huge gymnasium,
and slapping her on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never about money,'' Moceanu said the other day. ``It
was a personal thing, between my father and me.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her coach and family friend were merely protecting her,
at a time when she had no money and no experience in living on her
own. She has seen her mother and her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my mom to say hello to my father from me,'' she said.
``I cannot say what will happen in the future, but for now the
court says we cannot speak. I think he is heartbroken. He doesn't
understand. You cannot change a father-daughter relationship. You
only get one dad in your life. It's hard for him. It's hard for all
of us. But I did what I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people suggested she talk to a counselor, but Moceanu said,
``I didn't feel I needed it. If I haven't had a mental breakdown by
now, I never will. I've got my best friend in Houston, and she's
never betrayed a trust in nine years. It's like I said of the
family that helped me: one percent of the world is all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm pretty tough,'' she added, ``but I keep waiting
for it to turn positive. I used to have a good image, a happy
bubbly person. Now I felt so sad. The image was that I was this
girl who ran away with a married man. It just killed me. How can I
explain myself? It all got twisted up. I was second-guessing
myself, but nothing I did was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   After four months, Moceanu was reunited with her coach, Luminita
Miscenco, who had gone home to Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurting so badly those first days in the gym,'' Moceanu
said. ``I was just trying to get back my strength and stability.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she has made great progress and is training for the
2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. She has grown to be
5-feet-1-inch tall and 100 pounds, and has acquired a taste for
normalcy _ half a giant muffin and a foamy cappuccino during the
interview. Moceanu insisted she can still compete in a sport
dominated by preadolescents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They raised the age level to 16,'' she said. ``The competition
will be older. You start too young, you wind up hating it.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if the maturity of her body could be a negative,
Dominique Moceanu said, ``I feel I can handle responsibility. I'm
going to go to college, maybe go into broadcasting or acting, maybe
work with computers. I feel I can live with adversity. If I can get
through this, I can get through anything.''

KEY TEXANS AT ODDS ON LATINO GROUPS, DETENTION CENTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER DAY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Texans named to ranking membership posts on the
House immigration subcommittee are taking opposing positions on two
issues of consequence to the state.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's unclear whether Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee,
D-Houston, and Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, will agree on many
issues before the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigration's impact on Americans is so great that it's not an
exaggeration to say that you either change immigration policy or
you change every other policy,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't accept the goodness of immigration and what the
immigrants have been able to do and at the same time characterize
immigrants for all of the ailments and problems in America,''
Jackson Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2 million of the state's residents are immigrants, an
increase of 51 percent over the last decade. As many as 700,000
illegal immigrants may be living in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims,
and Jackson Lee, the subcommittee's ranking minority member, have
taken opposing stances on issues involving Central American
immigrants and overcrowded detention centers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jackson Lee, following the Clinton administration's lead, has
said she would like to ``balance'' the playing field for
Guatemalans, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans and Cubans who came to the
United States as refugees during the 1980s. Nicaraguans and Cubans
were granted amnesty by Congress in &UR;  &LR; 1997. Guatemalans and
Salvadorans, who sued for special benefits, are allowed to stay in
the United States only if they show they would be subjected to
``extreme hardship'' if deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in the discrepancies between Nicaraguans and
Guatemalans,'' Jackson Lee said. ``Some are given waivers and some
aren't. We need to be balanced and fair, not pitting one country
against the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has spoken out against the White House's efforts, which he
contends could make 240,000 people and 360,000 dependents eligible
for what he calls ``de facto amnesty.''
</P>
<P>
   The two groups have nothing in common, said Allen Kay, Smith's
spokesman. Guatemalans and Salvadorans came to the United States
because of civil strife in their homelands, while Cuban and
Nicaraguan refugees were allies in the fight against communism
during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said changing the rules would encourage others to come to
the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sets a terrible precedent,'' he said at a recent
subcommittee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the detention debate, Smith called for INS Commissioner
Doris Meissner's resignation after reports surfaced that the INS
may have been planning to release immigrants who are criminals to
relieve overcrowding in its detention facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither representative thinks violent offenders should
be released, they have different ideas as to what caused the
crowding and how it should be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Smith contends that overcrowded detention centers are a result
of mismanagement at INS, which has mushroomed in size over the past
five years. The agency now employs more armed agents with arrest
powers than the FBI and federal Bureau of Prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee blames crowding on Congress, which she said passed
overly broad laws requiring the INS to lock up productive, legal
immigrants ``It's not a question of too many detainees; it's
whether we have a rational law,'' said Lee, who cited cases in
which legal immigrants with minor convictions were detained under a
1996 immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said there are ``a handful of compelling exceptions,'' but
that the vast majority of immigrants with convictions are violent
offenders no one would want on the streets. A revision of the law
that put those ``compelling exceptions'' in detention centers is
unnecessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Although detention centers and Central American immigrants
have been top priorities, Smith and Lee have their own ideas about
what the rest of the year's focus should be.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee wants to explore whether caps on immigration from
certain countries are fair and how to reconcile the practice of
allowing migrants into the country for labor but not for
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Smith plans to investigate how immigration affects the U.S.
economy and its native workers as well as whether there should be
educational requirements for immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has an agenda, too. It would like Congress to restore
its authority to determine whether illegal immigrants with criminal
records should be detained.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one item that seems to pop up on everyone's agenda,
it's that something needs to be done to reform the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for reorganization range from eliminating the agency
to making it a free-standing department &UR;  &LR; in which a commissioner
could have more say in policy decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee said she supports a restructuring of the agency
rather than a dismantling.
</P>
<P>
   INS is attempting to head off the issue by working on a reform
plan that it will present to Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he is not sure it will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in (INS's plan) if it's productive. I'm not
interested in moving boxes around on an organizational chart,'' he
said. ``Do we need restructuring or do we need better management of
what we have?''

Though the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation's stated tax-exempt

spent on youth athletics. A community Olympic development program
which pledged to pump $1 million into kids sports programs in
Atlanta has yet to get underway nearly three years after the Games,

AS GOP CANDIDATES FLOCK TO IOWA, SOME ASK WHY GOV. BUSH IS ABSENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Hugh Winebrenner, unofficial statistician of
the Iowa presidential caucuses, scanned his latest tabulation of
how many times prospective Republican candidates have shown up in
the important early-caucus state.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 20, 1997, through early last week, Sen. Bob Smith of
New Hampshire had spent 44 days in Iowa, former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander 41 days, former Vice President Dan Quayle 21 days,
House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich 20 days _ and so on
through the list of more than a dozen probable as well as
implausible contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Even New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has spent three days in
Iowa. And hardly a week goes by that another would-be president or
two doesn't swirl through.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously missing from Winebrenner's list is the most
talked-about prospective candidate: Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has pledged to remain in Texas until the Legislature
adjourns in May, but then plans to travel the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has pointedly avoided travel to Iowa, the state that put
his father, former President Bush, on a winding road to the White
House almost 20 years ago with a surprise caucus victory over
Ronald Reagan. Reagan won the 1980 nomination and named Bush his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   So, Iowans ask, where is the Texas governor? When will he come
roam the rural towns and neatly trimmed suburbs? When will he
unveil a staff? When will he begin to set up the
precinct-by-precinct organization in the state's 99 counties that
is the traditional key to victory here?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he might be very strong. There is a lot of respect
here for the Bush name,'' said Greg E. Mollman, an insurance
executive active in Republican politics. ``But people here want to
see the candidate, look him in the eyes, before they make any
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   It's known as ``retail'' politics, and it takes time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa is a trench game,'' said Marlys Popma, former Iowa GOP
executive director who has become a leader in conservative activist
Gary Bauer's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even as vice president, Bush's father spent 43 days in Iowa in
the two years before the 1988 caucuses _ in which he ran third and
had to scramble to recover in the New Hampshire primary and go on
to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain risk in not showing up,'' said Winebrenner,
a professor of public administration at Drake University in Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides in Austin, Texas, refused to detail how much time the
governor was willing to spend in Iowa in the 11 months before the
Feb. 7 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told the Iowa legislators that if he does run he will take
Iowa seriously and he will campaign there,'' said Bush spokeswoman
Karen Hughes. ``But we've not gotten as far as discussing the
number of days anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Any idea that Bush can triumph in Iowa without a lot of personal
attention to the state and its Republican voters is ``totally
unrealistic,'' said David Kochel, state director for the
presidential campaign of Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just show up and wave from the tarmac,'' Kochel
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush stumps sufficiently in Iowa, he could do well if his
polling numbers remain high, activists agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to go with the winner. It would be foolish to deny
that's in people's thought process,'' said Popma, who was a state
leader in 1996 for the failed campaign of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be true for Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the wife of
the former senator and 1996 GOP presidential nominee, who will
announce Wednesday in Iowa that she is forming an exploratory
committee to consider running.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has been in Iowa three days over the last two years,
according to Winebrenner's count, and on her latest visit drew
2,500 people to a ``nonpolitical'' meeting in Ames, Iowa. She also
has the experience of campaigning often in the state for her
husband, Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he will not formally launch a campaign until late
summer, and some Iowa political operatives, including Bush
supporters, believe that will give him a rationale for skipping an
Iowa Republican straw poll scheduled for Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father ran third in the straw ballot in 1987, signaling
the problems he would face six months later in the Iowa caucuses.
But as the elder Bush proved, there is life after a political death
in Iowa _ he eventually won the nomination and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters try not to show any alarm about the governor's
decision to stay away from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. E. Thurman Gaskill of Corwith, a longtime Bush family
friend and supporter, said that whenever Bush comes to Iowa he will
know how to approach the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go out into the small communities,'' said Gaskill,
former president of the National Corn Growers Association. ``He
will meet people one on one. I think this is where the governor
comes across well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Brown, the Dallas Center lawyer who helped to run the 1980
George Bush campaign, predicted the younger Bush can pick up
supporters quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are excited about the prospect of a George (W.)
Bush candidacy,'' Brown said. ``People are looking for a new
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush and his campaign leaders may turn to an untested
generation of Iowans as organizers, in part because so many of the
old-line GOP tacticians are already signed up with other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest problem George W. is going to have is
finding leadership individuals who have organizational ability,''
Popma said. ``So many of those people are gone. I don't know where
he's going to for his leadership people.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not gone unnoticed here that Karl Rove, Bush's top
political organizer in Austin, is the former direct-mail vendor for
the Iowa GOP and, like Bush, has close ties to many key party
activists. Bush campaign chief possibilities include Rep. Chuck
Larsen Jr., who organized a letter from Iowa legislators urging
Bush to run.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Alexander has rounded up the biggest Iowa GOP stars,
including former Gov. Terry Branstad.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Roberts, a Des Moines lawyer who is national
Republican committeeman from Iowa, said the Texas governor should
not despair: ``The Bush organization has an abundance of riches
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question is, when will Bush begin to mobilize them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowans like to be romanced,'' Alexander told a group of GOP
activists last week, ``and it needs to be a longish courtship.''

   Glove manufacturers, which have found themselves the subjects of
lawsuits, have tried to block legislation banning latex gloves. At
the same time, they are creating alternative products.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Johnson &AMP; Johnson, for example, have
written to state legislators arguing against bills that would ban
powdered latex in hospitals. Meanwhile, the company has been
producing low-powder gloves and options to latex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been putting forward the alternatives,'' said John
McKeegan, a company spokesman. ``But there is a demand out there
for powdered gloves, and they are the ones that sell the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Regent Medical has been very aggressive in marketing its
powder-free gloves, including surgical gloves called Biogel, which
have a powder substitute that helps the glove slip on. Yet
powder-free gloves make up only 5 percent of the company's glove
business, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of hospitals across the country _ including Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury,
Conn., and Olean Hospital in Olean, N.Y. _ have either banned latex
gloves or restricted them to certain parts of their buildings. But
in general, doctors, particularly surgeons, are extremely resistant
to nonlatex alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, even medical workers with the allergy resist change.
``They think, `I desperately need this high-paying job in this
prestigious teaching hospital, I need the medical insurance and I
cannot afford to acknowledge a latex allergy,''' said Gail Lenehan,
chairwoman of the Massachusetts Emergency Nurses Association's
Latex Allergy Task Force. ``I have heard female surgeons say they
live in a man's world and fear a bias against them, and residents
say they won't speak up because they are low on the totem pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some hospitals are starting to change. ``We wanted to be
a leader in this area,'' said Robert G. Hamilton, an associate
professor of medicine and pathology at Johns Hopkins, which is
becoming latex-free. ``Cost is the fundamental question. But we
purchased a sufficient volume of stretch vinyl, which resulted in
no change in cost.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, an increasing number of lawsuits are charging
manufacturers with negligence and product liability, or with
continuing to market a product that they know to be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Howell Rosenberg, a partner with Brookman, Rosenberg, Brown &AMP;
Sandler, a law firm in Philadelphia, estimated that about 250 cases
against glove manufacturers have gone to federal courts around the
country, up from about 25 cases two and a half years ago. His
office is handling a suit on behalf of all the Federal cases,
roughly 12 percent of which are from New York. Dozens more are
being tried in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to be closely watched,'' Rosenberg said.
``We are talking about lots of people, and the greatest number of
victims are in health care. That is a very significant segment of
the work force who are doing very important jobs.''

 &HT;    KASICH BOWLS OVER VOTERS IN IOWA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ John Kasich's ``Rolling Through Iowa'' tour of
bowling centers scored a strike this weekend among those looking
for a true man of the people in the Republican presidential field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no zip,'' Kasich laughed Saturday after leaving a
7-10 split on Lane 2 at the 20th Century Bowling Center. It was the
second of six bowling centers on his four-day weekend visit to
Iowa, where the first presidential voting in the nation will take
place in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Karen, his wife, laughed. What the hyperkenetic congressman does
not lack is zip. He may have bowled only a 96, but he was bouncing
from one lane to the next, talking about ``running America from the
bottom up,'' with ``everyday people ... having more power over
their lives and more freedom to pursue their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The political establishment sees Kasich's chances of winning the
Republican presidential nomination in 2000 as about equal to those
of converting that 7-10 split. He front-running opponents have
establishment names like Bush and Dole, and his poll numbers put
him far back in the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to go anywhere,'' said Charles Cook, publisher
of the Cook Political Report newsletter in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Goeas, a veteran GOP pollster who has signed on with the
Kasich campaign, insisted his client has a chance to break out of
the pack because he is the least packaged and programmed candidate
in the field. ``He catches the imagination,'' said Goeas.
</P>
<P>
   That view was shared by some at the 20th Century Bowling Center,
where a $20 bill will get you a 12-inch pizza, a pitcher of
Budweiser and 20 frames of bowling, with change to spare _ if you
have your own ball and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, a man of modest background, was seen as a true populist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really relates to people,'' said Bud Legg, athletic
director of Ames High School. ``He has the knack for bringing all
factions together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hell-raiser,'' Kasich told a group of small business
owners as he described how he would shake up the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you logged on to my Web site, kiddo?'' he asked
9-year-old Dana Deyoe, daughter of hog farmer Dave Deyoe from the
nearby town of Nevada. ``There's a lot on there about my dog, Penny
Bird. There's more about my dog than about me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wear a toga,'' he told a group of Iowa State University
students as they jointly planned his return visit for a fantasy
rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   And rarely does Kasich forget to mention his roots, that he is
the ``son of a mailman.'' It is left to his listeners to draw their
own contrast of Kasich to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
millionaire son of a millionaire ex-president, or to Elizabeth
Dole, the millionaire wife of a millionaire ex-senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been where we are,'' said Terri Loney, an Ames middle
school teacher who accepted Kasich's invitation to join him in
bowling. ``It's refreshing to see his enthusiasm, his concern for
the common man. His background clearly makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   On this Saturday, while acknowledging that he ``didn't grow up
poor,'' he recalled how as a child he used to wish the family car
had automatic transmission and a radio. His father always bought
the cheaper, standard-shift cars with no costly extras.
</P>
<P>
   Heads nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Making that personal connection is just as important, at least
at this stage in the campaign, as his nuts-and-bolts agenda of tax
cuts, reforming Social Security and Medicare, school vouchers and
eliminating the Departments of Commerce and Education.
</P>
<P>
   It's one reason that his 16 years in the House, the last five as
chairman of the Budget Committee, do not seem to count against him
at a time when Congress is held in low esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the ins and outs of the government's finances like
nobody else,'' said Deyoe.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich acknowledged to the reporters tagging along that his
``Rolling Through Iowa'' tour is a shameless publicity stunt. But
he still believes that the bowling centers are perfect settings for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be a campaign just run from television,''
Kasich said. ``I want people to come look me in the eye, poke me,
smell me, and I think they'll love me.''

 (Eds: Changes made throughout story to add further details and
polish the language.)  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft Corp. moved to defuse a potentially
explosive privacy issue on Saturday, saying it would modify a
feature of its Windows 98 operating system that has been quietly
used to create a vast database of personal information about
computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft in effect conceded that the feature, a unique
identifying number used by Windows and a handful of other Microsoft
products, had the potential to be far more invasive than a
traceable serial number in Intel Corp.'s new Pentium III computer
chip that has privacy advocates up in arms. The difference is that
the Windows number is tied to an individual's name, to identifying
numbers on the hardware in his computer and even to documents that
he creates.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the Windows number with all these data, the
privacy advocates said, could result in the ability to track a
single user and the documents he created across vast computer
networks. Hackers could compromise the resulting database, or
subpoenas might allow authorities to gain access to information
that would otherwise remain private and unavailable. Privacy
advocates fear that availability will lead to abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely sensitive to any privacy concerns,'' Robert
Bennett, Microsoft's group product manager for Windows, said. ``The
software was not supposed to send this information unless the
computer user checked a specific option.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the option to collect the information had been
added to the software so that Microsoft support employees would be
able to help users diagnose problems with their computers more
accurately. He said the Redmond, Wash., software giant had never
intended to use the data for marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it would take the steps after a computer
programmer in Massachusetts discovered the numbers attached to
documents that he had created. The programmer, Robert M. Smith,
told Microsoft he believed the practice created a potential threat
to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said Microsoft would alter the way the registration
program works in the next maintenance release of Windows 98. He
said the company's technicians would look through its databases and
expunge information that had already been collected as a result of
earlier versions.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also exploring the possibility of creating a free
utility program that would make it possible for Windows users to
delete the serial-number information from a small database in the
part of Windows known as the registry, where it is now collected.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is the president of Phar Lap Software Inc., a
software tools development company, contacted Microsoft last week
after discovering that the Microsoft Office business software was
creating unique numbers identifying his personal computer and
embedding them in spreadsheet and word-processing documents.
</P>
<P>
   Smith discovered that the hardware identifier was sent to
Microsoft even when he instructed the registration program not to
send it. The discovery brought to light what Bennett contended was
a programming error.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said last week that they were using the
number in the company's software in an effort to find a unique
identifier to keep components from colliding with one another in an
increasingly complex world of networked computers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith said that the number created a ``digital
fingerprint'' that could be used to match a document created by a
word-processing or spreadsheet program with a particular computer.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after further studying the ``registration wizard''
_ the software module that enables customers to register their
copies of the Windows 98 operating system for support and updates _
Smith discovered that the number, known as a Globally Unique
Identifier, was being transmitted to Microsoft as part of a list of
registration information that generally includes the owner's name,
address, phone number, certain other demographic information and
details about what hardware and software are on or attached to the
user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft never asked me if it was OK to send in this number,
and they never said it was being sent,'' Smith said. ``They are
apparently building a database that relates Ethernet adapter
addresses to personal information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethernet adapters are cards inserted in a personal computer that
enable it to connect to high-speed networks within corporations,
and from there out to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy erupted just weeks after Intel, maker of the
most widely used processors for machines that run Windows, agreed
to change a small software utility that came with the new Pentium
III chip so that a serial number on the chip would be inactive
unless the computer user switched it on.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy activists have been attacking both companies, arguing
that identification numbers can be easily misused to permit the
creation of electronic monitoring systems that track a computer
user's behavior in cyberspace, or dossiers of personal information
about individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has sparked a heated debate over the fundamental
technology of modern computer networks and software systems, which
routinely employ serial numbers to identify individual computers
and software modules known as ``objects'' that can be shared by a
number of programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Intel number identified only a computer. The Windows
number identifies a person. And because the Windows number created
a potential linkage between individuals and confidential documents
they created, privacy advocates said they were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is horrendous,'' said Jason Catlett, president of
Junkbusters, a consumer privacy organization based in Greenbrook,
N.J. ``They're tattooing a number into each file. Think of the
implications. If some whistleblower sends a file, it can be traced
back to the person himself. It's an extremely dangerous feature.
Why did they do it?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups have long warned about the dangers of centralized
information and electronic monitoring. The privacy community has
been discussing the implications of the Intel Pentium III serial
number with Intel, and while some privacy advocates acknowledge
that the number can play an important role in protecting both
privacy and security, others have called for a boycott of Intel,
arguing that the likelihood of misuse of the number is extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fear of a centralized Big Brother, they add that the
rise of the Internet has made it possible for individual companies
to freely use detailed personal information for commercial ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the absence of legal rules that limit the
collection and use of personal information,'' said Marc Rotenberg,
director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington. ``It's clear to me that large Internet companies such
as Microsoft, AOL and Netscape will try to squeeze out privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives said on Friday evening that they had
developed the feature for technical reasons related to the need to
distinguish among millions of different hardware and software
objects on the Internet but had never considered the privacy
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft software engineers say the roots of the company's
numbering system go back to a system developed by computer
researchers at the Open Software Foundation in Cambridge in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to develop technology that would enable computers
to communicate across networks, a numbering system called a
Universally Unique Identifier, or UUID, was established as part of
a software standard known as the Distributed Computing Environment,
or DCE. Microsoft relied on this standard when it developed a
remote computing capability for Windows known as Object Linking and
Embedding, or OLE.
</P>
<P>
   The company's designers changed the UUID term to GUID, or
Globally Unique Identifier, and it is widely used by software
applications today. For example, the GUID is used for ``cookies'' _
files that Web sites write to a visitor's hard drive to identify
the user later and to track his or her travels through the Web.

NETS TAKE A CASUAL STROLL TO OBLIVION

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the undisputed worst team in the Eastern Conference was run
off its home floor by a banged-up and bad Charlotte Hornets team
Thursday night, an annual rite of winter returned to the
Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Open season on those poor old Nets began anew after nearly a
year off due to renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put in Jack Haley,'' someone yelled facetiously from behind
the team bench, imploring the assistant coach/team mascot to suit
up. Someone else sat on the opposite baseline, holding up a sign
that read, ``We Need a New Coach.''
</P>
<P>
   John Calipari, the current coach, claimed he did not notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing the culture'' has been a huge theme for the coach and
the team, but watching the Hornets open a 17-point lead in the
first quarter was enough to make you wonder how much had changed.
Once again, that old Net malcontent, Derrick Coleman, was on the
floor _ albeit for Charlotte _ the fans were fed up and the
playoffs were for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Hyped to no end, the team that looked good on a glossy magazine
cover in early February is now in danger of playing out the rest of
its days next to the automobile classified ads.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets meet a Knicks team on Sunday at Madison Square Garden
that badly needs a victory after falling hard on the road two
straight times. But at a depressing 3-12, Keith Van Horn, Jayson
Williams and their teammates need the game more. But that's not how
it works with the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   You can fire Calipari, which, unless the Nets completely bottom
out, is unlikely. You can ship players out and bring new blood in
until you fool yourself into believing you have the right
chemistry. You can wait for Sam Cassell to recover from a sprained
ankle and create on offense again. You can even make impressive
runs until you get back into every game.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't run from the obvious: As a franchise, the Nets
don't want it right now.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds Rileyish, but the observation does not come from a
South Beach motivational seminar. Instead, it comes from watching
the Nets up close on Friday, a few feet from behind the team bench.
</P>
<P>
   They simply do not want to win badly enough. They give up
uncontested layups in a half-court defense. They let the man
they're guarding beat them for position under the basket. As
athletic as they can be on offense, they have this soft, West Coast
feel about them, like they believe they can match your circus move
with their own. It's as if some carefree, Venice Beach pick-up
crowd won an all-expense paid trip to play in the NBA for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you have to be a thug to win in the East, but a little
more nasty disposition would help their cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets don't need a point guard as much as they need a
presence, a Mario Elie or Charles Oakley, to tidy the place up with
some elbow grease.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced expectations probably wouldn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   Some deranged prophet from this newspaper picked them to go to
the Eastern Conference finals. Of course, that prediction was
brought to you by the same person who said the lockout would end in
early December. So I got caught up in the hype, too.
</P>
<P>
   But trust me on this one: knee-jerk solutions are not the
answer. They don't need a coaching change as much as they need a
heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Watching them against the Hornets, you never got the feeling the
players stopped playing for Calipari. With a few minutes left in
the game and the Nets coming back from a 25-point deficit, they
were actually clapping like high school kids after one of his
timeout pep talks.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was that Williams played only 11 minutes and
then was off getting X-rays on a badly sprained finger.
</P>
<P>
   He is taking a lot of heat for this mess, which makes little
sense. Just because you sign an $86 million deal doesn't mean
you're supposed to average 20 points a game. Williams was never a
great offensive player, and now he can barely hold the ball with
two hands. If he can put back five missed shots a game and play
with the same tenacity, he should be as blameless as Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   With players occasionally sniping at each other and everyone
throwing darts at Calipari behind his back, Van Horn is one of the
few people in the organization who seems to understand that a
bunker mentality is one of the few ways in this league that bad
teams become good.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari, John Nash, the general manager, and Michael Rowe, the
team president, had a briefing session with the new owners last
week regarding trades. The prevailing feeling was that unless a
no-brainer comes along, this lockout-tinged season is not worth
backing up the truck over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You check the thickness of your skin to make sure it's as
thick as it was last season,'' Rowe said when asked if he expected
troubled teams to be making wholesale changes. ``There's more
pressure in this season, because there's a limited amount of time
to correct problems. But in the history of the NBA, this season
will always have an asterisk next to it, almost like Roger Maris'
61 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We'll get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Calipari's job is indeed safe for the moment and moving
players is unlikely, maybe the Nets will realize they are in this
miserable season together and change course _ before the lottery do
them part.

SPORTS COMMENTARY:   POSADA IS EVIDENCE OF OWNERS' CONTROL THAT
CONE WANTS TO END
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Yankees renewed Jorge Posada's contract last week with
unilateral frugality, there was little debate about the players'
true market worth. There was no harping on fairness and
faithfulness, as there was last Thanksgiving when Bernie Williams
had the audacity to play the field and make a $90 million catch.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Boss in charge, and the public yawned. In
exercising his contractual leverage over two notable contributors
to last season's all-conquering team, Steinbrenner had a rare
chance to play the game in 50s fashion. He picked the figures, drew
up the contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Take it, he said, or go play in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Steinbrenner knew, those players will be eligible for
arbitration, along the six-year climb to unrestricted free agency.
By that time, beyond the 2001 expiration of baseball's collective
bargaining agreement, major league owners may be counting on a new
set of rules. How dearly they would love to play the NBA game, pay
their players along fixed salary lines.
</P>
<P>
   They should not hold their breath. This will not happen. ``Not
without a huge fight,'' David Cone said recently at his dressing
stall in the Yankees' spring training clubhouse in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   These were not fighting words, the American League's longtime
player representative wanted to say. They merely reflected the
reality of a different sport, an organized union, a hardened
membership. The basketball players backed themselves into a corner,
ultimately dealt with their first taste of labor strife the way
most people thought they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``They held out for a while,'' Cone said. ``Then they basically
caved.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not that simple, given the careers on the edge and the
many mouths to feed. The NBA players are still reeling in sums
unimaginable to the working stiff, but within a uniform system that
has already had a numbing effect on the upwardly mobile. The NBA
badly needed financial constraints on its young, like Major League
Baseball's, but now makes no special allowances for its most gifted
talent, its most marketable stars.
</P>
<P>
   The next Patrick Ewing will be paid the same as the next Michael
Jordan. There is something inherently unjust and anti-competitive
in a system such as this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Player A gets the same as Player B, no matter how much more
productive, how many more championships, how many more tickets he's
sold,'' said Cone. ``This is tough for me to fathom.''
</P>
<P>
   The general public perception is that the NBA has a system that
is fixed, while Major League Baseball's is broke. Cone would argue,
rather convincingly, for the opposite. He cites the fact that
Bernie Williams toiled in the Yankees' organization for 13 years
before free agency, and wonders what a power and switch-hitting
catcher like Posada, who turns 28 in August, would be worth to any
number of teams.
</P>
<P>
   At least a couple of million more, in all likelihood, than the
$350,000 he got from the Yanks. Steinbrenner's stinginess, of
course, was directly related to Williams' haul, but the rules favor
those who achieve. If he earns it on the field, Posada's day will
come, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay us whatever you want,'' Cone said, ``but all we ask is
that at some point in our careers, let us be free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   He understands that these pleas do not resonate with the paying
public. ``They just see it as millionaires versus billionaires,''
said Cone. ``But that doesn't mean you just agree to one of those
so-called deals where the owners say, `Let's be 50-50 partners and
we make all decisions.' We've seen what happened when the NFL got a
hard salary cap.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, he said, got locked in and the owners wound up with
soaring franchise values. Over $500 million, Cone couldn't help but
notice, for a Cleveland franchise that didn't yet own one set of
cleats. Steinbrenner, along those lines, smartened up recently, and
created a more leveraged market for his principal ownership, rather
than let Charles Dolan dictate terms as an unchallenged suitor for
the team or its television rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are part of baseball's aristocracy. They are not the
Montreal Expos. Yes, Cone admits, baseball's competitive imbalance
must be addressed. No, he added, the answer is not to force players
to solve every problem the owners won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what the models are,'' he said. ``When I first pitched
in the American League, the places nobody wanted to go were
Baltimore and Cleveland. I'm not saying stadiums are the whole
problem but that's part of it. There comes a time when you just
have to say to a Montreal, if you can't get a stadium, publicly or
privately, maybe it's time to move.''
</P>
<P>
   From a public-relations standpoint, Cone admits that baseball's
warring sides did no better than basketball's during their 1994
strike. The positions were uncompromising, the arguments strident,
the personalities bland. ``Next time, we don't need to see Donald
Fehr and Bud Selig on TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has high hopes for Paul Beeston, now operating as
baseball's chief operating officer. By 2001, if his enduring right
shoulder has run out of innings, New York's most savvy athlete in
the field of communications said he might even be inclined to put a
more engaging face on the players' plight.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada could do much worse.

 &HT;    `Much is still left to be done' as Lewis leads delegation across
Alabama
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ ``I remember how vivid the sounds were as the
troopers rushed toward us _ the clunk of the troopers' heavy boots,
the whoops of rebel yells from the white onlookers, the clip-clop
of horses' hooves hitting the hard asphalt of the highway, the
voice of a woman shouting, `Get'em! '''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rep. John Lewis in his memoir, ``Walking with the Wind,''
recalling the 1965 voters' rights march across the Edmund Pettus
Bridge in Selma, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) walks across the Edmund Pettus
Bridge today, he will have a congressional delegation at his side
instead of a band of civil rights protestors. He will be escorted
by Alabama state troopers rather than face their bully clubs as he
did 34 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since ``Bloody Sunday,'' a march that riveted
the nation and created a ground swell of support for lifting
restrictions on the right of African-Americans to vote. But as
Lewis sees it, ``Much is still left to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   His message today will be about hope for an open dialogue on how
to dismantle the social barriers between blacks and whites more
than three decades after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis hopes some of the lessons learned during that struggle can
now be used by Congress as it begins to mend the bitter divisions
left in the wake of the impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see this as an opportunity to do some healing and to
build some bridges of understanding, some bridges of
reconciliation,'' Lewis said. ``The goal is not to just go on the
trip to observe. It is to learn and to grow _ to take some lessons
from the civil rights movements, to learn that in spite of what
happened in places like Birmingham, Montgomery and Selma, people
didn't become bitter, they didn't become hostile.'' Sponsored by
the Washington D.C.-based Faith and Politics Institute, two
busloads of lawmakers, their families and staff are making their
way through Alabama to see firsthand where the civil rights
movement was born and some of the movement's bloodiest battles
fought.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 17 congressmen, there was noticeable relief to be away
from partisan rancor over Clinton's cover-up of his affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure changes our focus and gets us talking about meaningful
issues away from the controversy swirling around us,'' said Rep.
Ray LaHood (R-Ill.), who presided over the House vote last December
to impeach a president for the second time in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the group had never been to Alabama. Some were too young
to remember the blood that was lost protesting written and
unwritten laws that separated blacks and whites in housing,
schools, laundry facilities, restaurants, marriage, and even water
fountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a boy when John Lewis was fighting the struggle. We
know the pilgrimage is not over, there is work to be done,'' said
Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), referring to a recent racist incident in
Texas where a black man was dragged behind a pickup truck and
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights movement ``is something we should always
remember and can never forget,'' said Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio),
who brought his two daughters on the journey.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Rev. C.L. Bachus of Kansas City, Kan., was in
Alabama, signs warned blacks that they were ``Entering Wallace
Country.'' The signs _ referring to the late Gov. George Wallace,
who was then a strident segregationist _ used to send shivers down
his spine because, ``we never knew what would happen to us in
Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the state with a black congressman filled Bachus
with pride. ``You forget about what it once was like,'' he said
watching a film at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute on Friday
night. In the film, police sprayed young black children with
firehoses so strong that the water removed bark from trees.
</P>
<P>
   The white-only signs in front of public bathrooms are long gone,
but racial discrimination still exists in more subtle ways, said
William Alexander, a 16-year-old high school junior from Washington
who is traveling with the group as a reporter for National Public
Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said he is discouraged at the way Congress has focused
so intently on the Lewinsky saga instead of ``what is going on
outside, like racism.'' Issues such as economic disparity between
races and job preferences that favor whites should be addressed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is showing me how far we have advanced and that there is
something we can do about tomorrow,'' Alexander said.

HIGH SCHOOL SOPHOMORE BEING COMPARED TO HOLDSCLAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She has that shy, awkward manner typical of
teen-agers. But there are moments when the blushing young woman
exudes a poise and quiet confidence beyond her years.
</P>
<P>
   Age is not what it used to be. Not when you have become somewhat
of a basketball legend at 16.
</P>
<P>
   Clare Droesch, a 5-foot-10-inch sophomore guard for Christ the
King High School girls' varsity in Queens, knows the feeling _ the
one that comes when you are being mentioned in the same breath with
alumnae such as Chamique Holdsclaw, the Tennessee Vols forward
considered by many to be the greatest high school girls basketball
player ever, and Sue Bird, the Lady Royal now of Connecticut
Huskies fame who was known in her high school days as Ms.
Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of Droesch's being the ``next Holdsclaw'' started in
January, when she broke the school's single-game scoring record
first set with Holdsclaw's 38 points, then reset at 39 by Bird.
Droesch scored 48 points against Bishop Kearney of Brooklyn on Jan.
8 during an away game.
</P>
<P>
   Droesch remembered being so caught up in the rhythm-and-flow of
the game that she did not realize she was shooting her way into
school history. As she was walking off the court at the end of the
game, a teammate, Patricia Tubridy, approached her and said:
``Clare, you did it. You broke Chamique's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that career-defining moment, Droesch has been inundated
with news media attention; opponents have started to double-team
her; teammates are expecting her to make the shot in clutch
situations and five to 10 colleges a week have been sending
brochures to her family's Rockaway Beach home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life's definitely changed a lot with the press and
everything and people comparing me to Chamique and Sue,'' Droesch
said. ``I see it in the way my family and friends treat me. It's
all cool, like I did something good as a sophomore. Now I can try
to break my own record.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there is a more immediate goal she is shooting for:
helping her teammates maintain Christ the King's consecutive state
championship streak, which is currently at nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Royals, the defending Catholic High School Athletic
Association girls champions, finished the regular season with a
19-3 record and are ranked No. 1 in the city and 24th in the nation
by USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   The team faced Bishop Loughlin of Brooklyn in the first round of
the playoffs Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to help take this team to a state championship,'' said
Droesch, who averaged 24 points and 6.7 rebounds and is being
touted as the best female sophomore playing today. ``When Chamique
was here, the team won four state championships. That's a mark I'd
like to strive for.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Droesch is determined not to let the hype go to her
head. She admits that she has to work on her overall game and is
the first to tell anyone who asks that she doesn't consider herself
in Holdsclaw's or Bird's league _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a sophomore; I'm still learning a lot and I want to
work on my defense and my inside game, like posting up,'' Droesch
said as she sat beside her beaming parents, Patti and George
Droesch.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vincent Cannizzaro hails his star's versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has multiple ways she can score points,'' Cannizzaro said.
``It's not that she needs to have the ball in a certain area of the
court or take a certain kind of shot. It's not that she's a post
player or a perimeter player. She can do both. She can score inside
or outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The last player to see the court like that was Holdsclaw,
according to Cannizzaro, who said the comparisons do not end there.
</P>
<P>
   Droesch is as good a passer as Holdsclaw, and Droesch, like
Holdsclaw, was constantly working on her defense. But the coach
thinks that Droesch has the potential to become the school's
highest scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's not just that she scores points, she shoots in
the high percentages, close to 50 percent from the floor,''
Cannizzaro said. ``We're constantly telling Clare we'd like for her
to make in the range of 23 to 30 shots a game. If she can shoot in
that range, at 50 percent, it's really a plus for the team.'' &QL;

STRAHAN WELCOMES THE CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Strahan, the Pro Bowl defensive end who is the New York
Giants' most dominant player, has a message for any teammate miffed
at the $5 million signing bonus and $4 million annual salary given
to Kerry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 21 guys making a million or more a year,'' Strahan
said. ``And we were 8-8 last year. If you're upset with what
Kerry's making, think about whether you should be earning what
you're earning.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan is the epitome of the 21st-century professional athlete
in that he knows his game and knows his business, and knows there
is only a subtle difference between the two.
</P>
<P>
   The 280-pound Strahan has the speed to outrun most quarterbacks
and the strength to body slam them when he catches them. He is a
loud, teasing locker-room leader and equally adept at the quiet,
corner-of-the-room philosophical or motivational discussion. And he
can count.
</P>
<P>
   When he looks at the Giants, he sees more seven-figure salaries
than any other team in the National Football League. But he is
aware that the game is played at an emotional pitch, and Strahan
has come to the conclusion that the financially secure Giants,
comforted by a management style that has been decidedly
conservative, have grown complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were just collecting checks last year,'' Strahan said in
the locker room last week as he dressed for the Giants' off-season
conditioning workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This off-season there's been a lot of turnover in here, and I
think it's good. We need to put a little fright in people. This is
a place that stuck with guys too long. If you're not happy here or
they're not happy with you, get out and go someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point, Strahan said, is running back Tyrone Wheatley,
whom the Giants traded to Miami last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyrone had the same problems with two sets of coaching
staffs,'' Strahan said. ``If it happens with two coaching staffs
then you've got to look at yourself. Tyrone needs to start blaming
Tyrone for some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan added that he wished the Giants were playing Miami this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like a shot at him,'' Strahan said. ``He used to say to
us: `If I go somewhere else, I'll be running over you guys.' Well,
I hope we get him some day. We'll see what happens, Tyrone.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan, scheduled to be a free agent in 2000, is on the verge
of the biggest pay day for a defensive player in the history of the
NFL. The Giants are determined to sign him to a new contract this
spring or summer. It will break the bank for someone who isn't a
quarterback or star running back and should easily be in the $8
million range annually.
</P>
<P>
   But Strahan is far from content.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impatient,'' he said. ``I'm so sick of the distractions to
winning I've seen around here. I heard guys talking about their
contracts in the middle of last season, and I wanted to tell them:
`Shut your mouth. Our record is 3-7, you're lucky this team wants
you.''''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Strahan is close to Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead, who has
boycotted the team's off-season conditioning program this year in
an apparent protest over a contract he wants to renegotiate.
Strahan, who talks with Armstead almost daily, said he understands
Armstead's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem with Jessie,'' Strahan said. ``I know
he hasn't missed a workout in six years, but he's at home in Dallas
working out every day. It's hard when salaries are going through
the roof and you're one of the best at your position and you're not
getting what you think you deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's how he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is an incongruity to Strahan's stance on Armstead and
how he feels about other Giants concerned about their pay, Strahan
sees the distinction as easily explainable. Armstead, the team's
only other Pro Bowl player, has performed at a high level, played
hurt and, when he felt it necessary, threatened teammates he
thought weren't playing hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more guys who are angry about losing,'' Strahan said.
``Jessie and me, our patience is very short. And that's what I like
about Ernie Accorsi; I think he's the same way. He hasn't been
afraid to pull the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi, who has been the general manager for 14 months, has cut
wide receiver Chris Calloway and quarterback Danny Kanell and
signed Collins. Accorsi, along with Coach Jim Fassel, has also
ignored the longtime Giant guard Greg Bishop in free agency, cut
cornerback Carlton Gray and exposed the starting safety Tito Wooten
in the expansion draft, which cowed Wooten into a huge pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's blowing people's minds around here, but I like the new
direction,'' Strahan said. ``It's like the Kerry Collins signing.
People say, `How do you give him all that money?' Well, suppose he
stays on the right track and something happens around here, and we
need him? If he plays well, we will look like geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have gotten somebody real cheap because winning
quarterbacks make a lot of money. It's one of the chances you have
to take. I'm willing to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it doesn't work out?
</P>
<P>
   Strahan motioned toward the vacant locker where Kanell dressed
until a month ago. ``Guys aren't getting forever to make it
anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Strahan, a throwback to a different era and a modern athlete
at the same time, there's a new Giants order and he likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the business side and there's the team,'' he said.
``Once the season starts, I just want to win. And I don't care
about hurting people's feelings if that's what it takes.''

EXPLOSIVE DUKE ADVANCES TO ACC FINAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   BARRY JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The capacity crowd in the Charlotte Coliseum
Saturday afternoon was pulling loudly for the underdog, North
Carolina State. Top-ranked Duke was playing without a starter,
Trajan Langdon, and it lacked its accustomed air of domination. Two
more starters, Elton Brand and Chris Carrawell, were
uncharacteristically ineffective in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it took the Blue Devils all of five minutes to take the
lead for good, and another 20 to put away the fifth-seeded Wolfpack
in a semifinal of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-68 victory, Duke's 26th in a row, improved the Blue
Devils' record to 31-1 and moved them to the tournament final for
the second consecutive year. On Sunday, they will face the winner
of Saturday's second semifinal between second-seeded Maryland
(26-4) and No. 3 North Carolina (23-8).
</P>
<P>
   Duke, undefeated during the conference regular season, last won
an ACC tournament title in 1992. N.C. State, still harboring hopes
of a bid to the NCAA tournament despite losses in five of its last
eight games and a weak nonconference schedule, fell to 18-13.
</P>
<P>
   Given his first start in Langdon's place, the freshman Corey
Maggette scored 17 points in the half to lead all scorers and
finished with 24, a personal best.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils led by only 43-35 at halftime, and N.C. State
remained within eight points until the customary Duke explosion
came about five minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Over a span of five and a half minutes the Blue Devils went on a
21-5 run, taking a 74-50 lead with 9 minutes 23 seconds left on a
fast-break layup by guard Will Avery. Duke hit 11 of its first 12
shots in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   During the decisive stretch Duke's defense forced five
turnovers, all of which resulted in scores, and held N.C. State to
1-of-6 shooting. Brand was a key factor in the run, and finished
the game with 19 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack never drew closer than 15 points the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State, a quarterfinal winner over Wake Forest, played with
surprising confidence in the early going against Duke, which beat
the Wolfpack twice this season by an average margin of 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   There were four lead changes in the first five minutes, with
Duke finally emerging with a 9-8 edge at the 15:04 mark on a follow
shot by the sophomore big man Chris Burgess.
</P>
<P>
   Brand, Duke's leading scorer, missed his first five shots from
the floor, all at short range.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the degree of difficulty, Duke also played without
Langdon, its second-leading scorer. The senior guard, who had
started 121 consecutive games, sprained his left foot in Duke's
104-67 victory over Virginia in Thursday's opening round. He
remains questionable for Sunday
</P>
<P>
   Handicaps notwithstanding, the Blue Devils permanently took the
lead with a dozen unanswered points, capped by a pair of Brand free
throws that pushed their lead to 19-8 with 11:34.
</P>
<P>
   But N.C. State was not to be put off easily. Every time Duke
built its margin to double figures in the first 25 minutes, the
Wolfpack responded with a flurry. Key to each rally was the
perimeter scoring of Justin Gainey and Anthony Grundy.
</P>
<P>
   Each made a trio of 3-pointers in the first half; N.C. State
usually averages five a game. The guards had 11 points each in the
period, with Gainey's 3-pointer at the buzzer cutting Duke's
halftime lead to single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Grundy, a freshman, finished with 19 points, while Gainey had
12.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Wolfpack's 2-3 zone drew a number of offensive
fouls from the Blue Devils and often forced them to the perimeter.
Duke shot only 40.6 percent from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps concerned about the game's drift and his team's apparent
acceptance of the conventional wisdom that the Wolfpack posed
little threat, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was unusually animated on
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski's vociferous objections to several calls finally
resulted in a technical foul, his first in two seasons, at the 6:44
mark of the first half. But N.C. State got only 1 point from the
possession.

FORGED LETTER RESULTS IN RELEASE OF PRISONER FACING FORGERY TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ It's only fitting that it was a man charged with
forgery who slipped out of the Johnson County Jail recently on the
strength of a phony letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very creative minds out there,'' said Bill
Miskell, a spokesman for the Kansas Department of Corrections.
``And we're real interested in finding the creative mind that faxed
that letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter notified jail officials that a parole violation
warrant against Joshua Williams would be dropped on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Believing the letter to be genuine, deputies allowed Williams,
38, of Kansas City, Kan., to leave the jail that day after he
posted bond on two forgery cases.
</P>
<P>
   The letter appears to be on Corrections Department letterhead,
but it contains typographical errors, including ``Govenor.'' It
ends with the forged signature of an actual parole officer.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had been in the jail since Feb. 1. He was on parole for
a Wyandotte County forgery conviction, and the Department of
Corrections had filed a warrant alleging that he had violated
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was re-arrested Wednesday in Kansas City, Kan., and he
was returned to the Johnson County Jail on Friday. His trial on
four counts of forgery is scheduled to start Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Sheriff's Department and the Corrections Department
said the incident was a first, and both are taking steps to ensure
it doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   And they hope to prosecute whoever sent the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear someone else was involved,'' said Maj.
Bernie Johnston of the Sheriff's Department. ``Some of these people
seem to have a lot more time to concoct these things than we do to
try and catch them.''

 &HT;    SAFETY ADVOCATES WANT TIGHTER TRUCKING REGULATION
 &HT;    With TRUCK-SAFETY. For release Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With more people being killed in crashes between
passenger vehicles and big rigs, some consumer groups and members
of Congress are blaming the federal agency responsible for
maintaining truck safety.
</P>
<P>
   The critics charge that the Transportation Department's Office
of Motor Carriers (OMC) has been lax in enforcing safety
regulations on commercial motor vehicles. The alarming results,
they say, are more defective trucks on the roads and more fatigued
drivers falsifying their required log books in order to evade
federal limits on time behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``OMC has not been doing a good job,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
transportation. ``The office has become too cozy with the trucking
industry, which it is supposed to be regulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf recently held a hearing on his proposal to move OMC from
Transportation's Federal Highway Administration to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   That agency ``is charged with the responsibility of overseeing
the safe operation of the nation's highways,'' Wolf said, while the
Federal Highway Administration has a broader mission that includes
construction of interstate roadways.
</P>
<P>
   Among the witnesses at Wolf's hearing was Bonnie Pierce, an Elm
City, N.C., mother who told how her son Terry, a high school
wrestler, and his teammate were killed in a head-on crash with a
fatigued truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was the tired trucker who killed my son still on the road
after 16 hours?'' she asked. ``The answer is simple. The federal
Office of Motor Carriers is incapable of enforcing safety
regulations and the Federal Highway Administration is incapable of
implementing new, more effective regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The trucking industry and safety advocates agree that it's time
to change the 65-year-old driving limits _ which generally require
eight hours off the road after 10 hours behind the wheel _ to force
drivers to get more rest. The Federal Highway Administration is
developing a proposal for new hours-of-service regulations.
</P>
<P>
   There could be disagreement between the truckers and consumer
groups, however, on what the hours should be.
</P>
<P>
   Walter McCormick, president of the American Trucking
Associations, which represents the major carriers, also agrees with
the safety activists that there should be more inspections of
commercial trucks and tougher penalties on carriers who put unsafe
big rigs on the roads. McCormick has proposed doubling the current
$100 million in federal funding for roadside inspections.
</P>
<P>
   However, Todd Spencer, vice president of the Owner-Operator
Independent Drivers Association, believes that pushing for more
inspections is ``a very narrow focus'' in seeking improved truck
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often trucks are inspected has little to do with how well
a driver is trained or with the economic coercion imposed upon
drivers to make impossible deadlines,'' Spencer testified recently
in a congressional hearing on truck safety.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to requiring truckers to pass the tests needed to
obtain a federal Commercial Drivers License, he said training and
an on-the-road apprenticeship should be required. He said the
independent truckers he represents also need regulations protecting
them from shippers who effectively force them to break safety laws
to meet their delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers who refuse are blackballed by the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry critics want several other reforms:
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring commercial trucks to have on-board satellite
tracking systems that record their speed and position, making it
impossible for drivers to fake their log-book entries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mandating on-board ``black boxes'' like those in airlines that
would determine causes of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring trucks to have engine governors that limit their
speed.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers and some safety advocates agree that states should
opening more roadside rest stops and lengthen stay limits so
drivers will have places to pull over and sleep. Many states now
limit truckers to two hours in a rest stop.

   TIPS FOR DRIVING SAFELY AROUND LARGE TRUCKS
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember trucks are heavier and take longer to safely respond
and come to a complete stop.
</P>
<P>
   _ If a truck is signaling its intention to change lanes, allow
it space to do so. Often, it's trying to avoid another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leave a safety cushion between you and the vehicle in front of
you. A good tip is to find a stationary object on the side of the
road and count 4 seconds as a cushion for a truck.
</P>
<P>
   _ At intersections, stay behind the wide white lines so trucks
can safely complete their turns.

 MYTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND HAMPERS TAX RELIEf  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Tax-cut proponents seeking a more politically appealing
way to ease the working-class tax burden have begun to focus more
on reducing Social Security taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This tactic is seen as having more potential for success because
it avoids objections that across-the-board reductions in marginal
tax rates help the well-off but provide no comfort to low-income
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a bogus economic argument, because the more income
workers receive, the more taxes they would normally have to pay.
Although it seems logical for tax relief to be proportional to tax
burdens, the phony claim that it's not fair invariably plays well
politically.
</P>
<P>
   What's inexplicable, however, is how those eager to play the
unfairness card when it comes to income-tax relief at the margin
never champion reducing Social Security taxes, which fall most
heavily on those at the bottom of the income ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Since Social Security stakes its claim on the very first dollar
of a worker's income, this is the only form of income taxation
relevant to those with modest incomes. About 75 percent of all
workers pay more in Social Security taxes than they do in income
taxes, and the comparable number is almost 100 percent for those
making $20,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these lowest-paid workers, incidentally, contribute a
significant portion of their meager wages to the income stream of
many affluent retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Given this socioeconomic inequity, it should make people of
conscience wonder why there isn't more support for reducing Social
Security taxes. This is especially so considering Social Security
enjoyed surplus revenues of about $100 billion last year. It's not
as if Social Security can't afford meaningful tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   What makes reducing Social Security taxes politically difficult
is the myth of the trust fund. After Uncle Sam spends surplus
Social Security revenues, the so-called trust fund is credited with
a claim against the Treasury to be redeemed as needed.
</P>
<P>
   When excessive Social Security taxes are criticized as unfair to
low-income workers, opponents of relief say the extra money is
needed to build up the trust fund for future beneficiaries. This is
an artful dodge, though. Assuming benefit cuts would be politically
impossible and tax increases politically difficult, future claims
will be handled the same way whether the trust fund exists or not.
</P>
<P>
   When surplus revenues are spent by Uncle Sam and the trust fund
gets a credit in return, as is currently done, how do you suppose
the money will be raised to honor this claim when it's needed to
cover revenue shortfalls? If there happened to be a budget surplus,
it could be used to make up the difference. If not, Treasury would
have to borrow the money.
</P>
<P>
   Say, however, Social Security tax cuts transformed the system
into a pay-as you-go operation. What would be necessary if no trust
fund existed when revenues fell short of what was needed to pay
benefits? The same exact thing. The difference would have to be
covered either by budget surpluses or Treasury borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   When the system is viewed in the context of economic reality, it
becomes much easier to justify Social Security tax relief because
the trust fund is exposed for the mythical slush fund it is.

 &HT;    A TRUCKER'S LIFE: DOWN THE ROAD WITH HAL T. BURKS
 &HT;    Repeating a story first moved Tuesday, Feb. 23 in (a) national
and (l) lifestyle categories for release Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD _ Daylight was fading over the tranquil Mississippi
pastures as Hal T. Burks steered his 18-wheeler down Highway 78
toward Tupelo and reflected on the two great loves of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pretty wife's name was Demetra,'' he said. ``One time early
in our marriage, I had just gotten home from two weeks on the road
when the doorbell rang and she got a delivery of roses. There was a
card that said 'To Demetra With Love,' but no signature.''
</P>
<P>
   After some chit-chat about other matters, his wife asked flat
out if he wasn't curious about who sent the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'No. Should I be?' Well, she thought I ought to,''
Burks recalled. ``She had sent them to herself to make me jealous.
We laughed about those roses for years. That was the only time she
ever tried to get me to quit driving. She knew how much I loved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal T. and Demetra had been married for 24 years and had reared
three children to adulthood before she died in 1997 of
complications from a liver disease. ``I'd been planning to retire
when I was 55 to be with her,'' said the 51-year-old long-haul
driver. ``Now I'll just keep on trucking.''
</P>
<P>
   Many motorists _ ``four-wheelers'' in the lingo of citizens'
band radio _ wonder about the nation's 3.75 million commercial
truck drivers like Burks. Romanticized in songs like ``Six Days on
the Road'' and ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses,'' they are
often portrayed as cowboys of the interstates. But safety activists
sometimes depict them as tattooed death on wheels _ fatigued or
drugged-out renegades riding 80,000 pounds of speeding jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For a reporter riding with Burks through five Southern states,
though, the stereotypes vaporize like the exhaust from his white
Freightliner. He drinks more bottled water than coffee, for
instance, and listens to books on tape as much as to country music
radio and CB gab. As for recreation on the road, ``give me more
than a 12-hour break and I'll find a golf course,'' Burks said.
</P>
<P>
   From his M.S. Carriers headquarters in Memphis to truck stops
across America, folks call him ``Hal T.'' His truck has his name on
the door, 10 forward gears, a 430-horsepower engine and a roomy cab
with a refrigerator and bunk beds. It gets about six miles to the
gallon of diesel fuel. There's also a company-installed engine
governor that restricts his speed to a maximum 65 miles per hour
and a Qualcom satellite hookup that lets his dispatcher track him _
within 20 feet _ anywhere on the continent. The system permits
instantaneous two-way communications through a computer on his
dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Burks is hardly a typical trucker. Over the past two decades or
so, he has driven 2.8 million miles _ that's nearly six trips to
the moon and back _ without having an accident. In 1997, the
American Trucking Association, which represents most of the major
carriers, selected him as an America's Road Team Captain. These
dozen drivers are picked because of their performance test scores,
safety record and flair for public relations. They represent the
trucking industry for 18 months, and then a new team is chosen.
</P>
<P>

   Driving east on I-20 through the Alabama night, Hal T. Burks
shifted gears and spun his stories.
</P>
<P>
   The ``T.'' stands for Travis. He was one of 14 children born in
a farm family outside Memphis. ``I never heard my parents argue,''
he marveled. Whenever there were differences, ``they'd go park by a
cornfield and have what Mama called 'loud reasoning'.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his schoolmates was the sister of singer Jerry Lee Lewis,
and he regularly visited the Killer's Memphis home during his
boyhood. Burks dropped out of high school in the 12th grade. ``My
downfall was my '59 Ford convertible _ black with red trim
interior,'' he recalled. ``I couldn't stand to sit in class and see
that car sitting in the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after leaving school, though, he was driving an olive
green ``deuce-and-a-half'' _ a 2.5 ton military truck. He earned a
high school equivalency diploma in the Army and served a tour in
Vietnam. After his discharge, he was working at a Jackson, Tenn.,
truck stop owned by his sister and brother-in-law when he was
struck by a yearning to drive a big truck down the road. Since
then, he has hauled cargo through 48 states _ all but Alaska and
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like driving any time,'' he declared. ``And it's great to
wake up in a different place every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight when he backed his trailer up to a
loading dock at a warehouse in Duluth, Ga., filled out his log
book, and settled into the lower bunk to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Federal transportation law lets truckers drive for 10 straight
hours, but then forces them to take an eight-hour break before
starting again. Practically every minute is chronicled in the log
book, and the Qualcom system provides computerized documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Paychecks are determined by mileage. Long-distance drivers who
operate company trucks usually earn between 28 and 35 cents per
mile. Drivers who use their own rigs to haul company cargoes earn
more per mile, but also must pay for gas and upkeep of their
trucks. The average truck driver makes $35,000 a year, according to
the American Trucking Association.
</P>
<P>
   To keep their expenses down and maximize their mileage, drivers
usually sleep their eight hours in their truck cabs rather than in
motels. They park in truck-stop lots or roadside rest stops or, if
possible, at the destination of their cargo. Drivers typically stay
on the road for two-week stretches, finding out where to pick up
and deliver the next load only after dropping off the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   Around 8 a.m., Burks notified his dispatcher that the Duluth
cargo, huge spools of wire, had been unloaded. Shortly afterward, a
message popped up on the computer screen to pick up a loaded
trailer at the M.S. Carriers depot in Atlanta and drive it to
Orlando. After hash browns, eggs and sausage at a Waffle House, he
drove to the depot, where the empty trailer was replaced with a
full one. The Freightliner was soon headed south on I-75.
</P>
<P>
   Passing miles of piney woods and palmettos, Burks allowed that
the road can get lonely. For years, he called his wife and kids
every day that he was away.
</P>
<P>
   Separations from family ``are the main reasons that a lot of
drivers quit,'' he said. ``You can't sit home and make money in the
trucking business. It takes a good woman to put up with a trucker.
She has got to be it all _ plumber, carpenter, sometimes mama and
daddy. Most of them can't handle all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are increasingly more women behind the wheel,
more than 90 percent of long-distance drivers are male.
</P>
<P>
   Burks looks back fondly on an 18-month period when he drove his
own rig. ``I took my pretty wife with me on the road,'' he
recalled. ``We had a great time. But I didn't like spending my days
off working on my truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Now M.S. Carriers provides him with a new truck every couple of
years and maintains the vehicles. A new Freightliner costs $80,000
to $100,000, and the Memphis-based carrier has about 2,500 on the
road. A trailer costs another $20,000 or so. In addition to its own
rigs, M.S. Carriers contracts with 700 to 800 owner-operators.
There are a few bigger carriers, but not many.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking business is booming. The industry employs about 9
million people _ including 3 million drivers _ and there is a
national shortage of 80,000 drivers, according to the American
Trucking Association. About 82 percent of the nation's freight
revenue goes to trucking firms, and the business has grown by 20
percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Burks faced an hourlong wait for a shower at the TA Truckstop
near the intersection of I-75 and the Florida Turnpike near
Wildwood, but wait he would. A day and a half had passed since he
had left his home in Humboldt, Tenn., and driven to company
headquarters in Memphis to begin this two-week run. It was time to
clean up and change clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The shower was free with a $50 fuel purchase or $6 without.
Truckers got a clean blue towel and matching washcloth and a key to
a private tiled bathroom with shower stall, lavatory and toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a wait in the evening'' as truckers fill the
parking lots for the night, explained Burks. ``The best time to get
a shower at a truck stop is early in the mornings.''
</P>
<P>
   But this day's drive has not yet ended. After the shower and a
supper of liver and onions, he was back behind the wheel _ heading
east on the Turnpike to Orlando. Time spent at truck stops doesn't
count against the 10-hour driving limit.
</P>
<P>
   Burks' CB handle is ``Double Trouble,'' but he listens more than
talks in the conversations that crackle over the airwaves. One
night, though, he talked to the driver of Dolly Parton's tour bus.
``He told me to look at his back window when he passed,'' Burks
said. ``There was ol' Dolly waving at me. Sometimes you'll see
country music singers and their crews eating in truck stops in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the food and sassy waitresses that pull truckers _
and bands' tour buses _ to truck stops, but also the huge parking
lots and 24-hour services. It's hard to pull a big rig up to a
McDonald's drive-in window.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Orlando are nearly deserted as the Freightliner
arrives around 11 p.m. Burks follows the directions on his Qualcom
computer screen to find his destination warehouse. He backs up to a
loading dock, enters the time in his log book, and is quickly
asleep in the bunk. He is awakened at 6 a.m. by a banging on the
cab door. A warehouse supervisor told him to move to another bay to
be unloaded immediately. Wiping the sleep from his eyes, he
complied.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor pointed to a room with coffee and an adjoining
bathroom where drivers can wash their faces and brush their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Before 8 a.m., the trailer was empty and Burks sent the news to
his dispatcher. Minutes later came orders to pick up a load about
50 miles away and drive it to Greensboro, N.C. Often, Burks does
not know what he is hauling. A load is a load. And a driver can't
make money in a parked truck. Breakfast will come somewhere down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Hal T. Burks was rolling again.

<P>
   Hal T. Burks eased his big Freightliner to the left lane of I-75
as a shiny red Ford pickup came barreling down an on-ramp near the
Georgia-Florida line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the law obligates trucks to move over and let them
on,'' complained Burks, who drives an 18-wheeler for M.S. Carriers.
``But sometimes I can't because there's traffic in the lane beside
me. Then a lot of times the four-wheeler will squeeze in right in
front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a recipe for tragedy. According to a Cox Newspapers
computer analysis of federal highway safety records, the most
common fatal accident involving a large truck and a car comes when
the car pulls in front of the truck and the larger vehicle can't
slow down in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we have 18 wheels with tread doesn't mean we can
stop on a dime,'' explained Burks.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths in car-truck crashes _ overwhelmingly of car drivers _
are on the rise, and the trucking industry's safety record is under
congressional scrutiny. But the Cox analysis found that police
investigators are three times more likely to cite car drivers for
driving errors that contributed to an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers suggest that the biggest opportunity to save lives
may be teaching car drivers how to stay safe around trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Cox examined 1997 data from the federal government's Fatal
Accident Reporting System (FARS) showing that in fatal crashes
involving cars and large trucks, the investigating police at the
accident scene cited the car drivers 2,381 times for deficiencies
such as ``failure to keep in proper lane,'' ``drowsiness'' or
``reckless driving.'' They cited truck drivers 679 times.
</P>
<P>
   In fatal crashes where drinking was a factor, the FARS data
show, 15 percent of the car drivers had an alcohol blood content
over the most common legal limit of .10 percent. By comparison,
fewer than 1 percent of the truck drivers had that much alcohol in
their systems.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the same FARS data, the General Accounting
Office (GAO), the investigating arm of Congress, reached a similar
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Errors by car drivers were reported in 80 percent of the
crashes, while errors by truck drivers were reported in 28 percent
of the crashes,'' said Phyllis Scheinberg, the GAO's associate
director for transportation issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gordy Wright, a spokesman for Georgia State Patrol, said
statistics from his state tell the same story. Of 121 fatal wrecks
involving large trucks in Georgia in 1997, the car driver was cited
nearly two-thirds of the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox analysis found that the most common fatal crash scenario
came when both truck and car were driving in the same direction
during daylight in good weather, and the truck hit the car either
at an angle or from the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anecdotally, that is what I would have said about the
situation even without the computer study,'' said Major Ken Howes,
a spokesman for Florida State Patrol. ``I've been on the highway
patrol for over 20 years, and the vast majority of truck drivers
I've come into contact with are professional, very careful drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're driving an 80,000-pound rig down an interstate
highway and a car abruptly changes lanes in front of you and then
hits the brakes, you can't stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
cautions that the contributing driver factors cited by
investigating police ``can only be suggestive about why truck
crashes occur'' and ``cannot be used to determine causation or
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The factors ``are based on the officer's judgment at the scene
of the accident _ his observations and discussions with
witnesses,'' said Dave Longo, a spokesman for the federal Office of
Motor Carriers (OMC). ``They are not an absolute causation
determination, because they are not made with the benefit of a more
thorough investigation and accident reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Highway safety advocates disparage the data in stronger terms.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are ``a bunch of malarkey,'' said Joan Claybrook,
director of CRASH, or Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways.
``It's become a canard _ heavily promoted by the trucking industry
_ that car drivers are responsible for most of these (fatal)
crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The car drivers are usually killed, and when police arrive to
investigate, ``the only one talking is the truck driver,'' said
Claybrook. So the account of the accident is likely to be biased,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the same pattern of driver factors was found in a study
of crashes where both the truck driver and car driver survived, the
GAO's Scheinberg testified at a House hearing on truck safety last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car driver errors were cited in 74 percent of the crashes,
compared to 35 percent for truck driver errors,'' she noted in
written testimony. ``This finding lends some support to the
hypothesis that, compared to truck drivers, car drivers contribute
more to fatal crashes between large trucks and cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Donaldson, senior research director for Advocates for
Highway and Auto Safety, argues that data from fatal crashes is not
comparable to data from non-fatal crashes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute on one statistic: Regardless of who caused
the accident, occupants of a car, van or sports utility vehicle are
much more likely to be killed in a crash with a big rig than is the
truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox analysis showed that of the 5,355 people who died in
crashes involving a large truck in 1997, about 87 percent were
occupants of the passenger vehicles. The death toll, up 213 from
the previous year, marks a continuing slow increase.
</P>
<P>
   After the toll reached 5,679 in 1988, it fell to 4,462 in 1992,
only to begin climbing again as traffic increased.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, car drivers were four times more likely to die in these
crashes than were the truck drivers _ 2,613 car drivers compared to
646 truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in deaths has spurred demands from highway safety
advocates for more federal inspections and regulation of trucking.
Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., has charged that the agency responsible for
enforcing truck safety _ the Office of Motor Carriers _ has not
done its job and should be moved from the Department of
Transportation to the independent NHTSA.
</P>
<P>
   But Donaldson also agreed that the danger to car passengers in
truck accidents needs to be hammered home by the trucking industry
and government licensing agencies. A public education campaign
should be waged to inform car drivers ``that their chances of
survival are extremely remote'' in a crash with a big rig, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burks agreed that if the drivers of ``four-wheelers'' realized
how likely they are to be killed or injured if hit by a truck, they
wouldn't try to squeeze in front of a big rig trying to maintain a
safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to continue to educate drivers on sharing the road,''
said Walter McCormick, president of the American Trucking
Associations (ATA), the group that represents many of the major
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The ATA and the U.S. Department of Transportation have begun a
``No Zone'' campaign to publicize the areas surrounding a moving
truck where motorists are in danger. The safety advocates say the
effort is ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Driving down I-75, Burks pointed to the mirrors outside his cab
windows and protruding from both sides of his hood. ``If the
mirrors are properly adjusted,'' he said, ``the only truly blind
spot on a truck is directly in the rear.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even a window in the bottom of the passenger door on
his truck so he can see cars directly on his right.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking industry contends that it is being unfairly
maligned in the safety debate.
</P>
<P>
   As the total truck mileage on the nation's highways has risen 77
percent since 1980, the fatal crash rate per 100 million miles
traveled has been cut in half, McCormick told Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than moving the Office of Motor Carriers, McCormick
testified, the trucking industry would support setting up a
separate federal agency to oversee its operations, with a
relationship like the Federal Aviation Administration has with
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   From the cab of his Freightliner, Burks dismisses the debate as
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Having driven 2.8 million miles without an accident, the
51-year-old driver takes safety seriously. Burks is a 1997
America's Road Team Captain _ selected by the trucking industry as
one of its safest drivers. He insists that both the government and
the industry have taken steps to ensure that commercial truckers
are safer than the average motorist on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Burks points out that truck drivers are required to earn a
federal Commercial Driver's License with more rigorous requirements
than the licenses held by most motorists. Federal law also requires
truck drivers to stop and rest for at least eight hours after
driving for 10 hours, and to record their periods of driving and
rest in a log book.
</P>
<P>
   Burks' employer, M.S. Carriers of Memphis, Tenn., is one of the
largest companies in the business. Like many of its peers, the
company invests heavily in safety equipment and training.
</P>
<P>
   On the dashboard of Burks' Freightliner is a computer connected
to a satellite positioning system that allows his dispatcher to
track him anywhere on the continent. This Qualcom system provides a
wealth of information _ the truck's speed, fuel consumption, idling
time, and rest periods. This data eliminates the possibility of a
driver cheating on the written log book.
</P>
<P>
   A Qualcom spokesman said about 230,000 long-distance, irregular
run drivers like Burks have satellite tracking systems tying their
trucks to dispatchers in the United States. Similar communications
systems such as cellular are also increasing in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The system ``can even show when a driver might be tailgating''
because it records how many times and how hard he hits the brakes,
said Burks.
</P>
<P>
   The 430-horsepower engine of Burks' truck also has a governor
that limits his speed to a maximum 65 mph.
</P>
<P>
   When he is not on the road, Burks is an instructor at the M.S.
Carriers driving and safety academy in Memphis. New drivers undergo
four weeks of schooling before going out on the road with a veteran
driver as a trainee.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of driving without an accident, M.S. Carriers
gives its drivers a ring with a blue stone in the middle. For the
next four years without an accident, a small diamond is added in
each corner. After 10 years, a big diamond goes in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appraises at about $3,500,'' said Burks, showing the ring
to a rider.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks to high school drivers education classes and other
groups to convey the trucker's viewpoint on to regular motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to share the highway,'' he explains.

COMMENTARY: AT FIREHOUSES, SOUNDING ALARM OVER DOWNSIZING

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Joseph Bellina is the business
administrator of Hamilton Township, and on the subject of reforming
the local volunteer fire department system, he says this: ``Nobody
wants to upset the volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to mess with the 380 or so men who can be counted
on to get out of bed at 3 a.m. or walk out of church or skip dinner
when their pagers go off.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers save towns millions by reducing the need for paid
firefighters, and while most towns are struggling to keep enough
volunteers active, Hamilton is a genial throwback, a neighborly
sprawl of aging Trenton suburbs and new subdivisions that still
produce enough volunteers to answer the call.
</P>
<P>
   But as Henry Ryan or Ferdinand Mather Jr. or Dave Sabo will tell
you, that loyalty is not necessarily to the township but to their
individual fire companies, and to the territories they serve.
Hamilton has eight fire districts, each with its own history,
firehouse, tax rates and board of commissioners, and eight is at
least two too many, according to a management study conducted for
the town last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The report's principal recommendations to improve service and
save money: Close two firehouses, get rid of the district
commissioners and consolidate the system.
</P>
<P>
   Don't upset the volunteers?
</P>
<P>
   ``When that thing came out, it just broke our hearts,'' said
Mather, the chief at DeCou Hose Company, which was founded in 1914
and is one of the companies that the study suggested closing.
``There is a history of generations of volunteer firemen in this
place, fathers and sons and grandfathers coming through here. These
guys aren't going to just move to another fire company in the
township if they closed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Beer has not been served in the bars of the Hamilton firehouses
in decades, and instead of poker games, the men (there are
currently no female firefighters) are now more likely to be working
out in the weight room or playing video games. Hanging out at the
firehouse has given way to second jobs or soccer games or watching
the children while the wife is at work.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteering itself, in fact, has become a career path for many
young men, a way of getting on the list for a job on a municipal
police force or as a paid firefighter in Hamilton or other towns.
</P>
<P>
   But spend time with the Hamilton volunteers and the stories come
out, stories about roots in the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got married, I told my wife our first priority was to
find a house in this fire district, and the closer to the station
the better,'' said Ryan, a state tax division supervisor who joined
the Mercerville fire company 29 years ago and is now one of the
Mercerville district's five commissioners. The house the Ryans
chose on Stevens Street had Mercerville volunteers on either side,
and one of them, Sam Layton, is godfather to their son Jason.
</P>
<P>
   So the thousands of newcomers in Hamilton may be only dimly
aware of the guys washing their fire engines on summer weekends or
tearing along in their cars, blue lights flashing, on their way to
the firehouse when their beepers go off. Most homeowners go for a
lifetime without calling for a fire engine, and may only think of
the volunteers when they run their annual fund drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a lot of people we're just yahoos _ you know, `foundation
savers' or `blue-lighters,''' said Sabo, the volunteer chief at the
Rusling firehouse. ``But for the guys who do it, this is something
their fathers did and their grandfathers, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellina, the business administrator, said the township had not
yet decided whether to adopt the recommendations in the study. He
said town officials planned to meet with the volunteers to discuss
the matter. In the meantime, however, many of the firefighters are
talking as if the consolidation were a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Mather, for one, insisted that his men would volunteer in
Bordentown, the next town south of here, if their firehouse was
closed. Others think that consolidation would bring a mix of
responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have a segment that will walk away and say, `This isn't
the way it used to be,' and you'll have some who will stay as a
career move and hope that there might be a job opening in
consolidation,'' Ryan said. ``And you'll have the old geezers like
me who will stick around just because this is what we do. This is
what we do.''

HEAD UTILICORP, ST. JOSEPH LIGHT &AMP; POWER AGREE TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ UtiliCorp United Inc., in a move that
reflects the consolidation transforming the utility business, has
agreed to buy St. Joseph Light &AMP; Power Co.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is valued at $270 million and is expected to be
completed in 2000. It will give UtiliCorp 61,000 electric customers
and 6,000 natural gas customers in 10 counties in northwest
Missouri, next to territory served by Missouri Public Service Co.,
another UtiliCorp unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good fit,'' said Richard C. Green Jr., UtiliCorp's
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph Light shareholders will receive $191 million in
UtiliCorp stock, or $23 for each share of St. Joseph Light stock.
That's a 36 percent premium over the St. Joseph utility's closing
stock price Thursday. UtiliCorp has also agreed to assume about $80
million of the utility's debt.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph Light has 350 employees, and the merger will cause
cutbacks. UtiliCorp said it would try to offer affected employees
jobs at other UtiliCorp operations. St. Joseph Light will also
offer a severance package.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph Light, which has some of the lowest rates in the
state, sought to reassure its customers Friday that it would still
be treated as a separate entity by regulators setting rates.
</P>
<P>
   The utility will keep its name but become a unit of UtiliCorp,
which is based in Kansas City. An office will be kept in St.
Joseph, and UtiliCorp has agreed to continue St. Joseph Light's
current charitable contributions for five years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an advisory board will be kept in St. Joseph for
three years that will make suggestions to UtiliCorp, said Terry
Steinbecker, president and chief executive officer of St. Joseph
Light.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agreement is a culmination of work begun by the
utility's board in 1992 to consider the effects of deregulation as
it unfolds. An inescapable conclusion was that St. Joseph Light had
to be part of a bigger company and the larger resources it could
deploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders and
customers,'' Steinbecker said.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit is the premium that shareholders will get on their
stock, he said. Also, customers will have more assurances of a
reliable energy supply and more services, and employees should have
more opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   UtiliCorp has 5,500 employees serving 3 million customers in
eight states and Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United
Kingdom. Its 1998 revenues were $12.6 billion, compared with St.
Joseph's revenue of $124 million in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some residents couldn't escape the sense that an
era was passing, because St. Joseph Light traces its roots to 1883.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad to see this consolidation, but it's a sign of the
times,'' said Barry Yantis, president of Chase Candy Co. in St.
Joseph, which makes the Cherry Mash candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale electricity markets are now deregulated, so prices are
allowed to float. Retail rates to a utility's customers, however,
are still regulated, and no date has been set in Missouri to change
that.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, utilities will lose their monopoly status and
be allowed to poach on each other's territories. That will make
size an important factor in competition, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger strengthens our competitive positions in our home
state and in the Midwest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agreement to buy St. Joseph Light didn't preclude
other acquisitions in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The deal must still be approved by St. Joseph Light shareholders
and state and federal regulators. Kevin Kelly, a spokesman for the
Missouri Public Service Commission in Jefferson City, said a
timetable to consider the merger would be set once the application
was submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Hogerty, Missouri's public counsel, said it was too early
to comment on the St. Joseph Light deal. But it's part of an ironic
trend, she said, that the prospect of deregulation is reducing the
number of companies to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behemoths just get bigger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the financial side, Robin Diedrich, an analyst with Edward
Jones, said the deal was relatively small but St. Joseph Light was
well-managed, and the proximity to other UtiliCorp operations made
it a good acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense,'' she said.

MUSEUM DISPLAYS CITY'S HISTORIC SIDE AS WELL AS ITS ECCENTRIC
SIDE

<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. _ It takes rare alchemy to transform a 10-cup
coffee brewer into a crowd-pleasing attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what the Patee House Museum here accomplished
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen it on television. You've read about it. Here it is
in person!'' announced a large sign beside a routine-looking Mr.
Coffee machine.
</P>
<P>
   The display was no flea-circus hoax. Like everything in the
Patee House, a vast, enchanting and truly goofy museum, it had a
legitimate story behind it _ albeit a strange one.
</P>
<P>
   The pot was the infamous carafe into which an employee at the
nearby Wire Rope Corp. had angrily relieved himself in full view of
a hidden video camera. That peculiar act, aimed, so to speak, at a
fellow employee, soon was reported by newspapers and TV broadcasts
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we got the pot,'' said Patee Director Gary Chilcote, 64, a
retired newspaper reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to capture the flavor of St. Joe,'' he added.
``We caught a lot of flak for that display, but our goal is to get
people to appreciate history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've got to entertain them, or they won't come. And
because we're a private institution, we can do things a bit
tongue-in-cheek. People enjoyed that pot exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, though, the coffee consumption at our board
meetings fell off dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patee House Museum occupies a huge 1858 building first
constructed as a hotel. It is one block square, four stories high,
in the west-central section of this city (population 75,000).
</P>
<P>
   Its displays are so eclectic that a local TV news producer once
said a visit there was like walking through his grandmother's
attic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being in a giant history book,'' said Chilcote.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Patee House, you drink sarsaparilla in the re-created
Buffalo Saloon as you listen to ragtime piano.
</P>
<P>
   You stroll down a painstakingly rebuilt 19th-century St. Joseph
street and visit the original Pony Express office along with
numerous other shops and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   You drop by the dental office run by the father and grandfather
of newsman Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``city jail,'' you view a collection of murder weapons.
Many of them are hammers, including the claw model favored by the
1937 killer of one Arthur Ferguson, and the ball-peen variety that
killed a woman in 1939. (``He loved her but was angry,'' reads the
display sign below its broken handle.)
</P>
<P>
   As you wander onward through a seemingly endless maze of
wonders, you'll encounter a 1,050-pound ball of twine and a fully
restored train depot complete with a Hannibal &AMP; St. Joseph Railroad
locomotive.
</P>
<P>
   You stroll by antique fire engines, a goat-powered treadmill and
a unique collection of brass ``bawdyhouse tokens'' once purchased
in the lobbies of certain downtown establishments and then
exchanged upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   You also see airplanes, spittoons, a 1920s service station,
vaudeville posters and a photographic display of the famous ``Horn
Furniture of Herman Metz.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine example of rare horn furniture, in this case a settee
made entirely of bull's horns, can be found in the beautifully
re-created hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
   It is, perhaps, a pointed commentary on the final career of the
hotel's founder.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel was built by John Patee, a druggist, teacher and land
speculator who was among the early boosters of St. Joseph's
short-lived role as gateway to the West.
</P>
<P>
   He built well but not wisely. His timing was off.
</P>
<P>
   When the Civil War interrupted St. Joseph's boom years, Patee
compounded his business error by siding with the South.
</P>
<P>
   In 1865, faced with ruin, Patee came up with a remarkable idea
he called the Grand Benevolent Raffle.
</P>
<P>
   He printed some 150,000 raffle tickets ($2 each) and conducted a
nationwide lottery in which the stakes were his hotel, valued at
$140,000, and two acres of St. Joseph property.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the drawing, 100 unsold tickets were dramatically
returned by an agent in Quincy, Ill. Patee generously bought the
lot ``to allow the drawing to continue on schedule,'' although why
that purchase was necessary was never explained.
</P>
<P>
   When the winning number was announced, it turned out to be one
of the tickets Patee held. Amazingly, he had won back his own hotel
and pocketed more than $200,000 in lottery proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reputation was so good that no one questioned his
honesty,'' Chilcote said. ``At least not at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Patee died in 1868, St. Joseph's richest man. But among the
people of the city, he was known thereafter as Lucky John, a phrase
that has about it a certain ironic ring.
</P>
<P>
   And, curiously, according to Chilcote's research, just one year
after the raffle, the man who had returned the 100 unsold tickets
married Patee's niece.
</P>
<P>
   After Patee's demise, his hotel went through a series of
incarnations: a women's college, a hotel again, a shirt factory
and, finally, a World War II defense plant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 it was condemned by the city but rescued at the last
moment by a committee of eight who dubbed themselves the Pony
Express Historical Association. The hotel had been the headquarters
of the Pony Express in 1860 and is a registered National Landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Chilcote was among the eight.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the museum's collection, almost entirely donated,
has grown so large that two floors of the building are now filled
with well-mounted exhibits and open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The top two stories, though, are like something out of the movie
``Citizen Kane'' _ a colossal warehouse containing tens of
thousands of artifacts from St. Joseph's colorful past.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of movie and TV people come to us,'' said Chilcote.
``And we can supply anything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, he added tongue-in-cheek, includes a slightly used
coffee pot stored in a third-floor room with other former display
items.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the pot, on a long and cluttered table, there is an 1886
photograph of a well-dressed St. Joseph gentleman sitting in a
buggy.
</P>
<P>
   The buggy reins, however, are not attached to a horse. They are
linked to a bird: The one-and-only, world-famous Celebrated
Trotting Ostrich.
</P>
<P>
   Chilcote glanced at the old photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll use it sooner or later,'' he said.

A DARK SIDE OF EXPANSION: HOUSING COSTS RISE RAPIDLY
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: See also WVA-WELFARE-NYT.)  
 (fb) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A strong national economy that is rewarding many
Americans through steady employment, low interest rates and rising
stock prices is hurting millions of the nation's poorest people by
delaying their access to affordable housing, a new report by the
federal government says.
</P>
<P>
   Research collected by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development found that as the economy has expanded, poor people
have been waiting longer for public housing units, rental costs
have been increasing and the number of affordable units has been
falling as landlords seeking greater profits get out of the public
housing business.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, as many as 25 percent more families are on
waiting lists for affordable apartments than there were last year,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rising economic tide is raising many boats, but it is also
drowning some,'' said Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, reflecting
a report the department plans to release this week. ``As an
unintended consequence of this amazingly strong economy, there is
less affordable housing stock and the prices are beyond the reach
of those at the bottom of the income spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Those conclusions are generally shared by advocates for the poor
who have campaigned for years for more affordable housing. Maria
Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on
Homelessness and Poverty, said the findings of the report reflected
``the convergence of many different trends in the private markets
and public policy that are squeezing poor people the most.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paradox of booming times,'' Foscarinis said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to citing economic conditions for the housing
problems, the report, ``Waiting in Vain: An Update on America's
Housing Crisis,'' strikes a familiar note in blaming the
Republican-led Congress. Echoing one of Cuomo's frequent complaints
since he succeeded Henry Cisneros as secretary in 1995, it points
to a decision that year to stop increasing the amount of money to
expand rental subsidy programs after money had been appropriated
for an additional 230,000 households each year from 1978 to 1984
and for 126,000 households from 1985 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Cassidy, a spokesman for Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman
of the House housing subcommittee, said Lazio had not read the
report and could not comment on it until he did.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A House banking committee staff member who works on housing
issues and spoke on the condition of anonymity defended the
decision, saying that Congress stopped paying for new subsidies
because HUD could not account for money it already had.
</P>
<P>
   After the department put into effect plans to improve efficiency
and programs to weed out fraud and abuse in housing programs,
Congress passed new public housing legislation and agreed last year
to a request to authorize 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers, which
entitle the holder to a rent subsidy. The staff member said
lawmakers would authorize ``a reasonable number'' of new vouchers
in President Clinton's 2000 budget request.
</P>
<P>
   The new vouchers eased some of the growing demand for affordable
housing, but pressure has continued to build.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the most alarming finding is that the time poor
families spend waiting for housing assistance _ a public housing
unit or a Section 8 voucher _ has grown longer, especially in big
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the average wait for a public housing unit
increased to 11 months last year from 10 months in 1996 and the
average wait for a voucher had increased to 28 months last year
from 26 months in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that the wait for housing had increased to
eight years in New York, six years in Oakland and up to five years
in Oakland and Washington; the wait for a voucher had stretched to
10 years in Newark and Los Angeles, seven years in Houston and five
years in Chicago and Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said a comparison of 18 cities in the last year
showed a 34 percent increase, to 660,000 from 500,000, in the
number of families waiting for a voucher.
</P>
<P>
   Among the economic conditions that most strikingly show how the
booming economy has progressed at the expense of the poor,
according to the report, is housing costs.
</P>
<P>
   While home ownership has reached a record level of 66.3 percent,
largely because low interest rates have offset rising home prices,
the rise in rents, 6.2 percent from 1996 through 1998, surpassed
the rise in income for the 20 percent of households with the lowest
incomes, Bureau of Labor Statistics says.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not mention any potential impact on housing
costs from welfare changes that began in 1996. A study by the
General Accounting Office in December said it was too soon to
determine the effects of lost welfare benefits on housing for the
poor.

   GHENT, Belgium _ The early morning drizzle was cold, of course,
and promised to continue all day, of course. That's winter in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of bicycle racers prefer to avoid the place. They spent
last weekend in Spain, at the Tour of Valencia, where temperatures
were in the low 70s, or in Italy, at the Trophee Pantalica, where
temperatures were lower, but still not the 45 degrees recorded in
Ghent.
</P>
<P>
   This city in eastern Flanders staged the start of the 54th Het
Volk race on Feb. 27, the traditional opening of the season in
Belgium and, as always, it was a gathering of tough men. Of these,
the toughest _ no argument possible _ is Johan Museeuw.
</P>
<P>
   The king of the classics, Museeuw comes from Flanders and, as
always, was the center of attention for his fellow Belgians. Young
and old, male and female, they surrounded the parked Mapei team car
in which he sat in the front passenger's seat before the start.
Through a slightly opened window on the driver's side, small boys
passed a team official sheets of paper for Museeuw to autograph.
The mood was reverential.
</P>
<P>
   Museeuw crashed last April in the Paris-Roubaix race, falling in
the mud and cobblestones of the Arenberg woods and fracturing his
left kneecap. He was taken to a Belgian hospital, and the leg was
immobilized in plaster.
</P>
<P>
   But his wound had not been thoroughly cleaned, and under the
cast his knee became septic. His kidneys and liver nearly failed,
and even after doctors understood what was happening and corrected
it, they feared the leg might become gangrenous and have to come
off. Months of recuperation followed. Museeuw kept the leg.
</P>
<P>
   At age 32, after a decade as a professional, Museeuw had long
been talking about retiring. He seemed especially serious in 1996,
but then won the world road race championship and decided to carry
on.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, he had reduced his schedule by dropping the Tour de
France and concentrating on the 10 one-day classics that comprise
the World Cup. Museeuw has won a big classic nine times.
</P>
<P>
   He could not return to competition until September, when he
tested his atrophied leg in small races. He decided that much as he
would like to retire, he did not want to leave the sport that way.
He signed a two-year renewal with Mapei and spent the winter
training on his bicycle, swimming long laps and working out in a
gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've returned to see how far I can go,'' he has said. ``Now
that I've got my health back, I'd very much like to be at the front
of races again. At the front, as in winning.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first couple of races in Spain last month, he did fine on
the flats but struggled on climbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's natural,'' said his team manager and confidant, Patrick
Lefevere, before the start of the Het Volk, which is rated a
semiclassic. ``We're not expecting too much of him now. He's got a
lot of races ahead of him in the next month and a half, and after
Paris-Roubaix we'll evaluate his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's doing well, but this is his first real test,''
Lefevere said. ``He's very motivated, and very calm. It's amazing
that he's alive and amazing he still has his leg.''
</P>
<P>
   For a final amazement, Museeuw rode a strong Het Volk, 202
kilometers (126 miles) over 11 short but steep hills lined with
treacherous cobblestones. As one rider after another wearily
dropped back or out, Museeuw remained consistently near the front.
</P>
<P>
   With about 15 kilometers to go, he even went on the offensive,
speeding away from a group of nine leaders. He was quickly chased
down, and an attack then by Frank Vandenbroucke, a Belgian with the
Cofidis team, proved to be the winning move.
</P>
<P>
   Vandenbroucke easily won the race in a sprint finish with
Wilfried Peeters, another Belgian with Mapei. Thirty-four seconds
behind were six riders, with Museeuw in the middle of the group,
finishing an impressive sixth. Only 44 of 199 starters completed
the race.

A MAJOR THEATER IN HARTFORD ADDS A SMALL, NEW AUDITORIUM 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn.)  (fb) 
 By ROBERT A. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bushnell in downtown Hartford will break ground this spring
on an 88,000-square-foot, $30 million addition that will give the
69-year-old, 2,800-seat theater a 950-seat modern auditorium for
smaller productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is also about economic development and activity in
the downtown,'' said Douglas C. Evans, the Bushnell's executive
director. ``Phantom of the Opera,'' he said, brought 135,000 people
to the Bushnell's Great Hall from August to October 1995, a record,
and grossed $6.7 million. But the impact on the community, for
everything from apartments for the cast to meals for theatergoers,
was estimated at more than twice that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arts community has been slow to embrace that concept, that
philosophy, that arts is a driver of the economy,'' Evans said.
``When we first started discussing it, it was taboo. The economic
aspect was considered dirty. But one of my platforms since the day
I arrived has been that arts are good for the economy, good for the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   H. Scott Phelps, president of the Greater Hartford Convention
and Visitors Bureau, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're promoting Hartford as a convention destination,
you're not just selling the convention space,'' he said. ``People
want to get out and see and do things , and having something like
the Bushnell in the downtown is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold C. Greenberg, president of the Bushnell's board of
directors, said a fund-raising campaign had set a goal of $45
million, not only to cover the costs of construction but to
establish a larger endowment for the expanded theater. The campaign
is halfway to its goal, including a $1.25-million gift from a
trustee, Anthony D. Autorino, and a $4-million gift from Maxwell M.
Belding, a trustee emeritus, and his wife, Ruth R. Belding, of Old
Lyme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic climate now is much healthier than the early
1990s, and I think the vision now is much more compelling,''
Greenberg said. ``There's an appreciation of what this will do not
only for local arts and community groups, but to bolster the
economic revitalization of Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the next decade, the city expects a total of more than $1
billion in new construction downtown, including Adriaen's Landing,
the $374-million stadium for the New England Patriots; a convention
center; a community technical college and 1,000 units of housing,
according to figures from the state's Department of Economic and
Community Development.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell's new theater will rise on an employee parking lot east
of the existing hall.
</P>
<P>
   Glass walls at the front of the addition will enclose a
three-story Grand Stair Hall, featuring a curved stairway, as well
as a cafe, gift shop and concierge office on the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   The second floor will be for intermission space or cabaret-style
performances. A luxury suite will provide a setting for corporate
functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we're only increasing the capacity by about one-third,
we don't expect the net effect to be that great,'' said David A.
Dalena, the Bushnell spokesman. ``Obviously, we'll have to make
some changes operationally, such as staggered starting times for
the performances, but that is all part of the planning process.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to angling the addition away from the main hall, the
site slopes slightly down to the east, which further decreases the
impact of the new building on the old, said William D. Clegg Jr.,
an architect with Schoenhardt Associates in Simsbury, which is
working with Wilson Butler Lodge of Boston on the plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some thoughts about enclosing the old building's
east portico in glass, but it's an important part of the building
and we felt the best way to preserve it was to leave it open,''
Clegg said. ``It was tough, and it was tight, but it came
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clegg, who specializes in historic preservation, said that the
Bushnell was close to his heart. In the late 20's, his wife's
grandfather, Howard Christian Peter, assumed the duties of head
carpenter on the Bushnell construction on the death of his
father-in-law, Ludwig Miller. Clegg's mother-in-law, Verna Carlson
of Bristol, still has pictures of the construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a project for me, it's a part of my
heritage,'' Clegg said. ``When I found out we had the job, I called
my wife and told her to go buy a dozen roses and we went over to
tell her mother. As I gave her the flowers I said, `The heritage
continues.' I look forward to taking her to the first show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bushnell project, which has a $10 million grant from the
state and $2.5-million from the Federal Department of Housing and
Urban Development, is currently being reviewed by the Connecticut
Historical Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very significant structure,'' said Susan R. Chandler, a
staff historical architect with the commission. ``It's a cultural
landmark as well as a historical landmark. It's one of the most
important stand-alone historical resources in the downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has not completed her review, she noted that the
designers of the addition had taken an innovative approach, angling
it away from the main hall so the east face of the building, with
its blend of Georgian-style columns and Art Deco exterior, would
still be visible from the street.
</P>
<P>
   Since Evans arrived to head the Bushnell in 1990, it has
strengthened considerably. When he arrived, about 180,000 tickets
were being sold each year. This year, it expects to sell 400,000 to
500,000 tickets, thanks to some of the lavish Broadway productions
he has attracted to Hartford. Large Broadway shows currently take
up 25 percent of the theater's schedule, but account for 90 percent
of the revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth also meant a tightening of availability for shows
by the Bushnell's tenant organizations _ the Hartford Ballet,
Hartford Symphony Orchestra, Connecticut Opera Association, and
Chamber Music Plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of the second hall means there's more flexibility
in getting dates, and there are a number of ballet shows that we
would rather do in a more intimate setting, that sort of cry out
for a smaller hall,'' said Trevor A. Cushman, president of the
Hartford Ballet. ``So on both counts, we're looking forward to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a normal season the ballet might do four shows, two
full-length and two triple-bills, or repertory shows. The repertory
shows might sell 800 seats, or fewer, on a slow night, which means
almost one out of four seats in the Great Hall would be vacant _
not the message an arts organization wants to send.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hartford Symphony is always squeezed for time in the big
hall, and if our vacating some slots in the big hall gives them
more time to get in there, we're all for it,'' Cushman said. ``And
in Bushnell II, as we're calling it, there's going to be better
seats for our purposes. They're going to be closer to the stage, so
everyone is going to be better served.''

THE ONLY COMPLAINT ABOUT CELEBRATION IS THAT IT MAY BE TOO
PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   LYN RIDDLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CELEBRATION, Fla. _ Diane Kupchak was tired of South Florida. It
had grown too fast. She didn't know her neighbors. She wanted to
live somewhere like Rutherford, N.J., her hometown, which she
remembered as a place where neighbors were family.
</P>
<P>
   So when she heard of Celebration, a town built from scratch by
the Disney Co. and designed in a way to encourage a sense of
community, she suspected she had found what she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels right,'' she said recently, after having lived in the
community for a year.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 700 homes built here now and house prices
appreciating an average of 1 percent a month, residents and Disney
executives say the experiment has shown signs of success.
</P>
<P>
   On average, a house is sold here every other day, with an
average sales price of $377,300, by far Osceola County's price
leader. The average home price in the county that includes Orlando
and Disney World is $230,000, county figures show.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jason Canin, vice president of Charles Wayne
Consulting, which tracks home sales in the Orlando area, the dollar
value of sales at Celebration for January through September 1998,
the firm's most recent report, was 42 percent higher than sales at
any other central Florida development. The sales totaled $52.5
million, with an average price of $370,000, Canin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very active market there,'' said Linda Goodwin, who
has sold real estate in Osceola County for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has a resale market developed, and homeowners are
making money. One town house sold for $225,000 last September, 15
months after the original buyer paid $181,900 for it.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Goodwin said many of the resales are Celebration apartment
renters buying town houses and town-house owners buying bigger
homes. A few have left the community because of job transfers, Mrs.
Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Celebration's planners envisioned a community reminiscent of the
quaint villages that dot New England's landscape. They wanted a
downtown, parks, playgrounds and a school, all within walking
distance of the homes. They wanted sidewalks and picket fences, a
town not unrelated to Disney World's Main Street USA, just a mile
or so away. They wanted to bring back a way of life lost when
suburbs appeared and cars became the only way to get to distant
stores, school and work.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Co. took a 10,000-acre tract of Florida scrub land
and turned half of it into an upscale community that eventually
will include 5,000 houses and apartments. The other half will
remain natural.
</P>
<P>
   The first residents moved in almost three years ago. In all, 772
residences have been built, 466 detached houses, 74 town houses and
232 apartments. Houses range in price from $160,000 for a garden
home of about 1,400 square feet to more than $1 million for the
estate homes, which range in size from 3,500 to 10,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   All 123 downtown apartments are leased, including those above
the shops. An additional 231 apartments will come to the market by
year-end. The one-, two-and three-bedroom units will rent for $830
to $2,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Reader, vice president and general manager of the
Celebration Co., the town's developer, said the quick sellout of
the town houses had resulted in the construction of 29 more town
houses than the 74 originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown sports four restaurants and a myriad of shops.
Bicycles, baked goods, clothing, gifts, antiques, books, kitchen
utensils and jewelry can all be purchased in the shops at the edge
of a man-made lake, which has no name. Celebration also features a
real oddity: a twin-screen, 515-seat downtown movie theater. A
short stroll away is the 115-room Celebration Hotel, which will be
completed this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Disney brought in famed architecture firms from around the
country to design the signature buildings: Michael Graves created
the Post Office, Philip Johnson the Town Hall and Robert A.M. Stern
Architects designed Celebration Health, a full-service medical
center. The Stern firm and Cooper Robertson, both of Manhattan,
designed the master plan.
</P>
<P>
   When the development was announced, demand was so high, a
drawing was held in November 1995 to decide who would get first
dibs at talking with a sales agent. Karen Howard remembers feeling
frustration because her number was so high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `Oh forget it, we're never going to get it,' ''
she recalled. But eventually she and her husband, Jack, were able
to buy a house that had been built for another family that had
backed out of the deal. The 3,000-square-foot coastal-style home
with a wraparound porch on the town's main thoroughfare came on the
market on a Friday and they signed a contract the next day. They
paid full price.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Howard's company, Herman Miller Inc., an office furniture
manufacturer, transferred him from Houghton, N.Y., to the Orlando
area five years ago. They settled in nearby Winter Springs, but
were intrigued with Celebration. Ultimately, they and two of their
neighbors bought homes here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an old-time kind of place,'' said Mrs. Howard. When
her 16-year-old son, Kyle, was injured in a soccer game, one of the
few she did not attend, her neighbor accompanied him to the
hospital. Recently, she and a friend were bike riding when they saw
a stray rabbit hopping among the lush foliage in a neighbor's yard.
They jumped off their bikes and quickly found the animal's owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other places a bunny wouldn't have a prayer,'' said Mrs.
Kupchak, who got in on the search.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Healy, the other rabbit rescuer, said, ``I can't imagine
not living here.''
</P>
<P>
   Her two children, ages 10 and 5, attend the K-12 Celebration
School, which has 800 students. It offers hands-on instruction in
multigrade classrooms. Recently some of the high schoolers created
web pages for local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The school is operated by the Celebration Co. in conjunction
with the Osceola County School District. The government for the
unincorporated development is run by the five-member Community
Development District, elected by property owners. Fees, averaging
about $400 a year, paid to the' association for the maintenance of
public areas are added to the bill for property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the lifestyle is clearly not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I came here my sister told me it creeped her out, it
was too perfect,'' said Julie Jensen who was visiting the town
recently. ``It is kind of Stepford Wife-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to spend that much money on a house I'd want
more space around me.'' said her friend, Sally Manko. ``The yard's
postage stamp-sized.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Celebration exudes uniformity and perfection in the
same way Disney World does. Streets are meticulously clean, lawns
manicured, trees trimmed. It looks like Ozzie and Harriet Nelson's
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Howard said she had heard many rumors about her town. Her
daughter, Courtney, a college student, teaches dance in a nearby
town and hears people there say that Disney pays the residents to
walk their dogs and sit on their porches a certain number of hours
each week.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, said Mrs. Howard, but people do enjoy sitting on
their porches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come home and drive through those white picket fences I
say `whew' and think I'm home and I don't have to go back out,''
she said. ``It's neat and organized. What's not to love?''
</P>
<P>
   Reader, the vice president and general manager of the
Celebration Co., believes the original dream has become reality.
``Over half of the residents volunteer in one of the 20 community
groups that the Celebration Foundation gave birth to,'' he said.
``We have a nice collection of people, very diverse backgrounds.
For a community as young as we are, that's a real success story.''

AS CALDOR FADES, RETAIL MARKET IS UNFAZED
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Caldor, the discount-store chain, announced in January that
it was closing its 145 stores, including 28 in New Jersey, William
A. Farber was struck by a sense of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   Farber is chief operating officer at Levin Management Corp. of
North Plainfield, which owns and manages 66 shopping centers, 45 of
them, totaling nearly 4 million square feet, in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Levin worked through the bankruptcies of W.T.
Grant and E.J. Korvettes. Now it is faced with the same situation
because Caldor anchors five of the company's centers, having
replaced Korvettes in the '80s. The centers are in Paramus, West
Orange, Woodbridge, Watchung and North Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the stores in those centers will signal what
impact, if any, Caldor's bankruptcy will have on the state's retail
market, and on landlords like Levin. Two of its stores _ one on
Route 4 West in Paramus, the other on Route 22 in Watchung _ are
already spoken for by Kohl's, a discount department store chain
based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., which is looking to build its
presence in the New York metropolitan area. If the leases of the
other three stores are not taken over by other retailers, Farber
said the space would be reconfigured for new users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting with a sound retail market and good real estate
locations, where land for new construction is scarce, so even
though one retailer couldn't make it, another one will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most retail analysts and brokers said Caldor's bankruptcy was
not expected to have a harsh impact on the overall market, and
might come and go without incident, much like the closing last year
of the Rickel stores, said Matthew J. Schnurr, senior vice
president of the investment services group at the West Orange
office of Grubb &AMP; Ellis, the national commercial brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the home-improvement chain's 53 stores, 40 of them in
New Jersey, were taken over by Staples, the office-supply store,
said Schnurr, whose firm handled the disposition of the Rickel
stores.
</P>
<P>
   A key reason why analysts are optimistic is that the closing of
Caldor stores, which average about 84,000 square feet, comes at a
time when the state's economy and retail market continue to be
strong. Projections are that it will remain so at least through the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the booming economy along with the fact that many
Caldor stores are in prime locations, very few are expected to be
hurt,'' said Ted Kraus, who heads TKO Real Estate Advisory Group, a
retail consulting firm in Mercerville.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide retail vacancy rate is hovering between 3.5
percent and 4 percent, virtually unchanged from last year, and
rents continue to rise, albeit not as aggressively as in the past,
according to TKO. For example, the firm puts the rents for stores
of 70,000 to 100,000 square feet for stores in good locations at
$10 to $13 a square foot, up about $1 from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Caldor closes its stores, other national and regional
retailers continue to expand in or enter the state, said Jonathan
Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization, a brokerage in
Woodbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Kohl's, as well as Wal-Mart and Kmart, are looking to
grow by picking up some of the leases on the stores left behind by
Caldor. Under bankruptcy laws, bidders for the company would be
able to assume the leases at the same rents Caldor was paying,
which may be significantly below today's rents since many of the
leases were negotiated years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is way for growing companies to get into a tight market in
a much quicker and less expensive way,'' Schultz said. That, in
turn, may ``slow development in the state, keeping supply in
balance with demand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One negative, added Kraus of TKO, is what will happen once new
retailers take over the Caldor stores. ``Some merchants who
survived because Caldor was a weak competitor will need to work
more aggressively or lose out to the new competition,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Late last month Kohl's received approval from the bankruptcy
court to buy for $142 million the leases of 33 Caldor stores.
Eleven of them are in New Jersey, including the two stores at
Levin's centers. They will be added to the six stores Kohl's
already has in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been expanding into the mid-Atlantic region over the
last two years,'' said Gary Vasques, executive vice president of
marketing at Kohl's. Taking over the Caldor leases is a logical
move ``and allows us to enter the New York metropolitan area with a
critical mass of stores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, he said, is to invest a total of $165 million to
renovate all the stores and open them by the spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the same, time Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, which
is based in Bentonville, Ark., was given the green light to buy 12
store leases for $75 million, none in New Jersey. And Kmart, of
Troy, Mich., put in a bid for 11 stores. Just one, a Levin property
in West Orange, is in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding for the leases, analysts said, is likely to continue
for another two months and may bring in more bids from the same
players or new ones from other retailers. In addition, retailers
who may not want to get involved with the bidding process _ waiting
instead for the leases to go back to landlords _ are said to be
eyeing the stores. Likely candidates are other so-called big-box
users, including discounters like Target, Ames and Bradlees, the
latter two of which worked themselves out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Stores in choice locations _ in densely populated areas with
strong demographics and next to and visible from major highways _
will be snapped up quickly, said Schnurr, of Grubb &AMP; Ellis.
Landlords with stores in less than prime spots ``will have to
become creative and come up with adaptive reuses,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Farber of Levin Management said that his company sees
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the Caldor stores in his company's centers are
taken over by a new retailer at a rent that ``is out-of step with
today's market,'' he said, there is room to renegotiate certain
aspects of the lease that pertain, for example, to rents based on
sales volume. He said there was also the possibility that the new
tenant would not need all the space, giving his company the chance
to take back any excess space and rent it to other tenants at
market rates.
</P>
<P>
   Farber said that was the plan at the Paramus center, a
270,000-square-foot community shopping strip anchored by a
130,000-square-foot Caldor store.
</P>
<P>
   There Kohl's intends to use only 90,000 feet, enabling Levin to
take back the rest, he said, noting that in tandem with Kohl's
plans to renovate the store's facade his company will invest $2.5
million to refurbish the center.
</P>
<P>
   Levin intends to repeat that plan at its 400,000-square-foot
Watchung Center, which is anchored by a 138,000-square-foot Caldor
store.
</P>
<P>
   The center is in the process of a $5 million rehabilitation,
which Levin is undertaking with Federal Realty Investment Trust,
based in Washington, D.C. That, together with Kohl's arrival,
``gives the center a shot in the arm to remain competitive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Caldor stores at Levin's other three centers are still up
for grabs and Farber said his firm would be just as pleased if it
got back those leases. The first choice would be to lease the space
to a single user or to two smaller anchors and ``fill in everything
else from there,'' he said, noting that the alternative was to
carve up the space for multiple smaller uses.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the stores are on two stories or have a basement
level, he said his firm would do what it had done many times
before: lease that space to complementary uses like health clubs or
day care centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has shown that retailers have a limited life span, but
as long as the location is viable and the economics are sound, life
for the real estate goes on,'' Farber said.

RED FLAGS IN A CO-OP'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The economics of buying a house are fairly simple:
You add up the cost of routine expenses _ mortgage, taxes,
insurance, utilities and maintenance _ and then factor in how much
it will cost to replace things like the roof or heating system when
necessary. Then you take your checkbook, subtract the down payment,
add your income and decide whether what's left over will be enough
for food, clothing and other necessities, and perhaps even some
non-necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a co-op apartment, on the other hand, is more complicated
because in addition to dealing with much of the above, the
prospective purchaser must cope with one of the harsher realities
of cooperative living _ the fact that other people are in charge of
the checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   It is thus important to examine the co-op's financial statement
carefully to help determine whether a building's books are as well
managed as yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing to consider when looking over a financial
statement is the availability of the statement itself,'' said Herb
Rose, a Manhattan co-op consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Most co-ops, Rose explained, operate on a fiscal year that ends
on Dec. 31. That means that financial reports for such co-ops
should be available in the early part of the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial statement should be available no later than May
7,'' Rose said. ``Anything later than that is a sign that there's
something wrong or that the bookkeeping is in such a mess that
they're having trouble reconciling it.'' (For co-ops on a fiscal
year that ends on a different date, Rose said, financial reports
should be available roughly five months after that date.)
</P>
<P>
   Other ``red flag'' items to look for, he said, are uncollected
maintenance charges and unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncollected maintenance is tricky because it's listed on the
financial statement as an asset,'' he said. ``But if uncollected
maintenance exceeds 5 percent of the total annual maintenance
charges for the building, you have a building that's in serious
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Excessively high uncollected maintenance charges, he said, is a
sign that attention is not being paid to cash flow in the building
and that there is no adequate system for collecting receivables.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of a bad cash-flow equation, he said, is excessive
unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shouldn't exceed 5 percent of total annual maintenance
either,'' Rose said. ``Because if they're not paying their bills on
time, they're probably paying late charges on some things and too
much for everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Gonchar, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the total
annual maintenance charges could be used as a benchmark for another
potential danger sign _ insufficient cash reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good general rule is that the reserve fund should be
approximately one-third of annual maintenance charges,'' he said.
And since reserves can be quickly depleted if major repairs or
capital improvements are necessary, he added, there should also be
some way of replenishing the fund.
</P>
<P>
   One way that well-run co-ops keep their reserve funds well fed
is by balancing income and expenses to generate a surplus at the
end of each year. Another is to create revenue generators like flip
taxes, whereby a set amount of money _ typically a percentage of
the sale price _ is paid to the co-op when an apartment is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to determine, Gonchar said, is whether there are
existing property tax abatements on the building and, if so, when
such abatements expire.
</P>
<P>
   When such information is included, Gonchar said, it can usually
be found in the ``Notes'' section of the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an abatement expires, the property taxes increase, and
that usually means an increase in maintenance charges,'' he said.
Two more bits of important information that might be found in the
Notes section of the financial statement, he said, are the number
of unsold units in the building and projected major repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the number of unsold units in the building exceeds 25
percent, some lenders may be hesitant to lend in the building,'' he
said. ``Unsold units'' are apartments still owned by the original
sponsor, the sponsor's designee or investors.
</P>
<P>
   And if major repairs or improvements are contemplated, he said,
the estimated cost of those expenses should be determined as well
as whether there is sufficient money in the reserve fund to pay for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not, that could mean an unexpected assessment for an unwary
buyer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonchar said that a buyer should make every effort to accompany
his or her lawyer when the lawyer goes to examine the minutes of a
building's board of directors, typically covering two years. Doing
so, Gonchar said, will enable the buyer or the lawyer to ferret out
information that may not be included in the financial statement _
information about tax abatements and future repairs, for example _
and to get an idea of other issues of importance in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Kleiman, a Manhattan certified public accountant who
specializes in co-ops and condominiums, said that somewhere in the
financial statement there should be information regarding the
co-op's underlying mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for any changes in mortgage terms that are scheduled to
take place,'' he said, explaining that a scheduled increase in the
interest rate or a required payment of principal could result in
increased maintenance charges.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important, Kleiman said, to pay close attention to
the date the current mortgage matures because refinancing the
mortgage can result in an increase in maintenance charges. Along
the same lines, he said, if there are commercial tenants in the
building, it is important to determine the terms of their leases.
</P>
<P>
   ``An expiring commercial lease may result in either a windfall
or a downfall,'' he said. ``But at least you'll know what to
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   James G. Samson, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that another
thing prospective apartment buyers might want to look at is the
proportional share of underlying debt attributable to individual
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Two other things to look for on a financial statement, Samson
said, are current expenditures for legal services and pending
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see lots of pending litigation or huge amounts of legal
fees, you should start asking questions,'' he said. ``Well-run
buildings don't have big legal problems and don't have big legal
fees.''
</P>
<P>
   And where in the report can such information be found?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look where the lawyers look,'' he said. ``And most
lawyers start by reading the footnotes because that's where the
problems are usually buried.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Samson said, a prudent purchaser will scrutinize every
line in the last two or three years' worth of financial reports,
and then read between the lines for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to throw your brain in neutral and look for what's
unusual, look for what has changed,'' he said, adding that such
detective work becomes even more important the more ``red-hot'' the
apartment market becomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's so good today that people are able to sell their
mistakes,'' he said. ``You just don't want to be the person who
buys one.''

AS SALVADOR VOTES, ITS ONCE-PROUD LEFT CONFRONTS A DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR _ Two years of democratic presidential politics
have accomplished what $5 billion worth of anticommunist US aid in
the 1980s could not: Divide El Salvador's largest leftist
opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 years of civil war against a US-backed conservative
government, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front gathered
former soldiers, peasants, doctors, and teachers with a unifying
mission: to replace the country's ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
   But almost seven years after both sides put down their guns, a
fractured front faces elections Sunday. And if preelection opinion
polls are correct, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
candidate, Facundo Guardado, a former guerrilla commander, will run
a distant second to Francisco Flores of the ruling National
Republican Alliance, some of whose founders had ties to right-wing
death squads that had been linked to tens of thousands of wartime
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Such an electoral loss would mark a dramatic and disappointing
skid for the front, known as FMLN, which a decade ago swelled with
support from college campuses in New England and other socialist
leaders in Cuba and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``This party is trying to change, and it's redefining itself,''
said Hector Silva, a Cambridge native who is now the FMLN mayor of
this capital city. ``We were the broad opposition during the war.
Now the question is, where do we stand on more pragmatic issues?''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the front seemed to be near the presidency. It
had taken over mayoralties in most of El Salvador's largest cities
and won nearly a dozen seats in congress, taking away the National
Republican Alliance majority.
</P>
<P>
   But internal divisions, which sources say had been percolating
since war's end, became more public, and began to chip away at the
front.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line members, most of them former guerrillas who believed
in broad Marxist principles, resisted the ideas of a growing
moderate wing whose members expressed concerns over more pragmatic
issues such as tax policy and public safety.
</P>
<P>
   The debates spilled into the selection process for the party's
presidential candidate. The moderates supported Silva, 50, a
US-educated obstetrician and former assembly member. Although he
did not fight in the war, Silva has become a popular figure for
tackling several quality-of-life issues, such as San Salvador's
worsening pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But at a party convention last year, more militant members won a
ticket with two former combatants, Guardado and Nidia Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country of amazingly practical people,'' one
diplomatic source said last week. ``My guess is that if the FMLN
had picked Silva, they would be doing much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the voters in this tiny Central American country
are expected to cast their ballots Sunday, among them Leonor
Marquez. The 25-year-old former guerrilla now collects tickets at
the Museo de la Revolucion, a museum dedicated to the country's
revolutionary movements. Even she has doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say that things have changed since the
war,'' Marquez said. ``We used to be much more united, but now I
don't even know who I'm going to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Alliance, whose initials in Spanish are
ARENA, has also experienced problems in its transformation from
wartime government machine to peaceful party. But experts credit it
with presenting a more united image.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the party's last two elected presidents, Alfredo
Cristiani and Armando Calderon Sol, who were conservative
businessmen and part of ARENA's traditional anticommunist wing,
Flores has portrayed himself as a more centrist and more distant
candidate. He has refused to debate his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, he spent several years studying mystical
philosophies, sometimes visiting gurus in India, according to a
recent biography published by the San Salvador daily, El Diario de
Hoy.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Catholic, Flores also took a graduate course in
liberation theology at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like a very serious student and he had a deep
interest in economic justice,'' said Harvey Cox, the professor who
taught the course, who has periodically spoken to his former
student.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual unknown as an assemblyman, Flores shocked party
members when he announced his candidacy last spring, months before
other parties had decided on nominees. Despite initial criticism
from party leaders, however, ARENA has firmly supported its
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everyone else, ARENA has had to change its methods,''
Calderon Sol said in an interview on Friday. ``This has been a more
transparent campaign and less confrontational.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
Silva said, is to ``construct a new model'' as a political party
rather than a military group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democracy and human rights that we fought for during the
civil war have been pretty much achieved,'' he added. ``Now we're
learning how to govern without forgetting that we still want to
have better distribution of economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The FMLN's problems are not unique in this region, which for
most of the 1980s was immersed in bloody battles between leftist
insurgents and rightist governments. The Sandinistas in Nicaragua
have had difficulty building political support after losing the
presidency in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   If no candidate wins 50 percent of Sunday's vote, a runoff would
be held within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support a return to a more traditional FMLN platform
say the answer is not in becoming a more centrist organization, but
in bringing back the populist platform and fiery rhetoric that
inspired the movement in its heyday a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if when we put away our guns we put away our hearts,''
said Victor Martinez, an FMLN member from the small northern town
of San Francisco de Gotera. ``So far, this has been a very boring
campaign.

   BOSTON _ Shayne Stevenson's hockey odyssey continues. The former
Bruin first-round pick (No. 17 overall in '89), who played only 19
games with Boston before being given away in the '92 expansion
draft, is a left wing with the San Angelo (Texas) Outlaws this
season.

<P>
   But Thursday morning, according to published reports, the
28-year-old Stevenson found himself on the outs with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson and teammate Kevin McKinnon were arrested in the
predawn hours for allegedly stealing a taxi in Bossier City, La.,
and fleeing onto Interstate 20 before being pulled over by police.
Both Outlaws were charged with unauthorized use of a moveable (cab
without the cabbie), McKinnon also nailed for first-offense driving
while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``About all we can say,'' said Suzanne Moore, whose husband,
Dick Moore, owns the San Angelo club, ``is thank God it wasn't
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson did not return a phone message left with Moore by a
Globe reporter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Moore, Stevenson has been sidelined recently by a
groin injury, but nonetheless joined the team on the trip that had
the Outlaws facing the Shreveport Mudbugs Thursday night _ sans
Stevenson and McKinnon, who spent a few hours in the Bossier Parish
Jail in Benton, La., before each posted a bond of $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson was an affable, fun-loving 18-year-old when the Bruins
selected him, hoping his blend of skill and quick-trigger
feistiness could bring them some production and nastiness up front.
It was the same draft that produced Mats Sundin (No. 1), Bill
Guerin (5), Bobby Holik (10), Olaf Kolzig (19), Adam Foote (22),
and Byron Dafoe (35).
</P>
<P>
   In the same draft, the Bruins took Mike Parson with the No. 38
pick and the highly-touted-but-short Wes Walz at No. 57. Of the 11
players the Bruins selected in '89, only Stevenson and Walz ever
made it to the NHL, contributing a total of 9 goals and 22 points
in a combined 92 games with Boston. Stevenson's totals with Boston:
0-1_1 in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   His end in the Hub came when the Bruins, deciding early that he
was a writeoff, left him exposed in the Ottawa-Tampa Bay expansion
draft. The Bolts bit, but he played only eight games with Tampa
Bay, picking up what stands as his last NHL point (an assist in
'92-93).
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' said Stevenson, shortly before going to
Tampa in '92. ``The Bruins thought they were drafting a man and
they got a boy. I had to learn how to be a professional hockey
player, and unfortunately, I did that at the Bruins' expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all my fault, and I wasted two years of my life _ and the
Bruins paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson returned home to Aurora, Ontario, after his final
go-round with Boston and his parents, Tom and Linda, insisted that
he seek professional counseling. He wouldn't specify the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got checked in,'' said Stevenson, who, when asked to
clarify, said he was not hospitalized. ``I went to see a
psychologist, that's all. I had problems. It's a lot of things. I
left home at 15, and you miss a lot, how to eat, how to spend your
money. But the shrink's helped me out, a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson has played in Europe and for a variety of lower-tier
US-based minor league teams. His longest stay was in Utica, where
he played two-plus seasons with the Blizzard. He spent last season
with the Port Huron Border Cats before signing in the summer with
the Outlaws, in the Western Professional Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson and McKinnon are scheduled to appear in Bossier Parish
District Court for arraignment April 5, the same day the Canadiens
visit Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of player was he in Boston?'' Suzanne Moore asked a
caller to the Outlaws office on Friday. ``Here, he comes out strong
each game _ he's a nice skater _ and then, I don't know, he just
sort of disappears.''

   It's late in the season, which means, of course, it's time again
for the Flyers to worry about their netminding (did you hear there
will be tulips in the Public Garden this year, too?). Rookie
Jean-Marc Pelletier (Georgia-born and ex- of Cornell) was tossed
into the net Thursday night for his NHL debut (a 5-0 whitewashing
by the Senators), which bumped free agent signee John Vanbiesbrouck
(five straight losses) to backup and Ron Hextall to the press box.
The move came after the Flyers lost four straight and were a dismal
2-8-2 over their last 12. It's general manager Bob Clarke's way of
trying to kick-start the karma. If this doesn't work out, look for
the spotlight to get pointed, appropriately, directly on the nose
of Eric Lindros. Another short postseason (the Flyers were knocked
out by the Sabres in Round 1 last spring) inevitably will reignite
rumors that Lindros will get moved in a blockbuster deal this
summer. But with whom? Los Angeles would make sense, especially
with a new building to fill, but the Kings lack the bodies to make
a swap viable. Would it make any sense for the Flyers to consider
Mike Modano? L'enfant Terrible is some three years younger than
Modano, and more of a physical presence, but maybe the Flyers could
use more touch/speed and the Stars more big-line bulk. It's really
about the only center-for-center swap that makes sense. Don't even
bring up the name Peter Forsberg. He's the best of the three . . .
Senators GM Rick Dudley got under the collar of his Islander
counterpart, Mike Milbury, when he said last week that Ottawa's
search for a second-line center included the possible acquisition
of the Islanders' Trevor Linden. ``It's nice to be wanted,'' said
Linden. ``But I don't want to leave.'' Milbury was disgruntled that
Dudley leaked Linden's name, saying it was ``inappropriate'' and
``counterproductive'' for another GM to be talking openly about
another team's players. The bluster aside, the betting is the
Islanders will move Linden, among many others, ideally dumping his
salary ($2.5 million) for at least one young prospect. ``If they're
throwing names like Trevor Linden around,'' said Milbury, ``we'd be
throwing names like (Alexei) Yashin and (Daniel) Alfredsson.''
Other clubs with interest in Linden: Toronto, Detroit, and
Vancouver (the club that sent him to Long Island for Bryan McCabe
and Todd Bertuzzi last February) . . . Adam Oates would be another
good No. 2 fit in Ottawa, but the Capitals aren't yet in the same
no-man's land as the Islanders in terms of the playoff picture. If
the Capitals dish Oates, it's tantamount to passing on the
playoffs, not unlike Calgary's sending Theo Fleury to the Avalanche
last weekend . . . The Rangers figured their playoff chances were
about to fade to black when Wayne Gretzky exited the lineup with a
bulging cervical disc. Result: a Petr Nedved hat trick, the
blossoming of some young forwards (Manny Malhotra and Marc Savard),
and a 3-0-1 undefeated streak headed into Sunday's match at the
Vault. Remember, the Rangers refused to part with Malhotra when the
Canucks were shopping Pavel Bure. What now, when the Great One
returns? Coach John Muckler may have no choice but to hand him
reduced minutes, in hopes of having the kids lead the way to the
postseason.

   Frightening sight at Toronto's new Air Canada Centre Wednesday
night when Alyn McCauley (5 feet 11 inches on tiptoes) was knocked
cold in a rear-board collision with the Devils' Sheldon Souray (6-4
in stocking feet). After a few minutes on the ice _ five of which
he was out cold _ McCauley was lugged out on a stretcher, though he
was able to squeeze Tie Domi's hand as he exited. Hospital tests
revealed a concussion, the fourth of his career . . . Amid all the
Canucks' injuries, left winger Peter Schaefer, a Syracuse callup,
has been impressive, showing some touch. Gotta like a guy who hails
from Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan . . . Jim Carey finally got what he
wanted: an NHL club to give him a chance. So he took the buyout
from the Bruins _ a savings of about $2 million for Boston _ and
showed up in St. Louis just in time to see prospect Brent Johnson
rattle off his second and third victories in net. Carey finally saw
his first NHL action in some 18 months when he took over for
Johnson in a 4-0 loss to the Leafs Thursday, allowing one goal on
four shots. Johnson was demoted to Worcester Friday. If Carey gets
in enough games (10) before the end of the season, he could be
exposed in the waiver draft. If not, look for the Blues to put up
either Grant Fuhr or Jamie McLennan for the Atlanta yard sale.
Carey's deal will bring him $200,000 this season and at least three
times that in 1999-2000 . . . UPN has landed over-the-air rights to
broadcast the Atlanta Thrashers games. Georgia, you're going to
love mini one-on-one (hint: it's not a race between modified
pickups).

   Oiler foward Georges Laraque, whose crushing hit Feb. 9 on
Darren Van Impe knocked the defenseman out of the Boston lineup,
had a highlight-reel punchfest with Sabres bad guy Rob Ray
Wednesday night in Buffalo. The pummeled Ray left the battle
clutching his left leg (pulled hamstring), tried to come back in
the second period, but couldn't continue (TKO, Laraque). During the
morning skate, Ray had been shown a printed report in which Laraque
said he would be looking to tangle. ``What's he going to do, beat
me up?'' said Ray. Ain't it awful being right? . . . The Oilers
have renewed their interest in acquiring Buffalo's Matthew Barnaby
(they were poking around last year) and have put out a feeler for
the Bay State's Jim Campbell (doing little in St. Loo). Rumor on
Friday had the Sabres ready to move Barnaby, netminding prospect
Martin Biron, and defenseman Jean-Luc Grand-Pierre (find a better
hockey name) in a package. If they're talking with Edmonton, the
Sabres no doubt would have to give up defenseman Bo Mironov. They'd
also be only too happy to dump netminder Mikhail Shtalenkov . . .
Perhaps as early as Friday, former Penguins great Mario Lemieux is
expected to file a bankruptcy reorganization plan that ultimately
could lead to the club being sold to a group he is assembling. The
investors would pony up some $50 million, he would fold in a
portion of the $31.4 million he is owed in deferred compensation,
and $60 million in debt also would be assumed. The Penguins are
about $125 million in debt. Lemieux, candidly, says he wants two
things out of the deal: 1. the money he's owed, and 2. the club to
remain in Pittsburgh (ultimately playing in a new rink). Meanwhile,
the current ownership group (including Revere-raised Roger Marino)
has a March 19 date in bankruptcy court, a hearing in which it
hopes to gain permission to pursue out-of-town suitors . . . The
Bruins' alumni squad will take to the ice Tuesday, 7 p.m., at the
Norfolk Arena for the benefit of the local Autism Family Center . .
. Ex-Bruin Geoff Courtnall, limited to 21 games this season with
the Blues because of postconcussion syndrome, might not be able to
return until 1999-2000 . . . Craig Janney has become the same spare
part on Long Island that he was in Tampa Bay. After being scratched
for two games, he told Newsday reporter John Valenti: ``You come
here, you're not dressing, and you're sitting in a hotel room for a
month, and it's going on two (months) away from my family.''
Islanders head coach Bill Stewart responded in part: ``It goes back
to `Shut up and play and don't tell me how wonderful you were 10
years ago.' '' Put a hold on those Janney-Cam Neely highlight
clips.

   BOSTON _ Quality of play is down. Shooting percentages are down.
Scoring is down. The Clippers are down.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the NBA is a league of trends, and its bete
noir is again holding its own at the bottom of an ever-deepening
barrel. The Clippers have involuntarily embarked on a possibly
historic campaign, one that is again raising questions about the
way Los Angeles's ``other team'' (read: not for NBC) functions.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has a minor investment in this year's team: its coach.
Chris Ford is now patrolling the sidelines for a team that is
finding it difficult to get even a single win. Ford has yet to
reach for the hemlock or the sharp objects in his rented Redondo
Beach house, but even he wasn't prepared for an 0-14 start.

   ``I knew what I was getting into,'' said Ford, a reference to
the ongoing chaos that has enveloped the Clippers in the immovable
personas of Wynken, Blynken, and Nod, also known as owner Donald
Sterling, henchman Andy ``He Must Have Incriminating Polaroids''
Roeser, and general manager Elgin ``I Was A Great Player'' Baylor.
``But you always think that when you take a job, you can make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wooden couldn't make a difference with this team. The
management troika seems to survive all the carnage while Hall of
Fame coaches such as Larry Brown and Bill Fitch get exasperated and
either leave or are fired. Ford is simply the latest human
sacrifice who deserves better, but is getting what everyone else
figured he'd get.
</P>
<P>
   He inherited a horrible team (17-65) that brought just about
everyone back and added no one of consequence other than No. 1 pick
Michael Olowokandi. Baylor and Roeser have deftly maneuvered the
roster in such a way that three of their best players, Lamond
Murray, Lorenzen Wright, and Rodney Rogers, as well as some others
who play critical roles, all are free agents at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   And they know what happens to Clipper free agents: They always
end up somewhere else. Always. The latest to leave were Ike Austin
and Loy Vaught, and the year before it was Bo Outlaw. The Clippers
have a rich, unblemished history of never re-signing their own.
Austin never even considered them. Outlaw took less money to go to
Orlando. This year's soon-to-be-freebies know they will not be
back, and that makes it impossible for a coach to establish any
type of a team concept.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, for instance, showed he was a team guy by reporting to
camp 40 pounds overweight. Wright, who everyone agrees has
potential, is already seeing himself as a $60 million player. And
the Clippers' best player, Maurice Taylor, is a free agent at the
end of next season. Think he'll sign an extension this week before
the deadline?
</P>
<P>
   This is the mess that Ford inherited. He said he went into the
job assuming ``they don't know anything,'' and he was surprised to
learn that he was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of teaching going on,'' Ford said. ``You just
hope some of it would sink in. These guys can't do it on their own
and they have to understand that they have to play in a system,
particularly on defense. When is the light bulb going to turn on?
It's not rocket science. It's simple rotations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford has taken to juggling the lineup, giving time to the
younger players who work in practice. He's without Olowokandi now;
the big guy has a sprained ankle. Olowokandi was the second No. 1
overall pick for the Clippers (Danny Manning was the other), and he
is far from polished, which makes his adjustment even more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young, raw talent,'' Ford said. ``He doesn't know the
game yet. Everything is still new to him. But he does have a great
jump hook when he moves to the middle, and that's a real strength.
He's also not afraid to bang and go for a rebound. But he's still
young in terms of knowledge, like illegal defenses, rotations,
things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi and the new Staples Center, which opens next year,
represent the dim lights at the end of the never-ending tunnel. The
real tragedy is that the NBA doesn't take the team by eminent
domain on the grounds of extreme cruelty. There's always been a
proviso to any team out West that is having its troubles: Thank God
for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been truer than the present, which bears an uncanny
resemblance to the past.
</P>

   Shortly after New Jersey's victory over the Celtics last Monday,
Jayson Williams said, ``This is great. But I don't want to get too
caught up in all this. It's only one win. Let's see what we can do
now.'' Well, the Nets responded with home losses to Milwaukee and
Charlotte, the latter coming as they unveiled new road uniforms
(sleeveless, V-neck, and gray) at home. After the Charlotte loss,
Chuck Person, of all people, said he thinks the Nets are too
predictable in going to Keith Van Horn on every play. (Consider the
source; the only passes Person ever liked were the ones to him.)
``They go to Van Horn way too much,'' Person said. ``He touches the
ball every time they come down and he doesn't make his teammates
better. You get the ball that many times and you don't make your
teammates better? Guys are open in front of him and to the side of
him. Give it to them.'' Meanwhile, there will be continuing
speculation on John Calipari's fate, although management has been
ultra-patient so far. When Cal protested too much in the Celtics
game, referee Steve Javie turned to the press table and said, ``$3
million a year and all he does is bitch.'' . . . The Sporting News
is out with what it says is an analytical list of the top 25
players in the NBA. Immediately, antennae go up, for these lists
generally are based on stats. Only one Celtic made it, Paul Pierce,
at No. 13. Antoine Walker has good company, however. Also not on
the list were Scottie Pippen, Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury,
Reggie Miller, Kobe Bryant, and some other really good players . .
. Speaking of Walker, he may be struggling _ OK, he is struggling _
but he has made good on his pledge to tone down the `` 'Toine The
Terrible'' act. In the first 13 games, he has picked up only one
technical foul, and that was a double-job with Mark Davis. His only
blemish has been the much-publicized dust-up with Kenny Anderson .
. . The Magic may be the surprise team of the division, or even the
conference, but it's not because of (a) a breakout year for Penny
Hardaway or (b) anything rigorous at practice. Hardaway is
struggling mightily with his shooting. As for practices, well, the
Magic don't have any. ``I've got my own thought process about this
schedule and how it should be approched,'' said coach Chuck Daly.
``And we, basically, are not practicing. The key is, can they hold
up? We're a 2 o'clock team. We get home at 2 o'clock (after
conference road games). And I just don't see how they can hold up,
so I'm trying to buy as much for the bodies as I can.'' . . . The
Knicks welcomed Latrell Sprewell back into the mix Friday night,
just as their coach was asking his team to be more angry and
assertive. Hmmm. Actually, it was Jeff Van Gundy reminding people
that his team is last in the league in turnovers and next to last
in rebounding and free throws. (Sound familiar?) Van Gundy kept the
Knicks in Florida for a couple of days after their loss to Miami
and went from there directly to Milwaukee. He said the Knicks have
been ``very accepting'' about giving away games, adding, ``It's far
greater than one player returning.'' . . . Guess who has the best
road record in the NBA? The Philadelphia 76ers, that's who. They're
a gaudy 5-1 away from First Union Spectrum, or whatever it is they
call their home. (It seems to change every year or two.) . . . The
consensus seems to be that there is more power, much more, in the
Western Conference, and that despite heady starts by the likes of
Orlando, you could take the top eight teams in the West and pick
them to beat any Eastern team (except Indiana) in a best-of-seven.
Well, the interconference records don't support such a theory. As
of Thursday, Eastern teams were 19-16 against the West. Some
surprises: Toronto is 2-0 against the West, while Minnesota is 0-2
against the East. However, Seattle has yet to play an Eastern team,
while the Knicks have played only Minnesota from the West . . .
With the unnoticed release of Carl Herrera this past week (since
signed by Denver), the only commodity the Grizzlies have left from
their ill-fated decision to draft Antonio Daniels at No. 4 in 1997
(ahead of Ron Mercer, lest you forget) is rookie Felipe Lopez.
Herrera and Lopez came from San Antonio for Daniels, who doesn't
get much time for the Spurs, either. He's averaging eight minutes
and 2.5 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are two key dates this week, both of which loom somewhat
large for the Timberwolves. The trading deadline is 6 p.m.
Thursday. Two days later ends the ``window'' that teams have to
re-sign their rookies to extensions. The man in question here is
Marbury, who remains determined to test free agency even as the
Timberwolves try to sign him to a $70 million extension. ``We're
going to find out, I guess,'' said Wolves basketball boss Kevin
McHale. ``Our goal is to sign the kid.'' Marbury has been rumored
to be headed here or there, but Minnesota can pay him the most and
probably gives him the best shot at a title. ``Free agency is not
the end of the world,'' McHale said. ``I did the same thing. I
didn't want to talk about my contract during the season, either. I
can't control that. It's not like I can wave a magic wand. If
you're going to do a deal, you should ask yourself, `Can I win a
championship with this guy?' If you can't, don't do it.'' McHale
has been a Marbury Man from the get-go and has not changed. But he
also has heard and seen comments from Marbury about not being sold
on Minnesota. The three most mentioned landing spots are New York
(where's he from), Chicago (which will have the money), and the
Lakers (who have the pizzazz and the talent). McHale doesn't pay
much attention to that and has already shown he won't be bullied,
by refusing to sign and trade Tom Gugliotta to LA for Elden
Campbell and Eddie Jones. ``No one knows a team as well as the
people who run it,'' he said. ``Steph has the ability to be the
best point guard in the game. But it's not like I can put a gun to
him or stick electrodes in his feet. He has a choice.'' One of the
interesting side plots is that Marbury recently dumped agent Eric
Fleisher (who represents Kevin Garnett) and switched to David Falk,
who has never had a marquee Minnesota player. Falk met Minnesota
owner Glen Taylor for the first time Wednesday and followed the
Timberwolves to Vancouver as the signing deadline approached.

PATRIOTS LOSE GROUND STANDING STILL 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ WARNING TO PATRIOT FANS: Do not read on if
you have angina.
</P>
<P>
   New England's football brass keeps insisting it will do
something before the free agency period is over, but if it turns
out to be replacing Todd Collins with Tedy Bruschi and Robert
Edwards with someone like Travis Jervey, they will slide back to
the pack in the AFC East, less than three years after reaching the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That's not because they lack talent but because their
competition has strengthened itself almost across the board while
the Patriots' ship has taken on more water. The way to compete is
not to hold a pat hand in Pats land and keep saying, ``It's all
about the injuries.'' But that seems to be the prevailing approach
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bruschi can replace Collins full time, but if he proved
that at the end of last season I missed it. Maybe Jervey or Sedrick
Shaw can duplicate Edwards's 1,000-yard season, but in three years
that position has gone from Curtis Martin to Edwards to a large
question mark.
</P>
<P>
   And if Heath Irwin can do what Dave Wohlabaugh did at center, he
must have really put on a show at those no-contact, closed practice
sessions last season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if every one of these non-moves works out, the Patriots
will still face an improved set of rivals in a division that put
four teams in the playoffs last season. Here's a closer look at
what the AFC East teams have done this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   JETS (12-4 in 1998): New York has not had a significant player
loss in free agency and has added a still-young eight-time Pro Bowl
safety in Steve Atwater, massive blocking tight end Eric Green,
punter/quarterback Tom Tupa, defensive end Mike Frederick, and
solid linebacker Roman Phifer, who had 99 tackles last year with
the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   That is in addition to the re-signing of quarterback Vinny
Testaverde to a three-year, $19.5 million contract. If you're
howling at that, consider this: Testaverde was 13-2 as a starter
last year and his 29 touchdown passes to 7 interceptions was the
fourth-best ratio in NFL history. He is no longer the
interception-prone quarterback of his early days in Tampa. Since
leaving there six years ago, he has had more TDs than INTs five
times.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (10-6): They, too, have lost little but added more
toughness and size to their offensive line by trading for Kevin
Gogan. Jimmy Johnson will try to rehabilitate former No. 1 pick
Tyrone Wheatley, the running back who took up residence in the
Giants' doghouse early and never got out of it. He also added speed
receiver Willie Green and may go after another one with big numbers
in Tony Martin, if Martin's off-field troubles can be worked out.
Most important, the Dolphins did not lose key free agent
linebackers Zach Thomas and Robert Jones, finding cap room to
re-sign both. If Dan Marino stays healthy and an improving line
with two power blockers inside (Gogan and Kevin Donnalley) can open
more holes for the running game, Miami will continue to be a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO (10-6): The Bills are the only team in the division to
do less than the Patriots thus far. They've added no one and lost
receiver Quinn Early and linebackers Chris Spielman (who didn't
play last year anyway) and Wayne Simmons. But they did re-sign
guard Jerry Ostroski and cornerback Ken Irvin, who were pursued by
other teams.
</P>
<P>
   They also have the most depth at quarterback with Doug Flutie
and Rob Johnson, a quality running back in Antowain Smith with a
veteran backup in Thurman Thomas, and a team that plays scrappy
defense that will keep them alive in most games, especially as the
weather worsens.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ENGLAND (9-7): The Patriots' salary-cap mismanagement (e.g.
Max Lane and Todd Rucci earning $2.5 million apiece as the team
benches one and tries to give the other to Cleveland) cost them
Wohlabaugh, and bad luck cost them Edwards. If they have
replacements in house, nobody has seen them.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Glenn remains a question mark because of persistent injury
problems and they still lack a dominating pass rusher unless Willie
McGinest blossoms and finds ways to avoid his own injury jinx. With
front office pressure on the head coach and fan pressure on
everyone, New England cannot afford to come out of the box slowly;
that would increase the public scrutiny and could lead to a mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (3-13): The Colts are the most improved team in the
division. That figures, since they won only three games, but chief
architect Bill Polian has remade a defense ranked 29th in total
yards, rushing yards, and points allowed by signing free agents
Chad Bratzke, Chad Cota, Cornelius Bennett, and Shawn King for
$14.5 million in bonus money and nearly $50 million in new
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Bratzke, a defensive end who had 11 1/2 sacks last season for
the Giants, was one of the hot commodites among this year's free
agent class, and Polian outbid Cleveland to get him. He will miss
Pro Bowl teammate Michael Strahan, but Bennett, Cota, and fellow
defensive end King should make it easier for him to earn the
six-year, $30 million contract he got.
</P>
<P>
   King is a run stopper not a pass rusher, but Bratzke and Bennett
may handle the latter chore. They still need help at linebacker and
a punter to replace Chris Gardocki, but their defense will have
some pop, especially from Cota, who loves to KO people from his
safety spot and is strong against the run. All of this can only
help an improving Peyton Manning. The Colts may not reach the
playoffs but they could prevent someone else in the division from
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are still nearly six months to go before the
first ball is kicked off in September, and when it is, a healthy
Patriot team will still be favored to win the AFC East. But if
things stay as they are, the Patriots won't be prohibitive
favorites, just the best of a tightly bunched group. And who would
have thought just three short years ago that we'd be saying that?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, the Herald attacked a Globe report that said
Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri had been offered a three-year, $2.5
million proposal to jump to the Browns. Cleveland personnel
director Dwight Clark was quoted as saying he had had only one
phone conversation with Vinatieri and had not signed him to an
offer sheet, which was a nifty way to deny something that had never
been written. This came out 12 hours after Vinatieri was saying on
local radio that he planned to sign the offer Clark was insisting
hadn't been made. Agents then began to call Vinatieri, who was
representing himself, telling him they could get him more money. He
hired one, who is now trying to get Cleveland to increase its
offer. So what did Clark say on Wednesday when the deal still
wasn't done? ``If it goes (back) to square one, then we're probably
going to get out of it. It was our understanding we had a deal that
was getting ready to go on an offer sheet and be signed by both
parties. We're not changing our deal.'' I thought Clark told the
Herald there was no deal? I thought Clark said all he had was one
phone conversation with Vinatieri? And teams wonder why they are
not believed when they try to get out their side of a story. The
fact is Vinatieri had the offer but had not yet received the
printed sheet when he decided to change direction. That may or may
not end up making him more money. Historically, such negotiating
shifts after a deal is done do not bode well for the player unless
it is one with a lot more leverage than a kicker who can't kick
off. Sources still believe Vinatieri will sign a Cleveland offer
sheet because the Patriots are not inclined to give him a
considerably bigger contract and have no need to until he signs
something because he's restricted. Worst-case scenario for
Vinatieri is getting no sheet to browbeat the Patriots with.
Next-worse is getting the same offer from Cleveland he had two
weeks ago, but having to pay an agent 3 percent of it for doing
nothing . . . Cleveland, by the way, likes to know what it's
getting into. When the Browns signed running back Terry Kirby last
week, he became the 12th ex-49er on their roster. At least five are
expected to be starters. Former 49er president Carmen Policy has
filled his front office with his ex-employees, and they are filling
coach Chris Palmer's roster with the same. Considering the Niners'
track record, that's not a bad idea. Another signee was defensive
back Marquez Pope, who was also pursued by the Patriots. Cleveland
used the same ploy _ offering a roster bonus rather than a signing
bonus _ they intended to use with Vinatieri to make it impossible
for New England to match. Roster bonuses count against this year's
salary cap while signing bonuses can be spread out for bookkeeping
purposes over the life of the contract, even if the money is paid
up front.

   Odd things can happen when you gather 300 college football
players to be poked, prodded, and examined by NFL teams. During the
recent scouting combine in Indianapolis, a Jets trainer was
examining the knees of a young prospect from Weber State whom he
knew little about. When asked how he thought he'd do in the draft,
the player responded that he just hoped to get a chance. So the
trainer then asked if he might like to come to the Jets and the kid
replied, ``Come on, I'd never play for the Jets.'' A bit taken
aback, the trainer asked why. ``Because my dad coaches the
Giants.'' The player was John Fassel, son of Giants head coach Jim
Fassel. He was a quarterback for three seasons but moved to wide
receiver last year and caught 16 passes for 197 yards and two
touchdowns. At best, he will be a late-round pick. Probably not by
the Jets . . . A name you will hear much about between now and the
draft on April 17 is McNeese State running back Cecil ``The
Diesel'' Collins. He is being perceived as the next Randy Moss, a
guy with a reputation for having problems off the field but a
battering ram on it. A college teammate of Collins now starting in
the NFL called him ``the best player I ever played with.''
Unfortunately, that former teammate also said, ``He's got a few
problems when he's not playing football.'' A few problems? He was
kicked off the Louisiana State team last June after being arrested
for unlawful entry into a woman's apartment, which is a felony. He
was indicted on that and misdemeanor battery charges. He
transferred to McNeese State so he could play last fall and lasted
two games, rushing for 117 yards and a touchdown before being
thrown off the team for possession of marijuana. So why is he such
a hot property? Because his talent may be second only to Ricky
Williams among available running backs. In the three full games he
played at LSU in 1997, Collins rushed for 172 yards vs. Mississippi
State, 232 and two touchdowns against Auburn, and 179 against Akron
on 20 carries. He was leading the nation with an 8.2-yard average
and 583 yards when he broke his leg in the next game against
Vanderbilt. When asked at the combine if the success of the
troubled Moss might convince teams to take a long look at him,
Collins said, ``You ain't lying. I've got to show them I'm not a
bad person. I'm a good person.'' Collins chose to run for the
scouts at the combine despite a hamstring injury he aggravated
taking a Cybex test in Indianapolis. He ripped off a 4.48 40 and
weighed in at a svelte 208. But if the Patriots are hoping Collins
will become the next Moss, they should consider this: For every
Moss, there are a dozen like Lawrence Phillips who bring their
baggage into the NFL instead of leaving it at the airport. Moss's
indiscretions had not resurfaced for two years when the Vikings
drafted him, and he went to a unique situation where both his
brother and a father figure (Cris Carter) were on hand to monitor
him. The Diesel went off the tracks twice just a year ago and would
have no such monitors here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone will grab Collins early, of course, because this is a
league of football players, not fine fellows. If you think
otherwise, consider that the Dolphins have been talking with
Martin, who was released by the Falcons after being indicted on
federal money laundering changes. Martin's father personally
appealed to Marino to talk with Johnson about the receiver, an
explosive ex-Dolphin who caught 66 passes for 1,181 yards and a
17.9-yard average last season. Johnson will not agree to give
Martin any up-front money since he could end up behind bars before
the season begins. But Martin's lawyer, Roy Black, will seek to
have the May 3 trial date postponed until after the '99 season; if
that happens, Johnson could sign Martin to an incentive-laden
contract . . . Hot unknown of the week? Peppi Zellner, a
6-foot-5-inch, 246-pound defensive end from Fort Valley State. He
ran a 4.68 40 and had a 35-inch vertical leap at the combine. He is
a versatile pass rusher who played football in 1996, basketball in
1997, and football again last fall . . . Troubled Hall of Fame
center Mike Webster was arrested twice last week for forging
prescriptions. Webster was getting Ritalin, a stimulant used to
treat hyperactive children with learning disorders. He had 18
prescriptions with forged doctor's signatures when he was arrested.
Sad story of a great player fallen . . . Al Davis never quits,
which is how he built the Raiders in their heyday. After having his
lawsuit against the NFL dismissed in federal court, Davis declared
it a victory and refiled in California state court still claiming
he controlled the lucrative Los Angeles market . . . It is still
believed that NFL owners will approve an expansion franchise for
Los Angeles at their annual meetings in Phoenix March 14-18,
despite the fact that no one there has a stadium plan or solid
political backing. That would be an injustice to Houston bidder Bob
McNair, who has followed every guideline given him by the league
and come up with a marvelous stadium proposal and the money to
finance it. But he has been privately assured he will land an
existing franchise soon enough from one of several teams with
stadium problems . . . Those meetings could be very contentious in
several other areas. Lions owner William Ford is irate at an effort
afoot to begin rotating the Thanksgiving Day games among all 31
teams instead of keeping one in Detroit. That's the tradition, and
anyone who grew up with the NFL knows it, but these guys don't give
a damn about tradition any more . . . The other problem is with
Howard Milstein's bid to buy the Redskins. A coterie of old owners
is trying to do for John Kent Cooke what his father wouldn't.
They're trying to save the Redskins for him. Problem is, the team
was left to a charitable trust that has to sell to the highest
bidder, and that's Milstein, not Cooke the Cheaper. Word is the
league will claim Milstein is leveraging too much of the purchase
price even though he has a $400 million line of credit from Societe
General Bank, which has helped finance six purchases of NFL teams.
Isn't he the same guy whose application fees the NFL took when they
approved him as a final bidder for the Browns, which was then the
highest sale in league history? You can bet that's a question
Milstein's lawyers will soon be asking Paul Tagliabue in
depositions if the NFL doesn't do the right thing by him. Tagliabue
is claiming the league never actually looked closely enough at his
finances to see if he could afford an $800 million bid. If not, was
it just taking his money and using him to drive up the price of the
Browns when he was not really a viable candidate? . . . Why do guys
like Patriots owner Bob Kraft want new stadiums? In Denver a seat
in a luxury box at Mile High Stadium cost between $262-$360 a game.
Seats in the new one go for $500-$821 a pop . . . The Bengals have
an interesting problem at quarterback. They paid Jeff Blake a
$500,000 roster bonus he was due last week, ensuring that he will
be back with the team and indicating that Neil O'Donnell won't be
after June 1. But the payment came two days after Blake called the
Bengals ``disloyal'' to him. Blake is still steaming about losing
his job to Boomer Esiason two years ago and O'Donnell last year,
and he was even angrier when he learned that Chancellor Media
Corp., which owns the radio broadcast rights to Bengal games,
offered to contribute $1 million to Esiason's charity to fight
cystic fibrosis if Esiason played for the Bengals this year.
Esiason declined, saying he was happy doing ``Monday Night
Football'' on ABC and a radio show in Cincinnati, but when Bengal
owner Mike Brown had an informal meeting with Esiason Feb. 23,
Blake got wind of it and was irked. Blake, 28, remains a vastly
talented quarterback who was the starter in 22 of Cincinnati's last
28 victories, but when he says, ``I can't trust anyone there,
there's no loyalty to me there,'' he's blinding himself to reality.
Head coach Bruce Coslet took Blake from the scrap heap and gave him
a second chance after the Jets released him, and Coslet stuck with
Blake far longer as a starter than anyone thought he should. The
fact is, Esiason came off the bench two years ago and played better
than Blake, so he won the job before retiring. Isn't that what
competition is about? If Blake doesn't like it, he should give back
the $500,000 . . . Jets quarterback Glenn Foley is due a $400,000
roster bonus March 15. If he gets it, he still could be cut after
June 1 for salary cap reasons . . . You'll hear a lot of talk about
whether the Browns will take Heisman Trophy winner Williams or
Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch with the first overall pick. Bet on
Couch. The Browns have built a solid line to protect him with
tackles Lomas Brown and Orlando Brown, center Wohlabaugh and left
guard Jim Pyne. Right guard will be a fight among ex-Patriot Scott
Rehberg, Ben Cavil, and 6-7, 315-pound Eric Bateman, who was signed
off the street recently. They have a veteran quarterback to start
with in Ty Detmer and know they can get running backs a lot easier
than quarterbacks. Palmer went to watch Syracuse quarterback
Donovan McNabb work out last week, and Williams now says he will
work out for Cleveland after refusing to do so at the combine. But
on Thursday, Palmer appeared with Couch at the Greater Cleveland
International Auto Show . . . Baltimore continues to work on a
trade for Detroit quarterback Scott Mitchell, but the Lions'
insistence on second- and third-round picks remains a problem. New
coach Brian Billick has said something has to give this week. If it
does, Jim Harbaugh could end up in San Diego in a three-cornered
deal . . . New Packers coach Ray Rhodes passed on a radio and TV
deal that would have earned him an additional $250,000 . . . The
Packers, by the way, made a solid move hiring Ken Herock away from
the Raiders to become director of college scouting. The Pack may
have lost a lot of free agents the past two years but hiring Herock
was a win for Ron Wolf . . . How fragile is a career as an NFL
quarterback? Consider this. Going into training camp this summer,
Arizona's Jake Plummer will be second in seniority to Troy Aikman
among NFC East quarterbacks, with new starters in Philadelphia and
Washington and likely a new one soon with the Giants after they
made erratic Kerry Collins the highest-paid player in team history
despite the fact that he had no competing offer in front of him.

TRIP TO MAJORS TARNISHED BY A MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Jackson Melian does not like to talk about the
night. What should he say? How do you explain coming upon a
terrible car accident and discovering that the two people killed in
it were your parents?
</P>
<P>
   It was warm and clear in the early morning hours last Aug. 28
and Melian, a 19-year-old who is expected to someday play the
outfield for the Yankees, was traveling with their Class A
Greensboro, N.C., minor league team from Columbia, S.C., to
Hickory, N.C. His parents and brother, who were visiting from
Venezuela, were driving a few miles head of the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   Melian was sleeping when the team bus slowed because of a wreck
just ahead on Interstate 77 in Charlotte. Lights flashed as the
groggy players looked out the window. A delivery truck had been
abandoned in the center lane because of engine trouble and a sports
utility vehicle had barreled into it at high speed. The driver and
a passenger had died instantly of massive head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   When the coaches and players on the bus noticed that the sports
utility vehicle had Florida license plates, they were apprehensive.
It was indeed the Melians' vehicle and the victims were Jackson's
father, Vicente Melian, 49, and mother, Jasmin Melian, 43.
Johnathan Melian, Jackson's 23-year-old brother, who was a
passenger in the front seat, survived. Jackson did not get off the
bus at the site of the accident. Seven months later, in an
interview at the Yankees' minor league camp last week, the pain of
that night was evident on his freckled face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to get over this,'' he said. ``But I know they
see me and see what I'm doing. I think they're proud because I'm
doing what they wanted me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident report from the Mecklenburg County Highway Patrol
indicated that Vicente, the driver, was going 80 miles an hour in a
55 mph zone. The vehicle left skid marks of 120 feet, hit the truck
at 58 mph and moved it 17 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get over this,'' Melian said. ``You're not going to
get over it ever. But this is what they wanted me to do. They
wanted to me play baseball in the major leagues and they wanted my
brother to be a lawyer, so we just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Melian has decorated his apartment here with several pictures of
his parents. He wears a gold chain with a pair of his mother's
earrings around his neck, never removing it. He smiled only to
describe how passionate a Yankee fan his father was, which
motivated him to arrive here almost two months early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Melian could pass for a high school fullback, based on his baby
face and the thickness of his legs and chest. In 1996, he was the
$1.6 million wonder boy, the young man from Venezuela who was given
the biggest signing bonus the Yankees had ever awarded an amateur.
Now, he seems more like a teen-ager trying to cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can really say to him and nothing you can
do,'' Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said. ``You pray
for him and his family. You wrap your arms around him as an
organization and help him make life's choices. You make sure you're
there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Melian was asked what he missed the most about not having
his parents, he looked down and said: ``Everything. I miss
everything. You don't hear anybody in the house. When you call,
there's nobody home. It's really everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rios, the director of Latin American operations for the
agent Scott Boras and the man Melian now calls his ``second
father,'' said more than 600 people flocked to the funeral services
for Vicente and Jasmin in Barcelona, Venezuela. There was so much
attention given to the deaths that the family had to hold a news
conference before the mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got into the room with Jackson and Johnathan
after the accident, I'll be honest with you, I told them I had no
answers,'' Rios said. ``I didn't know what to say, but we got down
on our knees and prayed. We asked God to give us the strength to
get through this. That's how we've handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three or four times a week, Jackson places a call to Johnathan,
a former minor leaguer with the Seattle Mariners and now a law
student in Venezuela. They discuss baseball, school and, of course,
their parents, consoling and counseling each other. They both live
in the off season in the condominium their parents owned.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson is talking about baseball, he is confident, even
borderline cocky. He proudly said he has gained 27 pounds _ ``all
muscle'' _ since the Yankees signed him, and at 6 feet 2 inches and
215 pounds, he said he was sure he would someday play for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I'm ready, I'll be there,'' said Melian, who batted
.255 with eight homers and 45 runs batted in and had 15 stolen
bases for Greensboro. ``They're watching me play and hoping I can
prove everything I'm supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said: ``He's got a demeanor that reeks of success. He's
got an aura. It's not cockiness. He just kind of lets you know he's
going to find a way to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Melian is still a baseball baby, a raw talent who strikes out
too much (120 times in 135 games) because he needs to learn how to
hit breaking pitches. He will start the season at Class A Tampa in
the Florida State League as the only teen-ager on the roster and
will probably spend the entire year there. Baseball is his
sanctuary.
</P>

   Three years ago, Melian visited Yankee Stadium and sat in the
first-base dugout with his father. Vicente wore a Yankee cap,
carried a video camera and Venezuelan flag and boasted how Jackson,
whom he named after Reggie Jackson, was destined to become a star
for the Yankees. Melian does not want to return to the stadium
again until he is there as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is something I'm going to have to talk about,''
Melian said. ``You can't put it behind you and change what
happened. There will be a time where I'll have to talk about it
even more. Maybe not now. Maybe later.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Melian looked away.

NICKLAUS TAKES FIRST STEPS IN COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Jack Nicklaus returned to Boston last Wednesday to visit
his doctor at New England Baptist Hospital and was advised that he
could discard the crutches he has been using since having hip
replacement surgery Jan. 27. He returned to South Florida Thursday
and followed son Gary in the opening round of the Doral Open,
walking with a cane and riding in a cart. He's on schedule for a
return to the game.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in 29 years that Nicklaus has missed the
Doral, and he won't play in the Masters next month after 40
straight appearances. He will go to Augusta National for the past
champions dinner, but won't stay for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go up some time in the afternoon,'' he said, ``go out and
take a ride around the golf course, go to the dinner, and come
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery Nicklaus had was experimental in that Dr. Benjamin
Bierbaum used a ceramic insert instead of a plastic one. The early
returns were positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing he was concerned about was unwanted bone
growth around the prosthesis, which would limit the range of
motion,'' said Nicklaus. ``He put the X-rays above and said, `Jack,
look at that. No bone growth.' I was clean as a whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically released me to do whatever I feel like I can do.
He took me off crutches and put me on a cane. He said when I can
walk straight and get my weight to where you feel you have good
balance, I can throw the cane away and start chipping, putting, and
swinging the golf club.''
</P>
<P>
   Inactivity has never been a Nicklaus trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had three exercise programs to do every day,'' he said.
``I don't have much time to do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, 59, stirred echoes of past glory when he shot himself
into contention at last year's Masters before finishing tied for
sixth. But he knew surgery was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't walk,'' he said. ``I couldn't do enough exercise to
get back to neutral. The doctor said the part that looked like it
had cartilage wasn't cartilage. It was all bone spurs, and the bone
spurs kept turning. I had a mess in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hurt when I was sleeping, so that was why I didn't
really rush into it. It wasn't that bad, but I couldn't do
anything. Then all of a sudden it became a quality-of-life issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The road back will be a slow one, perhaps slower than Nicklaus
realizes. He has said that he'd like to return for the Memorial
(June 3-6) at the course he designed outside his hometown of
Columbus in Dublin, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss playing golf,'' he said. ``Do I miss going out and
playing poorly? No. I enjoy going and playing well. I played nine
holes with Gary in December, and it was quite evident I wasn't
going to be able to play golf this year with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say I am ahead of schedule. The doctor told me I
couldn't hit a golf ball for three months. Now he's told me that
whenever I am stable on my leg, I can start swinging a golf club.
He said he didn't think I would make the Memorial. If I don't, I
don't. I'm not going to rush it.''
</P>
<P>
   So for now, his sporting participation was limited to throwing
out the first ball before an exhibition game between the Expos and
Mets Friday night at Jupiter Island. The urge to become active
again fires him from within.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman, who underwent surgery on his left shoulder
following a painful withdrawal at the Masters last April and this
weekend is playing in his first PGA Tour competition in nearly a
year, will oversee a complete rebuilding of the white course at
Doral.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to renovate,'' said Norman, ``and I said, `I won't
renovate it.' So they said, `Let's just blow it up and start all
over again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start renovating, you start opening up the closet
door and there are a lot of ghosts in there underneath the grounds.
So you have to redo irrigation, put in new drainage and a new
surface. You might as well do the golf course over. It's going to
cost the same amount of money if you're going to do all 18 holes.
They said, `Let's redo the whole thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are changes, too, at Augusta National, including the
growing of rough for the first time. Norman is not a big advocate
of the subtle renovations there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so much history,'' he said. ``I like to step up on
the tee and say, `Well, Gene Sarazen did this or Byron Nelson did
this' and feel the same piece of nostalgia and history under your
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   While noting that some of the classic courses all over the world
have changed _ including Royal Melbourne in his native Australia
and Doral's Blue Monster _ Norman added, ``It just blows my mind. I
just don't understand it. I guess I'm a bit more of a
traditionalist. I don't like to see that stuff happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said the game plan at Doral is to eliminate the rough
entirely and put in yellow coquina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be firm, but not waste bunkers,'' Norman said. ``If
you miss the fairways, you are in the coquina. If you look at the
Blue Monster, there are a lot of bunkers. They're huge. I want to
get away from that, get to smaller pot bunkers. It's going to look
different.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pat Horgan, who grew up in Newport, R.I., and went to the
University of Rhode Island on a football scholarship, was followed
in the second round at Doral by his brother, Harry, who was
paralyzed in an automobile accident more than a dozen years ago. It
was just the second time that Harry has followed his brother; the
accessibility of paved paths here made it possible for him to get
around. Harry heads up a program called Shake-A-Leg Miami that
helps people with disabilities participate in water sports ranging
from sailing to kayaking. The Golf Channel will air a special piece
on Pat and Harry Monday night at 7:30 p.m. It will be repeated at
11 and again in the 7-9 report on Tuesday morning . . . The World
Match Play Championship a week ago at La Costa in Carlsbad, Calif.,
undoubtedly hurt the field at Doral, where the only one of the top
seven players in the world rankings to show up was South African
Ernie Els, who lost in the opening round at La Costa. There is no
question the World Championships are going to hurt the smaller
tournaments; such things ultimately led to the demise of the
tournament at Pleasant Valley in Sutton, Mass. ``From a player's
standpoint, there are a lot of guys who can play out here,'' was
the assessment of Franklin Langham, who tied for the Doral lead
after the opening round. ``Maybe a lot of guys in the media or the
general public might know their names, but I guarantee if you look
at the winning score it's going to be a good score that wins. You
might argue the field isn't that deep, but you have 144 guys here
who can play.'' . . . The escalating cost of the Ryder Cup has some
news organizations gasping. The cost for a single room at the
designated media hotel, the Sheraton Boston, has risen to $236 per
night. The price at the media hotel for the Super Bowl in Miami two
months ago reportedly was almost $50 per night less _ at the peak
of tourist season . . . But there was a real ``bargain'' available
at Doral last Wednesday. During a rain delay in the pro-am, a man
identified by the Miami Herald as Walter Robinson apparently lifted
a bag of Orlimar Tri-Metal clubs from under a trailer and tried to
sell them for $5 apiece to multiple Doral Open champion Raymond
Floyd. Police arrested Robinson, who reportedly has a criminal
history that includes grand theft. The clubs were valued in the
range of $15,000 . . . The PGA Tour has entered into an arrangement
with IBM to apply technology to the week-to-week lives of the
players. It's called PGA Tour Links. Said Tour commissioner Tim
Finchem, ``We have over 18 players who have received a computer and
have been educated on the basics that will benefit the interaction
of a player with a tournament and our tournament organization.'' .
. . How's this for politeness? Chip Beck, who set himself up to
make just his third cut in his last 38 events by shooting a 71 in
Thursday's opening round, was talking to reporters when Fulton
Allem, who played in the group behind Beck, shouted, ``Why don't
you ask him why he's so slow?'' Beck had just shot his best round
in five years, and was limping on an ailing leg. ``Why do people
complain?'' he asked. ``They've got no idea what people go
through.'' This was reported in the Palm Beach Post by Craig Dolch.
For the record, Beck made the cut at 71-73_144, and Allem missed it
with 74-74_148.

   DAVENPORT, Fla. _ Boston sports fans are still annoyed about
Roger Clemens wearing a Yankees uniform. As I was leaving the Hub
Friday night, I told the ticket agent I was on my way to see Roger
pitch and the Delta man said, ``Clemens? I hope he gets in a fight
with Latrell Sprewell.''
</P>
<P>
   There should be some glee in New England Sunday because Clemens
made his Yankee debut Saturday and was rocked for seven hits and
three runs in three laborious innings against the hideous Kansas
City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that spring training means nothing, but Bostonians
can get a chuckle from the image of George Steinbrenner back in New
York, listening to Saturday's broadcast and lunging for his red
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   My baseball people wanted to make this deal? What's wrong with
them. Fire Cashman! Fire Costanza!
</P>
<P>
   I am a Boston sportswriter. I no longer have my own stars to
cover. I live vicariously by watching former Boston stars on other
teams. And so while the Red Sox played spring training games in
Sarasota and Tampa, I was at Baseball City Stadium watching Roger
pitch for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 4, which connects Orlando and Tampa, was backed up
for several miles one hour before the game. Some of the traffic no
doubt was bound for Disney World, but there were many New York
plates in the parking lot at Baseball City. This was the first
Royals spring sellout since 1990, when the Red Sox played KC. Club
officials could not determine whether Clemens was on the mound for
that game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket was visible during batting practice, stretching and
hanging out in the left-field area. He stopped to chat with
legendary Kansas City groundskeeper George Toma, then ducked into
the dugout runway. He said he had no time to talk before the game.
Even in the relaxed setting of ``Baseball City,'' Roger has to put
on his game face.
</P>
<P>
   Under the watchful eye of pitching coach (and manager for the
day) Mel Stottlemyre, Clemens warmed up on the bullpen mound
outside the left-field foul line. Fans gathered on the grassy knoll
behind the fence, and no fewer than 15 photographers shot the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees went out in the top of the first (many scouts,
including Boston's Frank Malzone and Lee Thomas, were on hand to
see Kansas City's Kevin Appier and Jeff King), Clemens took the
hill and the phalanx of photographers went to the backstop to
record the moment. Jorge Posada was the Yankee catcher and umpire
Gary Cederstrom was behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran led off and went out on a dribbler in front of
the plate. Joe Randa followed with a bloop single to right. Johnny
Damon flied to shallow center, but Randa took second on a wild
pitch and scored on a single to left by King (who would look good
in a Boston uniform). Jeff Conine reached on an infield single in
the hole, then Jeremy Giambi fanned on a 1-and-2 high heater.
Clemens threw 20 pitches in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Kreuter led off the second with a bloop double to left.
Clemens probably hadn't planned on pitching from the stretch so
much against the faceless, talent-starved Royals. Carlos Febles hit
one off the end of his bat for an RBI double to right. Then Rey
Sanchez hit a seeing-eye single up the middle and it was 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens finally got an out when Beltran grounded into a
fielder's choice. The Rocket got Randa on a fly to right, then
fanned Damon on a breaking ball to stop the bleeding. He was up to
41 pitches after two innings.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the third, Conine drilled a double off the wall
in left-center. Clemens struck out Giambi and Krueter to end his
first Yankee outing. He threw 58 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good,'' he said, before going on his traditional
post-spring-training-outing jog. ``I don't feel too winded. I was
glad to get the first one under way. It was nice. Jorge did a good
job blocking the plate. I had some forkers in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in a little better focus in the third inning. Being in a
new environment, I have a tendency to want to do more and
overthrow. Mel reminded me, `Don't try and turn it loose yet.' It
was good. I didn't see and hear a whole lot today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket is comfortable in such a vacuum. He's at his best
when he tunes out his environment. Was he bothered by the hail of
hits and runs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``My location is what matters. I'd like
to be able to get ahead more. But I wasn't going to try to knock
the bats out of too many guys' hands.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed comfortable wearing that Yankee cap. It still looks to
me like seeing Michael Jordan in a Laker uniform. I asked him about
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty used to it,'' he said. ``Ever since the first
couple of days in camp. It's where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where he is. Roger Clemens is a Yankee now. Every day.
And back in Boston, we'll be watching his every move.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn and the Anaheim Angels open at home against the
Indians on Tuesday, April 6. I'll be in California to see Mo.
Better there than in Kansas City watching the boring Red Sox
against the boring Royals.

CELTICS ARE ON THE MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ You won't see the Celtics in the flesh for a while.
Rick Pitino and his .500 team open a five-game road trip here
Sunday afternoon in the new Air Canada Centre. The trip ends a week
from Sunday in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there's a Southern swing to Charlotte and Atlanta
and a meeting with the Pistons at the Palace. It's a schedule only
a pilot could love, but, aside from the quirky travel, the games
represent a chance for the Celtics to not only stay alive, but
maybe even exhale.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five games, the first three are against teams that are
struggling. The last two stops are the toughest _ they always are
on long trips _ with the Pacers standing as, on paper anyway, the
toughest assignment. (Then again, Indy lost at home Friday night to
Golden State, so all bets are off.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can stay afloat for the rest of the month,'' Pitino said
after Friday's 102-94 victory over Denver at the FleetCenter,
``then we come back and have a lot of home games in April.'' In
other words, the Celtics need to simply remain in the picture until
April and May, when they have 14 of their last 21 at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics should need no motivational speeches for Sunday
afternoon's game against the Raptors. All Pitino needs to do is
replay the tape from the season opener, when Toronto manhandled the
Celtics and took a 103-92 victory in the FleetCenter. Pitino said
that after that loss, he never felt more disappointed in all his
years of coaching.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors are coming off a tough home loss to Orlando and are
not the automatic ``W'' they were last year. Still, as Antoine
Walker noted, ``It's really important that we get that first one
and get off to a good start on this trip. We haven't played that
well on the road, so we need to establish something right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are healthy for the first time in a while. Pitino
has his rotation pretty well set, using the ``Bomb Squad'' to come
in, harass, and wear down the opponent and then have his starters
feast on the leftovers. But the team is struggling on defense and
the Raptors present an inside challenge with Charles Oakley, Kevin
Willis, and, if he's used, Michael Stewart. But it's a game the
Celtics have every right to expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick look at the rest of the trip. The Celtics won't
play in the FleetCenter again until they host the vaunted Clippers
on March 17, St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday at Charlotte: Until Anthony Mason and Glen Rice went
down, this looked like a tough one. But the Hornets are a mess;
their owner is moving, their coach feels unappreciated, and it's
all showing on the court. Derrick Coleman sat out Friday's loss to
Washington; who knows if he'll decide to go? Rice is all but headed
to the Lakers. The Celtics should win this one.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday at Atlanta: The Hawks have been a disappointment
lately, but now have their main man (Steve Smith) back. They play
defense when they want to and will be a good test for the Celtics,
who will have a day to prepare. Atlanta has the personnel to be one
of the better teams in the East when healthy. This also is the day
of the trading deadline, so if the Celtics bottom out in Toronto
and Charlotte, well, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Friday at Detroit: The Pistons won't forget the last Boston
visit, when Dontae Jones led a fourth-quarter rally and Walker hit
the winner and strutted around the Palace thumping his chest.
Detroit has been up and down as well, but still has firepower and
will be catching the Celtics on the second end of back-to-back
games.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at Indiana: The Celtics' first meeting with the Pacers
and Larry Bird this season. They played Indy tough last year, even
in going winless, and should do the same this year. The Celtics
should not be too pooped and Indy is a decidedly un-athletic team.
Regardless of how things have gone to this point, a victory here
would be a terrific way to end the trip.

NOT ROUTINE START FOR MARTINEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Pedro Martinez doesn't eat hamburgers anymore.
He had his fill in Great Falls, Mont., his first year in pro ball,
when his limited English kept him from ordering much else on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   For a while last spring, Martinez drank only milk and took
protein supplements, after a frightening stomach disorder sapped
him of strength for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He was happy to report Saturday that back home in his native
Dominican Republic this winter, his diet was ideal: plenty of
steamed rice and vegetables, seafood and chicken, enough to pack an
additional 8 pounds on his flyweight's frame.
</P>
<P>
   He's feeling strong, even more so after not throwing this winter
for the first time since he has been playing pro ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Jimy's idea,'' Martinez said, referring to manager Jimy
Williams, ``and I decided to follow Jimy's advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez pitched 240 innings last season, including his seven
innings against the Indians in Game 1 of the playoffs. Throw in
another 20-plus innings in spring training, and Martinez's workload
exceeded 260 innings. A break was in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy told me he wanted me to start here like everybody else,''
Martinez said. ``Take the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Martinez is being counted on to be the staff ace at
least through 2003, it's obviously in the Red Sox' interests to
take the long view. Especially when they have $75 million tied up
in preserving him.
</P>
<P>
   The only downside, if it can be called that, is that Martinez
usually is sharp from the first moment he takes the mound in spring
training. That wasn't the case Saturday in Boston's 6-4 loss to
Cincinnati, when his first spring start was terminated after just
one inning. Martinez threw 46 pitches, nearly half a normal game's
work for him, walked three, forgot to cover first base, and gave up
four runs on just one hit. Nomar Garciaparra's two-run fielding
error added to Martinez's agony.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa, another Sox squad beat the Yankees, 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worthless,'' Martinez said. ``Coming so far for just one
inning. I should have settled down, but I just didn't feel right.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute bus ride from Fort Myers wasn't a total waste of
fuel. One scout said Martinez was throwing consistently in the
mid-90s, topping out at 97. Another had him even higher on his
radar gun: 96-98 consistently, maxing out at 99 on one pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blanked,'' Martinez said of his outing. ``I was thinking too
much. I was just lost. I didn't feel my mechanics were right. My
arm is really strong, but I couldn't find anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said that this in essence was a
makeup session for the round of batting practice Martinez missed by
reporting a couple days after camp opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the same number of pitches he would have in a BP,''
Kerrigan said. ``Today was all fastballs and changeups. He's not
trusting his curveball yet. But it will all come when we get him
back on the right schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat misleading, too, Kerrigan said, to suggest that
Martinez took the winter off. He may not have thrown off a mound
three times a week as he usually does, but he and his brother Ramon
worked on a long-toss program with their personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he needed to rest and recoup,'' Kerrigan said. ``He's
had three years in a row where he's thrown over 200 innings, and
been the No. 1 starter on his staff. He's just out of whack right
now, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez reminded his questioners that it takes little to make a
pitcher appear out of sorts. ``There are small things we do with
our legs and shoulders that cause us to make a pitch differently
than we want to,'' he said. ``You almost have to be a pitcher
yourself to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered no excuse for his failure to cover first base on what
could have been a double play started by first baseman Bob Hamelin.
It wasn't until Garciaparra had taken the throw at second that he
remembered to break for the bag.

   MIAMI _ It seemed for a time that Floridian Greg Kraft might run
away and hide. After building his lead to three shots in Saturday's
third round of the Doral-Ryder Open, he came back to earth briefly
but wavered just once as those in pursuit were unable to sustain a
serious charge.
</P>
<P>
   When Kraft lagged a putt from the back fringe of the 18th green
to tap-in length, it gave him a 70_205 aggregate and a two-shot
advantage over Ernie Els (70) and Glen Day (67) in a $3 million
tournament whose field took a hit because of the last week's World
Match Play Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The mere presence of Els, who has won the US Open twice in the
past five years and is the only one of the world's top seven
players here, sets up Sunday's final round. Els birdied the 16th
and 18th holes on a day that saw major challenger Scott Dunlap find
the water on 18 and take a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap still finished three shots astern at 69_208, where he was
eventually joined by Andy Bean, who made a remarkable recovery out
of a trap on the 18th and coaxed in his putt to save par.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might have been the greatest par I've ever seen in my
life,'' said playing partner Pat Horgan of Newport, R.I., whose
71_210 tied him with Ocean State compatriot Billy Andrade (68).
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, whose best finishes in eight years on the PGA Tour are a
pair of seconds, started with a birdie when he hit a 3-wood out of
a fairway bunker on the par-5 and eventually made a 4-foot putt.
After eight straight pars, he made birdies on the 10th (two putts)
and 11th (8-iron, 10 feet) to widen his lead to three before taking
a bogey on the 14th out of a fairway bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I did make a bogey, I figured I was still leading the
tournament,'' said Kraft. ``I hope I regain a little of the magic I
had the first two days. The first part of the round was a bit of a
struggle. I was kind of in a little funk but I finally settled into
a thought that really seemed to work and I played pretty good the
rest of the way in.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, who won the Nissan Open two weeks ago at Riviera before
bowing out of the match-play competition in the opening round, had
an erratic round that included four bogeys and six birdies. The
birdies on the 16th and 18th brought him into contention for his
second win of the year in just his second medal-play event.
</P>
<P>
   Day, who has earned the nickname ``All'' because of his slow
play, had birdies on the fifth (wedge, 7 feet), seventh (8-iron, 15
feet), and eighth (wedge, 20 feet) on the front side. He proceeded
to birdie the 10th with two putts from 40 feet and the 15th
(8-iron, 3 feet) to put him in position to win his first tournament
since joining the Tour in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every tournament I tee up is a ripe opportunity,'' said Day.
``I am trying to win, so I don't care what it is or where it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've practiced every day, and I usually don't hit balls after
I finish. I think I found something in my swing. I can't put a
finger on it. I just played smart and made some putts today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean, who turns 46 Saturday and who hasn't won since the Byron
Nelson in 1986, is the gallery favorite and delighted the crowd at
18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the better shots and maybe one of the more
questionable shots I have ever hit,'' he said. ``I hit to the right
and hit the cart path. I had a lie that there was really no way I
could pitch it out to the fairway. Luckily my ball never left the
flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrade shot himself into contention with a bogey-free round. He
started with a two-putt birdie and added birdies on the ninth
(6-iron, 5 feet), 15th (8-iron, 5 feet), and 16th (sand wedge, 5
feet).

MALONE FEELS FOR HIS OLD BOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Since pitcher Kevin Brown signed with the
Dodgers in December, club general manager Kevin Malone has been the
target of biting criticism throughout baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's been able to endure that, but what he doesn't
particularly care for is the treatment Montreal Expos president and
general partner Claude Brochu is receiving in the wake of the
Expos' possible defection from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Minority owners and possible investors have called Brochu an
``obstacle'' in the team's possible sale and said he didn't believe
in baseball in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they're doing to Claude Brochu is
unconscionable,'' Malone said before the Mets and Dodgers played
Saturday. ``Claude is a good man. He's done everything possible to
keep the club there. For the people of Montreal to take shots at
Claude Brochu is unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly close to Malone's heart since he spent
four years in Montreal, two as the Expos' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brochu) has been the baseball savior in Montreal,'' Malone
said. ``Claude represents the Expos. He's a battler, a survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   To backtrack, Canadian officials said public funds wouldn't be
used to pay for a $225 million downtown ballpark, which is hurting
efforts to keep the team in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball granted a 150-day bargaining window in
which club chairman of the board Jacques Menard could find an
investor or investment group interested in keeping the Expos in
Montreal. That window expired Saturday, meaning Brochu would resume
control of the club. But Menard was looking for an extension from
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, groups from Charlotte, N.C., Washington, D.C., and
Northern Virginia have expressed interest in luring the Expos,
among baseball's poorest teams. Montreal has lost Moises Alou,
Larry Walker and John Wetteland to either trades or free agency in
an effort to cut payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone needs to help out,'' Malone said. ``They've dismantled
championship clubs to keep that club in Montreal. If they're not
going to support Claude Brochu, they should look for a new home.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw leaves team: Closer Jeff Shaw came to Dodgertown on
Wednesday and by late Saturday morning was heading back to
Washington Court House, Ohio, to be with his wife, Julie, as the
couple prepares for the birth of their third child.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dodgers officials, Shaw said his wife's water broke
Saturday morning and he was hoping to make it home in time for the
birth. Shaw's expected to return to Dodgertown a few days after the
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley to DH: Perhaps more of the excitement will be for
today's ``B'' game against the Mets at Dodgertown rather than the
main attraction. Manager Davey Johnson said catcher Todd Hundley
will play for the first time, though it will be as the designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Hundley could catch his first game of the spring
later in the week, but for now the Dodgers are content with
allowing him to work on his throwing mechanics instead of catch
games.
</P>
<P>
   For the seven-millionth time this spring, the Dodgers said there
is nothing wrong with Hundley's reconstructed elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Roster cuts: The Dodgers sent infielder Damian Rolls,
outfielders Glenn Davis and Bubba Crosby and catchers Casey Snow
and Will McCrotty to their minor-league camp.

 &HT;    Change of luck aim for some
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In a city that's certainly not short on luck,
today's Las Vegas 400 offers several NASCAR drivers an opportunity
to change their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skinner and Michael Waltrip are both seeking an elusive
first career victory, while unknown driver Tom Hubert hopes to
parlay his fourth Winston Cup race into a full-time ride on the
circuit. Ricky Craven, who has battled injuries the past three
seasons, is looking to revive his career.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who has a tenuous 29-point lead in the Cup standings
after two races, is searching for his first victory in 79 career
starts. He'll start inside the third row today and could have his
best shot at becoming NASCAR's newest first-time winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the odds are better on the guys who win every week,
but I think this team is going to win a race,'' said Skinner, one
of only two drivers to post consecutive top-10 finishes this year.
``I would never bet on me because I think it's bad luck, but I
don't think I would be a guy who would bet against it, either. It
might be the place where we can get our first points victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who will drive the No. 31 Chevrolet he used to win last
year's exhibition in Japan, is one of four drivers in General
Motors cars that will start in the top five starting positions.
Bobby Labonte is on the pole in the No. 18 Pontiac, with Waltrip
and Joe Nemecheck starting second and third in Chevys.
</P>
<P>
   The only Ford driver in the top five is Hubert, a road-course
specialist from California. Hubert, 34, usually spends his Sundays
as a rear-tire changer in the pits, but today he'll be starting
fourth in his first start on an oval track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road racing has gotten me rides, but we need to get that
off our backs and show we can do it everywhere,'' Hubert said.
``We're hoping this will get it rolling into a full deal. I haven't
run but a handful of races, so it would be interesting to get in a
weekly situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford dominated last year's inaugural Cup event at Las Vegas
Motor Speedway, placing 13 cars in the top 14 finishers. Before the
season-finale at Atlanta last year, NASCAR officials changed the
spoiler and front-valence heights of the new Tauruses to curb their
apparent aerodynamic advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Fords led 413 of 593 laps this year, however, and placed six
cars in the top 10 starting positions for today's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fords still have a little bit of an advantage, and the
Pontiacs looked real good, too,'' said two-time defending Cup
champion Jeff Gordon, who will start 11th. ``When I look at it, our
odds aren't that great here. I certainly wouldn't be putting money
on me.... I just know I'm not the best one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who won the season-opening Daytona 500 and then fell to
a 39th-place finish at Rockingham after engine failure, still is in
a better position than Dale Earnhardt and Rusty Wallace, who both
needed provisionals to qualify and will start in the 19th row.

 &HT;    Breakout: Jones earns first start
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ After a forgettable start to his Winston Cup career,
rookie Buckshot Jones of Tucker finally has something to smile
about.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a University of Georgia grad, qualified for today's Las
Vegas 400 after failing to make the 43-car field for the season's
first two events.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 28, stood on Friday's first-round qualifying speed of
167.297 mph, which was 35th-fastest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to make the race,'' Jones said. ``My dad
(Buckshot Racing owner Billy Jones) is all pumped up. You miss the
first two races and you come down hard. I wouldn't care if I was
starting dead last. It doesn't matter where you start, you're in
the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' team struggled with aerodynamics and suspension on the
No. 00 Pontiac at Daytona and Rockingham. They've been getting
advice on setups from various teams, including Hendrick
Motorsports, which fields Jeff Gordon's Winston Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to run every lap and finish the race,'' Jones said.
``It's not going to pay to go out there and and try to go to the
front right off the bat. There's going to be some good cars back
there with me. I'll be doing a lot of learning.''
</P>
<P>
   GOLDBERG AT ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   Pro wrestling star Bill Goldberg will be the grand marshal for
next week's Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500 at Atlanta Motor
Speedway. Goldberg, a former defensive lineman for the Atlanta
Falcons, apparently is an avid NASCAR fan.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILIAR NAMES OUT
</P>
<P>
   There were some familiar names on the DNQ list for today's race,
including Kyle Petty and Ted Musgrave. Petty qualified for all 33
races last year, and Musgrave made the field for the 32 events he
entered. But both drivers were left out at Las Vegas after veterans
Rusty Wallace and Dale Earnhardt used provisionals to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first for me,'' Musgrave said. ``It's very
disgusting. I just messed up on the qualifying. Who would ever
think that Rusty and Dale and all them guys would have to take
provisionals and kind of scarf them away from the guys down here?''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Stanton Barrett, making his first start in the No. 90
Ford, made the field on owner Junie Donlavey's provisional.

 &HT;    ACC's plea: No way it's 3
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Tradition means a lot in college basketball,
but will it be enough to get four ACC teams into the 1999 NCAA
Tournament? That's just one of the major questions that will be
answered today when the 64-team field is officially announced (6:30
p.m., CBS).
</P>
<P>
   The other major conferences appear to be in pretty good shape
heading into Selection Sunday. If Ole Miss (19-12) gets in, the SEC
will have six teams for the first time in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten, the nation's highest-rated conference, definitely
will get six and probably will get seven, with Minnesota (17-10)
and its power rating of 18 screaming to be included.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East will have a good day with a No.1 seed (UConn) and
two No. 2s (St. John's, Miami).
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 (five teams) and Pac-10 (four) should also be
satisfied at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But the ACC, which has been top-heavy with the likes of No. 1
Duke (31-1), No. 5 Maryland (26-5), and North Carolina (24-8), No.
9 in the power ratings and a winner over Maryland Saturday, has
been making its case all week that it deserves to get more than
three teams in the field. Every year since 1980, when more than two
teams from a conference could be invited, the ACC has had four or
more teams in the NCAA Tournament. Wake Forest (16-13) and N.C.
State (18-13) are the league's best hopes for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up trying to outguess those guys (selection committee)
after last year but playing in this conference has got to stand for
something,'' said Wake Forest coach Dave Odom, whose team lost to
N.C. State in Friday's second round of the ACC Tournament. ``If
we're the No. 2-rated conference in the country, how can we get
only get three teams in?''
</P>
<P>
   That, it appears, has been the ACC's strongest argument to the
NCAA Selection Committee this week. The Big Ten, the top-rated
conference, could get as many as seven teams if Minnesota slips in.
So how, the ACC asks, can there be such a big drop-off to second
place?
</P>
<P>
   As it does every year, the ACC compiled a wealth of information
to make its case for multiple bids and sent it to the committee,
which is meeting in Kansas City. A copy of that document was
obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Some of its points
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The ACC is the No. 2 conference in five computer rankings and
three schedule rankings.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ACC's top three teams are responsible for 33 losses among
the other six. Since a team's Division I winning percentage is 25
percent of the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI), one of the major
factors used by the committee, those losses figure significantly
into the RPIs of the other teams.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ACC, at 8-8, is the only conference to have a .500 or
better record against non-conference ranked teams. The Big East is
10-12, the Big Ten 9-11.
</P>
<P>
   _ At 94-23, the ACC has the nation's top winning percentage
(.803) against non-conference competition.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky athletics director C.M. Newton, the chair of the
selection committee, said last week that once the 30 automatic bids
are awarded, conference affiliation is not a factor in the process
of selecting at-large teams. Every team, Newton suggested, is
judged independently based on strength of schedule, power rating,
and how it finished the season.
</P>
<P>
   That argument is not flying here in ACC country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the object of the process is to pick the best 64 teams in
the country, you have to consider the caliber of competition inside
the conference,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams said.
</P>

BRUINS WON'T PLAY SPECULATION GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ UCLA's goal on this Selection Sunday is to avoid
Princeton _ not the team, the mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Bruins won the Pac-10 title by three games
and expected a seed in the West Regional. Instead, Arizona stayed
West and the Bruins were shipped to the Southeast Region, where
they faced Princeton in Indianapolis. Unable to shake the
disappointment, they played like a team deflated.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with a young team and an uncertain seed, the Bruins
are again vulnerable to the whims of the nine-man NCAA selection
committee, which has been sequestered in a Kansas City hotel room
since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so difficult to know what the committee will do,'' UCLA
coach Steve Lavin said. ``We can't allow ourselves to speculate and
get our expectations set on one thing and then face disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to expend a lot of energy giving it much
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   They're leaving the speculation to others, so let's go.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the primary ingredients _ power rating, record in the
last 10 games, performance against top-rated teams, strength of
nonconference schedule, road performance _ the Bruins probably will
be a No. 4 or 5 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's loss at Arizona, the Bruins were No. 17 in the
Sagarin poll, which is more accurate than the RPI but not identical
to the NCAA's ratings formula. That correlates to a No. 5 seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that's fairly accurate,'' a selection committee member
said earlier this week. ``They're a young team that's made a lot of
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins and Wildcats thought Saturday's winner would be a No.
3 seed. Although possible _ betting on the selection committee is
the quickest path to bankruptcy _ that seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats may have secured a No. 4 seed with the victory, but
they seemingly lack the power rating (18), road wins and
nonconference schedule to displace Utah, Ohio State, Kentucky,
Cincinnati, Stanford, Maryland, St. John's and Miami _ teams
fighting for No. 2 and 3 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the Bruins go? As the Pac-10 champ, Stanford probably
will remain in the West, and the NCAA loathes placing two highly
seeded teams from the same conference in the same region.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's seed should narrow its potential destination. Because No.
4s and 5s are paired with the No. 1 seed in each region, UCLA could
be shipped to Charlotte with No. 1 Duke, or to Milwaukee with No. 1
Michigan State, or to Indianapolis with likely-No. 1 Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to go East,'' guard Baron Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins should be more concerned with opponent than locale.
They have greater flexibility than last season, when they had no
bench and no size, but they often struggle against physical,
disciplined teams that force them to execute their half-court
offense: Princeton in 1996, Iowa State in 1997, and Miami last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Add center Dan Gadzuric's season-ending knee injury, and the
Bruins are also susceptible to size.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the ability to match up with any opponent other than a
real strong frontline,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA could face any of a dozen teams that fill the 12-14 seed
model, including Murray State, Penn, Kent, Southwest Missouri
State, Creighton, Alabama-Birmingham, Oklahoma, Delaware and, yes,
perhaps Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton, which failed to win the Ivy League title, is one team
the Bruins won't face _ at least on the court.

<P>
   The three Americans who were killed while on a mission to help
the Uwa people of Colombia had distinguished themselves in the
United States and in international organizations as passionate
defenders of the environment and of the rights of indigenous
people, associates said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Washinawatok, 41, of Brooklyn, began fighting for the
rights of American Indians as a teen-ager in her own backyard, on
the Menominee Reservation in Keshena, Wis., where her father was a
prominent tribal judge. From that springboard, she travelled to
dozens of countries as an advocate for women's and Indian causes.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Freitas, 24, a California native who had recently moved
to Brooklyn, had spent much of the last three years trying to focus
attention on the Uwa tribe's battle to preserve its land from oil
exploration. The Uwa ``considered him one of theirs,'' a friend
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii, chairwoman of the Pacific
Cultural Conservancy International, worked to bring educational
opportunities to indigenous people and recognition for her own
Polynesian culture. To shed light on that culture, she was writing
a book about her own roots in Hawaiian royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are so committed and courageous,'' said Laurie
Parise, executive director of the Rainforest Foundation U.S., a
10-year-old organization in New York City, who knew two of the
slain Americans. ``They knew the danger, but they still went down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok grew up on the Menominee Reservation, where a
tribal spiritual leader gave her the name Peqtaw Metamoh when she
was a child. It means Thunderbird Woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her whole life was about humanity, about respecting people's
ability to be who they are,'' said Apesanahkwat, the chairman of
the Menominee Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just a wonderful person, a mom and a sister and a
daughter, an Indian woman who epitomizes all those values that not
many people possess,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok was a co-chairwoman of the Indigenous Women's
Network and was active in forums sponsored by the United Nations
and other international groups on Indian and women's rights issues.
Since 1992, she was also a member of the board of directors of the
American Indian Community House in Manhattan. She worked for the
Fund of the Four Directions in Manhattan, a foundation that
supports Native American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok's advocacy work began early. At age 14, she helped
her father, James, organize on the reservation, and three years
later came to New York City as an intern with the International
Treaty Council, which monitored Indian rights in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Ali el Issa, her husband of 16 years and a former Rite Aid drug
store manager, said he last spoke with his wife a week before she
was kidnapped. ``I told her, if it's not safe, come back. Don't use
your sympathy, use your brain.'' El Issa said she responded, ``I
feel I am with my people, like I'm back on the reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has a son, Maehki, who is 14.
</P>
<P>
   Freitas, a graduate of the University of California at Santa
Cruz, was trained as an environmental biologist and worked in
various environmental law projects after college. His passion was
not for books and formulas, though. It was for the wild, said
Leslie Wirpsa, a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his natural habitat to be out in the woods,'' she said,
adding, ``His spirit is inextricably linked to the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Freitas had been involved with the Uwa fight to keep oil
companies from drilling on their land for nearly three years and
founded a group called the Uwa Defense Working Group, which he said
was dedicated to the principle of non-violent social change.
</P>
<P>
   He helped bring an Uwa tribal leader to California last year for
public debates with representatives of Occidental Oil and Gas
Corporation, the Bakersfield, Calif., company whose affiliate,
Occidental de Colombia, has been trying to explore for oil on and
near the Uwa lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Uwa considered him one of theirs,'' Wirpsa said. The
feeling was mutual. ``He was awestruck when he was in the Uwa
territory,'' she added. ``I remember when he showed us a slide _
red birds against a rich verdant green backdrop _ and you could
feel his heart jump when he showed that slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Melina Selverston, director of the Coalition for Amazonian
Peoples and their Environment, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group,
said Freitas had received death threats on his telephone answering
machine. She said they came from the right-wing paramilitary groups
that operate in the Arauca area of Colombia where the Americans
were abducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terence was a deeply, deeply committed young man,'' Ms.
Selverston added. ``He was the one person the Uwa trusted as a
connection to the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay, 39, was a native Hawaiian of Scottish, Mohawk and French
descent, with varied interests and talents. A photojournalist and
writer, she led delegations of indigenous Polynesians to various
international forums and was active in Hawaii in fighting for their
official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her work was her passion,'' John Livingstone, who described
himself as Gay's common-law husband, said in a telephone interview
from his parents' home in Connecticut. ``She dedicated her life to
indigenous causes and saving traditional cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiian elders had trained her in what Livingstone called
traditional anthropology, and she was using those skills to trace
the history of the royal family from which she was descended. She
was writing a book about her roots called The Ancestral Voices.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said that Ms. Gay understood the dangers of a trip to
the Uwa in Colombia, where she was exploring the possibility of
setting up an education program modeled on one she had established
in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took my heart,'' Livingstone said, sobbing. ``She was the
love of my life. She was just a phenomenal, beautiful person, and
it was a senseless brutal act.''

SPORTS COMMENTARY: SPRING STARTS WITH A SILENT STEINBRENNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAINES CITY, Fla. _ At another time, in an earlier season,
George Steinbrenner would have fumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy won how many Cy Young awards?'' the Yankees'
impatient owner might have blurted. ``Who did he pay off? We gave
up my good buddy David Wells for him? You know that was the general
manager's trade. I'm going to have to talk to that young man. He
might be a bright young executive, but he got snookered on this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner was not at Baseball City Stadium to watch Clemens
pitch his first game for the Yankees Saturday. He was not here to
see the Kansas City Royals pepper Clemens for three runs and six
hits in the first two innings. Even if he had been, though, the
owner most likely would not have expressed outrage that Brian
Cashman (acting strictly on his own, of course, wink, wink) had
traded Wells, the perfect-game pitcher and New York cult hero, for
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Steinbrenner has mellowed, but he has learned that
spring training is not a mandatory time for pitching perfectly and
winning daily. In his past, he had legendary blowups with Billy
Martin over that subject, and Martin was never able to get
Steinbrenner to understand that spring training, especially the
early exhibition games, is a time for players to get into pitching
and hitting shape for the season.
</P>
<P>
   On one March day years ago, Steinbrenner sat in the stands at
Pompano Beach, Fla., and watched Dennis Rasmussen give up three
home runs in the first two innings as the Texas Rangers hit routine
fly balls that the gusty wind carried over the fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbus, here we come,'' Steinbrenner said as he watched the
third home run, suggesting that the left-handed Rasmussen had
earned a ticket to the minor leagues. When that season ended,
Rasmussen, who never was exiled to Columbus, had been the team's
No. 1 pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens did not give up any home runs. Most of the seven hits
the Royals got against him in his three-inning outing weren't even
produced by hard-hit balls. Nevertheless Clemens said he had to
resist the temptation to turn it up a notch or two when he needed
outs with Royals on base.
</P>
<P>
   He has a tendency, Clemens said, to try to do too much too soon
when he ``a little anxious or the adrenaline is pumping a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would the ardrenalin be pumping in his first exhibition
game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the excitement and the first time being out there again,
just being in a new environment,'' he said. ``I'm always excited
about those situations each time I go out and I have a tendency to
want to do more and overthrow. It was good that Mel reminded me on
two or three occasions that today less is more. It doesn't matter
what happens, guys get on base or whatever. Don't try to turn it
loose just yet.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a mere exhibition game (the NFL arrogantly calls theirs
preseason games), but it offered an intriguingly symbolic matchup:
Clemens pitching for the Yankees for the first time and Kevin
Appier pitching for perhaps one of the last times for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the money game that was in play.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Clemens from the Toronto Blue Jays Feb. 18, the
Yankees expressed willingness _ eagerness _ to take on another big
salary that will grow much bigger when they give the superstar
pitcher a contract extension that will catapult him into the Kevin
Brown stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, on the other hand, are looking to trade Appier for
young players because they want to reduce their $26 million payroll
and Appier, with a $4.8 million salary, is their highest-paid
player. The Yankees' payroll is nearly three-and-a-half times the
sum the Royals are committed to paying at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The teams epitomize the difference between baseball's haves and
have nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we can get a player or two back for Appier and we
can take some of the money we save and put it into prospects,''
Herk Robinson, the Royals' general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   The stands were filled with fans, but 20 or more scouts were
here also. Those from the Cleveland Indians, the Boston Red Sox and
the Rangers were probably the most attentive because their teams
have been the ones that have expressed the most interest in dealing
for Appier if he shows he has made a complete comeback from
shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Royals would like to retain some semblance of
respectability that Appier gives them, economic reality takes
precedence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' Robinson said, ``we cranked our payroll from $25
million to $37 million. We finished third and won five more games
than the year before. We never realistically were competitive with
Cleveland, but it cost us about $2{ million a game. We can't afford
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``old days,'' Robinson said, the Royals' owner, Ewing
Kauffman, ``could write a check at the end of the season for 1, 2,
3, 4 million, which he unwillingly did. He didn't like it; he
considered it waste. But it put us on a pretty good par with
Toronto or the Yankees or whoever. Now you put another zero on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 70s and the start of the 80s, the Yankees and the
Royals seemed to play each other every October for the right to go
to the World Series. They haven't had any of those games recently
and aren't expected to in the future. Times change.
</P>
<P>
   But they also change for impetuous owners. That's why
Steinbrenner didn't call the press box at Baseball City Stadium
Friday screaming for scalps, Clemens' and Cashman's. &QL;

Longhorns might have won for losing
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the spectrum of possible scenarios, Texas'
losing to Oklahoma State on Saturday might have been the Longhorns'
safest, smartest option. Besides making them angry and therefore,
in theory, inspired for the Big Dance, it also bought them an extra
day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Although some extra shooting practice might be in order, too.
And ball-handling drills. Definitely lots of those.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns, their entire season a transition game, had
overachieved to a level sufficient to claim the regular-season Big
12 title, winning 13 of 16 starts. Their quarterfinal victory over
Colorado here in the postseason just-for-profits classic had
secured, beyond any smidgeon of doubt, their participation in the
NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   To stick around KC for another day given how their legs were
dragging would have been for aesthetics only, not pragmatic gain.
The Longhorns weren't going to beat Kansas in this arena anyway,
certainly not with their feet mired in cement.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, how many steaks can you eat?
</P>
<P>
   ``If going out now,'' coach Rick Barnes said, ``gives us a
better chance to win next weekend, then I'd much rather go out
now.''
</P>
<P>
   It does. With an eight-man depth chart and, in Barnes, a new
taskmaster who asks that defense be played on more than an optional
basis _ a fresh approach for the post-Penders Burnt Orange _ Texas
is flat-out tired. The Longhorns are also hurting, none more so
than Kris Clack, whose badly bruised buttocks Saturday made him
grimace with practically every step. At one point in the first
half, he took to riding an exercise bicycle behind the Longhorns
band to loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   Backcourt monkey business
</P>
<P>
   Barnes wore a pained look as well. No, his fanny felt fine. It
was his guards who were killing him. Although he bragged on
Oklahoma State's defense, which featured liberal use of a zone _
somewhere, Henry Iba was scowling _ he couldn't have been pleased
with DeJuan ``Chico'' Vazquez, Ivan Wagner and William Clay, his
Marx Brothers backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   They shot 4-for-19. They lost nine turnovers. They dished a mere
four assists. Each committed at least one glaring gaffe late that
cost UT a chance to tie the score or lead in a game the Longhorns
would barely lose 59-57.
</P>
<P>
   They've been the weak link all season, these guys. Texas' burly
front line can duke it out with anyone, even Duke. But the guard
corps, minus offseason defectors Luke Axtell (Kansas) and Bernard
Smith (Houston), is thin, thin, thin. On afternoons like
Saturday's, their names should be Chico, Groucho and Harpo.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with poor Kris Clank's 3-for-11 misfiring, the Longhorns
finished a dreary .333 from the field. Which, by the way, was what
the Cowboys shot. Oklahoma State missed 15 of its first 17 salvos
of the second half, yet amazingly never surrendered the precarious
six-point edge to which it had clung at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Ten times in the last 14 minutes UT had a possession on which it
could have tied the score or regained the upper hand. Ten times the
Longhorns failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our opportunities, plenty of them,'' Barnes said. ``We
just didn't capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Right down to the final scrum under the basket, Texas was trying
to kick open the door, to no avail. Adrian Peterson's bricking the
second of two free throws with nine seconds left afforded Wagner,
the recipient of Chris Mihm's crisp outlet pass, a long moment to
make amends for his failings, particularly a horrid cross-court
pass just a second earlier that forced Vazquez to foul Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   A scramble to the end
</P>
<P>
   It was a two-point game, and the basketball was Ivan's to do
with as he saw fit. Wagner had gone 1-for-5 from 3-point range and
accounted for five of the Longhorns' 19 turnovers. Nonetheless, all
would have been forgiven with a tying bucket at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to avoid being referred to by clever sportswriters in
today's editions as Ivan the Terrible, Wagner forged a relatively
clear lane to the hole, but his layup didn't come close to
dropping. It angled straight down off the rim, leaving Gabe
Muoneke, who had muscled into position for the rebound, with an
off-balance putback that had only a dumb-luck chance of going in.
</P>
<P>
   The clock died with Gabe flat on his back, his face contorted in
despair while the Cowboys danced in circles around him.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, it's better this way. OSU profited by winning,
securing its stutter-stepping NCAA Tournament quest, which helps
the Big 12 and thus Texas indirectly. Eddie Sutton, having not
forgotten how his team had been tabbed as the conference's
preseason favorite, was so thankful to be alive he heaped praise on
everyone, even calling the Longhorns good bets to make the Sweet
16.
</P>
<P>
   With an extra 24 hours at home to relax, reflect and recuperate,
perhaps they are. But Groucho, Harpo and Chico must first step
things up a bit.

NEW HAVEN'S HALFNIGHT MAKING SWEET MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAGUE NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ashlin Halfnight may play hockey for a living, but he
also proves two points: that music does not soothe the savage
beast, and that a musician can be a Beast.
</P>
<P>
   Halfnight is in his second professional season with the Beast of
New Haven in the American Hockey League, though as his 30 penalty
minutes in 50 games indicate, he is far from savage. But as his
teammates and fans at New Haven Coliseum have discovered, the
defenseman is quite adept at performing with a guitar as well as a
hockey stick.
</P>
<P>
   The former Harvard captain and current property of the Carolina
Hurricanes has released a compact disc titled ``Loose Ends,'' and
the original five-song CD has become minor league hockey's version
of a hit record, selling out its first 2,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey plus music usually stirs up thoughts of ``We Are the
Champions,'' the theme song from Hockey Night In Canada, or the
``Chicken Dance,'' which makes the popularity of Halfnight's CD a
bit unexpected, given its acoustic guitar base and plaintive titles
such as ``Next To Nothing'' and ``Blue Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfnight, who wrote and sings each song, had no expectations
that he would ever sell more than a handful of recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was a vanity thing,'' said Halfnight, who recorded
several of the songs last offseason near his Toronto home and
concluded the project in a West Haven, Conn., studio. ``I just
wanted to get it finished before Christmas and give it to my
friends and family as a present.''
</P>
<P>
   He had only 50 copies made originally, but after they were
dispersed, he decided to try to market the disc, with $6 from each
$10 sale going to Saint Francis Home For Children, one of his
charities in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Sales took off at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really kind of weird,'' said Halfnight, whose only formal
music training came in the form of piano lessons as a youth. ``What
I thought was a little thing has really snowballed. It's beyond my
wildest dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Major League Soccer star Alexi Lalas, who takes his music
very seriously, have some competition down the road? Halfnight
doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a lot in college, but nothing public,'' he said. ``It
was a private thing, a tension release. It was with roommates and
friends, very informal. It's really just a hobby and something I
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfnight's younger brothers Drew (a contributor to the CD) and
Chris are also involved in music, but he assures: ``It's not going
to be the Partridge Family or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much hand-wringing (by purists) and fanfare (by the leagues)
accompanied the AHL's decision _ as strongly suggested by the NHL _
to adopt an experimental four-on-four format during its five-minute
overtime periods. The test was designed to see if opening up the
ice would lead to more scoring, and therefore fewer ties. After the
first week and a half, the NHL is getting what it was looking for.
While only 33 percent of games were decided prior to the
four-on-four system, a healthy 64 percent have been recorded as a
win or loss under it. Shots are up by more than 50 percent, and the
average length of overtime has been shaved by a minute and a half
to 2:49 . . . Scoring certainly wasn't a problem for Lars
Pettersen, who netted five goals in a third-period span of 16:01
for Augusta of the East Coast Hockey League last month. However,
Pettersen's splurge began when the Lynx trailed, 7-1, and they
wound up losing, 7-6, to Birmingham. Sam Ftorek, the son of Devils
coach Robbie and a former St. Anselm player, drew assists on four
of Pettersen's goals . . . Pat Egan, a former Bruins defenseman and
color announcer, heads up the list of four new inductees to the
Springfield Hockey Hall of Fame next Saturday at the Civic Center.
Former Indians Bruce Cline, Gerry Foley, and Keith Allen (the
latter of whom helped build the Philadelphia Flyers into a power in
the 1970s) are the other honorees. Gerry Cheevers will deliver the
dinner speech; for more information call 413-739-3344.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Providence's wondrous season threatened to hit a pothole last
week when the Bruins bought goalie Jim Carey out of his contract,
but the Baby B's have stayed on course. It helps to have a John
Grahame handy; the second-year pro, who was splitting time with
Carey, set a franchise record for wins in a season with his 26th
early last week, and when he beat New Haven Friday, it was his 18th
consecutive victory, an AHL record. Grahame's new partner, Joaquin
Gage, whom the Baby B's signed after he was released from a tryout
deal with Portland, debuted with 36 saves in a 3-1 loss to Lowell
last weekend . . . The Lock Monsters and their wives are holding a
dinner to benefit the Angel Fund, which aids in research for Lou
Gehrig's Disease. Bernice Rowe, the wife of general manager Tom
Rowe, and Carrie Jackson are co-chairs of the event, to be held
March 17 at the Andover Marriott. Call 978-458-7825 for details.

   Injuries and recalls sometimes result in manpower shortages in
the minors, and some teams find what can charitably be termed
``nostalgic ways'' to fill the gaps. It wasn't a ``turn back the
clock'' night, but there was Ron Duguay skating his lane for
Jacksonville in an ECHL game last month. The presence of the
erstwhile New York Ranger did more to hurt than help the Lizard
Kings, who had to forfeit when it was discovered that Duguay's
presence put them one veteran (200 pro games or more) over the
league limit. But maybe they shouldn't have lost the 2 points:
Doesn't a 41-year-old qualify for another category, such as super
veteran? . . . Defenseman Gaston Gingras suited up for a couple of
Chesapeake games this season and is expected to play more to become
eligible for the ECHL playoffs. Gingras, 39, already made a
comeback three years ago in the AHL after six years in Europe; this
time, he's playing for former Montreal teammate Chris Nilan . . .
Dennis Maruk, a 60-goal scorer for Washington in 1981-82, has
signed a five-game tryout deal with Lake Charles (Western Pro
Hockey League). He's a mere 43 . . . Andy Moog is coaching Fort
Worth (WPHL) while its regular coach fills in as a player . . .
Logo of the Week: For six years, The Hockey News's rankings of
logos have been eagerly anticipated by fans and front offices. The
bottom ranking is as coveted as the top spot, since marketing a
team as either worst or first is an easy sell. This time, The
Hockey News judged the ECHL's Mobile Mysticks most egregious. A
dragon wrapped around a hockey stick with blades at both ends?
Judge for yourself.

 &HT;    2 boats carrying Haitians sink near Florida; 4 dead, others
missing
 &HT;    By Larry Hobbs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Two smuggling boats crowded with nearly
40 Haitian refugees sank 30 miles east of West Palm Beach early
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After saving three men between 5 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. and
confirming four people dead, the U.S. Coast Guard searched through
Saturday night for other survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials believe more than 30 people, who were
being smuggled here from the Bahamas, are unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The three who were rescued by search helicopters were brought to
hospitals in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Border Patrol agents believe all three men are Haitian
refugees, although they had not ruled out the possibility that one
of them may be a smuggler, said William Brett, senior Border Patrol
agent in West Palm Beach. The men are in their 30s, though
officials did not give their names.
</P>
<P>
   Two boats carrying 18 Haitian refugees each set out from the
west end of the Bahamas, the survivors told Border Patrol agents in
West Palm Beach, Coast Guard Petty Officer Jeff Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Both vessels were open boats, one 17 feet long and the other 20
feet long, Hall said. There were no life jackets on board either
boat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first boat had problems, the second boat came over to help
and unfortunately both boats sank,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   A passing freighter called the Coast Guard at about 2 a.m. after
hearing screams in the dark waters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard helicopter using night vision equipment rescued a
man waving a flashlight and clinging to a propane tank at 5 a.m.,
Lt. Ron Labrec said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing he had the flashlight _ it increased his
chances of being found,'' Labrec said.
</P>
<P>
   Another helicopter plucked the two other survivors out of the
water after a Coast Guard Falcon jet spotted them clinging to a
barrel at 8:30 a.m., Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, the Coast Guard cutter Matagorda recovered
two bodies in the water and witnessed two more bodies sink near
where the two men were rescued, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men were released to Border Patrol agents in West
Palm Beach and one man remained at Good Samaritan Medical Center in
stable condition, a nursing supervisor said.
</P>
<P>
   All three men will eventually be taken to Krome Detention Center
in Miami, Border Patrol agents said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, two Coast Guard helicopters searched north of
where the tragedy occurred, hoping to find survivors clinging to
buoyant debris in the Gulf Stream's swift northerly currents.
Officials planned to re-evaluate at midnight whether to continue or
call off the search.
</P>
<P>
   The search was expected to stretch as far north as Cape
Canaveral by 11 p.m. Saturday, considering the Gulf Stream's 5 mph
currents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We search for survivors,'' Hall said. ``There is a possibility
that someone is alive or we wouldn't be searching.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that from ``what the survivors told the Border Patrol,
it was a migrant smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally that many people don't get on a boat to cross in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees trying to reach U.S. shores with the help of smugglers
risk their lives every time, Labrec said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go in small boats that are overloaded and they don't have
the proper equipment,'' Labrec said. ``It makes for a pretty
dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of Cubans and Haitians taking to the seas have
increased since 1998, and experts expect the trend to continue in
1999. In 1998, Coast Guard vessels intercepted 1,025 Cubans and
1,206 Haitians at sea, compared with 406 Cubans and 587 Haitians in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, a 29-foot boat capsized in 6-foot high seas off
Elliott Key, some 22 miles south of Miami. Nine drowned and another
five passengers were lost at sea and presumed dead. Two of the nine
survivors are the accused smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier refugees who used flimsy rafts, the latest
arrivals often are smuggled across in boats loaded with large gas
tanks.

ALBANIANS AGREE TO DEAL ON KOSOVO, DOLE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Former senator Bob Dole declared Saturday that ethnic
Albanians will sign an agreement Sunday that would let them run
Kosovo, a development that would put immediate pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept NATO troops to police the
settlement or face possible airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here at the US Embassy, Dole said he had
promises from all of the leading ethnic Albanian factions
represented at the peace talks near Paris last month that they
would sign the agreement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although those talks broke up inconclusively, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright said the ethnic Albanians had agreed to the
settlement in principle but had insisted they could not sign it
until they consulted with supporters in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who has openly favored the ethnic Albanians in their
struggle for independence from the Milosevic regime, said the
Albanian delegation will sign the agreement Sunday in Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The US point man in Kosovo, Christopher Hill, chief author of
the settlement, will travel to Pristina to preside over the
signing, Dole said. Hill appeared with Dole at the news conference,
but as is his wont was more circumspect, stopping just short of
saying he was sure the Albanians would sign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the cautious Hill was optimistic, especially after
Adem Demaci, the uncompromising political leader of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, was pushed aside by Hashim Thaci, the
29-year-old KLA leader who emerged as the Albanian delegation's
leader at the peace talks in Rambouillet. Although he has helped
shape the KLA into a more dangerous insurgency, Thaci is considered
more pragmatic than Demaci.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, however, the KLA sent mixed signals Saturday. The KLA
commander Suleiman ``Commander Sultan'' Selimi told a crowd of
5,000 at a commemoration of a dead Albanian separatist that the
rebels would not accept a settlement without a guarantee of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No half-measures will be acceptable to the KLA nor any
solutions whose goal is not independence,'' said Selimi, who is a
close friend of Thaci, who last week unseated the hard-liner Demaci
as the political leader of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, however, said he was sure the Albanians would sign Sunday.
``I think they'll keep their word. ... That puts the pressure on
the Serbs,'' said Dole, who was dispatched to the Balkans by the
Clinton administration to put pressure on the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Dole is seen as so partisan toward the Albanians that Serb
authorities refused to give him a visa to enter Kosovo. Instead, he
met with Albanian leaders in neighboring Macedonia, where Hill is
the ambassador, and spoke with others by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said that if the Albanian negotiators sign the agreement
Sunday, he and other diplomats will turn their attention to getting
the Serbs to sign before the talks resume in Paris March 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Serbs can be brought around,'' said Hill,
sounding uncharacteristically optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   US officials have hinted that special envoy Richard Holbrooke,
who in October got Milosevic to pull back his troops in Kosovo and
avert NATO airstrikes, might be dispatched to Belgrade to try to
persuade Milosevic to drop his opposition to NATO troops in Kosovo.
Last month, Milosevic refused to see Hill, apparently judging him
not important enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said he had briefed Albright on the developments Saturday
after she arrived here for talks with British Foreign Minister
Robin Cook. Albright and Cook were supposed to meet for an hour at
his country estate in Kent, but the talks went on for some three
hours, mainly on trade, with officials emerging to say more
detailed negotiations were needed between Washington and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   American and British officials are locked in a dispute over a
trade war between the United States and the European Union over
bananas. Britain wants the United States to lift sanctions against
European imports, saying that at least 3,000 jobs in the cashmere,
cookie, and car battery industries are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Dole was dispatched here by the Clinton administration to
pressure the ethnic Albanians to accept the deal, despite their
reservations about its lacking a guarantee of a referendum on
independence. Because some 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
are ethnic Albanian, such a referendum would virtually guarantee a
vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
   But the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans _ the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia _ does not
favor Kosovo's independence and knows the only way Milosevic will
agree to the deal is if Kosovo remains part of Serbia, which with
Montenegro forms what is left of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have said they may consider Russian-led troops as part
of a peacekeeping operation in Kosovo. Russia has long been
Milosevic's only staunch ally.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said that while the Contact Group would consider a
diversified peacekeeping force, ``this is a package and a NATO-led
force is part of the package.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Albright, Hill, and Dole met here with NATO's top
official, General Wesley Clark.

KRAFT SEES WINNER'S TENT, BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Greg Kraft showed how determined he is to win. Andy Bean
showed that at age 45, he can still hit terrific shots. Ernie Els
showed how great players remain in contention when they are not at
their best. And Glen Day showed he plans to follow a strong 1998
with an even stronger 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up an intriguing final round, despite some unexpected
names at the top, Kraft shot a resourceful two-under-par 70
Saturday and held a two-stroke lead after the third round of the
Doral-Ryder Open. Kraft stood at 11-under 205 for the tournament,
two strokes ahead of Els and Day and three strokes ahead of Bean
and Scott Dunlap, a rookie on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for a marquee name to emerge as the winner on
Sunday may be disappointed, unless Els or Justin Leonard
(seven-under-par 209) rises to the forefront. But those looking for
an unpredictable finish may get their wish. Kraft showed
resourcefulness, escaping with the two-stroke lead with which he
began the day by dodging trouble on numerous occasions. For Kraft,
who has never won an official event on tour, it was an important
test. But Sunday, the test will be even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious, of course,'' said Kraft, a 34-year-old native of
Clearwater, Fla. ``I have led going into the last round probably
three or four times, so I've had to deal with it. I love being
here. I don't have a sense of urgency. But I want to play well
tomorrow. I didn't play as well as I wanted today, but I'm looking
for a little magic tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Bean, although he hit some magical shots Saturday to keep
his hopes for a storybook victory alive. Bean has won at Doral
three times (1977, '82 and '86), but he has not won on tour since
1986. With a sizable gallery urging him on, he hit two shots that
he will long remember: a 70-foot bunker shot on No. 14 that he made
for a birdie, and, on No. 18, a tremendous 3-iron from 205 yards
away _ after his tee shot had hit the cart path and bounced into a
bunker lining the No. 1 fairway _ that helped him save par. It has
been a long time since Bean has entered a Sunday in contention, and
he was enjoying the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the better shots I have ever hit,'' Bean said
of the bunker shot at No. 18 on the Blue Course at Doral Golf
Resort and Spa, one of the toughest holes in golf. ``I had a lie
such that there was really no way I could pitch it out to the
fairway. I couldn't go straight or sideways, but I could see the
flag. I figured, `Well, I might as well.' I'd rather mess up
playing aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bean's shot landed on the green, the crowd roared, as the
ball skidded by the pin and stopped about 40 feet past. Then Bean
almost made his next putt for birdie, a feat that would have really
rocked the house. After gladly tapping in for par, Bean looked
forward to Sunday, and he was encouraged that the hard work he has
put into his game had begun to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun out there, and it's a long time coming,'' said
Bean, who will turn 46 next month. ``I'm looking forward to teeing
it up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Els, but for different reasons. Because he is the star
attraction on the leader board, ranked No. 4 in the world and a
two-time U.S. Open winner, many expected Els to mount a charge
Saturday. He instead struggled to a two-under 70, including a 37 on
the front nine. Els went straight from the 18th hole to the driving
range, and he indicated later that he may have corrected a swing
flaw, which might help him Sunday. But he still wished he could
have had a second chance at Saturday's round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played like a guy who has never won a tournament,'' Els
said. ``I was the guy making mistakes. My experience helped,
scrambling, getting up and down, staying in contention. I didn't
play the way a guy who has won two U.S. Opens should play. But I
get another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Day, another player looking for his first tour victory, hoped to
capitalize on his chance as well. He shot a solid 67 Saturday, and
he looked like the player who had a career year in 1997, winning
more than $1.28 million to finish 26th on the tour's money list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stepped up a level last year, and I have to maintain that,''
Day said. ``I have a legitimate shot at the Ryder Cup team. I think
I need to win a couple of times to do that. It's up to me to show
that last year wasn't a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft knew that the tournament was far from over, and that on
Sunday someone else could emerge as the winner. But he liked his
position. ``I expect a guy like Ernie to make a charge,'' Kraft
said. ``I know someone is going to have a good round tomorrow, so
I'm going to have to have one myself.''

ANGELS HOPE PITCHERS SIMPLY DO THEIR JOBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ A Randy Johnson-Roger Clemens duel in late
September would have been something.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, however, barely missed out on signing Johnson, and
the Texas Rangers came within a whisker of trading for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll have to settle for Chuck Finley vs. John Burkett, or
Ken Hill vs. Rick Helling with the AL West up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case in the division known for the Mo Vaughns, Juan
Gonzalezes and Ken Griffeys, not the Steve Sparkses or Mark Clarks.
</P>
<P>
   While the Angels won't hesitate to admit their strength is a
lineup that has Vaughn, Darin Erstad, Tim Salmon and Jim Edmonds
among others, they are not exactly whining about lacking quality
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have choices,'' said new Angels pitching coach Dick Pole.
``We're not in a situation where we have to make a pitching staff
up. We've got guys competing for spots.... We've got people who
will !ital!compete &UR; !off! &LR; , and when you've got people who compete
like that, you have a good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Pole, who served as pitching coach for the Boston Red Sox in
1998 and was the San Francisco Giants' pitching coach from 1993-97,
was speaking about pitchers like Finley and Tim Belcher. At ages 36
and 37, respectively, both are past their prime. But both are known
for battling deep into the game, keeping their team close and
eating up innings over the course of a season.
</P>
<P>
   Health is always an issue, and when it comes to the Angels, the
most important health question involves Hill's surgically repaired
right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He missed 2{ months last year after having arthroscopic surgery
to remove bone chips, and wasn't at full strength when he returned
for the final month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Hill's the key,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``If
Ken Hill's arm is healthy, he will give us 200 innings, 200 quality
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why I don't worry about the bullpen. If the starters give
us what we anticipate they'll give us, the bullpen sets itself up.
They don't get overworked and stay in their roles.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case last year, when the starters completed only
three games. It took a toll on the bullpen late in the season.
Shigetoshi Hasegawa, counted on as a key set-up man this year,
pitched 971/3 innings last year, the most by a reliever in the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have Sparks penciled in as their No.4 starter, with
Omar Olivares, Jarrod Washburn and Jason Dickson in competition for
the fifth spot. Closer Troy Percival anchors the bullpen, and Rich
DeLucia joins Hasegawa as the primary set-up men. Mike Holtz will
be the situational lefty.
</P>
<P>
   Pole has his work cut out for him getting to know his pitchers,
but he has former pitching coach Marcel Lachemann, now the
organization's roving pitching instructor, helping with the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lach left a good legacy,'' Pole said. ``We think an awful lot
alike. He's been a big help, especially learning the personalities
of the pitchers. It's a good situation both ways. It's a learning
process from both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, also new to the team after signing a two-year, $10.2
million contract, said he likes what he sees in the Angels
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the old baseball adage says you never have enough
pitching,'' Belcher said. ``But I feel our pitching is as good if
not better than anybody in our division. It's equal to Texas, and I
think we have the edge in experience. They have (closer John)
Wetteland, we have Percival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle's got quality starters, but no Cy Young candidates.
Over the course of 162 games, I'll take our chances.''

CLEMENS MAKES DEBUT IN HIS FASHION, AND YANKEES LIKE HIS STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBA-COLUMN-CLEMENS) 
(js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Fla. _ Roger Clemens wore a Yankees uniform in a game
for the first time Saturday, and it felt normal to him. Everything
seemed as it should be, the pitcher said. Clemens was on a mound,
staring down hitters, under a scorching spring sun, in a Yankees
cap. ``There was nothing funny about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His final pitching line of this exhibition was a bit funny _ as
in odd. Kansas City scored three runs in three innings on seven
hits, most of them little loopers and slow rollers. But spring
training is for practice, not results, and Clemens felt he mostly
accomplished what he wanted to Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' he said. ``I felt really good. I don't feel
too winded.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, pounded in his first exhibition outing last year before
going on to win the Cy Young award, has had leg problems in spring
training in the past, and he worried that his first-game adrenaline
might push him to strain something. ``But I got through that with
my legs feeling strong,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his outing with the last of his four strikeouts,
whiffing Chad Kreuter with a split-fingered fastball in the dirt
and pumping a fist _ not in celebration, but as a compliment to
catcher Jorge Posada for calling the right pitch. Posada would say
later that Clemens sometimes yelled to him in support: ``That a
baby!''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional relationship between pitcher and catcher is like
that of horse and jockey. The catcher holds the reins, calls the
signals, guides the pitcher through the turns of each game,
hopefully to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens takes full control of each of his starts; the
catcher merely hangs on for the ride. Clemens calls all of his
pitches in the regular season, though how he does this is not
exactly clear _ maybe with a touch of his cap, his thigh, a brush
of his glove against his chest. One signal means he's throwing a
fastball, another a split-fingered fastball.
</P>
<P>
   This is very unusual, and perhaps only the best pitchers are in
a position to ask for that responsibility. Joe Girardi, the
Yankees' catcher, recalled that when he was with the Chicago Cubs,
Greg Maddux used to call his pitches from the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens gathers his intelligence on the Internet, looking for
information in baseball stories. Maybe a hitter will say he's
having trouble with the high fastball, or that he's struggling
against breaking balls. Clemens reads, absorbs, exploits. And he's
leery of counterintelligence: Darrin Fletcher, Toronto's catcher,
would flash three sets of signs at Clemens even when there were no
runners on second base _ just in case an enemy operative happened
to be spying from the bullpen, the stands or the press box in order
to relay information to the hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Even in spring training, Clemens approaches each start like a
military operation (Code name: VICTORY), everything timed to the
minute, always intense, devoted to the role of pitcher. Packing his
bag in the Yankees' Tampa clubhouse Saturday morning, Clemens'
wardrobe belied his Texas roots: black shoes, black shirt, blue
jeans and studded belt.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival at the Royals' complex was delayed slightly, because
Clemens, who drove with his wife rather than ride the team bus,
needed directions once he arrived at the park. He had to check with
the volunteers collecting $3 for parking. ``I'm Roger Clemens _
yeah, the pitcher _ and I need to know how to get to the Yankees'
clubhouse. ''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Powell, the strength and conditioning coordinator who
helped Clemens prepare for his outing Saturday, says he has never
seen anyone go through such a stringent pre-game routine.
``Nonstop,'' Powell said. ``He's a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   A machine, preset. Clemens went to the outfield to stretch at
11:25 a.m. He performed sprints and agility runs, each seemingly
designed to stretch a specific set of muscles, as well as leg lifts
and toe touches in rapid succession. Clemens is not fast, by any
means, but the power in his movement is omnipresent, Girardi
mentioned, like a Clydesdale. (David Cone, who once tried running
alongside Clemens, found the pace never waned and shortly had a
good view of Clemens' substantial backside moving off in the
distance.)
</P>
<P>
   Warming up in the bullpen, Clemens fretted aloud that he would
rush his delivery, perhaps injure himself; the pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre says he has rarely worked with anyone who knows himself
as well as Clemens does. ``And it's an education for me,''
Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Royals' Kevin Appier shut the Yankees out in the top
of the first, Clemens strode to the mound, and those fans who made
up the first sellout here in nine years noted his presence
immediately. Most cheered loudly, with some booing. In his 15th
major league season, Clemens is accustomed to playing the villain.
</P>
<P>
   When the Royals' leadoff hitter, Carlos Beltran, bounced
Clemens' second pitch of the game back to the mound, Clemens
barehanded the ball before throwing to first. The umpire Gary
Cederstrom flipped him a new ball, and Clemens barehanded that, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But the Royals touched him for a run. Joe Randa dumped a bloop
single into short right field, taking second on a wild pitch,
before Jeff King whacked a belly-button-high pitch to left field,
for a clean single and a run batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who had trouble adjusting to the light slope of the
mound, threw strikes with 11 of his first 20 pitches, talking aloud
to himself after making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   His four-seam fastball, he said later, had unusual movement,
darting away from the right-handed batters five or six inches.
``Jorge said it was running all over the place,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals chipped away for two more runs in the second inning,
the crucial hit an opposite-field blooper that hit the right-field
line. The Yankees trailed by 3-0 when he departed.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, it was the first time since last May that he was
listed as a losing pitcher. ``That was a lot of fun,'' Posada said.
``I was catching the best.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   After losing by 9-1 to the Royals here and by 7-4 to Boston in
Tampa, the Yankees are 1-3 in exhibition games. With the Yankees
splitting their roster for two exhibitions Saturday, the pitching
coach MEL STOTTLEMYRE &UR;  &LR; was the manager in the game here, while JOE
TORRE &UR;  &LR; managed against Boston. Stottlemyre smiled as he approached
reporters after the Kansas City defeat and said, ``What, am I
fired?''

BELCHER HAS STAYING POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Tim Belcher is a nice guy. Friendly, outgoing,
talkative, considerate. He's the kind of guy who would offer to do
the dishes after having dinner at your house.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't invite him over after he loses a game. Not if you
still want your china in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will pay Belcher $10.2 million during the next two
seasons, and hold a $5.1 million option for a third season. They're
not paying for him to break things, though that might happen after
a bad game.
</P>
<P>
   What the Angels are dishing out millions for is what Belcher has
provided six major-league teams over the course of an 11-year
career: innings. Lots of innings.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is one of only four pitchers to have pitched at least
200 innings in every full season since 1991. Even last season at
age 36, Belcher made 34 starts, pitched 234 innings and went 14-14
for the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Durability, experience _ he's a quality veteran, he'll give
you 230 quality innings,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``In
my opinion, if we score runs like we should score, he's going to
win a lot of games. (begin ital)We'll(end ital) win a lot of
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher prides himself on being the guy who might struggle
early, but you look up in the eighth inning and he's still in the
game. He may not win every game, but at least his team has a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to pick a numbers goal, I don't mess around with
wins, strikeouts or ERA,'' Belcher said. ``I've seen so many guys
have a great year, but it doesn't show up in their record. For me
it's innings, and making my 34 or 35 starts. Pitch deep into games.
Decisions and innings work hand in hand. Pitch a lot of innings and
you'll get a lot of decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is 136-127 in a career that has had stops with the
Dodgers, Reds, White Sox, Tigers, Mariners and Royals. He's pitched
his innings, 2,0692/3 to be exact, but not all of them have been
good.
</P>
<P>
   That's when his temper might get the best of him.
</P>
<P>
   Once, after giving up a homer to lose a game for the Mariners at
Yankee Stadium, Belcher knocked a television camera out of the
cameraman's hands as he taped Belcher walking in the stadium tunnel
toward the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other incidents, though none of them were caught
on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher doesn't like that about himself, but he realizes it is
part of what makes him the pitcher he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who get to this level don't stay very long if they're
at all passive,'' Belcher said. ``It doesn't mean you have to be a
fly-off-the-handle, type-A personality, although I'm as close to
that as anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing to look at the tape and see what I've done.
I say to myself, `I'm an (expletive). Why'd I do that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He does it because he hates to lose. And that's why the Angels
got him.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, though, is not the same pitcher he was 10 years ago. He
doesn't throw as hard as he once did, but that doesn't mean he
can't get outs when he needs them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less of a physical game for me now and more of a mental
game,'' he said. ``I still consider myself a power pitcher because
I still primarily throw fastballs. Only now I have three or four
variations _ a cut fastball, a two-seamer, up, down. Ten years ago,
I'd grab the ball by four seams, aim for the middle of the plate
and throw the hell out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 37, Belcher is the graybeard of the pitching staff. His
experience can help younger pitchers, although he's not about to
force his wisdom down anybody's throat. But he might grab someone
by the throat if the situation calls for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel an obligation to be accessible to the guys,'' he said.
``As far as being vocal and grabbing a guy and saying `Come here
son,' I'll do that very rarely. It's gratifying if someone comes to
me and says `What about this?' It's a two-way street. If they want
my input, great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are times when you take a young guy aside or you
grab him by the throat. Whatever it takes. If he disrespects the
game or our team, I might assert myself. I won't stand for that.
The longer I'm around the game, the more I respect the opportunity
to have played it. It's definitely a privilege.''

FREE HOUSE MAKES CASE TO SUPPLANT SKIP AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The shuffling to replace the retired Skip Away
as the top older horse in the United States continued Saturday as
Free House captured the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap, outdueling
Event of the Year and his longtime rival Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think No. 1 is whoever won the last race,'' said Chris
McCarron, his jockey. ``Free House won the last race, so I guess
he's No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   The California-bred Free House, owned by Trudy McCaffery and
John Toffan, dictated the pace and held on for a half-length
victory over Event of the Year, with Silver Charm another
half-length back. Free House ran the 1\ miles in 2:00 3/5 and paid
$10.20 on a $2 bet to win as the third choice in the six-horse
field. The $600,000 first-place purse gave him just over $3 million
in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero, coming off an impressive victory Jan. 30 over
Silver Charm in the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park, was fractious
in the paddock and finished a dull fifth, beaten by 10 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm's second consecutive third-place finish did nothing
to dispel notions that his best races are behind him, two years
after winning the Kentucky Derby and a year after a grueling
victory by a nose in the Dubai World Cup. He is the leading active
money winner, with $6.8 million. The trainer Bob Baffert, who
blamed his horse's outside post position as a factor in the Donn
loss, said this time that his horse was compromised by drawing the
rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post position got him again,'' Baffert said of the
even-money favorite. ``He was trapped the whole way around.
Everybody expects him to win every time, but these were good horses
he was up against.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm broke alertly but fell back as Free House and Dr.
Fong ran one-two for the first mile. Event of the Year, the
Kentucky Derby favorite last year until fracturing a knee eight
days before the race, moved alongside the two leaders around the
far turn and Silver Charm followed on the outside. Those two were
slowly closing on Free House at the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't let them pass even when they galloped out,'' said
Paco Gonzalez, Free House's trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Stevens, Silver Charm's jockey, offered no excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still not the Silver Charm I'm used to riding,'' said
Stevens, who was concerned with Silver Charm's lack of speed in the
Donn. ``Whether he's lost a step or not, I don't know. He's turned
into a bit of a plodder. He doesn't have the acceleration. He was
still coming at the end. Unfortunately, we just couldn't get there
soon enough.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron knew Stevens and Silver Charm were bottled up on the
rail behind him. He did all he could to keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   Although Free House had lost five of the seven previous meetings
with Silver Charm, Free House had beaten him in the 1997 Santa
Anita Derby. Free House's biggest victory was last year's $1
million Pacific Classic at Del Mar, which will be the final race in
this year's inaugural NTRA Champions Series.

ROCKET ADDS NO FUEL TO FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Fla. _ Boston sports fans are still annoyed about
Roger Clemens wearing a Yankees uniform. As I was leaving the Hub
Friday night, I told the ticket agent I was on my way to see Roger
pitch and the Delta man said, ``Clemens? I hope he gets in a fight
with Latrell Sprewell.''
</P>
<P>
   There should be some glee in New England Sunday because Clemens
made his Yankee debut Saturday and was rocked for seven hits and
three runs in three laborious innings against the hideous Kansas
City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that spring training means nothing, but Bostonians
can get a chuckle from the image of George Steinbrenner back in New
York, listening to Saturday's broadcast and lunging for his red
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   My baseball people wanted to make this deal? What's wrong with
them. Fire Cashman! Fire Costanza!
</P>
<P>
   I am a Boston sportswriter. I no longer have my own stars to
cover. I live vicariously by watching former Boston stars on other
teams. And so while the Red Sox played spring training games in
Sarasota and Tampa, I was at Baseball City Stadium watching Roger
pitch for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 4, which connects Orlando and Tampa, was backed up
for several miles one hour before the game. Some of the traffic no
doubt was bound for Disney World, but there were many New York
plates in the parking lot at Baseball City. This was the first
Royals spring sellout since 1990, when the Red Sox played KC. Club
officials could not determine whether Clemens was on the mound for
that game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket was visible during batting practice, stretching and
hanging out in the left-field area. He stopped to chat with
legendary Kansas City groundskeeper George Toma, then ducked into
the dugout runway. He said he had no time to talk before the game.
Even in the relaxed setting of ``Baseball City,'' Roger has to put
on his game face.
</P>
<P>
   Under the watchful eye of pitching coach (and manager for the
day) Mel Stottlemyre, Clemens warmed up on the bullpen mound
outside the left-field foul line. Fans gathered on the grassy knoll
behind the fence, and no fewer than 15 photographers shot the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees went out in the top of the first (many scouts,
including Boston's Frank Malzone and Lee Thomas, were on hand to
see Kansas City's Kevin Appier and Jeff King), Clemens took the
hill and the phalanx of photographers went to the backstop to
record the moment. Jorge Posada was the Yankee catcher and umpire
Gary Cederstrom was behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran led off and went out on a dribbler in front of
the plate. Joe Randa followed with a bloop single to right. Johnny
Damon flied to shallow center, but Randa took second on a wild
pitch and scored on a single to left by King (who would look good
in a Boston uniform). Jeff Conine reached on an infield single in
the hole, then Jeremy Giambi fanned on a 1-and-2 high heater.
Clemens threw 20 pitches in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Kreuter led off the second with a bloop double to left.
Clemens probably hadn't planned on pitching from the stretch so
much against the faceless, talent-starved Royals. Carlos Febles hit
one off the end of his bat for an RBI double to right. Then Rey
Sanchez hit a seeing-eye single up the middle and it was 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens finally got an out when Beltran grounded into a
fielder's choice. The Rocket got Randa on a fly to right, then
fanned Damon on a breaking ball to stop the bleeding. He was up to
41 pitches after two innings.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the third, Conine drilled a double off the wall
in left-center. Clemens struck out Giambi and Krueter to end his
first Yankee outing. He threw 58 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good,'' he said, before going on his traditional
post-spring-training-outing jog. ``I don't feel too winded. I was
glad to get the first one under way. It was nice. Jorge did a good
job blocking the plate. I had some forkers in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in a little better focus in the third inning. Being in a
new environment, I have a tendency to want to do more and
overthrow. Mel reminded me, `Don't try and turn it loose yet.' It
was good. I didn't see and hear a whole lot today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket is comfortable in such a vacuum. He's at his best
when he tunes out his environment. Was he bothered by the hail of
hits and runs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``My location is what matters. I'd like
to be able to get ahead more. But I wasn't going to try to knock
the bats out of too many guys' hands.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed comfortable wearing that Yankee cap. It still looks to
me like seeing Michael Jordan in a Laker uniform. I asked him about
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty used to it,'' he said. ``Ever since the first
couple of days in camp. It's where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where he is. Roger Clemens is a Yankee now. Every day.
And back in Boston, we'll be watching his every move.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn and the Anaheim Angels open at home against the
Indians on Tuesday, April 6. I'll be in California to see Mo.
Better there than in Kansas City watching the boring Red Sox
against the boring Royals.

ANGELS' SHIPLEY RETIRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- With Gary DiSarcina recovering from a broken bone in
his left forearm, the Angels' shortstop situation took another
couple of twists and turns Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   First, veteran Craig Shipley decided he would retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the desire to play anymore, Shipley said from his
hotel room Saturday afternoon. ``I've been feeling this way for a
while. ... Everybody comes to that point sometime during their
career. It's tough to go out there every day when you don't want to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley, 36, said he spoke with manager Terry Collins about his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood,'' Shipley said. ``I've known him a long time.
I'm appreciative of everything he and the organization have done
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipley, who paused several times and spoke softly during the
conversation, said he has no serious health issues and has had no
problems with anyone in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Sydney, Australia, Shipley will return home to Palm
Beach Gardens, Fla. to his wife and two children. He began his
major league career in 1986 with the Dodgers, played in 582 major
league games with five teams (Dodgers, Mets, Padres, Astros and
Angels) and hit .271 with 20 homers and 138 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys play with fire,'' Collins said. ``When the fire
starts to burn out, a lot of times they don't make the right
decision, but this kid did. I tip my hat to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly appreciate Craig's decision,'' general manager
Bill Bavasi said. ``I spoke with him (Saturday) morning about his
feelings and it was obvious he had given this a great deal of
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels then called up shortstop Chuck Abbott from minor
league camp. Abbott will join the club in Tempe today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby (Fontaine, director of scouting and player personnel)
thought he was a guy we should look at,'' Bavasi said. ``With
DiSarcina getting hurt, I wish we would have brought him in at the
start. But he's in town and he's in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, a second-round pick in 1996, hit .263 in 132 games last
season for double-A Midland.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels dropped their second Cactus League game in a row to
the Oakland A's, losing 8-7 at Phoenix Municipal Stadium Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had plenty of offense, as Tim Salmon, Phil Nevin and
Todd Greene each homered. But for the second day in a row, the
Angels pitching left something to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek, in relief of starter Omar Olivares, gave up
back-to-back-to-back homers in the fifth inning to Ben Grieve, Matt
Stairs and Eric Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares looked good in his first two innings of work, then
allowed three runs in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omar threw the ball good until all of a sudden he walked a
couple guys,'' Collins said. ``But his ball had life and
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares is competing with Jason Dickson and Jarrod Washburn for
the fifth spot in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Chuck Finley (stiff back) still has not been given the
go-ahead to pitch in a Cactus League game, though he continues to
throw during workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be another week before he's ready to let it loose,''
Collins said. ``I'm not going to let him out there until he's ready
to pitch, because as you know he's a maximum-effort guy. This guy
means too much to us to take a chance with him. One more week and
he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Stankiewicz, competing for a job as a utility player,
looked good at second base Saturday. Stankiewicz, who also can play
shortstop, is vying for the spot against Jeff Huson and Luis
Rivera. One of them might be the starting shortstop on opening day
if Gary DiSarcina (broken bone in left forearm) is not ready. ...
The Angels play the A's again today (12:05), this time at Tempe
Diablo Stadium. Tim Belcher will start for Anaheim against
Oakland's Gil Heredia.

CLINTON AIDES ADMIT LAPSES ON ESPIONAGE BY CHINESE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two of President Clinton's top advisers said
Saturday that the investigation into China's acquisition of U.S.
nuclear weapons technology showed enormous lapses in security at
the Energy Department's laboratories in the 1980s, and they
acknowledged that they moved too slowly to solve the problems
during Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, in response to an article in The New York Times on
Saturday detailing a federal investigation into how China was able
to copy the most advanced miniature nuclear warhead, known as the
W-88, came from the president's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information that we were provided in 1997 made clear that
there was a serious security problem at the national labs dating
back to the mid-1980s, which we were going to deal with in a
systematic and comprehensive way,'' Berger said in an interview
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The authority to tighten security and begin a major
counterintelligence push at the laboratories arose from a directive
signed by Clinton in February 1998, after a nine-month
investigation into security lapses at Los Alamos National
Laboratory and other laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson said Saturday that ``the major reforms were
instituted in October 1998, a month after I came in'' as energy
secretary, succeeding Federico Pena.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the tightening happened nine months after
Clinton's order was signed, and 18 months after the details of the
security breach were first relayed to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's critics say the delays indicated that the
White House was playing down the severity of the reports to avoid
derailing effort to put relations with China on a better footing.
Berger and other officials deny that.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, senior administration officials say
Richardson, who previously served as chief delegate to the United
Nations, was not briefed on the investigation until a month after
joining the Energy Department. Even then, it came from the Energy
Department official, Notra Trulock, who first raised questions
about the Los Alamos case, rather than from the National Security
Council or the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Saturday to explain the delays, senior administration
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that despite
Clinton's directive in early 1998, the Energy Department moved
extremely slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Pena announced his decision to leave the department in the
spring of 1998, and major decisions were held in abeyance. ``Things
were kind of hanging out there'' until Richardson's arrival, one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The main suspect in the warhead case was identified only as a
Chinese-American computer scientist at Los Alamos. But it was not
the first time the administration was made aware of security
breaches at that laboratory, which is in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, a 58-year-old physicist, Peter Lee, admitted
in a plea bargain agreement that in 1985 he gave China classified
information involving the use of lasers to simulate nuclear
detonations.
</P>
<P>
   Former officials of the Bush and Reagan administrations say
that, in retrospect, the government was remarkably lax about lab
security in the 1980s, even during the Reagan administration's arms
buildup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite clear now that things were far too casual,'' James
R. Lilley, the ambassador to China from 1989 to 1991 and then a
senior Defense Department official, said in an interview on
Saturday. Lilley, who for years served as one of the CIA's top
operatives in Asia, including in China, said: ``This has been going
on for a long, long time. We had Ministry of State Security
defectors and other Chinese who became agents, and they made it
clear that this was a top priority of their industrial and
intelligence apparatus.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lilley blamed the two Republican administrations he served
in, he added that the Clinton administration was ``caught in
bureaucratic struggles between the Energy Department and the FBI,
and the Chinese saw that we were still sitting ducks'' in the early
to mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But Lilley said the United States should not disrupt its
dealings with China because of the spying. ``You've got to get some
maturity into the relationship with China,'' he said, arguing that
the United States could deepen its economic engagement with China
``while still restricting high technology exports and breaking up
their espionage rings.''
</P>
<P>
   The view in Congress may be different. The steady drip of
disclosures about Beijing's efforts to obtain U.S. technology may
lead Congress to derail efforts for China to join the World Trade
Organization _ an objective of the Chinese for many years.

3 VICTIMS IN COLOMBIA DEFENDED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS 9th graf from end for clarification. No other changes.)  
 (ATTN: Wis., Hawaii, Calif.)  (fb) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three Americans who were killed while on a mission to help
the Uwa people of Colombia had distinguished themselves in the
United States and in international organizations as passionate
defenders of the environment and of the rights of indigenous
people, associates said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Washinawatok, 41, of Brooklyn, began fighting for the
rights of American Indians as a teen-ager in her own backyard, on
the Menominee Reservation in Keshena, Wis., where her father was a
prominent tribal judge. From that springboard, she travelled to
dozens of countries as an advocate for women's and Indian causes.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Freitas, 24, a California native who had recently moved
to Brooklyn, had spent much of the last three years trying to focus
attention on the Uwa tribe's battle to preserve its land from oil
exploration. The Uwa ``considered him one of theirs,'' a friend
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii, chairwoman of the Pacific
Cultural Conservancy International, worked to bring educational
opportunities to indigenous people and recognition for her own
Polynesian culture. To shed light on that culture, she was writing
a book about her own roots in Hawaiian royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are so committed and courageous,'' said Laurie
Parise, executive director of the Rainforest Foundation U.S., a
10-year-old organization in New York City, who knew two of the
slain Americans. ``They knew the danger, but they still went down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok grew up on the Menominee Reservation, where a
tribal spiritual leader gave her the name Peqtaw Metamoh when she
was a child. It means Thunderbird Woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her whole life was about humanity, about respecting people's
ability to be who they are,'' said Apesanahkwat, the chairman of
the Menominee Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just a wonderful person, a mom and a sister and a
daughter, an Indian woman who epitomizes all those values that not
many people possess,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok was a co-chairwoman of the Indigenous Women's
Network and was active in forums sponsored by the United Nations
and other international groups on Indian and women's rights issues.
Since 1992, she was also a member of the board of directors of the
American Indian Community House in Manhattan. She worked for the
Fund of the Four Directions in Manhattan, a foundation that
supports Native American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok's advocacy work began early. At age 14, she helped
her father, James, organize on the reservation, and three years
later came to New York City as an intern with the International
Treaty Council, which monitored Indian rights in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Ali el Issa, her husband of 16 years and a former Rite Aid drug
store manager, said he last spoke with his wife a week before she
was kidnapped. ``I told her, if it's not safe, come back. Don't use
your sympathy, use your brain.'' El Issa said she responded, ``I
feel I am with my people, like I'm back on the reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has a son, Maehki, who is 14.
</P>
<P>
   Freitas, a graduate of the University of California at Santa
Cruz, was trained as an environmental biologist and worked in
various environmental law projects after college. His passion was
not for books and formulas, though. It was for the wild, said
Leslie Wirpsa, a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his natural habitat to be out in the woods,'' she said,
adding, ``His spirit is inextricably linked to the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Freitas had been involved with the Uwa fight to keep oil
companies from drilling on their land for nearly three years and
founded a group called the Uwa Defense Working Group, which he said
was dedicated to the principle of non-violent social change.
</P>
<P>
   He helped bring an Uwa tribal leader to California last year for
public debates with spokesmen for the Occidental Oil and Gas
Corporation, the Bakersfield, Calif., company whose affiliate,
Occidental de Colombia, has been trying to explore for oil on and
near the Uwa lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Uwa considered him one of theirs,'' Wirpsa said. The
feeling was mutual. ``He was awestruck when he was in the Uwa
territory,'' she added. ``I remember when he showed us a slide _
red birds against a rich verdant green backdrop _ and you could
feel his heart jump when he showed that slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Melina Selverston, director of the Coalition for Amazonian
Peoples and their Environment, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group,
said Freitas had received death threats on his telephone answering
machine. She said they came from the right-wing paramilitary groups
that operate in the Arauca area of Colombia where the Americans
were abducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terence was a deeply, deeply committed young man,'' Ms.
Selverston added. ``He was the one person the Uwa trusted as a
connection to the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay, 39, was a native Hawaiian of Scottish, Mohawk and French
descent, with varied interests and talents. A photojournalist and
writer, she led delegations of indigenous Polynesians to various
international forums and was active in Hawaii in fighting for their
official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her work was her passion,'' John Livingstone, who described
himself as Gay's common-law husband, said in a telephone interview
from his parents' home in Connecticut. ``She dedicated her life to
indigenous causes and saving traditional cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiian elders had trained her in what Livingstone called
traditional anthropology, and she was using those skills to trace
the history of the royal family from which she was descended. She
was writing a book about her roots called The Ancestral Voices.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said that Ms. Gay understood the dangers of a trip to
the Uwa in Colombia, where she was exploring the possibility of
setting up an education program modeled on one she had established
in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took my heart,'' Livingstone said, sobbing. ``She was the
love of my life. She was just a phenomenal, beautiful person, and
it was a senseless brutal act.''

RODMAN HEAD GAMES WORK ON MALONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Karl Malone could willingly bring on repressed memory
syndrome, he'd certainly apply it to the barrage of distasteful
images that comprise his performance in the 1998 NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   If there are images that haunt the onetime NBA MVP, they
resemble a certain 6-foot-6 power forward with strange hair and a
red Bulls jersey. A reasonable facsimile will face Malone and his
Utah Jazz teammates this afternoon at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   The jersey and hair color have changed, but Dennis Rodman's
defense, rebounding an uncanny ability to mess with Malone's head
are the same.
</P>
<P>
   In Games 1 through 4 of the '98 Finals, Rodman helped hold
Malone to 20 points a game _ seven below his average _ and by the
time Malone got untracked in Games 5 and 6 it was too late, and the
Bulls had beaten the Jazz for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman wasn't talking Saturday, but his Lakers teammates are
hopeful the Worm can provide the same voodoo when the teams meet
today. The Lakers, losers of six of their last seven against Utah,
will take whatever edge they can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does an excellent job getting into Karl's head,'' Kobe
Bryant said, ``but I'm sure Karl is getting used to it by now.
Hopefully, he's not. (Rodman's presence) can do nothing but help.''
</P>
<P>
   If not with head, then at least with body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is able to bump him, be a little bit more physical with
him,'' Bryant said. ``He understands his game a lot more. He has
the footspeed to keep up with Karl and he can contest his shots as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis said the Lakers' recent strides in defending
the pick-and-roll, Utah's preferred offense, will make more of a
difference than Rodman, who probably won't start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tape of every pick-and-roll they ran in the Finals,
and (Rodman) does do a good job,'' Rambis said. ``But it's not like
I put him on Karl and all my worries are over, because that's not
true. They were very successful in running it, and Chicago defended
it a whole bunch of different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone will probably start out against Travis Knight and could
be defensed by Rodman, Elden Campbell, Shaquille O'Neal or Robert
Horry at various points in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be afraid to put them all in there,'' Rambis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Horry, who's drawn the assignment for most of the last two years
while playing out of position, said Rodman should be an
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know you've got somebody who's just as strong as
Malone that can battle him for a significant amount of time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bench time: Horry didn't play Friday night and before that had
averaged just seven minutes a game for the last week because of
Rodman's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine. I'm just trying to stay in shape and just wait,''
Horry said. ``If it had been anybody else, I probably would have
been upset. But you got Dennis coming in, you're trying to get him
acclimated to the team, you just gotta be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, usually if I'm sitting on the bench, I'm in a
hurry to get in the game. But now I just wanna watch and learn.
This is a point in my career where I feel like I can learn more
just sitting on the bench. Plus, you know, save some trouble on
these old knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Bryant sprained his right wrist in a tumble to the
floor early in Friday's game against Seattle. He wore tape on the
wrist during Saturday's practice, but Bryant said the injury won't
affect his shooting. He made 8 of 15 shots against the Sonics.

ONE YEAR WITHOUT `SUNSHINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ How's it going? Doris Bailey is asked. It's been a
little over a year, now, hasn't it? &QL; 
``Well,'' she says, taking a deep breath. ``It's been 15 months,
two weeks, three days and, let me see, about 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it's going.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it's gone since early one morning in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a good night for Doris and her family. Her youngest
son, Derrek Wheaton, had been one of the players honored at Phoenix
College's annual football banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Like his older brothers, Robbie and Kenny, Derrek had been a
star athlete at Tempe's McClintock High School. He was an
All-Arizona defensive back in football, a center fielder his coach
believed could play in the majors, and one of the few high school
basketball players to hold his own against a phenomenon named Mike
Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   ``For going on 23 years I've lived here in south Phoenix,''
Derrek's mother says. ``People know I've never been one to brag on
my kids. But I've always been so proud of my sons, living in this
neighborhood and still being good boys. I've been so proud.''
</P>
<P>
   During high school, Derrek was offered a football scholarship to
the University of Oregon, where Kenny had gone, but he didn't
qualify academically. So he went to Phoenix College, where he
played ball and studied harder and hoped eventually to transfer to
a major university, then follow Kenny, a cornerback with the Dallas
Cowboys, into the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are young, you have so many dreams,'' Doris says.
``None of his can come true.'' &QL; 
Random violence
</P>
<P>
   After the football banquet Derrek went out. At about 2 a.m. he
stopped, alone, at a convenience store at 16th Street and Southern.
While there, his girlfriend paged him.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't looking for any trouble, but he didn't have to be.
This is a place where trouble comes looking for you. Several young
men approached Derrek as he was on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   He told his girlfriend, ``I'm about to get sweated by these
fools.''
</P>
<P>
   There were gunshots. He died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, 1,500 people crowded into the McClintock High
School auditorium for his funeral. The family was there. Derrek's
father, Robert. His mother. Brothers. Along with friends.
Teammates. Teachers. Coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a special kid,'' says B.G. Jones, who coaches
junior-varsity football at McClintock. ``Not because he was a
ballplayer, but because he was good. You can see that reflected in
his family.
</P>
<P>
   All the eulogies were like that, many mentioning how Derrek's
constant smile got him the nickname ``Sunshine.''
</P>
<P>

   PHOENIX _ How's it going? Doris Bailey is asked. It's been a
little over a year, now, hasn't it? &QL; 
``Well,'' she says, taking a deep breath. ``It's been 15 months,
two weeks, three days and, let me see, about 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it's going.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it's gone since early one morning in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a good night for Doris and her family. Her youngest
son, Derrek Wheaton, had been one of the players honored at Phoenix
College's annual football banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Like his older brothers, Robbie and Kenny, Derrek had been a
star athlete at Tempe's McClintock High School. He was an
All-Arizona defensive back in football, a center fielder his coach
believed could play in the majors, and one of the few high school
basketball players to hold his own against a phenomenon named Mike
Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   ``For going on 23 years I've lived here in south Phoenix,''
Derrek's mother says. ``People know I've never been one to brag on
my kids. But I've always been so proud of my sons, living in this
neighborhood and still being good boys. I've been so proud.''
</P>
<P>
   During high school, Derrek was offered a football scholarship to
the University of Oregon, where Kenny had gone, but he didn't
qualify academically. So he went to Phoenix College, where he
played ball and studied harder and hoped eventually to transfer to
a major university, then follow Kenny, a cornerback with the Dallas
Cowboys, into the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are young, you have so many dreams,'' Doris says.
``None of his can come true.'' &QL; 
Random violence
</P>
<P>
   After the football banquet Derrek went out. At about 2 a.m. he
stopped, alone, at a convenience store at 16th Street and Southern.
While there, his girlfriend paged him.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't looking for any trouble, but he didn't have to be.
This is a place where trouble comes looking for you. Several young
men approached Derrek as he was on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   He told his girlfriend, ``I'm about to get sweated by these
fools.''
</P>
<P>
   There were gunshots. He died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, 1,500 people crowded into the McClintock High
School auditorium for his funeral. The family was there. Derrek's
father, Robert. His mother. Brothers. Along with friends.
Teammates. Teachers. Coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a special kid,'' says B.G. Jones, who coaches
junior-varsity football at McClintock. ``Not because he was a
ballplayer, but because he was good. You can see that reflected in
his family.
</P>
<P>
   All the eulogies were like that, many mentioning how Derrek's
constant smile got him the nickname ``Sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the killing was random. Derrek, one officer said,
was in the wrong place at the wrong time. &QL; 
No arrests

Kansas tops Kansas State to make final
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Only one of the top four seeds in the Big 12
tournament survived to reach today's championship game, which is no
big surprise to a league that had only one Top 25 team when the
week began.
</P>
<P>
   But the only top-four seed that remains alive is the team that
was supposed to be vulnerable for the first time since the
conference was formed.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Jayhawks will try to make it a perfect 3-for-3 in Big
12 tournament championship games after defeating Kansas State 69-58
in a semifinal matchup Saturday at Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Kansas (21-9) will play No. 5 Oklahoma State (22-9)
for the title today at 2 p.m. in a rematch of one of the best games
in the Big 12 regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks won 67-66 in overtime at Lawrence, Kan., two weeks
ago when Cowboys guard Adrian Peterson was whistled for a
controversial foul as Ryan Robertson tried a desperation 3-pointer
at the buzzer. Robertson made his first free-throw attempt to end a
great game on a sour note.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (OSU) game was a big win for us on Senior Night, but we
don't want to win games like that,'' said center Eric Chenowith,
who led the Jayhawks with 20 points and 11 rebounds Saturday. ``I
think they feel like they want to get us back. It will be a big
game for them because they want another shot at us.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Kansas State after losing twice to Kansas in the regular
season. The Wildcats (20-12) made a strong showing in the
conference tournament, but coach Tom Asbury believes their 7-9
conference record will doom their chances of an NCAA Tournament
berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had to win the (Big 12) tournament,'' Asbury said.
``The selection committee probably isn't going to leap-frog us over
a team with a better conference record. So we came here to win the
tournament and came up a little bit short.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 17,000 watched Kansas State battle back from a
eight-point deficit in the second half and take a 57-55 lead with
5:30 to go on a layup off an offensive rebound by Tony Kitt. But
the Jayhawks would outscore the Wildcats 14-1 the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome still was in doubt with 1:53 remaining when Kansas
led 63-58, but freshman point guard Jeff Boschee took control and
scored the last six points with a free throw, a driving turnaround
jumper in the lane and a 3-pointer, his fourth of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boschee made all the plays in the last two minutes,'' Asbury
said. ``It's not a whole lot more complicated than that. It was a
dead-even game and we had a chance to win, but Boschee made some
terrific plays when we lost him a couple of times. He made some
gutty shots.''
</P>
<P>
   A little too gutty as far as Jayhawks coach Roy Williams was
concerned. Williams loves his talented guard who was the Big 12
Freshman of the Year, but Boschee also frustrates Williams at
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is fearless, but he ran the wrong play, so he's also
clueless,'' Williams said. ``The next-to-last play (the driving
jumper), he screwed it up. I called one play and he ran another.
Four guys got it right and he got it wrong, but he ends up making
the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff's never afraid to make a play. He doesn't always make
them, but he isn't afraid to try.''
</P>
<P>
   K-State point guard Chris Griffin was amazed at some of the
running jumpers Boschee made en route to a 19-point effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got the best of me today,'' Griffin said. ``They set a lot
of good picks for him, and it's hard to get back to him because he
has such a quick release.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin and the other Kansas State starters admitted they were a
little tired while playing for the third time in three days. Asbury
used 11 players to try to keep fresh bodies on the floor, but the
Wildcats seemed to fade down the stretch. The team's top scorer,
guard Cortez Groves, came off the bench to score 12 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ The emir of Bahrain, a key U.S. ally in
the Persian Gulf region, collapsed and died Saturday at the age of
65 after a meeting with visiting Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The emir, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al-Khalifa, had ruled the tiny
island nation since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He was immediately succeeded by his son Sheik Hamad bin Isa
Al-Khalifa, 49, in what by all appearances was a smooth transfer of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Hamad, who had been crown prince, had already held the title of
commander in chief of Bahrain's armed forces. He is said to share
the pro-Western orientation that has made Bahrain an important base
for U.S. military operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the transfer of power marks the end of an era for
Bahrain, where the emir had been a dominant force for nearly four
decades. It may also offer a foretaste of what lies in store for
several other Persian Gulf monarchies whose leaders are in
questionable health.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi ruler, King Fahd, 79, has been hospitalized several
times in the last three years; the monarch's brother, Crown Prince
Abdullah, 77, is now running the kingdom on a day-to-day-basis.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, in Bahrain at the start of a nine-country tour of the
Middle East, said he had been ``stunned and saddened'' to learn of
Isa's sudden death. The cause, according to Bahraini officials, was
a heart attack that the emir suffered just minutes after the two
ended a half-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Isa had suffered heart problems in the past; he visited
Cleveland, Ohio, last year to undergo heart treatment. He had shown
no recent signs of ill health.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that Cohen, who arrived Saturday night in
Riyadh, the Saudi capital, on the second leg of his journey, had
offered to stay in Bahrain to attend Isa's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Bahrain said that as many as 10,000 people attended
the funeral, and that flower petals were strewn on the capital's
streets. Bahrain state radio said that Hamad had earlier informed
an emergency Cabinet meeting of his father's death and that he was
taking power under the kingdom's laws.
</P>
<P>
   Isa's death was announced to the people of Bahrain after state
television began broadcasting recitations from the Koran, the
Islamic holy book, a standard practice after the death of a leader
in the Muslim world. The scenes were reminiscent of those played on
Jordanian television just one month ago, after the death of King
Hussein, another key U.S. ally.
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain's new emir, Hamad, is an experienced military commander
who graduated from the British military academy at Sandhurst. As
crown prince since 1964, he presided over a buildup of Bahrain's
armed forces, and has been seen as a strong proponent of Bahrain's
emerging partnership with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials say he has shown no indication that he would
back away from the arrangements that have made Bahrain the
headquarters for the United States' 5th Fleet, which patrols the
Persian Gulf. Nor, they say, has he voiced opposition to
arrangements that, in a series of recent crises, have allowed U.S.
warplanes to be in Bahrain for possible use against Iraq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hamad inherits an emirate whose strength as a banking and
financial capital has helped to make up for its relative lack of
oil, though it remains a poor cousin among its Persian Gulf
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   There are also deep domestic strains, particularly between
Bahrain's majority population of Shiite Muslims and the more
prosperous Sunni minority, headed by the Al-Khalifa family, which
controls nearly all power and privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, those strains have played out in a campaign of
low-level violence, including bombings and other attacks, that have
claimed more than two dozen lives.
</P>
<P>
   Under Isa, Bahraini authorities responded with a heavy hand,
sending security forces into the streets and arresting scores of
Shiite activists, many of whom remain in jail. As commander of
Bahrain's military forces, Hamad has been closely identified with
that policy.

The weary need rest, but when?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
VIERA, Fla. _ It's the four-letter word no manager wants to say and
no player wants to hear: R-E-S-T.
</P>
<P>
   The players acknowledge needing it but rarely want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my way, I would never come out,'' said Astros first
baseman Jeff Bagwell, who has played a full 162 games three times
in his eight-year career.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a game, chances are Bagwell's name will be listed on
Larry Dierker's lineup card. Second baseman Craig Biggio will be
there, too. So will third baseman Ken Caminiti and right fielder
Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the foursome missed only 44 games last season, with
Bagwell and Caminiti accounting for 36 of those because of time
spent on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Various factors _ an increase in injuries, cross-country travel
and the non-stop, six-month grind _ make it impossible for players
to go the distance without an occasional day off.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker realizes his job gets tougher when it comes to the
delicate subject of when, and how often, to rest high-profile
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a believer the guys need all kinds of rest, but as you
get older you need some,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking I probably should rest them a little bit more
early in the season. I'll probably have to force myself to do it
because I know I'm going to get into an argument every time I do.''
</P>
<P>
   He's probably right. Do you expect Biggio, who has missed two
games since July 31, 1995, to stroll into the manager's office and
request a day off?
</P>
<P>
   The issue of finding an occasional breather for his regulars
will be one of Dierker's top priorities this season. Special
interest will be paid to Caminiti and Biggio, both at or
approaching their mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, even after 1,539 games _ and three years spent
catching _ Biggio has never been on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older you get, you're going to have to take more off days
than normal,'' said Biggio, who in his 10th season hit a
career-high .325 and set a club record with 210 hits last year.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the games Biggio failed to play last season had nothing
to do with injury. His club-record streak of consecutive games
played was halted at 494 _ second at the time to Baltimore's Cal
Ripken Jr. _ when Dierker decided to keep Biggio out of the lineup
Aug. 5 at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Previously when the 33-year-old second baseman wasn't in the
lineup, Dierker had managed to get him into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something you take a lot of pride in,'' Biggio said.
``You still take a lot of pride in wanting to play every day.
You'll always be that way. To me, the goal this year is to start
158 games rather than 162.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's only a couple of games here and there. But it's a
couple of games off and that's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring marks the first in several years that Caminiti, 35,
is coming back from offseason surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti missed 21 games in 1998 with a strained left quadriceps
and was bothered by a bad shoulder in San Diego's run to the World
Series. Upon arrival at spring training, he proclaimed himself in
the best condition in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already talked about it. If he wants to give me a day
off fine, so be it,'' said Caminiti, who hasn't played more than
146 games since 1991. ``It's his team. I'm just here trying to make
the team better.''
</P>
<P>
   When Caminiti isn't in the lineup, Bill Spiers will play third
base. Spiers also can spell relief for Biggio. Tim Bogar can play
every infield position, with most of his time expected to come at
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   When is the best time to take break? Dierker plans to choose his
spots carefully:
</P>
<P>
   According to most players, leaving a lopsided game a few innings
early is the next best thing to getting an entire day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they keep you in there too late,'' Biggio said. ``If
you can get some guys a few innings off in blowout games, that's
serious relief there. It's always tougher on the infielders than
anybody else, just from the standpoint you're bending over on every
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can get some guys a couple extra innings off here and
there, that's a huge, huge lift. It might not look like a big deal
in the box score, but it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekend games are especially tough. Most of the time, a Saturday
night game is followed by a 1:30 p.m. start on Sundays. Sometimes
it's a Friday-Saturday turnaround. Nationally or regionally
televised games start as early as 12:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play 12:35 games (following a night game) that really
beats you up,'' Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many breaks in the schedule. Most players favor
time off when a day game is followed by an off day. There are only
four such opportunities on the Astros' 1999 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Players prefer to find out in advance. Playing regularly becomes
a routine and players arrive at the park early to go through
pre-game batting practice and infield drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to give you a day off during the season, they
should tell you, `Don't come to the ballpark until game time,'''
Bagwell said. ``Guys come, take early hitting, hit batting practice
and take ground balls. They probably do more running around when
they're not playing. They're not getting a day off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell isn't fond of days off, and with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993-95, he missed playing time when he fractured his left
hand on three separate occasions, though the 1994 injury happened
just a few days before the strike caused an early end to the
season.
</P>
<P>
   If not for missing 15 games during the second month of 1998 with
a laceration to his right knee, Bagwell would have played in close
to 160 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been injured and I know what it's like not to play,''
said Bagwell, who has two streaks of 300 or more games played. ``I
just want to play as much as I can because I never know when it's
going to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue becomes a problem late in the season. Then, it's almost
impossible for a manager whose team is in contention not to go with
his regular lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, with the division title already in hand, the Astros
played a brutal schedule of four games in the three days, including
a doubleheader that followed a series-opening afternoon game that
went 13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the games in that series with the New York Mets went
extra innings. The Astros lost all but one and finished the season
a sluggish 6-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros carried a heavy workload, leading the league with
1,471 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (Mets) series was a backbreaker,'' Biggio said. ``That
just kicked our butt right there. Physically that hurt us, but that
didn't hurt us in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou stayed healthy last season and played 159 games, a
career high. But after a strong and consistent three-fourths of a
season, Alou failed to add to his 38-homer total after Aug. 24 _ a
span of 30 games _ and collected just six of his 124 RBIs during
the final month.
</P>
<P>
   Alou's late-season slowdown lingered into the postseason, where
he went 3-for-16.
</P>
<P>
   The reason?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I am tired,'' Alou said before Game 3 of the divisional
playoffs with San Diego ``That's one of those things that every-day
players find it hard to admit. That's something my dad (Expos
manager Felipe Alou ) was good about when I played for him in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   I used to get mad at him when he gave me a few days, but in the
long run, you're probably better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said, ``There are two ways to look at it: You're going
to rest somebody and they don't like to hear that. But the other
guys need some playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   When one of those occasions comes up, don't expect the players
to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be the opinion around baseball that guys need days
off,'' Bagwell said. ``I don't know. I don't think if you give me a
day off in April or May or June that's going to help me throughout
the year.''

Kraft leads way, but all eyes on Els
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ When people talk about golf greatness, they use adjectives
like ``Tigeresque'' or ``Duvalian.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``Elslike'' will make it into the game's thesaurus by the
end of play today at the Doral-Ryder Open.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Who's No. 1?'' debate between Tiger Woods and David Duval
could be a three-way discussion if Els can hammer out another
victory today, which would be his second in his first three weeks
of PGA Tour action in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be easy for the low-key South African, who trails
leader Greg Kraft by two shots going into the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Els said he dodged a bullet Saturday, playing subpar but not
falling any further behind Kraft than when the day started. Both
players shot 2-under-par 70s, leaving Kraft at 11-under 205 for the
tournament and Els at 207, tied with Glen Day.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt Els is lurking, ready to pounce on a leader
board that is slightly less than star-studded. But he added he
didn't play like a man who feels like the one to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I should have felt,'' he said. ``But the way I
was playing, it's like I was the one who's never won a tournament.
I didn't play the way a guy who has won two U.S. Opens should
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was inexperience or simply off days, nobody was able
to put much space between themselves and Els on a day when he could
have been pushed back into the pack if Kraft or Day or somebody
else had gotten hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather conditions in the afternoon were perfect,'' Els
said. ``But nobody made a move and I feel kind of fortunate playing
kind of poorly and hanging in there. I'm still in the tournament.
So I feel I have a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft likes his chances, too.
</P>
<P>
   But a history of blown opportunities clearly haunts the Doral
leader. The eighth-year pro from Clearwater, Fla., has never won on
Tour, although he did win the 1993 Deposit Guaranty Classic when it
was an unofficial event in Hattiesburg, Miss. Kraft has led going
into the final day three times on Tour. He had no trouble reciting
when and where he has stumbled at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was '93 at New Orleans, '94 at the Western Open and '96 in
the Deposit Guaranty,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost like those moments in history are engraved on his
brain, ready to be fired off in rapid fashion whenever anybody
asks. He rattled them off faster than most people list their kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious, of course,'' he said. ``But it's not the first
time I've had to deal with it (leading with 18 holes left).''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft also said he expects good things today _ from his
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a guy like Ernie to make a charge,'' Kraft said. ``He
has been playing well all year. And I'm good friends with Andy
(Bean). He's been working very hard on his game, and I hope he has
a great day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean is at 8-under 208 after a 69 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Els who everybody is targeting as the main man today.
He birdied two of the last three holes, including the dreaded 18th
at Doral's Blue Monster, to stay poised for a run during the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   Should a victory come about for Els, it might behoove Woods and
Duval to make a little room for Els in talk about who the sport's
top gun is, if they haven't already. Els won at Los Angeles two
weeks ago, but lost in the first round of the Andersen Consulting
Match Play Championship. He said Saturday if he had gone past the
first round, he probably would not have played Doral.
</P>
<P>
   But now Els is threatening to win for the third time this year.
He captured the South African PGA in January.
</P>
<P>
   Another win might force Els into the same level as Woods and
Duval, although it's a level Els says he hasn't reached yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a better record than I do right now, and that's
the bottom line,'' Els said. ``I know I'm up there pretty high
already. But they (Duval and Woods) will still be the guys people
talk about next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Els has two major championships and seven Tour
wins. That stacks up nicely against Woods' eight titles and one
major and Duval's nine wins and no majors.
</P>
<P>
   First things first, however.
</P>
<P>
   Els will have to run down Kraft, who has had only one bogey over
the past 27 holes. That came on the par-4 14th Saturday when he
knocked his approach over the green and couldn't get up and down.
He also made a solid par on the 18th to close out his round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important, I think, to finish out your round strong
because the last thing you want to do is leave a sour taste in your
mouth,'' Kraft said. ``I struggled early in the round, but it was
nice to get it together and hit two quality shots on the last hole
and get out of there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want to do is stumble on No. 18. It's a
hole that I couldn't have won the tournament on today, but I could
have lost it, maybe, if I'd stumbled.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, any stumbling will be done today.
</P>
<P>
   And it might be Els giving him a nudge in the back along the
way.

ISLES WASTE 3-GOAL LEAD AS FLYERS RALLY FOR TIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Eric Lindros, the Flyers' hulking center, watched
like a predator as the Islanders' defense weakened in the game's
final minutes. And when the time was right, Lindros saw his chance
and seized it.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders had taken a three-goal lead late into the third
period Saturday. But the Flyers' rally started with 3 minutes 6
seconds left as Philadelphia scored once, then again. And with less
than a minute remaining, Lindros used his enormous body to steal a
point for his team. He barreled over two Islanders on his way to
the goal, where he swatted the puck away from Islanders goalie
Tommy Salo and stuffed it into the net with 51 seconds left,
completing Philadelphia's stunning comeback to earn a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' 37th goal, in front of a sellout of 19,649 at the First
Union Center, was allowed to stand after a video review. The point
snapped the Flyers' five-game losing streak, while the Islanders'
streak without a victory in Philadelphia reached six games, dating
to Nov. 4, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers (30-19-14), who also got goals from Dave Babych and
Valery Zelepukin in the final 3:06, then had several chances to win
before time expired. The best attempt, a backhander by Keith Jones,
trickled just wide of Salo, who faced 28 shots, 15 in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that Lindros inflicted the damage with the
Islanders' top two defensemen on the bench. Kenny Jonsson missed
most of the game with a headache after getting an elbow to his face
from John LeClair late in the first period. Rich Pilon, a Lindros
nemesis, left the game with about four minutes left with a strained
back, also caused by a run-in with LeClair.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the injuries to Jonsson and Pilon, the Islanders had
the rookie Eric Brewer and the journeyman David Harlock on the ice
when Lindros muscled his way to the net and scored the game-tying
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to take it around the front of the net and slam
it home,'' Lindros said. ``It popped loose while I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was not how Salo saw the play unfold. He complained to
Referee Dennis LaRue that Lindros had violated his crease, and that
he had already frozen the puck between his arm and his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it right under my arm,'' said Salo, who was taunted by
the cheering fans after the Flyers had tied the score. ``And he
whacked it out. But when you're up, 3-0, with three minutes left,
you shouldn't lose a point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two guys right there,'' Islanders Coach Bill Stewart
said of Sergei Nemchinov and Mark Lawrence, both draped over the
6-foot-4-inch, 238-pound Lindros as he scored the game-tying goal.
``You don't take the body on a guy like that. You take away his
stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart added, ``Maybe if we had a $40 million payroll, we
wouldn't be talking right now.'' For the Islanders (19-37-8), it
was one of their most embarrassing collapses of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Islanders played down the injury to Jonsson,
who missed a month earlier this season with post-concussion
syndrome. Jonsson, who left the game after receiving a stiff check
from LeClair behind the goal, will be examined in New York on
Sunday, and his status for that afternoon's home game against the
Devils is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling better,'' Jonsson said after the game. ``I had a
headache right away; they had a little concern about it. They
wanted to be cautious with me. I wanted to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilon's toughness was surely missed. The rugged defenseman had
done a fine job on Lindros and LeClair before twisting his back
trying to hit LeClair and leaving the game. He is also questionable
for the Devils game.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first period, the Islanders took a 1-0 lead on
a power-play goal by Zigmund Palffy at 1:53 of the second period.
It was his third goal in two games. Lawrence scored at 10:02 of the
third period, and Bryan Smolinski scored at 12:58 to stretch the
Islanders' lead to 3-0. It wouldn't last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on the bench was screaming that we shouldn't die,''
Lindros said. ``We knew that we could get something out of this if
we just kept coming at them.''  &QL;

ARIZONA PUTS THE HURT ON UCLA 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ They did not blame the officials. They did not blame
injuries. The UCLA Bruins blamed no one and nothing but themselves
for this debacle, since the answer was as clear as the desert sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no mystery to this, it was a good, old-fashioned
fanny-whooping,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said after an 87-70 loss
to Arizona on Saturday, before 14,545 at McKale Center. ``They were
tougher. They were smarter. They beat us in every phase of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Always the spin-meister, Lavin then said the Bruins' performance
``could not have come at a better time,'' because it will create a
sense of urgency with the NCAA Tournament beginning this week.
</P>
<P>
   He's right on one count: UCLA (22-8, 12-6) has played some of
its best games immediately following defeats. But a performance
this bad this late in the season could just as easily portend an
early tournament exit, especially with star guard Baron Davis
hobbling on an injured toe.
</P>
<P>
   Davis sprained the middle toe on his right foot in the final
minute of Thursday's victory at Arizona State. On Saturday, with
two minutes left and the Bruins trailing by 20, he aggravated it
and needed help leaving the court. X-rays were negative, and
afterward, Davis seemed resigned to playing in pain in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse,'' said Davis, who scored 21 points and played most
of the second half with four fouls.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins had plenty of other problems, beginning with
their half-court offense _ or lack thereof. They shot 38 percent
from the field, set a handful of screens and actually executed
their plan a few times.
</P>
<P>
   Like Arizona State, the Wildcats pressured the perimeter passing
lanes, making it difficult for UCLA to rotate the ball from one
side to the other. The Bruins' structure quickly broke down,
leaving behind the same wild shots and one-on-one play that
dominated their attack two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put up too many 3s,'' forward JaRon Rush said. ``We weren't
patient enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona forward Gene Edgerson's critique was not as kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played scatterball, playground ball,'' Edgerson said.
``You don't win in the tournament with that kind of ball. You'd be
lucky to win the first-round game.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's offensive problems started inside, where skinny forward
Jerome Moiso was helpless against Arizona's big men. They moved him
out of the low post and used well-honed techniques to lure him into
foul trouble. Moiso wanted no part of the rough stuff, scoring four
points and grabbing three rebounds in 21 minutes. Without center
Dan Gadzuric, numbers like that will mean doom in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to deny me everything, and they did it well,''
Moiso said. ``We did not respond to adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso had no help. After playing well in three previous games
without Gadzuric, the trio of Sean Farnham, Travis Reed and Matt
Barnes combined for two baskets and five rebounds. The Bruins had
no low-post presence, no consistent interior attack, and Arizona
feasted _ outrebounding UCLA 46-31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked before the game,'' Lavin said. ``I told them if we
got outrebounded, there was no way we could win.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona guard Jason Terry led all scorers with 26 points in his
final home game. Immaculately prepared, Arizona shot 53 percent in
the first half and built a 52-36 lead, dominating as UCLA did in
the Pauley Pavilion meeting two months ago. Back then, the Wildcats
righted themselves and made a late-game charge.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Bruins had no such mettle, wasting several chances
midway through the second half with bad shots and spotty 3-point
defense. The lopsided outcome was reminiscent of UCLA's Senior Day
visit here in 1993, when it lost 99-80.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to regroup and get ready for (the
tournament),'' Reed said. ``If we don't regroup fast, it'll be over
in a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Guard Ray Young played only a few seconds because of a
hip pointer suffered at Arizona State, but he expects to be ready
for the tournament. Guard Brandon Loyd did not play because of a
bruised right (shooting) hand.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was named to the coaches' All-Conference team but did not
win Player of the Year; that honor went to Terry. JaRon Rush and
Gadzuric were selected to the All-Freshman team. Arizona's Michael
Wright was named Freshman of the Year. Stanford's Mike Montgomery
was selected Coach of the Year.

SILVER CHARM LOSING HIS LUSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ This time, like last time, Silver Charm's problem was
his starting spot, in the spur-of-the-moment opinion of his
trainer. Too far from the rail when he ran third in the Donn
Handicap in Florida, too !ital!close!off! to the rail when he ran
third in Saturday's Santa Anita Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post position got him again,'' Bob Baffert said down at
trackside moments after the horses crossed the wire. Hemmed in
behind Free House, the eventual winner, and Dr Fong, a 20-1 shot,
``he had no place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame Baffert if he strains for excuses after Silver
Charm records the worst back-to-back finishes of his career?
</P>
<P>
   It was this colt, by coming within a New York split-second of
sweeping the Triple Crown two years ago, who turned Baffert into
his sport's two-footed star, his prematurely white mop of hair
recognized even beyond the racetrack gates.
</P>
<P>
   In January, when Baffert was in Miami during Super Bowl week,
racing publicists took him to the football press room one day, and
the radio talk-show boys lined up to interview him. A horse
trainer!
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm did that for him, a feat of magic for which the
wise-cracking Baffert is just introspective enough to be grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Given their history, it must be hard for Baffert to admit Silver
Charm's magic is gone.
</P>
<P>
   So instead Baffert said: ``He was trapped all the way around
there. That's why I hate the 1 hole (post position).''
</P>
<P>
   Too far inside? Too far outside? The truth lies somewhere in
between.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that even if the 62nd Santa Anita Handicap didn't
tell us who's the No. 1 older thoroughbred in America, it did tell
us who's not.
</P>
<P>
   After beginning the season as his species' undisputed leader,
Silver Charm has some catching up to do now. The 5-year-old gray
horse ain't what he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was closing at the end,'' said his jockey, Gary Stevens.
``But he's still not the Silver Charm I'm used to riding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Silver Charm that Stevens is used to riding is the one who
ranks third all-time in earnings with $6.8 million and this month
was listed by a Blood-Horse magazine panel as No. 63 among the
century's hundreds of thousands of racing thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   And mind you, there's not a big difference between greatness and
a third-place finish in the deepest Big 'Cap in memory. Silver
Charm finished only a length behind Free House and half a length
behind runner-up Event of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in a race that close, drawing a bad post position could
have made the difference. But so could losing a step.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said during the week that given the strength of the
six-horse field, Silver Charm would ``have to run the best race of
his life to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. And you could see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida's Gulfstream Park, Stevens and Silver Charm, breaking
from post 12, had dropped nine lengths behind the leaders to avoid
being swept wide in the clubhouse turn. It proved to be too much
ground to make up and they finished five behind winner Puerto
Madero.
</P>
<P>
   Since Silver Charm had to rally from far back to win his
season-opening race at Santa Anita, handicappers wondered if he'd
simply lost his early speed, a dangerous trend if true.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of fast workouts, designed to drill the speed
back into him, Silver Charm raced close to one of the slowest Big
'Cap paces in decades. With one-quarter mile to go in the 1\-mile
race, he was sitting fourth, tucked in behind Free House, Dr Fong
and inside Event of the Year. Puerto Madero, not himself Saturday,
was safely back in fifth.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the stretch, Silver Charm swung into a clear path
and fixed his sights on the leaders. Stevens went to the whip. But
in the final 440 yards, covered in an ordinary 25.21 seconds, they
made up only a little more than one length. They never looked like
the winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed by his effort,'' Stevens said. ``I don't
think they can say, `He ran another bad race.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, none of his opponents would say anything so
disrespectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver Charm has been one of the best horses in North America
for the last couple of years. You can't knock his record,'' said
John Toffan, who, with Trudy McCaffery, owns Free House, a loser of
four in a row to Silver Charm before Saturday. ``If you beat Silver
Charm, you've got a pretty good horse.''
</P>
<P>
   When Silver Charm inched closer in the stretch, Toffan admits he
thought, ``Here we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   He was thinking of the Silver Charm of the Derby, the Preakness
and the Goodwood Handicap last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember,'' McCaffery said, ``Silver Charm's
danced a lot of dances. If he's just got a little tired, I can't
say I blame him. But I don't think we've seen the end of Silver
Charm.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out soon enough. Retirement is not in the plans. He
could try to defend his title at the March 28 Dubai World Cup. The
``NTRA Champions on Fox'' series, of which the Big 'Cap was the
second leg, also is laid out before him, even if it's no longer his
for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   What Silver Charm needs is a big victory to restore his
reputation. That or a fresh excuse. &QL;

GARBAGE TRANSFER STATIONS FACE CIVIL RIGHTS INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal government will conduct a broad civil
rights investigation into a Bronx congressman's allegations that
the concentration of dozens of garbage transfer stations in the
South Bronx discriminates against minority residents, federal
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The formal inquiry is the first of its kind in New York state
and one of a handful of environmental justice investigations the
government has launched nationwide, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It will seek to determine whether dozens of garbage transfer
stations, and the hundreds of trucks that feed them, have spawned
widespread respiratory and other health problems that violate the
civil rights of South Bronx residents, the vast majority of whom
are black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   If the government concludes that the stations are in violation,
it could cost New York City ``tens of millions'' a year in federal
aid, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously very serious,'' Jeanne Fox, the EPA regional
administrator for several states including New York, said at a
conference in New York City among federal officials and
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about, `Was a group discriminated against in an
environmental manner?' '' Ms. Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will be led by officials from the EPA and two
investigators from the U.S.Justice Department: Bill Lan Lee, the
agency's chief civil rights investigator, and Lois J. Schiffer, an
assistant attorney general in the environment and natural resources
division.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to launch the investigation follows a monthslong
campaign by U.S. Rep. Jose E. Serrano, a Democrat from the Bronx,
to call attention to the high concentration of garbage transfer
stations in the Hunts Point, Mott Haven and Port Morris
neighborhoods, which form the heart of his 16th Congressional
District.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In December, Serrano filed a formal request with the EPA, asking
the agency to look into whether the approximately 35 garbage
transfer stations in those communities, which have more than 95
percent black or Hispanic residents, have affected the health of
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The 35 transfer stations handle about half of the city's
commercial waste, Serrano said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was announced late Saturday afternoon by
Bradley Campbell, of the White House's Council on Environmental
Quality, after an eight-hour conference among about 100 people,
including officials from several federal agencies and
representatives from city and regional environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the officials toured the South Bronx and parts of
Brooklyn, which have large concentrations of garbage transfer
stations.
</P>
<P>
   After Campbell outlined the scope of the inquiry, a spokesman
for Serrano, Luis Torres, said, ``That's all the congressman
wanted, a serious investigation into the siting of these
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone late Saturday, Joseph J. Lhota, the deputy
mayor for operations, said that he had not been aware of the
inquiry but added that the city would cooperate with federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation is to begin before the end of
September, Ms. Fox said, and is expected to take a few months to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Though it opens a new chapter of federal efforts to evaluate
environmental justice claims in New York state, Ms. Fox said the
investigation follows similar inquiries in Louisiana, Michigan and
other states.
</P>
<P>
   The South Bronx transfer stations, most of which are privately
owned but licensed by the city and state, serve as temporary
collection bins for a good portion of the 13,000 tons of garbage
that New York City generates and sends to landfills every day.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them operate in residential neighborhoods, EPA officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   To bear out Serrano's civil rights claims, federal investigators
would have to conclude that the stations have an adverse effect on
his constituency's collective health, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They also would have to find that the adverse effects, whether
intentional or not, disproportionately affect members of minority
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the federal investigation will be a search for clues
that suggest a causal link between the transfer stations and
asthma, respiratory infections and other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But measuring the effects of legions of garbage trucks or
polluted runoff from the stations will not be easy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waste-transfer issue is difficult because we don't have a
full understanding of their impact,'' Bonnie Bellow, an EPA
spokeswoman, said at Saturday's conference. ``This is kind of new
territory.''

CHARTER SCHOOLS SHOW NO SIGN OF SLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flagstaff offers full-day kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa now enrolls pupils who turn five late in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Creek tossed aside its superintendent and is pumping more
phonics into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   From the Navajo Nation to Nogales, public school districts are
taking extraordinary _ and some say long-overdue _ measures to keep
students from defecting to Arizona's charter school explosion.
</P>
<P>
   No longer are traditional public schools a monopoly _ their
charter-school siblings, who emerged nipping at their heels in
1995, charter law passed 94 are now major players in Arizona
education.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one quarter of all the nation's charter schools are in
Arizona, where 270 charters serve about 30,000 students. Four years
ago, some 50 charters in Arizona housed 7,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Public school districts are still way ahead, enrolling 750,000.
Both charter schools and district schools are free to students and
get an average of $4,800 in state aid for each student in their
desks.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the state, schools superintendents and boards are
changing programs in response to the new competition. In Mesa last
year, the district went so far as to advertise for students and
promote its full plate of educational fare.
</P>
<P>
   Many are spicing up their curricula to try to match the
enticements of charter schools, which often offer a focused diet of
arts, technology or back-to-basics entrees catering to niche
children, a category that includes both gifted kids and academic
strugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to survive, we had to quit our whining and do a
better job ourselves,'' said Kent Matheson, former superintendent
of Flagstaff Public Schools, who launched a variety of programs in
his district to dazzle students bent on leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it's too early to tag an ``A'' or an ``F'' on the
charter school revolution. There isn't a lot of information
available to compare _ head-to-head _ the academic performance of
charters and districts.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years of wide-ranging, consistent standardized test
scores are available, and Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards
won't begin until this spring. Much of the evidence at this point
is anecdotal.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, a growing number of parents are choosing
charters.
</P>
<P>
   And in no other city in the state are charters more concentrated
than in Mesa, home to Arizona's largest school district, with
70,000 students. About 50 charter schools have taken up residence.
</P>
<P>
   At least two national studies have put Mesa under a microscope,
deeming it the perfect place to take a hard look at the impact _
both good and bad _ of charter schools on districts.
</P>
<P>
   Critics rail against the burgeoning charter school system,
saying it is mushrooming out of control without enough
accountability. Most charters aren't accredited, some employ
noncertified teachers, and most inhabit such places as strip malls,
churches and apartment complexes.
</P>
<P>
   Those critics assert that districts do a better job than
charters, offering something for all students, including sports and
other extracurricular activities that most charters don't offer.
And stricter regulations govern districts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Hartley, D-northwest Phoenix, said she hasn't seen any
charters that are doing anything that isn't already being done in
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the incubators of education reform that they
promised to be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates cite a list of pluses: smaller classes, one-on-one
attention, the perception of safer campuses, and more access to
educators and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charters seem to be more influenced by what we want,'' said
Karla Freeman, who lives next door to a Mesa district school under
construction but sends her boy to Life Elementary School, a charter
in Mesa. ``There's an intimacy here. That in itself would keep me
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many educators say charters are spurring districts to offer more
specialized programs and to pay closer heed to parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charter schools make us look at ourselves and see what we can
do better,'' said Robert Meko, principal of Mendoza Elementary
School, an arts-based Mesa district school with a new
early-kindergarten program.
</P>
<P>
   Charters have their fair share of problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, youth at the Arizona Career and Technology High School
in Mesa were left out in the cold when the school folded amid
allegations of financial mismanagement by the operator, who had
once served time in jail on a drug charge. The problems escalated
because the charter holder, the Window Rock Unified School
District, was too far away to keep an eye on the school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the founder of another charter, Citizen 2000, was
accused of spending more than $100,000 in state money to buy a
Biltmore-area home for her mother and jewelry for herself. The
school closed and went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   One reason charters are gaining popularity is that many burrow
into niches. They may target at-risk students, those who want to
acquire vocational skills, pupils who want to quicken their pace to
college, or those interested in honing artistic talents.
</P>
<P>
   Charter-school director Mike Matwick uses computer-based
learning at the Arizona Career Academy in Mesa to reach the
previously unreachable: teen parents, law breakers, high school
dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaddie family has removed the frills from education and
returned to basics to hammer knowledge into students at Noah
Webster Basic School.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Alverson, director of several Mesa charters, hopes to open a
series of neighborhood charter schools that mirror districts'
programs without the overwhelming, overcrowded feel of many
district schools.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the far reaches of the country are taking note
of Arizona's charter school phenomenon. A handful of academic
research projects and national newspaper stories are focused on
Arizona and the dynamic between districts and charters.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the comments are glowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of chaos, a lot of confusion and a lot of
controversy, but I also saw (Arizona) districts that were
responding,'' said Eric Rofes, author of a national study of
charter schools' impact on school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Another still-to-be-published study focused primarily on
Arizona, discovered that although changes are being made within the
traditional system, many are cosmetic and fail to change the core
of public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found cheap, easy-to-do, cute solutions,'' said Rick Hess,
one of the four authors of the federally funded research project by
the nonpartisan Bodman Foundation in New York. ``But what we really
didn't see is the heavy-lifting'' or changes that tried to raise
the academic bar.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of state superintendents by University of Arizona
researchers reflects an even dimmer view of the effect of charters.
</P>
<P>
   About 57.5 percent of administrators polled said charter schools
cannot improve public education, while only 25 percent thought they
could. Fifty percent stated their districts have not been hurt by
or benefited from charter schools. &QL; 
No sharing system &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no system in place for charters to share creativity
with districts, the superintendents agreed. And charters aren't
clamoring to do it on their own. In fact, some refuse to talk to
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many school districts are reacting.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Mulholland, a researcher with Arizona State University's
Morrison Institute for Public Policy, said: ``People rarely like to
admit when something has caused them to change.''
</P>
<P>
   A study she wrote for the state Department of Education
evaluating the progress of charter schools will be released later
this month. She is working with national researchers to look at the
impact charter schools are having on Arizona districts.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland, like others before her, has keyed in on Mesa to show
that districts are battling with charters to keep students in their
desks.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between public schools and charters in Arizona
has followed an interesting course.
</P>
<P>
   When charters arrived on the scene, districts spread horror
stories about them, asserting that far-out institutions, such as
witchcraft schools, would spring up. They spun tales of doom about
a movement they thought would sputter and choke, several district
educators across the state have said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't, especially in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996-97 school year, about 900 of the Mesa district's
70,000 students transferred to charters. All 70 schools in this
suburban district, already a school-reform leader in the state,
lost at least one student.
</P>
<P>
   The district began listening more closely to parents' wishes.
Coincidentally or not, it opened a third back-to-basics school _
with a fourth slated to open this fall _ and began a
first-of-its-kind enrichment program for home-schoolers. It also
lent several of its teachers to an arts-based charter school and
converted its Montessori program into charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   The district made national headlines when it began advertising
for students. It also started promoting its cutting-edge programs,
including an elementary school transformed into an arts magnet the
year charter schools were written into the law. Mesa's Highland
Elementary School principal uses a glossy brochure and artsy video
to sell his wares.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Dixie Parrish is convinced she wouldn't enjoy so much
freedom if it weren't for the competitive atmosphere. On one Friday
last fall, students tie-dyed shirts in one classroom and made
candles in another.
</P>
<P>
   By so reacting, it's as if many districts are reminding parents
that they offer good programs too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like looking at your wife and seeing someone
flirt with her. You ask yourself if you've told her you love her
enough times,'' explained Meko of Mendoza Elementary in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   The effects charter schools are having on traditional public
schools are not unique to Mesa. Take a look.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Creek, a rural district in the east Phoenix area that lost
one-third of its elementary-school students in fall 1996 to the Ben
Franklin Charter School, hired a new superintendent and began
teaching phonics. &QL; 
The `3 C's' &QL; 
In Flagstaff, former superintendent Matheson came up with the
``three C's'': compete, collaborate and be creative. All-day
kindergarten classes were added and several magnet schools opened
in the wake of charter schools. Today, the current superintendent
is trying to entice the award-winning Flagstaff Arts and Leadership
Academy, a charter, to nest under its wing.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Likes, superintendent of the one-school Higley district in
one of the fastest-growing areas in the Phoenix area, also felt the
ripple effect of charters. The east Phoenix-area district is
redoing its teacher evaluation and salary schedule systems after
seeing how charters have done them better.
</P>
<P>
   Likes is in a unique position, though. Realizing he could charge
schools a fee to sponsor their charter, he become the largest
district sponsor of charter schools in the country. He wanted to
use the money to funnel the dollars into his impoverished district.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Likes oversees 260 district students and 3,500 charter
students flung across the state in 28 schools _ none of them within
the boundaries of his district.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new business. It ``is'' a business. Let's not kid
ourselves,'' said Likes, who admitted he was as big a ``crybaby''
as anyone when charters first emerged.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he tiptoed into charterland. Now, he plows through it.
And reaps the monetary rewards.
</P>
<P>
   With the fees he has charged his charters, the district has been
able to gain a business office, a new principal and $25,000 in
computers and other high-tech gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Other districts are turning to charters, as well. The Florence
district even asked a charter school for at-risk students if it
would take some of the district's struggling students. &QL; 
Not all so positive &QL; 
However, not all districts have reacted so positively to the
charter school movement, according to educational observers.
</P>
<P>
   The Snowflake district said ``no way'' when the Mesa charter
school it sponsors and oversees asked to open a second site in
Pinetop, within the Snowflake district boundary. Too close for
comfort, officials readily admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Call it guerilla warfare. Other districts have refused to accept
charter school credits of students returning to the traditional
system. Mesa officials, who periodically thumb through charter
applications at the Department of Education, have leaked
anti-charter school stories to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Most public educators, however, are realizing that treating
charters as Public Enemy No. 1 won't serve them well in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent election cycle, more than a half-dozen east
Phoenix-area school board candidates said in their platforms that
district schools need to provide more alternatives to compete with
charters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way to improve the entire public system,'' said Lisa
Graham Keegan, state superintendent of public instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope the innovations would take hold.'' &QL;

ASU SEARCHES FOR AN IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Two hours before tipoff Bobby Lazor stood alone
on the arena floor and looked around at 14,000 vacant seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many are gonna be here?'' he wondered.
</P>
<P>
   The ASU senior absently bounced a basketball on the hardwood
floor. The sound in the empty building was hollow, which could
describe how Lazor later felt after he scored 30 points and grabbed
11 rebounds in another losing effort, this one against Southern
Cal, the final game of the Sun Devils season and Lazor's college
career.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance was _ 7,308?
</P>
<P>
   The head count must have included players, coaches, students,
alumni, vendors, Sparky, ASU cheerleaders, the ASU pep band, Ned
Wulk and perhaps a few folks wearing cowboy hats who put down money
at the Wells Fargo Arena window only to discover the tickets they
had purchased weren't for the George Strait concert.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw instead was another tough loss by a team with
limited talent. A team few people identified with. One few
supported.
</P>
<P>
   They saw first-year coach Rob Evans do everything he could to
keep ASU playing hard. And to match ``his'' intensity, his will to
win.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the second half Evans asked for and drew a
technical foul, hoping his display of ire directed toward the
myopic officiating crew would provide his tiring kids an energizing
spark.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils played hard. The team that has lost almost every
close Pac-10 game this season didn't quit. When Lazor who played 39
minutes walked off the court for the last time and his eyes met
those of his father who was waiting for him, Bobby was bone tired,
his gold jersey soaked with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Evans praised the effort of the team he inherited. But the
Devils suffered another losing season (14-16) and in this town
losing teams go largely ignored _ especially at a school that
hasn't given the public much to cheer about, basketballwise, in a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   Evans understands why ASU sold only 6,000 season tickets. He
isn't surprised that few students attend the games. Only 500 ASU
students at a school with an enrollment of more than 40,000 bought
basketball season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Student cost is $32 for 16 home games. That's $2 a game, less
than what it costs to rent a movie.
</P>
<P>
   One reason students ignore ASU basketball is because the program
hasn't produced many identifiable players in recently. Jake
Plummer, Keith Poole, Pat Tillman and Juan Roque played on winning
football teams. They also competed four years.
</P>
<P>
   ASU basketeers have come and gone, for various reasons. The
school honored three seniors before Saturday's game. Mike Batiste
misssed the first part of two of the last three seasons. Lazor, a
transfer from Syracuse, played only two years here. Ron DuBois is a
former walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   The most recognizable ASU basketball player this decade is
Stevin Smith of point-shaving fame. One ASU fan directed a sign he
made at the USC bench. It read, ``We May Have Hedake (Smith) But At
Least We Don't Have The Juice,'' referring to former Trojan O. J.
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery why ASU didn't sell out once. Exclude the
Arizona game (13,404) and the Sun Devils averaged 5,450.
</P>
<P>
   ASU hasn't beaten a Top 25 team at home since 1995. The Devils
haven't beaten UA and UCLA in the same season since 1985-86. The
last time the school advanced to the NCAA tournament in
back-to-back years (1979-80/80-81) the head coach was Ned Wulk.

   At halftime ASU honored Wulk, now 78, naming the court after
him. ``I hope you come back,`` he told the small enthusiastic
crowd. He could have added, as he did during Friday night's
function in his honor, ``And bring three or four friends with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans appreciates the former coach's public appeal for support.
What warms his heart even more is the collective talent of ASU's
nationally-ranked recruiting class. Donnell Knight. Tanner Shell.
Tommy Smith. Chris Osborne. Shawn Redhage. ASU may start three
freshmen next year. These are names to remember. Players to get
excited about. Athletes worth paying to see.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black, Evans looked and sounded like a minister
presiding at a funeral on the day ASU's season died and was laid to
rest. A time to mourn? Yes. ``It was a long road,'' the coach
solemnly intoned.
</P>
<P>
   But friends, glory awaits. There are great rewards in store for
those who do right and keep the faith. Evans envisions the day when
hopes will be lifted up. When ASU basketball will become a hot
ticket. When students will see the light and pack the student
section and Wells Fargo Arena will be transformed into a place as
bountiful and wondrous as heaven itself. ``Evvvvvverybody'' will
want to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will happen. Absolutely,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   I want to believe. I really do. &QL;

<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ It was Senior Day, an opportunity Saturday for
Arizona's fans to salute point guard Jason Terry and center A.J.
Bramlett, who came up big in their final home appearance.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be an even bigger day for the little guys _ role
players Ruben Douglas, Traves Wilson, Rick Anderson, Justin Wessel
and Eugene Edgerson _ who carried 13th-ranked Arizona past No. 12
UCLA, 87-70, ending the Bruins' five-game streak.
</P>
<P>
   Those lesser lights will determine how far the Wildcats advance
in the NCAA Tournament. If they play as they did Saturday, it could
be a long run, according to Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play like this I think we can go all the way to the
(Final) Four,'' said the senior point guard, who on Saturday
received his latest accolade, Pac-10 Player of the Year. ``This is
the best game we've played for 40 minutes, despite the 26
turnovers. The freshmen had no fear at all. That's going to be huge
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In blowing out the Bruins (22-8, 12-6 Pac-10), the Wildcats
(22-6, 13-5) claimed second place in the Pac-10, stretched their
home streak to 32 games, and appeared ready for their 15th straight
NCAA Tournament berth. They find out where they are seeded and
assigned this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Terry scored 26 points and made four steals, making him a close
winner in the point-guard shootout with UCLA's Baron Davis, who
scored 21 and had four steals. Terry's only flaw was losing control
of his emotions. He forced passes (seven turnovers), and received a
first-half technical foul for mouthing off to UCLA's JaRon Rush,
who also received one in the exchange. When the Bruins beat the
Wildcats in the Pac-10 opener in Los Angeles, Rush said the margin
would have been 30 points instead of seven if he had played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to jawing and I usually don't do that,'' Terry said. ``I
did take that comment personally, that's why my emotions were so
high for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Rush conceded that ``J.T. lit us up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett, who joined Terry on the all-conference first team
announced Saturday, posted his 16th double-double of the season,
the most at UA in 22 years and tying Phil Taylor for third on the
UA career list. Bramlett scored 14 points and had 10 rebounds to
lead Arizona's 46-31 board dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a physical game,'' Bramlett said. ``Everybody was
scrapping. Maybe they were a little frustrated. You could kind of
see it in their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   And that ultimately is what separated the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona quickly lost power forward Michael Wright, who played
only three minutes in the first half after receiving his second
personal foul. Wright, the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, is an
inside force, but without him the Wildcats did not panic.
</P>
<P>
   But when Davis got his second foul for the Bruins, just before
center Jerome Moiso got his second, they quickly became flustered.
Arizona broke the full-court press and got good looks at the
basket. Douglas (15 points, three three-pointers), Anderson (eight
points, two three-pointers) and Wilson (a three-point basket on the
only shot he took), along with inside enforcement from Edgerson
helped UA stretch a tie game at the 8:21 mark to a 16-point
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening half, the Wildcats made 7 of 9 three-point shots
(77.8 percent), 13 of 16 foul shots (81.3 percent) and had a
whopping 22-9 rebounding edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anderson gave us a big-time lift, and I'm not just talking
scoring,'' said UA Coach Lute Olson. ``I'm talking four assists and
no turnovers. That is key for us going into the playoffs. Wilson
came off the bench and played with confidence _ three assists and
no turnovers. We extended the lead when they came into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson preached defense hard after California shot just under 52
percent and Stanford 54 percent in two UA road losses the previous
week. The Wildcats got the message, limiting the Bruins to 38.1
percent, that after Southern California shot 43.3 percent as
Arizona blew it away, 88-73, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to go into the tournament too cocky,'' Rush
said. ``This game proves that we're not ready yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And it might have proved that Arizona is. &QL;

A DARK SIDE OF EXPANSION: HOUSING COSTS RISE RAPIDLY
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS to add 2 grafs before last graf, adding statistics on
dwindling number of low-cost housing units. ) (Eds: See also WVA-WELFARE-NYT.)

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A strong national economy that is rewarding many
Americans through steady employment, low interest rates and rising
stock prices is hurting millions of the nation's poorest people by
delaying their access to affordable housing, a new report by the
federal government says.
</P>
<P>
   Research collected by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development found that as the economy has expanded, poor people
have been waiting longer for public housing units, rental costs
have been increasing and the number of affordable units has been
falling as landlords seeking greater profits get out of the public
housing business.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, as many as 25 percent more families are on
waiting lists for affordable apartments than there were last year,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rising economic tide is raising many boats, but it is also
drowning some,'' said Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, reflecting
a report the department plans to release this week. ``As an
unintended consequence of this amazingly strong economy, there is
less affordable housing stock and the prices are beyond the reach
of those at the bottom of the income spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Those conclusions are generally shared by advocates for the poor
who have campaigned for years for more affordable housing. Maria
Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on
Homelessness and Poverty, said the findings of the report reflected
``the convergence of many different trends in the private markets
and public policy that are squeezing poor people the most.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paradox of booming times,'' Foscarinis said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to citing economic conditions for the housing
problems, the report, ``Waiting in Vain: An Update on America's
Housing Crisis,'' strikes a familiar note in blaming the
Republican-led Congress. Echoing one of Cuomo's frequent complaints
since he succeeded Henry Cisneros as secretary in 1995, it points
to a decision that year to stop increasing the amount of money to
expand rental subsidy programs after money had been appropriated
for an additional 230,000 households each year from 1978 to 1984
and for 126,000 households from 1985 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Cassidy, a spokesman for Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman
of the House housing subcommittee, said Lazio had not read the
report and could not comment on it until he did.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A House banking committee staff member who works on housing
issues and spoke on the condition of anonymity defended the
decision, saying that Congress stopped paying for new subsidies
because HUD could not account for money it already had.
</P>
<P>
   After the department put into effect plans to improve efficiency
and programs to weed out fraud and abuse in housing programs,
Congress passed new public housing legislation and agreed last year
to a request to authorize 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers, which
entitle the holder to a rent subsidy. The staff member said
lawmakers would authorize ``a reasonable number'' of new vouchers
in President Clinton's 2000 budget request.
</P>
<P>
   The new vouchers eased some of the growing demand for affordable
housing, but as the department report suggests, pressure has
continued to build.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the most alarming finding is that the time poor
families spend waiting for housing assistance _ a public housing
unit or a Section 8 voucher _ has grown longer, especially in big
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the average wait for a public housing unit
increased to 11 months last year from 10 months in 1996 and the
average wait for a voucher had increased to 28 months last year
from 26 months in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that the wait for housing had increased to
eight years in New York, six years in Oakland and up to five years
in Oakland and Washington; the wait for a voucher had stretched to
10 years in Newark and Los Angeles, seven years in Houston and five
years in Chicago and Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said a comparison of 18 cities in the last year
showed a 34 percent increase, to 660,000 from 500,000, in the
number of families waiting for a voucher.
</P>
<P>
   Among the economic conditions that most strikingly show how the
booming economy has progressed at the expense of the poor,
according to the report, is housing costs.
</P>
<P>
   While home ownership has reached a record level of 66.3 percent,
largely because low interest rates have offset rising home prices,
the rise in rents, 6.2 percent from 1996 through 1998, surpassed
the rise in income for the 20 percent of households with the lowest
incomes, Bureau of Labor Statistics says.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that the number of units that rent for less
than $300 fell, to 5.5 million in 1998 from 6.8 million two years
before, a drop of 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said housing prospects for the poor could grow worse
before they improve. The report said that last year, 13,000 units
in subsidy programs were lost when the property owners did not
renew their contracts with the housing department. This year,
contracts with owners of another 9,000 units expire, and officials
do not yet know how many of them plan to renew.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not mention any potential impact on housing
costs from welfare changes that began in 1996. A study by the
General Accounting Office in December said it was too soon to
determine the effects of lost welfare benefits on housing for the
poor.

FINLEY DECIDES IT'S OK TO BE LITTLE OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ For most of his major-league career, the Diamondbacks'
Steve Finley has made a name for himself with acrobatic catches in
center field, hustling for the extra base and flashing occasional
power.
</P>
<P>
   With his 34th birthday on Friday, Finley believes he has found a
training regimen to enhance his performance by putting less stress
on his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always looking for ways to get better,'' Finley said.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of spring training in 1998, he was introduced to a
kinesiologist in Dana Point, Calif., Dr. Edith Heus, who had
developed a training program with longtime personal trainer Marv
Marinovich, father of former NFL quarterback Todd Marinovich.
</P>
<P>
   Because the regular season was just beginning for the San Diego
Padres, Finley couldn't begin the program, but as soon as the club
was swept by the New York Yankees in the World Series, he began.
</P>
<P>
   Its working title is the Pro Sports Tech System. The technical
name is proprioception, ``where the brain knows where the body is
in space.''
</P>
<P>
   In more basic terms, it means to allow the body to maintain
better balance during athletic competition with an exercise program
in which the participant goes through training while off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   It involves resistance training and includes standing and moving
on ``wobble disks'' and large gymnastics balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way I can describe an example of being off-balance is
a big offensive lineman in football who is blocking against an
opponent,'' Finley said. ``The lineman is stronger than anyone, but
it probably wouldn't take much to push him off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In baseball, you're always making quick movements, reactions.
A lot of the time, you're working off-balance. But by working all
the muscles during this program, you aren't out of balance out
there nearly as often.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think Finley is speaking gibberish, think again. He has a
degree in physiology from Southern Illinois and was accepted to a
chiropractic school in St. Louis before pursuing his baseball
career.
</P>
<P>
   Finley has brought his own equipment to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the guys might think I'm a little crazy, but
all I care about is the results,'' said the two-time National
League Gold Glove winner.
</P>
<P>
   The workout apparently has the blessing of team strength and
conditioning coach Jeff Forney, who plans to try it, Finley said,
``so he knows what I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer version lasts 90 minutes and the shorter version
about 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I would call revolutionary, it's just very
subtle,'' Finley said.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich has worked with hundreds of college athletes and said
that although there is something to be said for a lot of muscle
mass, ``those guys tend to be worse athletically. They do not seem
to be as productive as some of the other guys who are more
balanced, where the body works together as a unit. This is more of
a total workout, and there's not as much strain on the joints.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a great athlete, you don't need to look like Arnold
(Schwarzenegger). Cosmetics and performance are two different
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich said his son, who is considering a return to the NFL,
works with the program, as do New York Giants safety Jason Sehorn,
Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown and several ``ultimate
fighting'' participants.
</P>
<P>
   Heus said the workout begins with stretching the muscles at the
core of the spine and then fans out. In addition to the wobble
discs and gymnastics balls, modified weight-training machines are
used and there is some rowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the body becomes more efficient,'' Heus said.
``You don't feel wiped out like you do after some workouts, the
body is not broken down. It should help create some endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your average athlete can benefit by this, too, not just those
in the pros and college. Success from this is not, `You either have
it or you don't.' It's not genetically related.'' &QL;

PATAKI MUTES CALL FOR CHANGE IN DRUG LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a significant policy shift, the Pataki
administration has backed away from any major overhaul of the stiff
Rockefeller-era drug laws that have caused New York's prison
population to surge over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, administration officials say they are considering more
modest changes, like allowing appeals judges to reduce the
sentences of people who have been convicted of low-level drug
offenses when the penalties they receive far outweigh their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, shortly after taking office, Pataki proposed
overhauling the drug laws, saying that the stiff sentences they
require had packed state prisons with nonviolent drug addicts who
might be better off in drug treatment programs or some other
cheaper alternatives to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers had been making similar arguments for
years, though they were derided as soft on crime. But when Pataki,
a Republican, made his comments, the proposal was hailed as a
breakthrough that could result in the first major changes to the
drug laws since they were enacted in 1973 under another Republican
governor, Nelson A. Rockefeller. Pataki has been under mounting
pressure to revamp the laws ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But in a lengthy interview on Friday, Katherine N. Lapp, the
governor's top criminal justice adviser, said the Pataki
administration saw no reason now to overhaul the laws, largely
because the governor had adopted several early-release programs,
including drug treatment, as an alternative to prison for low-level
drug offenders, virtually all of them addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lapp said the governor's aggressive use of such programs had
saved the state the expense of building 5,000 more medium-security
cells over the last four years while it kept the most dangerous
drug criminals behind bars. These offenders include people who have
prior records of conviction or were convicted of drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Let's repeal the Rockefeller drug laws,''' she
said. ``But that would be contrary to public safety. The
overwhelming majority of drug offenders in our prison system today
have earned their way into the system because of their
background.'' Ms. Lapp added, ``Wholesale changes would be
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lapp's comments come as a broad coalition of judges,
criminologists and politicians from both parties have begun an
aggressive campaign urging Pataki and the Legislature to scale back
the drug laws drastically, if not repeal them altogether, during
the current legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks disappointed those advocates, who had been counting
on the governor to lead the fight for overhauling the laws. They
reiterated their concern that the laws have needlessly increased
prison costs without significantly reducing the problem of illegal
drug use and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gangi, the director of the Correctional Association of
New York, a prison watchdog group that supports changing the laws,
said the state was still imprisoning thousands of nonviolent drug
users who were not major dealers but sold drugs or committed other
crimes to support their habits. He said it would be more
cost-efficient and humane to put them in drug treatment programs
rather than prison. ``Their addiction drives their criminal
activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki's new position drew strong support from prosecutors
and other law-enforcement officials who have sought to block any
wholesale revision of the drug laws. They argue that the laws
enable them to force drug offenders to accept lower charges or even
placement in drug-treatment programs in exchange for lesser
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased to hear this from the governor,'' said
William J. Fitzpatrick, the president of the New York State
District Attorneys Association. ``We use the Rockefeller drug laws
as a weapon to ferret out criminal activity, and I think we are
pretty discreet in its application and in who we try to put in
prison.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The timing of the policy shift may have political ramifications
for the governor. He is currently exploring the possibility of
running for national office, and his desire to avoid overhauling
the drug laws would play well among conservatives who are
influential in the national Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But some political experts believe it is more likely that his
new position is an opening bid in negotiations with Democrats in
the Assembly who have long sought wholesale revisions to the drug
laws. Indeed, Ms. Lapp said that the administration would only
agree to revise the laws in exchange for the Assembly's support of
the governor's proposal to eliminate parole for all nonviolent
felons. ( Pataki has already pushed through bills eliminating
parole for violent felons.)
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1973 Rockefeller drug laws, judges must abide by rigid
sentencing guidelines that require long prison terms for drug
offenses, even relatively minor ones like possessing a small
quantity of narcotics. Under a similar law passed that same year,
the sentences increase sharply when a person is convicted of a
second felony within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, nearly 22,000 of the state's 70,000 prisoners were
incarcerated for nonviolent drug crimes, at a cost of about $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration contends that more than half of those
had been convicted of other crimes as well. Ms. Lapp said that 29
percent were convicted for illegal use of weapons, 15 percent for
robbery, 9 percent for assault and 6 percent for burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lapp also said that the administration has managed to halt
the rapid growth of the population of nonviolent drug offenders in
the prison system for the first time in nearly two decades. It has
done so, she said, by employing early-release programs on a
case-by-case basis.  &QL;

PHOENIX OPEN MUST PRESERVE ITS IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - So the elitists will get their way. Their golf
tournament will once again be sanitized, hosed down, cleansed of
the common folk.
</P>
<P>
   So the Phoenix Open will become just another boring stop on the
tour. Another anonymous tea party of knit shirts and coddled
sponsors. Just another perfectly putrid, self-contained corporate
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Just another cash grab to fill time between the majors.
</P>
<P>
   When a sport deems itself sacred, there is no room for fun. But
this isn't about loud mouths or public drunkenness or galleries
that haven't been brainwashed by the politics of polite. This is
about killing an institution, the Mardis Gras of golf. A tournament
championed as a cultural event, embraced for its revelry.
</P>
<P>
   For the very things the Thunderbirds are trying to kill.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, sweeping changes are in the works following a wave
of bad publicity. In the wake of an alcohol ban that didn't work
and a gun found in a fanny pack comes radical reform. Ideas ranging
from weekly passes priced at $150 to limits on alcohol consumption
to artificial measures designed to restrict attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Ever hear of a sporting event so callous? So self-important that
it wants to handpick its following? So stodgy that a proposed price
increase is designed not to make money but to weed out the
undesirables?
</P>
<P>
   So snobbish that it casts judgment on its fan base?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, when a gun-toting, beer-chugging goofball charges a
police officer, there is room for concern. But isn't it ironic how
tournament officials once went out of their way to downplay the
significance of Brian K. Murphy? And now he's the symbol of pending
disaster?
</P>
<P>
   If he is truly an aberration, treat him like one.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, there is some middle ground here. Some way to appease
the golfers and the PGA Tour without ripping the personality out of
the Phoenix Open. A tournament so popular that it has become a part
of our sporting culture, an event so different that it's recognized
across the country. And it's not like the Valley has an excess of
national identity.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 40,000 people gathered around the 16th hole
on a Saturday afternoon. Television cameras were everywhere. And
there wasn't a viewer in the nation who didn't watch the
proceedings and wonder, ``Whoa, is that really golf?''
</P>
<P>
   The Thunderbirds don't know how good they had it.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, one of the premier players on tour, called No. 16
the ``most unique hole we'll play all year.'' Do they understand
the significance of such a statement?
</P>
<P>
   It is a testament that should be treasured, trumpeted, marketed,
parlayed into big-time prominence. The Phoenix Open could've been
the most unique non-major on tour. Instead, they are running from
their fears, into the safety of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Magee, a Paradise Valley resident and new match-play
celebrity, told ``The Republic'' on Friday that the Phoenix Open
was ahead of its time. That the rebellious crowds were preparing
golfers for ``the next generation of golf fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Magee recognizes one key factor: If you can't boo, it's
not a sport. And you can't appeal to a new generation with an
antique mindset clinging to country club traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Open should hold firm. Put the emphasis on the fans,
not the golfers. Increase plain-clothed security. Announce severe
penalties to any fan who crosses the line, most notably its new ban
on guns. Promote the tournament as the future of golf, and if a
handful of professionals want no part of it, fine. Fill the field
with guys who do.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, if raucous galleries are really a glimpse of the
future, the TPC will be remembered as ground zero, the origin of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they want the silence of etiquette to prevail, the frat
house kicked off campus. They want a nice, quiet tournament. They
want to appease the PGA Tour, appear dignified, disgusted by the
monster they unknowingly created. They want to fill their corporate
tents, sell their identity to sponsors, limit alcohol to a quaint
beer garden, reward the sheep who wouldn't dare boo a shot in the
bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Thunderbirds:
</P>
<P>
   Careful what you wish for. Silence can be deadly. &QL;

RACE MORE BORE THAN ROAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Those weren't the throaty roars of engines heard
Friday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   They were snores.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an impeccable performance by Mark Martin and several
NASCAR Winston Cup buddies, a crowd of 72,500 was forced to endure
more than two hours of a yawning Sam's Town 300.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who with 35 wins is the NASCAR Busch Series all-time
leader, led 150 of 200 laps, including 89 of the final 90.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the car to beat all weekend,'' Martin said. ``The
thing was really hooked up today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cup regulars, of which there were a robust 16 in a starting
field of 43, dominated their Busch counterparts, which may not
necessarily be good news for NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials made a preseason marketing pitch to make
certain everyone understood the Busch Series could stand on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not NASCAR's minor league,'' NASCAR official Kevin
Triplett said.
</P>
<P>
   OK, then why allow so many Cup drivers in a Busch race, which,
in turn, sends several Busch regulars home early?
</P>
<P>
   Although many Busch drivers encourage the Cup invasion because
they feel it enables them to gain valuable experience, how much can
be learned when the Cup regulars combine to lead all but 14 laps
and collar the top five finishing positions.
</P>
<P>
   Not much, that's how much.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite, Martin insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Busch regulars) could look at what we did and say it can
be done,'' Martin said. ``All the parts are available to everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we started running so well (in the Busch Series) in the
(1990s), the Busch regulars have really stepped it up. They thought
they were doing all they could, then we sort of raised the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, they went back to work and figured out what to do to
raise the bar for themselves. There's some really great talented
teams and drivers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But none were able to flex their Busch muscles against the Cup
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Following Martin across the finish-line were Joe Nemechek, Jeff
Burton, Jeff Gordon and Jimmy Spencer. And Burton now leads the
driver's standings in a series in which he's only a part-time
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Defending series champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. (sixth) was the top
Busch finisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with the (Cup drivers),'' Dale Jr.,
said. ``But it's a shame because some people that were up in the
points, like Casey Atwood, had to go home and that makes you sick
to your stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Busch Series isn't going to thrive off the Winston Cup
drivers. It's going to thrive off the Busch drivers. But, then
again, it's a double-edged sword. Those guys come into our series
and we get a chance to compete against them. There's no feeling
like running with guys like Mark Martin. It's a good
confidence-builder.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's confidence builder was knowing his car wasn't entirely
perfect, but it didn't need to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off a little too loose and we tightened it up a
little bit too much,'' said Martin, who started from the pole
position and won $87,625 from a $1,053,728 purse. ``On the last
stop, we wound up going half in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin could have instructed his pit crew to install a luggage
rack on the roof and he still probably would have had the
aerodynamic sleekness to put away Nemechek and company.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who was making his first Busch start in seven years,
struggled with a nagging handling problem throughout most of the
race. Although he edged Earnhardt Jr., in their initial Busch
showdown, Gordon, believe it or not, was a non-factor.
</P>
<P>
   He never led and never came close to leading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed on the gear and we were way too tight,'' Gordon
said. ``It took us a little while to get it dialed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he started next to Martin on the front row, Gordon
immediately went in another direction. He went backwards, dropping
to fifth by Lap 2.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Lap 24, Dale Jr., passed Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The move invoked cheers. And some boos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess all the fans want to know how I feel about the first
time me and (Gordon) have run in the Busch Series together,'' Dale
Jr. said. ``I really enjoyed it. To run second to that guy is not a
bad day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best. Everyone wants to be where he's at right now. I
have a lot of admiration for him. He's good at what he does and
that's where we all want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Martin. Martin seems content right where he's at. &QL;

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ A year ago, the Las Vegas 400 might as well have
been a New York City fashion stage for the Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   Models dressed as NASCAR Winston Cup drivers paraded the
aerodynamically sleek machinery down the Las Vegas Motor Speedway
runway, capturing 13 of the top 14 finishing positions in a nearly
endless conga line of superiority.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Calvin Klein would have been proud.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford's reign could be over.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bobby Labonte put a  &UR; Joe Gibbs-owned Pontiac on the pole
position for today's Las Vegas 400 and has a front-row neighbor in
Chevy's  &UR; Michael
 &UR; Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   The top Ford qualifier is road-racing specialist  &UR; Tom Hubert,
who will start fourth next to Chevy's  &UR; Joe  &UR; Nemechek.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy's  &UR; Mike Skinner will start fifth, but the next five are in
Fords.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's race also provided little side-by-side racing and
that, too, could change.
</P>
<P>
   Rule changes allowing for larger rear spoilers and smaller front
air dams have drivers believing there will be less
follow-the-leader racing and more door-to-door racing.

   &UR; Kyle Petty and  &UR; Ted Musgrave failed to qualify, and  &UR; Rusty

provisionals to make the 43-car starting field.

POLITICAL FORCES COMPLICATE DISPOSAL OF CHEMICALS, EXPLOSIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It would have been difficult enough for Gov. Hull's
office just to decide how to dispose of more than 800 pounds of
potentially lethal chemicals and explosives left in a shed by a
``gun nut.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a lot more than explosive chemicals to worry
about. There were also some volatile political forces at work.
</P>
<P>
   There were the New River residents, some concerned by rumors
spread on the Internet, who told Hull they distrusted the federal
government's claims that it could burn up the chemicals without
endangering the community.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three miles away there was the massive 5,856-acre
Anthem community, owned by the Del Webb Corp., a powerful developer
and a key Hull campaign contributor, that was opening its doors for
business.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a federal agency, the Environmental Protection
Agency, that was proposing to incinerate the chemicals and evacuate
some nearby residents in the very same month (March) that thousands
of Anthem buyers were to arrive for the development's highly
publicized grand opening.
</P>
<P>
   So for the governor, it was not just an environmental problem
but a safety issue and a political headache.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 21, Del Webb told the EPA in a letter that to incinerate
the chemicals when thousands of people were visiting Anthem between
Feb. 27 and April 1 ``could be close to disastrous in terms of
traffic, crowd control, media exposure and criticism, availability
of appropriate fire and sheriff's resources, and overall community
relations.'' The EPA had been considering conducting the burn in
March because it wanted to complete it before the beginning of the
fire season.
</P>
<P>
   But after weighing everyone's objections, Hull appeared to go
out of her way to antagonize the EPA _ denouncing its leaders as a
group of ``bumbling bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA took charge of a property formerly occupied by Charles
``Chuck'' Byers in Sept. 17, 1997, after it was discovered Byers
was storing explosives and chemicals for making munitions there.
The ranch is in the 44800 block of North 27th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by Hull's critical words on talk radio and her lack of
support for its cleanup plan, the EPA told the state to finish the
job itself and pick up the tab estimated in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to proceed and take care of it, but we wanted to do
it with the state's full support,'' EPA Regional Administrator
Felicia Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Also withdrawing was the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, which had been providing security at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt federal departure has put the governor in the
position of having to explain why she rebuffed two agencies that
that had already spent more than $1.5 million to clean up and
secure the mess and were prepared to spend more.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's office acknowledges that Del Webb's concerns played a
role in her reluctance to back the EPA's plan, but her spokespeople
deny that the developer's influence outweighed other, equally
serious considerations. To understand the story, the Hull aides
said, you have to appreciate the depth of skepticism held by many
New River residents toward the EPA. Her staff members say local
citizens were always their primary concern.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb was a significant campaign backer of Hull's. Phil Dion,
Del Webb's chief executive officer, arranged a fund-raising
luncheon for Hull in Las Vegas in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it (Anthem) is a big development, and I know that Del
Webb has communicated their concerns to the governor,'' said Hull
spokeswoman Francie Noyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that they're not part of the reason (to reject
the incineration for now),'' she added. ``But they are by no means
the major consideration here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Pappas, community and public relations manager for
Anthem, said the development had communicated its concerns to the
EPA only because it had been advised by the Maricopa County
Sheriffs Office to let the federal government know of any
`significant events'' occurring during the planned incineration.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's office said many of the New River citizens don't believe
the agency's claims that burning the chemicals can be done without
contaminating the ground, water or air.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know if their kids are going to be playing in
dirt that's contaminated,'' said George Weisz, executive assistant
to Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents think the cache of 800 pounds of chemicals and up
to 100 pounds of explosives should simply be carted away. Most of
the chemicals in the shed _ the non-explosive ones _ already have
been removed by federal cleanup crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state can finish this up without even causing a bang,''
said Byers, now lives in the Ahwatukee Foothills. He pleaded guilty
to munitions-related crimes in January and was put on probation for
five years. The judge called him a ``gun nut.''
</P>
<P>
   Byers has accused the ATF of corruption and alleges that the CIA
has taken part in drug running and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rumors have spread on the Internet that the EPA has
been using its incineration proposal to try to drive down property
rates because the U.S. is secretly planning a federal buyout.
Hostility toward the federal government in New River reached a
point where Marcus believed there was a ``safety concern'' for her
EPA employees.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA, which denies the Internet rumors, believes the
chemicals are too volatile to be transported out of the shed. Many
of the chemicals are unlabeled. All are believed to be precursors
to manufacturing explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go in with a robot and pick it up, and you can't
send anyone in, or else you might get an unplanned fire and
explosion,'' said Paula Bruin, an EPA spokeswoman. ``A burn is
controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA said it has been prepared to destroy the witches' brew since
October 1997 but that the state needed reassurance. Marcus said the
Department of Defense subsequently endorsed the plan, and an Army
Corps of Engineers contractor ranked on-site burning as the safest
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor is still not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, Hull spokeswoman Noyes said, is that the
EPA has not answered all of the state's questions and has not
communicated well with New River citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that if this thing had been handled a little more
quickly and if they had talked to the people up there, it wouldn't
have gotten to the place it's at,'' Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   But Marcus said, ``We did engage the community and individuals
for countless hours and put out the best information we had.'' A
timeline released by the EPA shows numerous meetings and other
contacts between the agency and New River citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said the governor didn't intend to chase the EPA and ATF
off the project, adding that the state was surprised when it was
notified they were pulling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way anybody wanted this to go. It has been
really unfortunate,'' Noyes said. &QL; 
Republic writer Brent Whiting contributed to this report.

  LOS ANGELES: said Mayor Dan Kuperberg.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kurtz has said if the Agoura-Las Virgenes Chamber of Commerce
doesn't attract more businesses, it may have to merge with
neighboring chambers. That's been another trend of the '90s for
chambers: merging smaller groups to form regional entities that
better reflect the regional nature of business. After all, a
business won't turn away a customer just because she lives five
miles down the freeway in another town.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of thinking that brought together the Chatsworth
and Northridge chambers, though merger talks are on hold for now.
</P>
<P>
   If talks are revived, said Chatsworth's Himes, it would be
because the benefits of merging include economies of scale plus
some added clout in lobbying efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're approximately the same size; we'd be speaking with twice
the voice, so to speak,'' Himes said.
</P>
<P>
   And the merged chambers could attract more members _ and more
money. About half the Chatsworth chamber's approximately $100,000
budget comes from membership dues, Himes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some anecdotal evidence that there were people who
were on the fence; that if there was a merger they would be
interested in joining again,'' Himes said. ``Right or wrong, there
is this concept that if you are bigger, you are better.''
</P>
<P>
   Operations have rolled along at the Mid Valley Chamber of
Commerce, which covers the Los Angeles city communities of Van
Nuys, Panorama City and North Hills _ but not without some
difficulty, executive vice president Nancy Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the health of my chamber's improving,'' she said.
``We've struggled, too _ we had some really rough years _ and we're
finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, which we thought
would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can almost change the light bulb at the end of the
tunnel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 percent of the chamber's $330,000 budget comes from
member dues.
</P>
<P>
   Membership has fluctuated over five years for various reasons:
569 in fiscal 1994; 533 in 1995; 559 in 1996, the year of a major
membership drive; 509 in 1997; and 503 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple explanation for the 1996-97 drop: About 50
percent of members recruited during drives typically drop out after
the first year, Hoffman and other chamber officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just us _ it's a known fact,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber, or its committees, have adopted several measures to
boost or retain membership. In 1997, for example, a Latino Business
Development Committee was formed to increase chamber representation
of Latinos, who constitute a bulk of business owners in the
northeast San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the organization in 1997 appointed a member services
coordinator. In addition, the Mid Valley Chamber of Commerce stays
in regular contact with its members to remind them of events and
other activities of interest.
</P>
<P>
   And it recently brought in a telemarketing volunteer, whose
duties include those simple ``hi'' calls to members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for money; we're not reminding them of
events,'' Hoffman said. ``We're just reminding them that we're here
if they need anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working. Membership in fiscal year 1999, which
ends March 31, was 538, up nearly 7 percent from the prior year. &QL;

CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE TRY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES TO RECRUIT MEMBERS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ed Kurtz would walk a mile _ or more _ to promote
a new business association he hopes will breathe new life into the
struggling Agoura-Las Virgenes Chamber of Commerce in the Agoura
Hills community northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In Van Nuys in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, Nancy Hoffman
and her Mid Valley Chamber of Commerce team let their fingers do
the walking, phoning local businesses just to say hi and let them
know the chamber is there for them any time they need.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz and Hoffman are top people at their chambers _ Kurtz the
new president of the Agoura-Las Virgenes chamber, Hoffman the Mid
Valley's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   They are fighting to boost _ or just hang onto _ their
memberships.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers throughout California are losing members in part
because business people want them to go beyond their traditional
role as networking organizations, said Kathy Fairbanks, a
spokeswoman for the 11,000-member California Chamber of Commerce in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses aren't just joining chambers for the sake of
joining chambers anymore,'' Fairbanks said. ``They want to get
something out of it such as advocacy at the local level with city
councils and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many chambers are doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Kurtz and Hoffman _ and executives like them across
the region and across the country _ are canvassing their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of chambers are really growing in size, because they're
really active in the community and serving businesses in the
community really well,'' Fairbanks said.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Fernando Valley, many chambers were hit hard by the
1994 Northridge Earthquake, said Les Himes, president of the
260-member Chatsworth/Porter Ranch Chamber of Commerce in north San
Fernando Valley, which until recently had been in merger talks with
the Northridge chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses were destroyed or damaged, and their owners had
to devote more time and resources to rebuilding them, he said.
Organizational dues were some of the first items cut in their
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the economic recession of the early 1990s forced some
businesses to close their doors, he said. Meanwhile, many surviving
businesses had to cut their staffs, forcing their owners to devote
more time to managing and operating them.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of all this was that merchants had less time _ and
money _ for their chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general feeling throughout the chamber business that
things were off a little bit,'' Himes said. ``There's also a
feeling that there's an upswell of improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   A more activist role is what Kurtz _ a former Agoura Hills
council member and mayor _ had in mind when he formed the Agoura
Hills Merchants Association, which had its first meeting on Feb.
22.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the prior two weeks beating the pavement, distributing
several hundred fliers announcing the first meeting to every
business in the city.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 merchants, plus some city officials, turned out for the
meeting, a small but promising first step in getting the new
association off the ground, Kurtz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new concept; it's never been done before _ 10 people
could mushroom to 20 people,'' Kurtz said. ``I'm cautiously
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that first came to Kurtz some five years ago. But
he put it into action now to reverse the sagging fortunes of the
50-year-old Agoura-Las Virgenes chamber.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly alarmed that about 40 percent of the
chamber's members are from outside Agoura Hills _ an indication, to
Kurtz, that the chamber is becoming too regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Agoura-Las Virgenes chamber has some 365 members, according
to executive director Diana Malmquist.
</P>
<P>
   The new association is intended to boost local membership in the
chamber by demonstrating its benefits to local merchants.
</P>
<P>
   It would do four things: educate merchants about rules and
ordinances affecting them, such as regulations on outdoor displays;
re-establish the ``shop Agoura Hills'' campaign; expand the
chamber's annual business fair; and organize a citywide Midnight
Madness sale during which stores in the city would remain open
through midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that if merchants prosper, so will the city, since
35 percent of the city's $6.6 million general fund is derived from
sales tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's interests and the businesses' interests coincide
perfectly,'' said Mayor Dan Kuperberg.
</P>

COYOTES FANS FLOCK TO RALLY FOR PROPOSED NEW ARENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ They didn't wait in line for more than an
hour to discuss taxes, traffic, redevelopment or whatever else many
Scottsdale residents think a new hockey arena might bring to their
town.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the families at a Saturday rally for a new arena at Los
Arcos Mall just wanted to see the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   They lined up some 300 deep, many wearing thick maroon-and-green
hockey jerseys in the 79-degree afternoon sun, to get autographs
outside the aging mall.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd don't even live in Scottsdale and are
ineligible to vote in the May election that will decide whether the
new arena is built. But whatever the Coyotes want, fans said, they
want, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for it if it makes them happy,'' said Kurt May, 12, who
added Coyotes center Daniel Briere's and forward Brad Isbister's
autographs to his jersey. The Peoria sixth-grader already had
Jeremy Roenick's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got him at the Exxon station.''
</P>
<P>
   And Teppo Numminen's _ ``I ran all over the Ice Den for a pen
once I saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of arena supporters staged the rally and autograph
session in hopes of gaining support for the May 18 election, when
Scottsdale residents will vote on the City Council's December
decision to form a stadium district. The district would pay for the
mall's proposed $624 million redevelopment, including a 20,000-seat
arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes now play at America West Arena, where, from about
4,200 of the seats, fans can see only one goal.
</P>
<P>
   They registered voters, played street hockey and raffled off
game tickets as Howlin' Tommy Rox and the Phoenix Coyotes played
classic rock such as ``Mustang Sally'' and songs that evoked the
sounds of a hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   They say the proposed 20,000-seat arena will revive the almost
deserted mall, where the shadow of Sears remains along with only a
handful of stores and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 feet away, pacing the sidewalks surrounding the mall,
arena opponents passed out fliers, waved handmade signs and yelled
into bullhorns, hoping to fight the development at the corner of
McDowell and Scottsdale roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will destroy our neighborhood,'' said Eric Auxier,
36, an America West Airlines pilot who can see the old Sears
building from his driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Auxier bought the home he grew up in, hoping to
return to the quiet, modest neighborhood of block homes he
remembers from childhood. Now, he worries he'll back right up to
the sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, organized by No Pucks _ Neighborhoods Organized to
Prevent Unwanted Community Killing in Scottsdale _ is all the
protesters feel they can do to sway voters their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need all this congestion here,'' says Scottsdale
resident Theresa Halverson, holding a ``No arena'' sign in one hand
and passing out fliers to passing cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait till the traffic stops,'' her cousin, 72-year-old Nancy
Brown, chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   The two worry the arena will change the pace of their
comfortable south Scottsdale neighborhood. As Halverson, 62,
watched Coyotes sign autographs in the shade, she wondered aloud
why they didn't come talk to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't they come over here and ask me what I want?'' asked
the retired office worker. ``This arena won't help them win any
faster.'' &QL;

TRADE RUMORS ABOUND IN NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case we are being heckled by a special-interest lobby, it
should be noted that no agents were harmed in the production of
this column.
</P>
<P>
   Any violence against agents has been simulated. Actually, we
have made every attempt to avoid the use of agents, because our
topic is this week's NBA trading deadline (Thursday), and seeking
insight about trades from an agent is about as ill-advised as
asking a mugger for directions to the nearest ATM.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the league's new corrective bartering agreement has put
the ``dead'' in trading deadline. Clearing room beneath its nastier
salary cap seems to be at the top of each team's ``to-do'' list.
Well, unless that elbow injury has left his jumper with the
accuracy of a five-day weather forecast, Glen Rice still is
expected to be acquired by the Lakers. But most general managers
are concentrating on dumping salaries, throwing them overboard like
a collection of Boz Skaggs albums cluttering the passenger basket
hanging beneath an endangered hot-air balloon.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? If everyone's doing it, then who's left to do any
trading?
</P>
<P>
   Teams that are one warm body shy of evolving from playoff
pretenders into contenders.
</P>
<P>
   George Karl, stunt double for John Lithgow and coach of the
playoff-sniffing Milwaukee Bucks, knows his frontcourt has less
depth than a half-hour of ``Friends.'' Last week, George accused
the Clippers of having ``get-able'' frontcourt players, but
wondered who in his right mind would want players from a winless
team.
</P>
<P>
   If one of those players is second-year power forward Maurice
Taylor, the answer is ``everybody.'' For the last several days,
trade talks with the Clippers begin and end, quickly, with Taylor,
who - rest assured, Clipper fans - is as untouchable as your wife's
meatloaf. The Philadelphia 76ers, who recently won six games in a
row for the first time since Coach Larry Brown began talking to and
answering himself, reportedly discussed a deal involving talented
Tim Thomas, but Taylor isn't moving.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas? He's making $1.8 million in the second of his three-year
deal. Nobody else in that price neighborhood (and the cap dictates
that salaries conform in these deals) is near his level of talent.
So for the Sixers to acquire anyone capable of helping them advance
in the playoffs, the other team probably would have to toss in
another player to achieve a salary match; that would leave the
other team with an extra body and, perhaps, an extra contract to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   OK, as the start of March Madness approaches (savvy NBA timing,
eh?), a deal should be swung here and there. Don't be stunned if
the struggling New Jersey Nets - who have a few big-ticket players
playing the same positions - ship somebody somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But simply clearing cap room is no guaranteed solution, so help
us Jerry Krause. Since the new contract allows only a potential
free agent's team to pony up the maximum scoots, many in the
eagerly awaited talent avalanche have re-enlisted with their
current teams.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the deadline for teams to re-sign players they don't
mind having around is Saturday. After Saturday comes and goes,
contract chat is to be forbidden until July 1, and signing a free
agent from another team isn't legal until Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   sub UF5 Worm 2000
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman, the Krazy Glue threatening to hold the Lakers
together, may be Laker enough to join the team in its move to the
Staples Center. But Dennis, who signed for the $1 million exception
(which sounds like the plot line from the movie ``Indecent
Proposal''), would be limited to just a 10 percent raise.
</P>
<P>
   After two Laker seasons, he'd be eligible for big money ... at
age 39.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rodman could make up the difference by going
Hollywood, which now is within walking distance. Remember, with
Rodman and Rick Fox, the Laker bench has more film experience than
its starting lineup (sorry, Shaq).
</P>
<P>
   Fox had a nice role in ``He Got Game,'' leading Jesus
(Shuttlesworth) into temptation.
</P>
<P>
   As the co-star of ``Double Team,'' Rodman led Jean-Claude Van
Damme into early video rental.
</P>
<P>
   sub UF5 Clip and save department
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, as you may know, are owned by Donald T. Sterling.
Wouldn't it be nice if the ``T'' stood for Terrell, as in Brandon?
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Brandon plays point guard very well for Milwaukee. He
will be a free agent at the end of this season, because he is not
wild about a bratwurst-case scenario and refuses to re-sign with
the Bucks until testing the free-agent market. Brandon has said he
will sign with the team that really wants him, and money may not be
the lead variable (uh-huh).
</P>
<P>
   His agent is Bill Duffy, who also represents Clipper rookie
center Michael Olowokandi and may not mind steering Brandon to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have eight players in the last year of their
contracts; by not re-signing all of them (except Tyrone Nesby),
they could clear, oh, $15 million or so in cap room and still have
eight bodies under contract.
</P>
<P>
   With two more rookies (the Clips should be hell in lottery
Ping-Pong), and two free agents (including Brandon for a hard pinch
or two over $10 million per year), the Clippers could be in
business.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is convincing Sterling to pay one player more then 10
large ones. Here's a hint: giving the loot to a great player just
before moving into a new arena with the Lakers beats dividing it
among three medicore players.
</P>
<P>
   sub UF5 Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Olden Polynice was fined last week for making an obscene gesture
for the benefit of his old fans in Sacramento. Actually, Olden was
using a finger to signal how many times he will have appeared in an
All-Star Game the next time he's chosen for that honor. ... Further
evidence that the only Nelson who belongs in Texas is Willie, not
Don: With Paul Pierce, Jason Williams and Larry Hughes still on the
draft board last year, Nellie selected Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor,
then shipped him to the Bucks for Dirk ``Apocalypse'' Nowitzki. He
also sent this year's No. 1 pick (a lottery likelihood) to Phoenix
in exchange for its backup point guard, Steve Nash. ... According
to rumor, No. 1 Clipper fan Billy Crystal is writing the screenplay
for a film about the coach of his favorite team. The working title
is ``Analyze Chris.''

GRAND OPENING OF `ANTHEM' PLANNED COMMUNITY IN PHOENIX DRAWS
THOUSANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Take a retired Marine Corps colonel, a family of four
and a golf fanatic, throw in some snowbirds and a couple of
nudists, and you get a good idea of who showed up to see the newest
development in the north Phoenix- area:
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's grand opening of Anthem _ a widely-hyped
master-planned community that spans 6,000 acres _ drew home buyers
and curiosity seekers from as close as neighboring New River and as
far as Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees walked alongside young couples. Self-described country
folk mixed with city dwellers. The country club set inspected wine
cellars while families checked out kitchen space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking for four years,'' said James Laseter, 70, a
retired colonel with the U.S. Marine Corp. who lives in Hawaii. ``I
haven't found anything I like as much as this.''
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics came out too on Saturday, scratching their heads at
the thought of this large community rising from the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stop development,'' said Charlie Gross, 65, who
lives on an acre-lot in nearby Black Canyon City. ``But I couldn't
stand anyone living that close to me. I don't want to hear my
neighbors. All I hear now is dogs occassionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Min Lussier got dressed and bicycled over from the
nearby nudist colony in New River. Residents drive on dirt roads
and rely on wells and septic tanks in rural community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just wondering what it's going to do to the water
supply, and the impact it will have on the desert,'' said Bob
Lussier.
</P>
<P>
   By Anthem estimates, over 6,000 people showed up Saturday. That
almost matched the number who decended on the development last
weekend during a frenzied pre-grand opening sale.
</P>
<P>
   People with invitations and gate crashers quickly snatched up
lots _ leaving Anthem security and sales reps overwhelmed and
prospective homebuyers irked when they couldn't buy a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem officials then released another 200 lots for this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Developer Del Webb Corp., planned on selling 1,000 lots over 12
months, starting this month. Several hundred have been sold so far,
exceeding expectations, said Anne Mariucci, a senior vice president
with Del Webb. She declined to give an exact number of home sales.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the buying frenzy last weekend, people entered
drawings for appointments with sales reps on Saturday. Drawings
will also be held from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Laseter, who was visiting from Hawaii, grabbed a lot in the
country club community. For him, Anthem's location is ideal for
visiting his children in both Gilbert and Sedona, but also offers
the ammenities he wants like golf.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Winerkoorn , 77, was also drawn by the links.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play three or four times a week,'' he said. ``I will buy
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone touring Anthem jumped at the chance to sign on
the dotted line.
</P>
<P>
   At a drawing in the lesser-expensive Parkside community, the
first two potential buyers for 10 lots decided to pass _ one
changed his mind and the other wanted a better pick of lots.
</P>
<P>
   And Al McLeod, who toured the property with his wife Martha via
shuttle bus, ``just wanted to check out the options. We're just
kicking the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bob and Jean Moody, who live in the Deer Valley area, came
with checkbook in hand. They want their three kids to grow up
outside the city, and said the the development's price range and
ammenties won them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a good investment and a good place to
live,'' said Bob Moody. &QL;

ODOM IS HOT SHOT IN LIFTING URI 
</HEADLINE>
 10 FINAL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It was a huge gamble from the beginning. The
university enrolled him as a non-scholarship, non-matriculating
student, never guaranteeing him full admission. He went nearly two
years without playing organized basketball, including one at his
third and final high school. Twice he bolted from the university,
including one time after the exam period, only to return and start
anew.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Lamar Odom became eligible to play at the University
of Rhode Island, many wondered how long he would stay before
vaulting to the NBA. Questions persisted as to whether he was worth
the effort, the risk and the criticism URI absorbed for opening its
doors to him.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   With 6.1 seconds left in Saturday's Atlantic 10 tournament
championship game, the sophomore sensation from New York firmly
etched his place in URI and A-10 basketball lore. He dribbled to
the left wing, and with Temple forward Keaton Sanders guarding
heavily, he drilled a 24-foot trey at the buzzer to give the Rams a
thrilling 62-59 tourney victory over Temple and the league's
automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, the A-10 rookie of the year, finished with 21 points and
10 rebounds for URI (20-12), which won its first title game in
three finals appearances. He also became the league's first rookie
to win tournament outstanding player honor since freshman Alex
Bradley of Villanova in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Odom initially signed a national letter of intent to attend
Nevada-Las Vegas out of high school but a Sports Illustrated
article questioning the validity of his admissions test scores
prompted the school to release him from the letter.
</P>
<P>
   He reacquainted himself with URI coach Jim Harrick, who had
recruited Odom when he was mentor at UCLA. And after a lengthy
process to obtain eligibility, Odom began his much-anticipated
career this season.
</P>
<P>
   His winning shot Saturday sent the URI faithful among a crowd of
10,167 into bedlam, and left a partisan-Temple crowd of 10,167
stunned.
</P>
<P>
   It also prompted Odom to weep openly moments after the feat and
in the postgame press conference 15 minutes later. ``I dreamed
about it all my life, but I can't even explain how I feels,'' said
Odom. ``I didn't know it was in until it went in. I guess it was a
lucky shot. I tried to jump over him and shoot him and I got a good
look, I just let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he felt at the moment considering all he had been
through, Odom began, ``It's like heaven,'' then he broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord works in mysterious ways,'' interjected Harrick,
while patting Odom on the back. ``He's made this young guy go
through a lot of adversity and the rewards are tremendous,
certainly at the end of the rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick added that the shot conjured up memories of Odom's first
collegiate game, when he slipped past Texas Christian's Vladimir
Jacksic on a crossover dribble, drove into the paint, and scored on
a finger roll with 5.7 seconds left to lead the Rams to a
season-opening 87-85 win over TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got in the huddle, I said, `Hey, he hit the first shot
against Texas Christian on a layup. We're going to go from the
first game to the last game on the same play.' (URI guard Preston)
Murphy spotted up and so did (URI guard Tip) Vinson. But I saw in
his eyes that he was going to take the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple coach John Chaney said the Owls defended Odom to the
sideline to give him a bad angle to shoot. ``And he finished it,
like he's supposed to finish,'' said Chaney, whose team (21-10) is
a virtual lock for the NCAA Tournament. ``He's a pure shooter and
there's nobody in the country better than he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments before Odom's heroics, Temple had a chance to take the
lead, but guard Pepe Sanchez (8 points), who all but ceased
shooting after a horrid game from the floor (3 of 16, including 1
of 11 from 3-point range) misfired again, and Odom got the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that when you're open and you stop
shooting, you put pressure on your other teammates,'' said Chaney,
whose players struggled from the perimeter throughout the game and
blew a chance to pull away after leading, 36-27, with 19:04 left in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont Barnes led Temple with 19 points and nine rebounds but
took only four shots in the second half. Sharp-shooting forward
Mark Karcher added 16, including a trey with 1:26 left to put
Temple ahead, 59-57, but even he struggled, going 2 for 9 from the
floor in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   URI forward Antonio Reynolds-Dean (7 points) scored with 48
seconds left to tie the game at 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful basketball game between two wonderful
clubs,'' said Harrick. ``It was bad someone had to lose, but we
needed it more than Temple.''

   After completing the first phase of its season by winning the
conference regular-season championship for an unprecedented fifth
time in the last six years, the top-seeded University of

   For the seventh time in the league's 20-year history, the
tournament championship was decided by a pair of finalists ranked
in the Top 10. But the No. 3 Huskies (28-2) demonstrated their
championship mettle with a sustained and savage beating of
10th-ranked St. John's (25-8) to enter the third phase of their
season, the NCAA Tournament, as a likely No. 1 seed in the South
Region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of energy we brought out in the first half and at the
start of the second half is the kind of energy we're going to need
next week,'' said UConn coach Jim Calhoun, whose team won its
fourth tourney title in the last five years to become the second
team behind Georgetown (6) to win back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
   Junior swingman Richard Hamilton, who shared conference player
of the year honors with Miami's Tim James, led the Huskies with 23
points on 8-for-11 shooting and grabbed 7 rebounds while sophomore
guard Khalid El-Amin scored 15 and Rashamel Jones had 11 points off
the bench, all in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can now say that in 32 of 33 games we played, we had a
chance to win,'' said St. John's coach Mike Jarvis, who was
accompanied by the team chaplain to his postgame press conference.
``Tonight was the first one, I guess in a way you can say, that we
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, having conserved much of their energy after
breezing to a 71-50 romp over Syracuse in the semifinals, came out
of the box looking very much like a band of whippets in streaking
to a 13-0 lead. Hamilton set the frenetic pace by scoring UConn's
first 7 points in a row _ on a layup, a 3-pointer and a baseline
jumper _ after the first 1:29 had elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin followed with a top-of-the-key trey and then found Kevin
Freeman with a pretty alley-oop feed that turned into a
crowd-igniting dunk for an 11-0 lead, prompting St. John's coach
Mike Jarvis to signal for a 20-second time out. It was of little
use, however, as UConn extended it to 13-0 when Hamilton let fly of
a stop-and-pop jumper at the 16:50 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley, who led St. John's with 18 points before fouling
out with 33.7 seconds left, got the Red Storm on the board when he
hit a pair of free throws with 16:20 to go. The Huskies threatened
to bury St. John's in the first half when they led by 17 four
times, but the Storm refused to cave and finally made their stand
in the final 5:02 by going on a 10-0 run to rally from a 34-17
deficit to within 7, 34-27, on a 3-pointer by Marvis ``Bootsy''
Thornton (17 points) with 55 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared St. John's had finally gained some
momentum by drawing within 37-29 on Artest's low-post move with
eight seconds to go before intermission, UConn quickly wrested it
away. With five seconds left, Ricky Moore took an inbounds pass and
relayed a midcourt bounce pass to El-Amin. With the clock ticking
toward zero, El-Amin took the ball, spun away from a double-team
trap, and let heave of a 40-footer that found its mark at the
buzzer, giving the Huskies a 40-29 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good play,'' El-Amin said. ``Just the way coach drew
it up on the sideline, and we just executed it the way he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half began much like the first after the Huskies
scored 11 unanswered points to build a 51-29 lead with 15:50 to go.
Freeman, who was snubbed by the league's coaches when the
all-conference teams were released last Monday but was voted the
tourney's most outstanding player, expanded it to 25 points, 61-36,
when he stepped to the line to the chants of ``MVP! MVP! MVP!'' and
sank a free throw with 10:11 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not making one of the teams really hurt me,'' Freeman said.
``But this is probably the best thing that could've happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Artest sparked and capped a 12-6 run with a driving layup and a
3-point strike that cut UConn's lead to 66-50. Thornton hit a free
throw with 3:17 to go that drew St. John's within 15, 68-53, but
that was as close as the Storm got to putting a damper on UConn's
banner night and season.

UCONN SENDS A MESSAGE? 
</HEADLINE>
 EAST-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The message the University of Connecticut seemed to
be sending Saturday &UR;  &LR; night was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to trash us?'' the Huskies seemed to be saying.
``Talk about how we had `run out of gas'? Suggest that this will be
another season ending in the frustration of not making the Final
Four? Concede the national championship to Duke?''
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, fire away. But be careful. Underestimating this team
might be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no one in the sellout crowd of 19,548 who came to
Madison Square Garden to watch the Huskies and St. John's joust for
the Big East tournament title should have any doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Not after the way the No. 3-ranked Huskies took apart the
Johnnies, 82-63, in what was more a scrimmage than a contest. The
Huskies took a 13-0 lead and never stopped running, playing
defense, or hustling.
</P>
<P>
   It was fine preparation for the NCAA Tournament, which will
begin this week with the Huskies as a No. 1 seed in some region
other than the East, which will belong to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, that's the way UConn coach Jim Calhoun wanted
it. Winning this tournament in the 20th anniversary of the Big East
was a nice fringe benefit, but it wasn't essential. Calhoun didn't
treat it that way, as he mixed and matched lineups, defenses, and
offensive styles, getting a look at such seldom-used players as
Souleymane Wane.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, once the game started, Calhoun had his ``A'' game face on,
chewing on the officials and his players the way he always does.
Calhoun is of the old school that says if you are going to keep
school, you might as well try and win.
</P>
<P>
   But the tension that will be present when the one-and-done
tourney begins was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to win this tournament,'' said Calhoun. ``We
proved ourselves during the 18 games (of the Big East regular
season). But we're getting back to where I want us to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The place that Calhoun and his team want to be at the end of the
month is in St. Petersburg at the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   As every Husky fan from Norwalk to Storrs will be happy to tell
you, that is a place that no UConn team has been.
</P>
<P>
   With that comes inherant pressure, since the Huskies have
accomplished all they can at their current level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get there (Final Four),'' said Calhoun, with a smile,
``I won't be a better coach. If we don't, I won't be a worse coach,
you can be sure of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The players say that if there is pressure, it is a kind they
like. ``A fun kind of pressure,'' said forward Richard Hamilton,
who scored a game-high 23 points and is getting healthier each game
after a month-long recovery from a thigh contusion. ``Our goals at
the start of the season were to win the Big East regular season, to
win the Big East tournament, and to win the NCAAs. But we want to
win for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have done that in reaching their first two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun began preparing the Huskies for their third goal after
they won a rematch with Syracuse in the Carrier Dome on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   His game plans started to include a more liberal use of his
bench and experimentation with different defenses, different
lineups. He also tried to get his team healthier _ Hamilton and
center Jake Voskuhl (foot) had been the primary patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did get healthier,'' he said. ``That was the biggest key.''
</P>
<P>
   Being healthier has made the Huskies happier.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone understands that this week will bring new pressures.
The 28 games the Huskies have won will mean nothing. They will be
0-0, along with 63 other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun says it doesn't matter to which regional his team is
sent as much as who is waiting for the Huskies when they get there.
``I'm a bracket guy, much more than a geography guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the final line of the Big East championship
bracket had the Huskies on top.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time for satisfaction but not celebration. The Huskies
didn't cut down the nets. They didn't go wild in their postgame
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the thousands of fans who at times had made the Garden
sound like Gampel Pavillion sent the true message on which all
Husky fans are now focusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Duke,'' they started chanting with 3:06 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   If UConn can continue to play the way they did Saturday &UR;  &LR; night,
they might indeed get an opportunity to dance with the Devils.

FREE HOUSE DAZZLES IN BIG 'CAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- Chris McCarron is a little new to this Silver
Charm-Free House rivalry, but it didn't take the jockey long to
know the score after winning Saturday's Grade I $1 million Santa
Anita Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 5-3 now,'' McCarron said in the jockeys' room after
guiding Free House to a half-length victory over Event of the Year
in a much-anticipated race that lived up to its hype.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, the even-money favorite, had a rough trip from the
No.1 post position and finished third. Silver Charm and jockey Gary
Stevens encountered traffic problems around the clubhouse turn and
near the five-eighths pole before unleashing a closing surge in the
final eighth of a mile that fell one length short.
</P>
<P>
   It was Free House's second victory in a $1 million race in the
past seven months -- he also won the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in
August -- and it ended a four-race losing streak to Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to beat Silver Charm again,'' co-owner John Toffan
said. ``I was beginning to think it wouldn't happen, although I
still feel we should have won the (1997) Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Free House's last victory against Silver Charm before Saturday
came in the 1997 Santa Anita Derby. Silver Charm got the best of
the 5-year-old California-bred in all three Triple Crown races that
year, and he continued his dominance with a 2 1/2-length victory in
the Goodwood Breeders' Cup Handicap at Oak Tree in October.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm still holds the overall edge, but Free House is
beginning to stamp himself as a horse you don't want to let have
the lead. The son of Smokester went gate to wire in winning the San
Antonio Handicap last month, and he duplicated the feat Saturday to
give trainer Paco Gonzalez his first Big 'Cap victory and McCarron
his second.
</P>
<P>
   Once McCarron overcame a rough start, it was clear sailing. Free
House hopped in the air a bit at the beginning, but he was in front
by a head the first time past the grandstand and kept the lead
while posting fractions of :23.56, :47.40 and 1:11.46 en route to a
final clocking of 2:00.67 for the 1 1/4 miles on the main track.
</P>
<P>
   Longshot Dr Fong pressed Free House early, and Event of the Year
and Silver Charm took turns with late bids. But Free House, the 4-1
third choice, found another gear to record his ninth victory in 21
starts.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron said he knew Free House was going to be tough to catch
when he chirped to him on the far turn and could feel he had a lot
of horse left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked down at the fuel gauge and saw the needle still on
full and I thought, `Man, this is awesome,''' McCarron said. ``I
went ahead and tapped him on the shoulder and he just jumped
forward, sort of like Alysheba did when he won the (1988) Santa
Anita Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that same feeling of acceleration. It's fun when you get
that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Nakatani, who rode Event of the Year: ``Free House just ran
a great race. There's not many horses who could have beaten my
horse today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Free House was the best horse on the track today because he
took the track early, and he didn't relinquish it,'' McCarron said.
``They took shots at him all the way around there ... Dr Fong,
Event of the Year from the three-eighths pole, and Silver Charm
very late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all had a chance to run by him, but the best horse won
the race today.''
</P>
<P>
   Free House returned $10.20, $5.20 and $2.80 and spoiled Richard
Mandella's bid to become the first trainer to saddle three
consecutive Big 'Cap winners. Mandella saddled Event of the Year
and 5-2 second choice Puerto Madero, who finished a disappointing
fifth in the six-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero was coming off a huge score in the Donn Handicap
on Jan.31, but the Chilean-bred never resembled the horse that
romped by 2 3/4 lengths in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened to him,'' Mandella said. ``It
didn't look like he had his mind on his job early. He just looked
like the first eighth of a mile he didn't have his heart in it.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCarron, it was his 17th mount in the Santa Anita Handicap
and continued a run of good luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventeen is my lucky number,'' he said. ``I got married on
the 17th, (wife) Judy was born on the 17th and I beat Sandy
Hawley's record of 515 winners on Dec.17, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of good things have happened to me on the 17th.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron has won four times in six attempts as the rider of Free
House, who tied Puerto Madero atop the NTRA's ``Champions on Fox''
series standings with his latest victory.

PIMLICO SPECIAL NEXT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- John Toffan, co-owner of Free House with Trudy
McCaffery, said Saturday's winner of the $1 million Santa Anita
Handicap may run next in the Pimlico Special in May.
</P>
<P>
   The horse's connections are pointing the horse toward the next
stop on the NTRA's ``Champions on Fox'' series -- the Hollywood
Gold Cup in June -- and Toffan said they would like to give Free
House a race between now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spacing (between races) is there, and he likes the
track,'' Toffan said of the Pimlico Special.
</P>
<P>
   Free House ran second to Silver Charm, losing by a head, in the
1997 Preakness Stakes at Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Smith, ridden by Garrett Gomez, lost the lead to 3-2
favorite Hawksley Hill in midstretch but rallied back along the
rail to win Saturday's Grade II Arcadia Handicap by a head.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Smith, trained by Bruce Jackson, ran the mile on the turf
in 1:34.53 and returned $16, $6 and $3.
</P>
<P>
   Hawksley Hill, who ran a similar race in the Breeders' Cup Mile
in November when Da Hoss re-rallied to win by a head, won last
year's Arcadia Handicap with Pat Day aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Jose Valdivia, Jr. guided 5-2 second choice Big Jag to a
half-length victory in the seven-furlong Grade II San Carlos
Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Big Jag overcame a stewards' inquiry and paid $7.80, $3 and
$2.20 while beating even-money favorite Kona Gold. The final time
was 1:21.18.
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold also ran in last November's Breeders' Cup, finishing
third at 16-1 in the Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita offered a $1 million guaranteed Pick Six pool
Saturday, and there were 29 winning tickets.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect ticket, which was made difficult by 12-1 longshot Jack
The Bull's victory in the eighth race, paid $28,065.80.

BRADLEY AND GORE COMPETE FOR DONORS IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the contest for votes in next year's New Jersey
presidential primary, even Vice President Al Gore's supporters
agree that former Sen. Bill Bradley is likely to win his home state
going away.
</P>
<P>
   But in a battle of nearly equal importance _ for New Jersey
money _ Gore's team is not yielding an inch, and politicians from
both camps say the vice president will probably reap as much
campaign cash from the state as the favorite son, and perhaps more.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey has always been very rich in terms of giving to
politicians on the national level,'' said state Sen. Richard J.
Codey, the minority leader who is helping run Bradley's New Jersey
campaign. ``I'm sure they'll do well.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is of more than academic interest. To many
politicians, the presidential campaign season starts not in Iowa or
New Hampshire next year, but with the filing of the first campaign
finance reports with the Federal Election Commission next month.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, having run in three presidential campaigns since 1988 and
served as vice president for six years, has assembled a loyal
network of supporters capable of raising large amounts of money in
just about every state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who represented New Jersey in the Senate for 18 years,
has many wealthy supporters in New York, Illinois and California,
but nothing to rival Gore's fund-raising apparatus. To a large
extent, Bradley is counting on New Jersey to be his base of
financial support. So how well he does in the Garden State's money
sweepstakes will be used as a barometer of his strength nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In another way, New Jersey money may prove more important than
New Jersey primary votes. The state's primary is scheduled for June
2000, potentially too late to help Bradley offset Gore's strength
elsewhere. Although Bradley's supporters are pushing to move the
primary to March, the effort has stalled in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In the first test of his local money-raising prowess, Bradley
garnered $1.5 million at an event in East Brunswick on Thursday.
Bradley aides contend the take was particularly impressive because
Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., held a major event in Newark
featuring President Clinton just the night before, raising more
than $2 million for the senator's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore supporters are questioning how much of Bradley's $1.5
million came from New Jersey. ``We know a lot of that money came
from throughout the country,'' said Alfred C. DeCotiis, a Teaneck
lawyer who is one of Gore's major fund-raisers in the state.
``Bradley has to go nationwide to raise $1.5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, a spokesman for the Bradley campaign, said the
``vast bulk'' of the money came from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is so strong in New Jersey, and other states, because
essentially the same people who raised money so successfully for
Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 are working for him. In New Jersey,
that team consists principally of David Steiner, a real estate
developer; Orin S. Kramer, an investment banker; state Sen. Raymond
J. Lesniak of Elizabeth; DeCotiis, and Charles Kushner, a major
fund-raiser for Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   The group raised more than $9 million for Clinton in the last
two elections, its members said, and hopes to bring in $6 million
for Gore in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the New Jersey fund-raisers are supporting Gore,''
Lesniak said. ``On the political side, most people are holding back
because they know that politically it is not wise to go against
your own senator. And there is no need to.''
</P>
<P>
   After running three successful statewide campaigns, Bradley has
his own extensive list of affluent bankers, lawyers and businessmen
to draw upon, but much of it overlaps Gore's. And for the time
being, many Democrats are giving to both men, or neither.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does present a dilemma for New Jersey Democrats,'' said
Thomas P. Giblin, the state Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Spicuzzo, chairman of the Middlesex County Democratic
Committee, expressed the conflict many New Jersey Democrats feel,
saying that although he supported Bradley, he still planned to
attend Gore's first New Jersey fund-raiser in May. He will go, he
said, ``out of respect to the person and the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledges that he will be unable to match Gore's
fund-raising prowess. He has said he wants to raise $20 million to
$25 million from around the country for the primaries, about half
the $40 million to $55 million Gore's advisers say they plan to
raise.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who has long contended that the high cost of
campaigning has distorted the political process, says his campaign
will be more efficient than Gore's, relying more heavily on
volunteers and person-to-person contact than on expensive
television commercials. He also says he expects to attract
contributions from people who have not given to politicians in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to run the kind of campaign that reaches
out to the broadest kind of constituency, and encourages people who
have not been involved in the political process to get involved as
volunteers and contributors,'' he said Friday at a news conference
in West Orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's particularly important to me to have New Jersey
supporters who came forward with their $1,000 contributions,'' he
continued. ``We think that we will be able to surprise a lot of
people. But, no, I don't think we'll get to $55 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gore's advisers say they think Bradley will reach his
goal of $20 million to $25 million in contributions, and that that
will be enough to make him a credible candidate. But they also
asserted that Gore would be able to raise money almost at will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard not to raise money when you are the incumbent
going around the horn for the fourth time,'' DeCotiis said. ``With
only one competitor, a man not currently in office, it's hard to
believe Vice President Gore won't be able to raise what he wants to
raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters agree, but say Gore's organizational
strength will not necessarily make him a winner. ``My fear, and I
think many Gore supporters might say this privately, is that he
could be another Walter Mondale,'' Codey said, referring to the
former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate who was
trounced by Ronald Reagan in 1984. ``He had a lot of the
establishment, but not the public.''
