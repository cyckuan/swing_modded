<HEADLINE> UAE to Have Formal Bourse in Early 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) will soon finish a federal law on the long-awaited
establishment of a formal stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The law is expected to go into force in early 2000, a senior
official announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A law on the UAE stock market will be ready within the coming
two weeks and the law is expected to go into force within the next
six months," said Sheikh Sultan Bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, chief of
Abu Dhabi Crown Prince's Court and member of the Abu Dhabi
Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
A technical committee is currently drawing the framework for
the trading system until the federal law on the UAE stock market
is ready for operation, the official told reporters aftering the
opening of an international conference on banking strategies.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, currently the only country in the Gulf region that
doesn't have a formal stock market, has been working on setting up
one for some years.
</P>
<P>
In June, the cabinet approved a 49-article federal draft law
which set out the structure of the proposed market. But three
months have gone by, and the draft has yet to become a formal law.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, the future stock exchange will be a
unified one, with two trading floors in Abu Dhabi and Dubai
connected by an electronic trading system.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that the stock market authority will be
permanently based in the capital Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
Without a formal bourse, the UAE's stock trading has been
taking place by telephone on an informal basis. Only UAE
nationals are entitled to holding shares directly.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Seeks World Agencies' Help to Enhance Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt intends to turn to renowned
consultative organizations in the world for help in its drive to
enhance exports, the economy and foreign trade minister said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt may ask experienced world agencies to help work out a
strategy for marketing its products in foreign countries, Youssef
Boutros Ghali said, addressing a seminar here on promotion of
Egyptian products to Australia.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, increase of imports, inability to enhance
exports and decline of oil prices on world markets have led to an
annual deficit of more than 10 billion U.S. dollars in Egypt,
which tried hard to balance its foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Egypt plans to divide the potential markets in the world into a
number of groups for a study of their needs and demands for
products in a bid to guide the country's export strategy, Ghali
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country will employ international expertise
to help promote exports and penetrate world markets.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will "make use of all basic experiences in the world to
develop our products, absorb latest technological know-how and
adjust it to our environment to manufacture products which are
capable of withstanding competition in the world market," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are people who raise the banner saying 'show us your
products,' but I will respond by saying 'help us in marketing our
products," he added.
</P>
<P>
Australian Ambassador in Cairo Victoria Owen said Egyptian
businessmen have succeeded in getting a good share of the
Australian market and exports foodstuffs, ready-made garments,
carpets and rugs.
</P>
<P>
Owen expressed his country's readiness to cooperate with Egypt
in further boosting its exports.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, a joint businessmen association between the
two countries was set up.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 109 Tons of Drugs in Seven Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian security official
announced Tuesday that over 109 tons of various illicit narcotics
have been confiscated during the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
This showed a 26 percent increase from the same period of last
year, said Ali Shafei, director general in charge of anti-drug
affairs at the security forces.
</P>
<P>
He said in the western province of Ilam that over 2,182
kilograms of heroin were confiscated in the country during the
seven months, whereas the figure for the same period of last year
stood at 883 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Most of the haul were from international trafficking gangs who
intended to transfer the drugs to Europe, he said, quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the huge drug haul indicated the
increase in drug production and distribution in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran has toughened its crackdown on drug trafficking, rampant
near its eastern borders with neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan
where the drugs originate, and deteriorating in its western
borders where they are smuggled to Europe and the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Shafei also said that 47,000 people were arrested in connection
with drug trafficking during the past seven months while 65,000
others arrested for drug addiction.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Marks Food Day Taking Youth into Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- From U.N. Headquarters
in New York to the capitals of many countries, the World Food Day
was observed in earnest on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fact that 800 million people still suffer from hunger and
malnutrition seems more unacceptable than ever as the 20th century
comes to a close, said U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Louise
Frechette in her massage on the occasion of the Day.
</P>
<P>
In New York, a U.N. observance session was held in which
General Assembly President Theo-Ben Gurirab said this year's theme
is Youth Against Hunger as the heavy burden of hunger, poverty and
illiteracy hold young people back.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by youth organizations around the world found
that early childbearing, lack of education, drug abuse, family
problems, sexually transmitted diseases and unemployment are among
the issues haunting the youth the most.
</P>
<P>
However, Frechette said, young people, about one fifth of the
global population, should be encouraged to become a constructive
force for social change and contribute to ensuring food for all.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) whose 54th
birthday fell on Saturday, is the sponsor of the World Food Day.
</P>
<P>
Its Director-General Jacques Diouf believed that given the
proper tools and opportunities, young people could make a much
greater contribution to national development and the fight
against hunger.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials renewed their appeal to governments for their
efforts to be committed to halving the number of hungry people by
2015.

<HEADLINE> Tens of Thousand Germans Demonstrate Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 19 (Xinhua)--Tens of thousand Germans serving in
public sections Tuesday rallied in Berlin, protesting against
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's unpopular austerity package that
would freeze their salary and pension, the ARD television reported.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, organized by German Federation of Labor
Unions and German Association of Officials (DBB), was held in the
downtown district of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 people, including 8,000 policemen in uniform,
expressed their frustration and dissatisfaction to Schroeder's
coalition cabinet with placards, balloons, and loud music, the
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, in their first large-scaled action against
the austerity plan, said it was unfair for the public servants to
sacrifice solely for the state, and they demanded the whole
economy to share the burden.
</P>
<P>
A slogan band of Berlin fire brigade read:"100 per cent rescue
but only 86.5 per cent pay. It smells to heaven."
</P>
<P>
The unions will not yield to the cabinet "without any fight",
said the chairman of DBB, Herbert Mai.
</P>
<P>
"By now has no government succeeded, the Schroeder government
will not succeed, either," Mai told demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet should not neglect the welfare of officials and
other public servants, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The unions are not against budget cut...but if sparing is
necessary, it is necessary to every one, and those stronger must
bear more than those weaker," said Mai.
</P>
<P>
The overall income of 2 million German officials and 1.3
million pension-takers will be restricted to grow at the inflation
rate in coming two years under the so-called "sparing package".
</P>
<P>
Raised by Finance Minister Hans Eichel in this June, the
austerity package was aimed to lower German budget by 300 billion
marks in four fiscal years in succession. Pension and social
welfare pays will be drastically cut according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The package, linked with another sweeping reform plan of
cutting corporate and income tax rates, was backed by Schroeder
and German business but was widely denounced by the powerful labor
union movements.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, the Chancellor defended his policy by simply saying it
was "proper" to freeze the salary of officials as a part of the
entire austerity plan.
</P>
<P>
"I think that is proper," said Schroder, adding that the
cabinet would not change its line.

<HEADLINE> China on UN Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Peacekeeping operations
should strictly abide by the purposes and principles of the
Charter of the United Nations, China said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to U.N. Shen Guofang
made the remarks at the Forth Committee (Special Political and
Decolonization) of the 54th session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In carrying out its responsibility in maintaining international
peace and security, be it peacekeeping, preventive diplomacy,
post-conflict peace-building or activities in other related areas,
the United Nations should always follow the fundamental principles
of respect for state sovereignty and non-interference in internal
affairs, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
In the post Cold War era, the international situation has
indeed undergone significant changes, but the principles of
respect for state sovereignty and non-interference in internal
affairs are far from outdated and deviation from or contravention
of these principles will lead to the possibility that sovereignty
will be willfully weakened and widely accepted norms of
international relations severely damaged or even obliterated, Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that the success of UN peacekeeping
operations in playing a unique role in facilitating the political
settlement of conflicts and disputes should mainly be attributed
to the observance of the principles of respect for state
sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, fairness and
neutrality, non-use of force except for self-defense and obtaining
prior consent from parties concerned, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
To continue to play their due role under the new circumstances,
peacekeeping operations must abide by the above principles that
have been proven effective under the guidance of the purposes and
principles of the Charter, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Urges End to Double Standard in UN Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
should not treat conflicts and suffering at different places
around the world with different approaches and it should not pay
more attention to some areas while neglecting others, China said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by the Chinese Deputy Permanent
Representative to the U.N. Shen Guofang at the Fourth Committee
(Special Political and Decolonization) of the 54th session of the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Peace and security of one region should not be maintained on
the basis of negligence of and indifference toward another region,
and conflicts in different regions around the world stem from
different root, but the United Nations should treat them equally
without discrimination, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, from Kosovo to East Timor, the world has
witnessed the deployment of peacekeeping operations by the UN at
an unprecedented scale and at the same time, the African continent
is still in the quagmire of continuing conflicts that are
inflicting untold sufferings to the local people, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
African people should not be deprived of adequate attention and
assistance from the international community simply because they
are in Africa and they need the United Nations "blue helmet," Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
Any dithering or wavering by the UN will undermine its
authority and tarnish its prestige, or even weaken its ability in
maintaining international peace and security and ultimately cost
it the understanding and support of the vast number of developing
countries for the peacekeeping operations authorized by the
Security Council, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry on
Tuesday accused the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking nine of
its contracts signed under the oil-for-food program, Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry blamed the U.S. and
British representatives at the Sanctions Committee for suspending
those nine contracts signed under the fifth and sixth phases of
the oil-for-food deal during the committee's sessions held on
October 11-12.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said these blocked contracts were signed with
companies of France, Egypt, Germany, Belarus, the United Arab
Emirates, Austria and Turkey and included medical and veterinary
appliances, oil spare parts, agricultural insecticides, tractors,
tires and electricity cables.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal now in its sixth phase, Iraq is
allowed to sell limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 24 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie's accountability speech was rejected by the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) here in the small hours on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door voting showed that 355 members rejected the
accountability speech, 322 members accepted, nine abstentions and
four votes invalid.
</P>
<P>
Habibie presented his accountability speech on October 14, a
mandatory requirement for a president. Two days later, he replied
to the general view of the 11 factions in MPR on his
accountability speech.
</P>
<P>
Most factions acknowledged the achievements in press freedom
and political openness. However, while the prose and style of the
presentation varied, all the members underlined the common
subjects of concern -- the economy, human rights and corruption.
</P>
<P>
All members were critical of Habibie's handling of the East
Timor issue, criticizing Habibie for not bringing the option of a
ballot to the MPR before executing the plan.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of corruption, collusion and nepotism, questions
were raised about Habibie's determination to weed out these
crucial offenses.
</P>
<P>
Observers here held that the rejection of the accountability
speech is a major blow to Habibie's bid for re-election in the
presidential election which will be held on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Help Belgrade Clean Up Pollution From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Switzerland are to
send experts to clean up Yugoslav territories, which were polluted
by NATO bombing during the Kosovo war, said the press service of
the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made at a meeting of heads of the
humanitarian mission "Focus", which also incorporates
representatives from Greece and Austria and was established at the
end of April this year to offer humanitarian assistance to the
war-suffered Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
During NATO aggression against Yugoslavia, the U.S.-led west
alliance's unprecedented missile attacks and bombardments of the
"Petrol-chemical" complex and fertilizer plant in Pancevo, an oil
processing plant in Novi Sad, oil storages in the cities of
Smederovo and Pristina caused the worst damage in history to the
ecology and environment in the whole drainage basin of the Danube
river.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Tuesday pointed out the
necessity to provide humanitarian aid to Yugoslav people in
restoring both the country's economy and the ecological balance in
the region, seriously ruined by the NATO military operation.
</P>
<P>
"It is a duty of all the states, and first of all those having
taken part in the aggression, to do their best to avert a
humanitarian disaster likely to break out with the winter coming
as a result of the NATO destructive military operation against
Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that without Belgrade's full-fledged participation
in the work to stabilize the situation in the Balkans it would be
impossible to attain this goal.

UNITED NATIONS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution to unequivocally
condemn all forms of terrorism and call on all States to fully
implement anti-terrorist conventions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is seen as a step further by the 15-member
Security Council in fighting against the increase of international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "unequivocally condemns all acts, methods
and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable,
regardless of their motivation, in all their forms and
manifestations, wherever and by whomever committed, in particular
those which could threaten international peace and security," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Council "calls upon all States to implement fully the
international anti-terrorist conventions to which they are
parties, encourages all States to consider as a matter of priority
adhering to those to which they are not parties, and encourages
also the speedy adoption of the pending conventions," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen international conventions have already been
adopted, aiming at suppressing various forms of terrorism, such as
the hijacking of aircraft, the taking of hostages, attacks on
diplomats and acts against the safety of shipping.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also stressed the role of the United Nations in
strengthening international cooperation in combating terrorism and
emphasis on the importance of enhanced coordination among States,

<HEADLINE> Lithuanian Economics, Finance Ministers Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian President Valdas
Adamkus Tuesday accepted the resignation of Economics Minister
Eugenijus Maldeikis and Finance Minister Jonas Lionginas, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministers tended their resignation after failing to block
agreements on the transfer of control of the Lithuanian oil
complex to the U.S. Williams International Company (WIC).
</P>
<P>
The deal, which enjoys the support of President Adamkus, won
majority support at an extraordinary government session Tuesday,
although Prime Minister Rolandas Paksas also voted against it,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the government session, Maldeikis,
the economics minister, said that the agreements on the deal were
unbalanced, saying "Lithuania's responsibility to the investor is
disproportionate and will lead to disproportion in the economic
development" of the Baltic country.
</P>
<P>
Lionginas, the finance minister, said he opposed the deal
because it would mean the transfer of 350 million U.S. dollars to
WIC to replenish working capital at the Mazeikiai oil refinery and
that the transfer will have to be drawn from revenue from a
government Eurobond issue, Interfax reported.

and hope to see China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, Parliament Speaker Spyros
Kyprianou and Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides reaffirmed the
policy during their separate meetings with Tian Jiyun,
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National

</P>
<P>
The Cyprus' leaders also voiced the hope that China, a

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Revenue to Double in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government revenue is
expected to double from 4.17 billion U.S. dollars last year to
8.75 billion dollars in 1999, according to results of a recent
survey obtained here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Agusto and Co.,which made the survey, said its projections were
based on an increase in petroleum profit tax due to improved oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Government's earnings from the oil sector alone is expected to
leap from 2.895 billion dollars in 1998 to 7.368 billion dollars
this year, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Income from value added tax is also expected to increase from
369 million dollars last year to 580 million dollars this year,
while revenue from customs and excise duties is likely to grow
from 577 million dollars to 650 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The massive rise in government earnings is also partially
attributed to liquefied natural gas exports which started from
October this year and is estimated to earn 250 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The consultant company, however, painted a grim picture of
government budget, with the deficit climbing to 9.5 percent of
gross domestic product from 4.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The projection is based on the 2.5 billion dollars deficit
accumulated by the military regime of General Abdulsalam Abubakar
which stepped down in May this year.

<P>
ATHENS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday welcomed the
statements made by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook concerning
Cyprus' accession to the European Union (EU), saying that nothing
could stop Nicosia's march towards EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Cook reportedly said after talks with his Greek counterpart,
George Papandreou, that for Britain the settlement of the
political problem of Cyprus was not a precondition for the
island's EU membership bid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that this position was the standing stance of
the EU.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said here Tuesday that clarification of Cyprus'
course to EU accession was a condition for any prospect of new EU
members, candidacies for membership, or EU expansion.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots side, along with Turkey and some members
of the EU, opposes Cyprus's accession to the EU before the island
republic resolves its 25-year-old division problem.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Offers Counterbid for Carrier Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada announced a
counterbid of nearly 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 673 million
U.S. dollars) in Montreal Tuesday for the merger of the two
national flag carriers.
</P>
<P>
The airline has teamed up with Lufthansa, United Airlines and
the Canadian Imperial Bank Commerce to offer 930 million Canadian
dollars (about 626 million U.S. dollars) for 35 percent of Air
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The counterbid deals a blow at an Onex Corp.'s restructuring
plan to merge Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International at
5.7 billion Canadian dollars (about 3.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Onex's plan must be approved by two thirds of Air Canada
shareholders at a meeting to be held in Montreal on November 8
this year.
</P>
<P>
The counterbid is attracting Canadians by reducing job cuts to
2,500, as compared with 5,000 announced by Onex in late August.
</P>
<P>
The merge plan emerged in August as both carriers had reported
poor operations. Canadian Airlines was heavily burdened with debts
up to 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 673 million U.S. dollars)
while Air Canada was plagued with its stagnant share at the stock
exchange.

<HEADLINE> UK Company Identifies Genes Behind Common Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- British drug company Glaxo
Wellcome said Tuesday it has for the first time identified genes
thought to be linked to common diseases such as migraine,
diabetes, and psoriasis.
</P>
<P>
Dr Allen Roses, Glaxo Wellcome's vice president presented the
results at a human genetics conference being held in San
Francisco, the United States, the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries were achieved by using a gene mapping technique
called single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).
</P>
<P>
Comparing the SNP map from people having a certain disease with
another healthy group enables researchers to focus in on a very
small DNA section which is likely to contain a gene related to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Using simulated data some scientists have suggested that a very
detailed SNP map would be needed to identify where disease genes
are located.
</P>
<P>
However, the new progress Glaxo Wellcome has made in
identifying the select regions, where genes connected to the three
common disease are believed to lie, demonstrates that such a high
density SNP map is not necessary to research genes associated with
all diseases.
</P>
<P>
Although the findings do not mean immediate cures for those
diseases, Dr Roses believed it will certainly provide researchers
with a much better understanding of the genes involved.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday called on all warring parties in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) to honor the 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord in
order to pave the way for the success of the immunization
campaigns in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued here by his spokesman, said that
he "calls on all parties to the Lusaka Peace Accord to observe the
ceasefire throughout the country and extend their full support for
the third and final round of the polio immunization campaign to
proceed from October 20-28, 1999."
</P>
<P>
"He reminds all parties to their commitment under the Lusaka
Peace Accord, to enable national immunization campaigns to be
carried out," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan also "stresses the importance of this campaign
to eradicate this crippling and preventive disease in the DRC,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The parties have given their support for the earlier polio
immunization rounds which allowed for more than 90 percent of the
targeted 10 million children under five to be immunized throughout
the country. The first round began on August 8-20.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is being carried out by the U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in close
collaboration with local health authorities and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka Peace Accord was singed in Lusaka, capital of
Zambia, on July 10 by Congo (K) and its allies, Angola, Zimbabwe
and Namibia, and by Rwanda and Uganda. The two rebel factions,
one backed by Rwanda and the other by Uganda, signed the accord
on September 9.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese teachers at state-run
and private schools will stage a two-day strike from Wednesday to
protest the government's failure to meet their demands for high
pay.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by the Chairman of the Lebanese
Teachers Union George Saadi at a news conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He called on all teachers across the country to heed the
union's call and stay at home on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the call is met by all 67,000 teachers, nearly 700,000
students may be stranded at home, a union's member said.
</P>
<P>
Teachers of the intermediate and elementary levels at
state-run schools refueled their on-off standoff with the
government after it failed to meet their demands for higher pay
and better cost of living allowances.
</P>
<P>
The government recently raised the salaries of high school
teachers, enraging the teachers of the lower levels.
</P>
<P>
The strike caps an ongoing education crisis sparked by a
student stampede to cheaper state-run schools due to spiraling
tuition fees at private schools.

Habibie's accountability speech was rejected by the People's

The closed-door voting showed that 355 members rejected the
accountability speech, 322 members accepted, nine abstentions and
four votes invalid.
</P>
<P>
Habibie presented his accountability speech on October 14, a
mandatory requirement for a president. Two days later, he replied
to the general view of the 11 factions in MPR on his
accountability speech.
</P>
<P>
Most factions acknowledged the achievements in press freedom
and political openness. However, while the prose and style of the
presentation varied, all the members underlined the common
subjects of concern -- the economy, human rights and corruption.
</P>
<P>
All members were critical of Habibie's handling of the East
Timor issue, criticizing Habibie for not bringing the option of a
ballot to the MPR before executing the plan.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of corruption, collusion and nepotism, questions
were raised about Habibie's determination to weed out these
crucial offenses.
</P>
<P>
Observers here held that the rejection of the accountability
speech is a major blow to Habibie's bid for presidency in the
presidential election which will be held on Wednesday.

difficult", said Pinto, adding that they are in "urgent" need of
food, clothes and lodges.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New KFOR Head Vows to Step Up Security in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Klaus Rajnhart, the newly
appointed commander of the international peacekeeping force in
Kosovo (KFOR), pledged Tuesday to beef up security in Kosovo's
provincial capital of Pristina in a bid to curb escalating
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Under Rajnhart's instruction, as the Yugoslav official Tanjug
news agency reported, the KFOR will increase soldier and armored
vehicle patrols in the streets.
</P>
<P>
The capital of the war-shattered province recently witnessed
several terrorist acts. A Serb was killed Monday night, one week
after the murder of the U.N. staff member Valentin Krumov, from
Bulgaria, by ethnic Albanians mistaking him for a Serb.
</P>
<P>
Rajnhart said that "these hideous acts will not be tolerated"
and that the KFOR will take all possible steps to stem the
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
The KFOR conceded for the first time on Sunday that the
demilitarization of the "Kosovo Liberation Army," the illegal
force of ethnic Albanians, was incomplete and condemned its
continued engagement of terrorist activities.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sends Clinton Message on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
sent a message about the situation in Chechnya and the North
Caucasus to his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton on Tuesday in
response to the latter's appeal, said Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitri
Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's message "outlines essential ways of the Russian
leadership to the restoration of the federal constitutional order
in the Chechen Republic and measures against terrorism," Russian
Media quoted Yakushkin as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the political issues of the Chechen situation, including the
status of Chechnya, Yeltsin stressed in the message that "they
must and will be solved politically by dialogue with those leaders
of the Chechen people who reject violence and terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"My main task is to suppress the hotbed of terrorism and
violence in the Chechen Republic. I think it necessary to restore
constitutional order in Chechnya, to find and neutralize all the
international terrorists and their leaders and to block the ways
for the expansion of that plague," said Russian President.
</P>
<P>
Russia has to destroy the source of terrorism and violence in
the Chechen republic so as to prevent new attacks on civilians and
end violence against civilians both inside Chechnya and in
neighboring areas by gangsters and terrorists, Yeltsin wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has become the object of an attack unprecedented in
cruelty and cynicism by terrorist and gangster units based in
Chechnya," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The global challenge posed by terrorism must be countered by
the whole of the international community, Yeltsin believed. The
law enforcement agencies of Russia and the United States must
closely cooperate in fighting international terrorism, he urged.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Politician Criticized For Remarks on Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Shingo Nishimura, parliamentary
vice minister of Japan's Defense Agency, drew fire Tuesday for
suggesting that Japan consider arming itself with nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Nishimura said in an interview with the Weekly Playboy magazine
which went on sale Tuesday that Japanese parliament "should
consider the fact that Japan may be better off if it arms itself
with nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
The comment, which Nishimura called his "personal opinion,"
provoked criticism from Japan's main opposition parties such as
the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), Social Democratic Party (SDP)
and Japanese Communist Party (JCP).
</P>
<P>
The three parties issued separate statements accusing Nishimura
's remarks of running counter to Japan's policy on nuclear weapons.
Japan has promised not to produce or possess nuclear weapons or to
allow them to be brought into the country.
</P>
<P>
Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said he will see Nishimura
to question him about the meaning of his remarks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Agency chief Tsutomu Kawara phoned Nishimura,
who is in Osaka, and told him that his behavior was "inappropriate
as a parliamentary vice minister," Kyodo News quoted Defense
Agency officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nishimura, a member of the Liberal Party (LP), sparked
controversy in 1997 when he made a trip to China's Diaoyudao
Islands (known in Japan as Senkaku Islands) in the East China Sea.
The islands are also claimed by Japan.
</P>
<P>
Nishimura became one of the defense agency's two parliamentary
vice ministers on October 5, when Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi reshuffled his cabinet to launch a new coalition government
between the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), LP and the New Komeito
party.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China Tuesday called
upon the relevant U.N. bodies, including the Security Council, to
give adequate attention to the international terrorism, which is
posing "menancing threats to international peace and security."
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, was addressing an open
debate on the international terrorism at the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, international terrorist activities are on a
rampage, causing severe life and property losses to innocent
civilians and posing menancing threats to international peace and
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To beef up efforts in fighting against international terrorism
conforms to the overall interest of the international community,"
he said. "The relevant U.N. bodies, including the Security
Council, should give adequate attention to this issue and
contribute their part when necessary."
</P>
<P>
More often than not, terrorist activities in recent years
transcend national boundaries, he said, adding that international
cooperation in this area and multi-dimensional actions against
targeting the various manifestations of international terrorism
have now become an indispensable condition for the crackdown
against terrorism to be effective.
</P>
<P>
On the draft International Convention for the Supervision of
Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, he voiced his hope that the various
sides will step up their work in a pragmatic and cooperative
spirit to ensure early adoption of the Convention by the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Ad Hoc Committee established under a General Assembly
resolution on December 12, 1996 has completed the drafting of the
International Convention for the Supervision of Acts of Nuclear
Terrorism, which was put forward by France.

<P>
Referring to the Taiwan issue, he said Taiwan is part of
China's territory, stressing that the Taiwan issue can not be

realized, Chi said.
</P>

construction of the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
China will never seek hegemony, never implement a policy of
aggression of other countries, never form military alliance with
other countries and never base its military or set up military
base in other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
While speaking highly about the stable development of the
Sino-Israeli ties, he said this relationship will be further
strengthened on the basis of the five principles of peaceful
co-existence.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, U.S. Introduce MILES in Combined Wargames </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian-U.S. joint military
exercise featuring the use of an advanced laser system to monitor
casualties and damage was successfully staged Tuesday in western
Egyptian desert.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-U.S. joint wargames are part of the ongoing
"Bright Star '99" multi-national military exercises that involve
the U.S., Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands,
Greece, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the drilling a success, Chief of the Egyptian
Training Authority General Gamal Abu-Nour said it was the first
time that the U.S. Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System
(MILES) was employed in the combined drills that enabled the
command to be clearly informed of the simulated casualties and
damage on the battle field.
</P>
<P>
The MILES is a family of low-power, eye-safe, laser-based
devices that simulate the casualty-producing effects of several
direct-fire weapons.
</P>
<P>
When a MILES transmitter is placed on a weapon, it emits a
laser beam each time a blank round is fired. The beam, with a
maximum firing range of 2,600 meters, is a pulse of coded infrared
energy that can be picked up by the MILES censors either worn by
all individuals or arrayed on all equipment on the battlefields.
</P>
<P>
Once a soldier or vehicle target is hit, the sensors will send
out a distinctive audio tone. The casualty or damage will be
immediately reflected on the computers monitored at the command.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Nour said such system was never used in the previous
biennial multi-national wargames that started in 1981 and it was
hard for the commanders to get specific information about the
casualties and damage caused by the mock battles.
</P>
<P>
The MILES can be equipped on various weapons such as rifles,
attack helicopter weapons systems, the Tube Launched, Optically
Tracked, Wire-Guided weapon system, M-60 and 50 caliber machine
guns, hand grenades, and 150 mm main guns of tanks, a news release
by the military media said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and U.S. Mechanized infantry units, tanks and
anti-tank missile systems participated in the two-hour wargames,
which was designed to learn from each other and improve
coordination between the two countries' troops.
</P>
<P>
Laser beam flashed from the tank guns; simulated missiles from
the defense side were fired at attacking forces; columns of dust
billowed up from the treads of the tanks which performed mock
engagement in the five by 10 kilometer battle area in Talet
Misalam, about 200 kilometers west of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the wargames, Abu-Nour said "we can get
experiences and draw lessons from the field. The exercises are
designed to improve the commanders' management capability in the
battle and the cooperation between the two forces to achieve
enemy's casualties. We attained all the goals."
</P>
<P>
The biennial Bright Star combined exercises were staged by the
U.S. and Egypt since 1981 except 1991 when the Gulf War broke
out. Some other countries joined in from 1993.
</P>
<P>
A total of 73,000 soliders, 368 planes, 56 ships from 11
countries are taking part in this year's wargames that will be
conducted in three stages, from September 17 till November 2.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ready for Military Cooperation with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's ambassador to Syria
Tuesday expressed his country's readiness to provide Syria with
advanced military technology and sophisticated weapons to upgrade
Syria's weaponry.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held here at the Russian Embassy,
Ambassador Robert Markaryan said his country's defense aid to
Syria would not pose any threat to any country, saying that there
are no international bans on arms supply to the Arab country.
</P>
<P>
"Russia does not yield to any foreign pressures regarding its
military cooperation with Syria, even the U.S. pressures," he
said, noting that Moscow had made clear its position on the issue
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Any pressures regarding Russian-Syrian military cooperation are
illegitimate and unacceptable, said the Russian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador's comments came three months after the United
States warned Russia against selling arms to Syria.
</P>
<P>
He also asserted his country's support to Syria's position on
the Middle East peace process, describing it as "fair and
legitimate."
</P>
<P>
"Peace in the region should be based on the U.N. Security
Council Resolutions No. 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace
principle as well as the Madrid peace conference principles," he
added.

<HEADLINE> German Police Rescues Hijacked Egyptian Airplane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A hijacked Egyptian plane was
rescued Tuesday evening after a special German police commando
caught two men at Hamburg airport.
</P>
<P>
One of them, the hijacker, had surrendered to the commando, but
the other had nothing to do with the affair, said Juergen
Petersen, a spokesman for the Hamburg police.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the action and the passengers can soon
safely leave the plane, Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, a Boeing 737-500 of Egyptian Airlines carrying over
50 people, had landed at Hamburg airport at 20:38 after being
hijacked just following its take-off from Istanbul's Ataturk
airport, officials at Hamburg airport said.
</P>
<P>
German RTL television said the hijacker, an Arabic-speaking man
armed with a knife, commandeered the plane shortly after take-off.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the plane, initially diverted to London,
had not enough fuel to make the direct flight to the UK and
instead needed to refuel in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The police said the plane had 48 passengers and six crew
members on board.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Praises Demolition of Jewish Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has praised as a "good step" the demolition of the first Jewish
settlement by Israel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made Tuesday by Arafat during his meeting with
visiting former South African President Nelson Mandela who is on a
two-day private visit to the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
As part of compromise agreement with settler leaders, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced plans last week to uproot 12
illegal Jewish seregard Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank and Gaza Strip as illegal and
demand that Israel evacuate all its 144 settlements in these areas.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Arafat told reporters that the U.N. Security
Council resolutions established the illegitimacy of the Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration, the European Union, Russia and the
Non-Aligned countries consider the Israeli settlement activities
detrimental to the peace process, he added.

<HEADLINE> Panama Stresses New Relations With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian President Mireya
Moscoso said Tuesday that the U.S. hand-over of the Panama Canal
to Panama should mark a new relationship emphasizing diplomatic
and commercial ties over military issues.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso made the remarks during his meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton at the White House. The two leaders also discussed
anti-drug efforts and environmental issues, said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso urged Clinton to attend a ceremony in Panama in
December on the transfer of the canal from U.S. to Panamanian
control, saying such a ceremony would underscore the beginning of
a new relationship between the dominant power and nations of Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
Opposing the establishment of a new U.S. drug-fighting base in
Panama, Moscoso stressed that this new relationship should
emphasize diplomatic and commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
The canal has been a strategic point for the United States to
fight the drug smuggling from Latin America. Under a treaty signed
in 1977, Panama takes control of the canal after midnight on
December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Panama's government refused to allow the U.S. to establish an
anti-drug base after the U.S. withdraws from the canal.

<HEADLINE> Chilean President Refuses Spanish Petition on Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chile's President Eduardo Frei
said on Tuesday that the Ibero-American Summit to be held in
Havana is not the time or place to talk on bilateral issues
between Spain and Chile.
</P>
<P>
He made this statement while speaking about comments made by
Spain's Foreign Minister Abel Matutes on the theme.
</P>
<P>
On returning from Guatamala where he signed a free trade
agreement with the Central American countries, Frei said "If we
haven't resolved these bilateral issues in a year, I don't see why
we should discuss them in a multinational meeting".
</P>
<P>
He said that they should maintain just one line of
communication in the Pinochet case, for the quick return of the
honorary senator to his country.
</P>
<P>
Chile has decided not to attend the Ibero-American summit in
Cuba next month to protest Spain's attempts to extradite former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Frei reaffirmed how important it was to have signed
the free trade agreement with the countries which make up the
Central American integration system, which represents for Chile a
market of 35 million people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the accord, he said it was the first time the
Central American countries have signed an agreement with a South
American country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement definitely signified more employment for
Chileans, considering that 90 percent of the export products are
manufactured, added President Frei.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore,
who is fighting for the Democratic presidential nomination, will
have six additional debates with his rival, former U.S. Senator
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
The Bradley campaign Tuesday issued a timetable of six debates
starting December 17 and ending January 27, just before the New
Hampshire primary scheduled for February 1.
</P>
<P>
The Bradley schedule included two debates in Iowa, which will
stage the first major caucuses of the 2000 campaign on January 24:
three in New Hampshire, and one in Washington D.C., which will be
nationally televised.
</P>
<P>
The Gore campaign accused Bradley of trying to put off a
face-to-face confrontation for as long as possible and said he
should start the debates immediately.
</P>
<P>
Gore has been calling on Bradley to begin a schedule of weekly
debates, but Bradley has declined to accept the challenge.
</P>
<P>
Their first debate will be October 27 in Hanover, New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who has been facing tough challenge from Bradley,
appears to have stabilized his support in some of the most
recently published surveys.
</P>
<P>
In a new Pew Research Center poll issued Monday, Gore led
Bradley among Democrats by 60-31 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Follow Nyerere's Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Retired president of
Tanzania Ali Hassan Mwinyi Tuesday called on people in the country
to follow the principles of national unity, peace and
self-reliance advocated by the late leader Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Addressing tens of thousands of people who thronged to the
National Stadium in the capital Dar es Salaam to pay last respects
to Nyerere, who retired as president in 1985 and died last
Thursday, Mwinyi urged Tanzanians not to abandon the principles
that united the country together.
</P>
<P>
Mwinyi, who was Tanzanian president during 1985 and 1995,
described his predecessor Nyerere as a "brave" and "firm" man and
a person in principle.
</P>
<P>
Although Nyerere was gentle and kind, Mwinyi said, the veteran
African statesman would be "as hot as a pepper" when somebody went
against a decision that had been made by the majority.
</P>
<P>
In a hastily constructed house on the lawn of the stadium,
Nyerere's remains were laid in a half open coffin from which
people could view his face.
</P>
<P>
Relatives and close friends were paying last respects to
Nyerere and his body will lie in state at the stadium until
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Nyerere's coffin was moved from his residence in the
northern outskirts of Dar es Salaam to St. Joseph's Metropolitan
Cathedral that overlooks the Indian Ocean for the funeral mass,
attended by his family and senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
Mwinyi recalled that in 1977 when he, as ambassador to Egypt,
presented his credentials to President Anwar Saddat, Saddat
praised Nyerere as a man who held beliefs in human equality, and
advocated to defend the rights of poor people within their own
country and beyond their borders.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was respected as "Mwalimu" or teacher in Kiswahili
throughout Africa for his intellect and integrity.
</P>
<P>
He is remembered at home as the man who led the drive for
Tanganyika's independence from Britain in 1961 and masterminded
its union with the Indian Ocean islands of Zanzibar to form
Tanzania in 1964.
</P>
<P>
He is credited with peacefully uniting the 120 ethnic groups
in Tanzania under a national flag and bringing education and
medical services to even the poorest people.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has declared Thursday as state funeral
day. Foreign dignitaries from some 40 countries are expected to
arrive here to pay their respects.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hopes U.S. to Bring Turkish Side to Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government expects the
U.S. Presidential emissary Alfred Moses to convince the Turkish
side to return to the negotiating table without any preconditions,
government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's statement come as Moses and U.S. State
Department Cyprus coordinator Thomas Weston made their first day
contacts with Cypriot officials.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the Turkish side will cooperate in the
framework of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1250 and will come
to the table to discuss a Cyprus solution," Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Resolution 1250 calls for unconditional talks between
Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots this fall to reach a
settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side refuses to attend negotiations unless its aim
of establishing a confederation of two states on the island is
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Moses and Weston arrived here Monday night for talks with
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in a bid to get the two sides to the negotiating table
for talks, aiming at a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Moses arrived in Cyprus from Athens where he had talks with
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou. Prior to that, he was in
Ankara to meet Turkish government officials.
</P>
<P>
Moses will meet the Denktash Tuesday evening and he will have
working breakfast with Clerides. Earlier in Tuesday afternoon, he
met with acting Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary
General to Cyprus James Holger.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seek Students' Help in Stopping Youth Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
asked 350 students Tuesday to help fight against youth violence in
the country.
</P>
<P>
America's youth feel increasingly unsafe after a series of
deadly shootings at schools, Clinton told the students, who were
selected for the two-day conference by 130 members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to live in the new world of the 21st century,
you've got to help people get rid of their old hatreds and old
fears," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by House Democrats, the "Voices Against Violence"
conference was timed to coincide with the six-month anniversary of
the Columbine massacre near Denver, in which two boys killed 12
fellow students and one teacher before killing themselves in the
school library.
</P>
<P>
Spurred by those killings, the House and Senate passed
competing versions of a bill designed to keep guns out of the
hands of children and criminals, but a panel of lawmakers from
both chambers has yet to strike a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Republican-led Congress to pass hate crimes
legislation and a bill requiring background checks for buyers at
gun shows in a bid to prevent such violence.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would give states 1.5 billion dollars over
three years to fight youth crime, establish strict penalties
for crimes involving guns and give prosecutors discretion to try
people as young as 13 as adults.

JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Almost three-quarters of

of 650 rand a month, South African Parliament's standing committee

Many of the workers suffered physical and verbal abuse from

<HEADLINE> S. African Rand Stands Firmer in Face of Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The South African rand
stood firmer in a market characterized by range trading as the
gold price continued its downward trend Tuesday afternoon, testing
a low of 305 dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the local currency traded tightly within a
two-cent band, showing no response to the local and U.S. consumer
inflation (CPI) data released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics South Africa said the September headline inflation
was the lowest in 31 years at 1.9 percent year on year compared
with 3.2 percent in August. Markets had expected CPI at 2.1
percent year on year.
</P>
<P>
Core inflation remained unchanged at 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. CPI rose 0.4 percent in September compared to a market
forecast of 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rand was last at 6.1330 to the U.S. dollar from its
previous New York close of 6.1475.
</P>
<P>
The rand traded between 6.1300 and 6.1475 for most of Tuesday,
and tested an intraday best level of 6.1220 after midday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers expect the rand to find resistance and support at the
6.11 and 6. 15 levels.
</P>
<P>
The gold price dropped to 307.60 U.S. dollars an ounce from
Tuesday morning's opening high of 311 U.S. dollars and a previous
New York close of 310.75 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Palestinians, Israelis to Keep Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting former South African
President Nelson Mandela Wednesday called upon the Palestinians
and Israelis to keep their choice for peace and set aside their
hostility toward each other.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is on his second day of a private visit to the
Gaza Strip, gave a speech to the Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC) where he was accorded a warm welcome as a long-time
supporter to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The histories of our two peoples, Palestinians and South
Africans, correspond in such painful and poignant ways that I
intensely feel myself being at home amongst compatriots," said the
just-retired 81-year-old president.
</P>
<P>
The two peoples shared solidarity in battle and now they are
partners in the pursuit for peace and they are working on the
well-being and future prosperity of their countries, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"Yet peace is the only route to be taken for the people of
Palestine to achieve their dream of nationhood, democracy,
stability and progress," said Mandela, who along with Palestinian
leader Yassar Arafat are seen as symbols of freedom by both
African non-whites and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the people in the region should
forgive their hostility even it is not easy.
</P>
<P>
"Yet you have chosen forgiveness ahead of revenge, peace above
violence. The road towards reconciliation is never easy: it asks
for us to put the coolness of our heads above the warmth of our
blood," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who had been jailed for 27 years for his struggle for
the end of apartheid in South Africa and was elected the first
black president of the country later, encouraged the Palestinians'
efforts to reach their independence.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that there is no peace for Israel if it does
not withdraw its troops from all the Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Mandela Monday visited Israel and held talks with Israeli
leaders. He called on them to return the occupied land to the
Arabs in exchange for peace.
</P>
<P>
He said in the speech that the Palestinians are "emerging from
darkness and a brighter future waits" them after they suffered
from hardship and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
"The flag of Palestine already flied proudly over the ancient
streets and homes of your motherland, and the world awaits your
date with destiny," he said, but warned that there will certainly
be obstacles ahead and not all deadlines will be met during the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Abu Ala, speaker of the PLC promised that the
Palestinian people will take peace as their strategic choice in
their strive for an independent state with Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has left Gaza for home, winding up his Mideast tour
which had also taken him to Syria, Israel and Iran.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Stop "Pan-Politicizing" Mainland Aid to Quake Victims (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Central government officials
today urged Taiwan authorities to stop "pan-politicizing" the
mainland's aid to the victims of the devastating earthquake that
hit that island province on September 21.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of journalists from the mainland, Taiwan,
and Hong Kong, officials from the Foreign Ministry, the State
Council Office on Taiwan Affairs, and the China Seismological
Bureau rebuked the rumors and censures against the mainland as
groundless and detrimental to the development of cross-Straits
ties.
</P>
<P>
Li Qianghua, spokesman with the seismological bureau, said
mainland seismological departments and experts have paid special
attention to the quake and sent immediate messages to their
counterparts in Taiwan on September 21 expressing their
willingness to offer help at any time, but the proposal has so far
received no response.
</P>
<P>
On October 15, the China Seismology Society invited experts
from Taiwan to hold talks in the mainland on the issue of post-
quake rebuilding, but this too was turned down in a letter from
the other side of the Straits dated October 19, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the mainland has acquired abundant experience
over decades from deadly earthquakes, including the 1976 Tangshan
quake, and is willing to cooperate and share these experience with
their Taiwan counterparts, in the hope that the compatriots in the
mainland "should not have shed their blood for nothing."
</P>
<P>
Mainland experts feel regretful and sorrowful because they have
not been able to get to Taiwan, Li said, noting that the mainland
is still ready to send expert teams to contribute to Taiwan's
rebuilding efforts. The mainland is also willing to readjust its
rescue plans in line with the requirements of Taiwan's quake-hit
areas, he added.

<HEADLINE> New Russian Military Doctrine Rejects Western Dominance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia's new military doctrine
rejects the West's practice of achieving political goals through
military might, a senior Russian defense official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the doctrine was published earlier this month for
review. It will be sent to the president for approval after a
discussion by the Security Council, the country's top advisory
body.
</P>
<P>
The draft essentially "rejects the methods and tools of
achieving political goals using a big stick such as (those used by)
the NATO military alliance," said Colonel General Valery Manilov,
first deputy chief of the General Staff.
</P>
<P>
"We categorically reject and will tenaciously work to prevent
making a habit of arbitrary use of military force in pursuance of
purely national interests by NATO or the United States at the
expense of sovereignty and interests of other countries," the
Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Manilov, one of the authors of the draft, said the military
strategic part of the document outlines ways of countering
military threats.
</P>
<P>
The general, who said earlier this week that Russia would use
nuclear weapons against a country or a group of countries, nuclear
or otherwise, that threatens its vital national interests,
apparently toned down his stance.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of using such weapons "will be raised" when
"a country or a group of countries attacks Russia and its allies,
and conventional weapons prove insufficient to curb the aggression
and Russia's existence as a sovereign independent country is
threatened."
</P>
<P>
Manilov did not say unambiguously whether Russia may use
nuclear weapons first, Interfax observed.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Stop "Pan-Politicizing" Mainland Aid to Quake Victims (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-quake efforts are a matter of humanitarianism and science
and technology, and experts from neither side of the straits want
to "pan-politicize" the issue, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Zushou, head of the Foreign Ministry's Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan Department, said the Taiwan authorities' condemnation of
the so-called mainland's blockage of international aid to the
quake victims is groundless.
</P>
<P>
Since the earthquake, the mainland has continuously shown its
gratitude to the international community for their rescue
activities, spared no efforts to provide assistance to these
activities, and even planned to initiate international aid via the
United Nations, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as required by the U.N. Charter only a sovereign
entity has the right to ask for the demand for initiation of
international aid.
</P>
<P>
The mainland Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
has written to the Foundation for Cross-Straits Relations seeking
comments from its Taiwan counterpart on the planned initiation of
international aid, Zhu disclosed. The foundation has replied,
saying it is not necessary to do so, he said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, international non-government rescue activities have
been carried out normally and smoothly, and up to now over 20
foreign countries have sent more than 30 rescue teams with over
700 people to Taiwan's quake-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the so-called mainland hampering of a Russian
rescue team's effort to fly to Taiwan via the mainland, Zhu said
the Foreign Ministry gave immediate consent to Russia's request to
fly its rescue team over the territory of the mainland, and this
has never been denied.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has acted in accordance with international
convention, while the Taiwan side has had ulterior motives in
making repeated condemnations, the official said, noting that in
fact some foreign rescue teams had to leave Taiwan ahead of
schedule because they had nothing to do there.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Stop "Pan-Politicizing" Mainland Aid to Quake Victims (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Initiating international aid is useful to the people of Taiwan,
but the Taiwan authorities have "politicized" anti-quake efforts
in an attempt to conduct a "quake diplomacy" in order to develop
contacts with international organizations with the status of "
sovereignty," according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Huaijun, head of the exchange bureau under the State
Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, said President Jiang Zemin and
other state leaders have sent messages of sympathy to the quake
victims, while mainlanders from all walks of life began collecting
donations immediately after the quake.
</P>
<P>
To date, the mainland has raised five million yuan worth goods
and 30 million yuan in cash for the Taiwan victims. The China Red
Cross Association will remit another 500,000 U.S. dollars as the
third batch of rescue funds from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
While mainland aid has received thanks from many Taiwan groups
and individuals, some Taiwan people have distorted the facts, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities have played down the mainland aid, and
Lee Teng-hui has never mentioned the mainland concern and
donations, but has taken the opportunity to reiterate his "two-
states" fallacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has been restrained in denouncing the groundless
rumors in this case, but the repeated distorted remarks made by
the Taiwan side have led to recent speeches by officials from the
Taiwan Affairs Offices under the State Council and the Communist
Party of China Central Committee to clarify the matter, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The quake could have been an opportunity for the improvement of
cross-Straits relations, but a few people in Taiwan have been
damaging this possibility, he said, adding that he regrets this.
</P>
<P>
He urged those Taiwanese with ulterior motives to spend their
energies in the anti-quake efforts, instead of trying to transfer
the dissatisfaction of the Taiwan people over the ineffective anti-
quake activities undertaken by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities should make greater efforts to rebuild
the quake-hit areas and give their consent to mainland's request
to send its rescue personnel and relief goods to the province as
early as possible, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> China's Imperial Tombs to Apply for World Heritage Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to apply for
UNESCO's World Heritage listing for the imperial tombs of the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911), China's last feudal dynasty, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
There are two groups of imperial Qing tombs, the Eastern Tombs
and the Western Tombs. Both groups are located in Hebei Province
in north China.
</P>
<P>
The tombs are east and west of Beijing, the current national
capital and also the capital of the Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Tombs have been open to the public for about two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Currently, large-scale preparatory work is being carried out in
the western tombs area, including the repair of various structures
and the installation of fire-prevention facilities in the old
buildings, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, power and telecommunication facilities which
have affected the landscape and polluted the surrounding
environment in the area are being relocated or rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
Protective organizations have been established in eight
villages near the Western Tombs, and government officials are
giving instruction to the villagers about these undertakings.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO officials are scheduled to visit the Western Tombs in
March next year, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Welcoming Luncheon Held for Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin on
Wednesday attended a welcoming luncheon held here in his honor by
the China-Britain Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the luncheon, President Jiang Zemin gave an account
of the economic situation in China, saying China's economy on the
whole is doing well and, despite the Asian financial crisis in
1997 and last year's disastrous flooding rarely seen in China's
history, "we have still been able to maintain stable economic
growth thanks to the series of strong measures we have adopted."
</P>
<P>
The GDP of China grew by 7.6 percent in the first half of this
year, and the objective of a 7 percent economic growth rate
projected for this year can be attained, said the president, who
arrived here on Monday on the first visit to Britain by a Chinese
head of state.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Jiang expounded China's stance on entering the
World Trade Organization, saying: "China has all along taken a
positive approach towards joining the WTO and has been working for
13 years to this end. Its position is both consistent and
clear-cut."
</P>
<P>
"China needs to join the WTO for its own economic development
and reform and opening-up. Likewise, the WTO needs China," the
president said. "Without the participation of China with its 1.2
billion people, the WTO cannot be a complete world organization,
nor will the situation be conducive to global economic growth."
</P>
<P>
But China is still a developing country and its social
productive forces are yet to be developed, he said. "So, it can
join the WTO only on terms for a developing country."
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of the economic relations and trade between
China and the United Kingdom. He noted Britain is the second
largest trading partner of China among the European Union
countries and also the biggest EU investor in China.
</P>
<P>
"The steady development of our economic cooperation and trade
has brought substantial benefits to both sides. Our economic
cooperation and trade still have immense potentials that we should
continue to tap," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the luncheon, which was attended by leading business
figures in Britain, Charles Powell, chairman of the China-Britain
Business Council, called President Jiang's visit a "milestone" for
the development of Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-premier Qian Qichen and other members of Jiang's
entourage also attended the luncheon.

<HEADLINE> Manila Plans to Reduce Dependence on Oil Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua)- - The Philippines plans to
increase its fuel oil self-sufficiency level in a bid to reduce
the nation's dependence on imported oil, presidential sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said
the government's long term energy plan is to increase the oil
self-sufficiency level from 39 percent in 1998 to 46 percent by
2004.
</P>
<P>
Barican said this can be done by developing indigenous energy
resources, mainly by natural gas, to increase the country's
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
The country will also tap, he said, geothermal, hydroelectric
and other new and renewable energy sources, like wind, solar, mini
and micro-hydro which are being used increasingly in the
production of electricity for remote off-grid areas.
</P>
<P>
He said following the decision by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reduce oil production, the
government has undertaken several measures to cushion the effect
of the increase in the prices of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has started to temper price increases of
socially-sensitive products, like diesel and liquefied petroleum
gas, so as to mitigate the impact of increasing crude cost,
particularly diesel that is used for public transport.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices were very low, at 10 U.S. dollars per barrel, from
December 1998 to March 1999 but rose to 20 to 22 dollars per
barrel in recent weeks, the spokesman added.

LAGOS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's House of
Representatives has completed the review of the anti-corruption
bill sent to the National Assembly by President Olusegun
Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker of the House, Alhaji Na'aba, assured that the House
would endorse the bill, which serves the fist bill sent by the
President to the country's top legislature for approval, as soon
as other necessary actions on it were concluded, reported the
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Anti-corruption has been a top priority for the new civilian
government, and an anti- corruption law serves a legal basis for
it, said President Obasanjo recently, while criticizing the
National Assembly's tardiness in approving it.
</P>
<P>
Na'aba, however, warned that the bill alone would not eradicate
 corruption in the country, adding that only good leadership,
which catered for the welfare of the people, could control it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the Anti-Corruption Committee of the
House are expected to visit Hong Kong and Malaysia to study the
structure, funding, staffing and the investigative powers of
similar anti-corruption bodies.
</P>
<P>
"We will get samples of their anti-corruption laws, study them
word by word and section by section with a view to harmonizing
them into our own anti-corruption laws," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Bamboo Industry to Ease Timber Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen its
bamboo industry over the next 15 years in an effort to ease its
timber shortfall, according to an official of the State Forestry
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Lei Jiafu, director of the Afforestation Department of the
administration, said at the '99 China Bamboo Culture Festival
which closed here today that China will expand its bamboo
plantation area by 1.2 million hectares in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the goal for the industry's output value is 30
billion yuan by the year 2015, when exports could reach one
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lei called this a "bamboo for timber" strategy that is expected
to be the country's principal means of solving the timber shortage
following a comprehensive logging ban at areas along the upper
reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers to alleviate soil erosion,
which involve 13 provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The country's timber shortfall now stands at 38 million cu. m.
a year, and it will reach 43 million cu. m. by 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that large amount of imports is not a solution
because of surging prices and shrinking supply in the
international timber market.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the International Network of Bamboo and Rattan
affirmed China's "bamboo for timber" plan as the right decision,
and said they expect bright market prospects for China's bamboo
industry, which is the largest in the world with 4.2 million
hectares of bamboo forest coverage.
</P>
<P>
Bamboo also will play a much more important role in
construction and paper-making industries, where timber used to be
considered indispensable.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: Chinese Position on Joining WTO "Consistent And Clear-cut" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China has all along taken a
positive approach in its 13-year efforts to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO), with a position "both consistent and clear-cut,
" said visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to make efforts for greater global economic
growth, but we are firm on not sacrificing our national interests
in undertaking any international economic cooperation," Jiang said
at a welcoming luncheon hosted by the China-Britain Business
Council, stressing that this is a basic prerequisite for China on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
"China is a developing country and its social productive forces
are yet to be developed, so it can join the WTO only on terms for
a developing country," Jiang reiterated.
</P>
<P>
"China's accession to the WTO must be based on a balance
between rights and obligations," the Chinese President added. "It
will not accept excessive terms which exceed its capacity."
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that economic ties between China and the world
have become ever closer, adding that the world needs China for its
prosperity, just as China needs the world for its development,
reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
"Without the participation of China with its 1.2 billion
people, the WTO cannot be a complete world organization, nor will
the situation be conducive to global economic growth," Jiang
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
 So far, China has concluded bilateral negotiations on its
accession to the global trade body with some developed countries,
and is expected to start a fresh round of talks with the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on Britain to support China's position and to
play a positive role in seeking a rational solution for China's
membership in the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Striking Deal on ABM With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian military
officer denied on Wednesday that Moscow will make compromise with
the United States regarding a possible revision of the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile treaty (ABM).
</P>
<P>
The denial came amid Western reports that U.S. officials were
trying to use American assistance with radar technology as a lure
to get Russia's agreement to amend the ABM treaty so that both
country could establish national missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no compromises on this issue," said Colonel
General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian General
Staff.
</P>
<P>
The ABM treaty, which bans the construction of systems to
defend against ballistic missile attacks, is considered a
cornerstone for the arms control agreement.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been trying to build a national missile defense
system in violation of the AMB treaty.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said Wednesday that "the U.S. attempts to withdraw from
the ABM Treaty are objectively destroying the system of agreements
covering the limitation and reduction of weapons of mass
destruction, including nuclear weapons," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The basic and fundamental character of the ABM treaty
excludes the possibility of adjusting it to the momentary
interests of the American administration," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leadership views "attempts to violate the current
system of agreements in the areas of armament, disarmament and the
elimination of weapons" as a threat and an element destabilizing
the regional and global situation.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Officially Starts Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Wednesday declared her decision to put forward the
presidential election in an official proclamation, ending months
of speculation about the possibility of an early poll.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said her decision signified the officially
starting of presidential race although unofficial campaigning has
been going on for months.
</P>
<P>
"By virtue of the powers vested in me by paragraph 3A of
Article 31 of the Constitution... I, Chandrika Bandaranaike
Kumaratunga, President, do by this proclamation, hereby declare my
intention of appealing to the people for a mandate to hold office,
by election, for a further term," President Kumaratunga said.
</P>
<P>
However, the exact polling date has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
The Government Information Department said in a news release
that a schedule and a balloting date would be announced within the
next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said earlier Wednesday that the presidential
election will be held in eight weeks, more than 10 months ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
But the official radio said Wednesday night the elections
commissioner will announce nominations by November 11, then the
poll will be held following six-week campaigning.
</P>
<P>
Consequently it seems likely the polls will be held in late
December or early January.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Elections said it would take necessary
measures to ensure the success of the presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga's decision was welcomed by the main
opposition party and other parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the main opposition United National Party (UNP)
Ranil Wickremasinghe said they were ready for polls and have been
campaigning for some time.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Sri Lanka said it welcomed the
president's decision and will support Kumaratunga in the poll.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga was elected in November 1994 with a
six-year term.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said the timing of the presidential poll is due
to the current economic situation conducive to the ruling People's
Alliance (PA) government.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that President Kumaratunga's reelection
will boost the PA's fortunes in parliamentary election which is
expected to be held soon after the presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, there were extensive speculations about the
snap presidential and parliamentary elections which are due
respectively in November and August next year.
</P>
<P>
The PA and the UNP have been campaigning unofficially for
several months.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Indonesian New President Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian new president
Abdurrahman Wahid took an official oath at the plenary meeting of
the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The country's influential Muslim leader was sworn in by Chief
of the Supreme Court Sarwata in accordance with Islamic teachings.
</P>
<P>
Wahid alias Gus Dur was elected the country's fourth president
in a tight contest with Megawati Soekarnoputri, who was nominated
by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), on
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a secret ballot conducted by the MPR, the country highest
decision-making body, Wahid got 373 votes out of a total of 691.
Megawati obtained 313 votes while the remaining five votes were
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
As Chairman of the MPR Amien Rais announced the ballot result,
all participants sang the national anthem, Indonesia Raya.
</P>
<P>
Megawati and many others then approached Wahid to congratulate
him on his victory. Megawati also called on her supporters to
understand the ballot result of the presidential election which
was in favor of her brother Wahid.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's victory was believed by political analysts as the
result of strong supports by the Muslim-based political parties.
The 59-year-old Wahid currently held the post of the general
chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, the largest Muslim organization in
the country with around 30 million members.
</P>
<P>
Wahid is also a figure that is accepted by all sides.
</P>
<P>
"With Gus Dur's ascent, rifts among Muslim groups can be
averted," deputy chairman of the Indonesian Council of Ulemas
Amdihan said.
</P>
<P>
Amdihan also appreciated the warm welcome by Megawati soon
after the election was finished.
</P>
<P>
"It indicates that Gus Dur is also acceptable to the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wahid thanked Megawati and her backers for their understanding
about his health condition.
</P>
<P>
"I deeply appreciate Mega because she has known that I am not
healthy, but she does not bob up and down on my sickness. Herself
and her assistants must be respected," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid had brain surgery after experiencing a stroke in January
1998.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve national economic recovery, some MPR
members expect Wahid to form a coalition cabinet with a strong
economic team.
</P>
<P>
Kwik Kian Gie, an MPR deputy chairman, said that power sharing
in the coming cabinet should not be based on political power only,
but also on assessments of the individual capacities of potential
cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar Kartasasmita, another MPR deputy chairman, said Wahid
must accelerate the country's efforts to restore the economy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's central bank governor Syahril Sabirin said interest
rates would come down further if the political situation
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the priority sectors to be tackled if a new
government was formed, Sabirin said it had to further show its
commitment to restructuring the nation's ailing financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election has led to active trading in the
stock and money markets.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was quoted around 7,300 per U.S. dollar on
Wednesday, compared with around 7,600 in late trading on Tuesday.
The Jakarta Stock Exchange index gained 0.778 points to close at
584.425.
</P>
<P>
When the presidential election was going on, several violence
took place in Jakarta and other cities. Security forces had to
resort to rubber bullets, smoke bombs and tear gas when hundreds
of supporters of the PDI-P tried to force their way to the
Parliament building.
</P>
<P>
At least five persons were seriously injured and rushed to a
hospital following an explosion near Hotel Indonesia in Central
Jakarta on Wednesday noon.
</P>
<P>
In Solo, Central Java, some buildings were damaged by the
supporters of the PDI-P, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election was held after the outgoing president
B.J. Habibie's accountability speech was rejected by the MPR
earlier Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Habibie told reporters at his residence that he will not return
to the political stage. He has also called on the countrymen to
support the elected president.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Tapping Sino-U.K. Economic, Trade Potentials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The economic cooperation and
trade between China and the United Kingdom have immense potentials
and the two countries should continue to tap them, said visiting
Chinese President Jiang Zemin here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries have a long history of two-way trade and
fresh progress has been made in recent years thanks to bilateral
efforts," said Jiang at a welcoming luncheon hosted by the China-
Britain Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the bilateral trade volume has hit 6.58
billion U.S. dollars. Between January and August this year, it
rose 16.9 per cent as compared with that in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Britain is China's second largest trading partner among E.U.
countries and also the biggest E.U. investor in China.
</P>
<P>
"The steady development of our economic cooperation and trade
has brought substantial benefits to both sides," Jiang said. "
China has a big market and its potential is even bigger."
</P>
<P>
"Its sustained economic growth will open up a broad prospect
for China's economic cooperation and trade with other countries,"
said Jiang, who estimated that China's total imports are expected
to rise to 1,500 billion U.S. dollars in the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
"For a period to come, China will give priority to developing
the infrastructure sector and industries such as agriculture,
water conservancy, energy, transportation, telecommunications, raw
materials, environmental protection, high technology and key
equipment," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the U.K. enjoys a considerable edge in
finance and science and technology, and ranks among the world's
most advanced nations in such areas as energy, chemical industry,
machine-building and infrastructure. In addition, many enterprises
in the U.K. have long-standing economic and trade ties with China
and a wealth of experience.
</P>
<P>
"As long as our two sides give full play to the favorable
conditions, we will surely be able to build on the China-U.K.
economic cooperation and trade and make even greater progress,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president recalled that back in the early days of
New China, some British companies went to China in defiance of
obstacles on a famous ice-breaking visit for the purpose of
developing bilateral economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
He called on both countries to carry forward such pioneering
spirit and, from a long-term and strategic perspective, explore
new channels and areas for expanded bilateral economic cooperation
and trade under the new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready to work together with the British government
and friends from the business community to bring economic
relations and trade to a new high and promote the development of
the comprehensive Sino-U.K. partnership," Jiang said in conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Riders Expelled for Failing Blood Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Two riders have been expelled
from the world track cycling championships here on Wednesday after
failing random blood tests, the International Cycling Union (UCI)
said.
</P>
<P>
Jan Van Eijden of Germany and Edita Kubelskiene of Lithuania
will both be suspended for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The test measures the number of the red cells in the blood and
the rider would be disqualified if the number is too high.
</P>
<P>
The excessive amount of red cells, which increase the stamina
of the athlete, could be the result of the usage of banned
substance EPO. But the blood test could not detect the EPO
directly.

Asia-Europe Foundation, envisioned the rise of a new Asia
characterized with world-class economies, good governments, clean
environment, strong social cohesion, and etc.

Asia after the two-year crisis, yet at the same time cautioning
against complacency.

region, including the situation in Indonesia and East Timor,
economic restructuring, globlization, regional integration and the
influence of Internet, among others.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows Slightly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. trade deficit narrowed
slightly to 24.1 billion dollars in August as exports hit record,
the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that the August deficit edged down 3.2
percent from the all-time record of 24.9 billion dollars set in
July.
</P>
<P>
The August imbalance, even with the 791 million dollars
improvement, was still the third worst monthly performance in
history and left the deficit for the whole year running at an
annual rate of 252 billion dollars, 53 percent higher than the
recorded 164.3 billion dollars deficit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exporters, who have been battered for two years as the
Asian crisis cut into their overseas markets, posted a sizable 3.7
percent gain in August, which lifted exports of goods and services
to a record 82 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But imports, which have been strong all year, posted an
increase of 2 percent and also set a new record of 106.1 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy, which has continued to grow strongly despite
all the overseas problems, has been pulling in imports at a record
clip, helped by the huge foreign currency declines that have made
imports bargains for U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
In August, the deficit with Japan, though narrowed 5.8 percent
to 6.4 billion dollars, is still running 13 percent above a year
ago, adding to trade tensions between the world's two largest
economies.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports to all Pacific Rim countries, the area hardest hit
by the two-year world financial crisis, jumped by 6.4 percent in
August, helping to narrow the deficit by 1.8 percent to 17.2
billion dollars. South Korea, Thailand and other nations in the
region are reporting rising economic activity this year as they
climb out of steep recessions caused when their currencies
plunged.
</P>
<P>
U.S. deficit in petroleum rose to 5.9 billion dollars in
August, the highest deficit since a 6.4 billion dollars imbalance
in December 1996. The volume of crude oil shipments and the price
both rose, with the average price per barrel climbing to 17.80
dollars, the highest level since March 1997 and up from 16.01
dollars in July. U.S. deficit with the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries hit a record of 2.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports of foreign cars and auto parts hit a record
in August of 15.8 billion dollars as did imports of consumer
goods, which climbed to 20.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the export side, shipments of USA-made autos and parts set a
record in August, climbing to 6.7 billion dollars. Exports of
capital goods were also at an all-time high of 27.3 billion
dollars. Farm exports were up 3.3 percent in August to 3.94
billion dollars, but are still running 4.3 percent behind last
year's levels.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports to Mexico climbed to a record but imports from the
country also set a record, pushing the U.S. deficit with Mexico to
2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The August deficit with Canada also hit a record of 3.5 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Teachers Go on Strike for Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 67,000 Lebanese teachers
began a two-day strike Wednesday throughout the country to protest
the government's failure to meet their demands for pay raise.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which kept nearly 700,000 students away from
classes, involves teachers at state-run elementary and
intermediate schools, who claim they are excluded from a salary
compromise the government reached with secondary and high-school
teachers early in summer.
</P>
<P>
Many private elementary and intermediate schools abstained from
joining the strike because they had already given their teachers
salary raise that is being demanded by the striking union.
</P>
<P>
The crisis erupted over a student stampede from expensive
private schools to cheaper state-run schools because parents
could not afford skyrocketing tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the influx, Education Minister Mohammed Youssef
Beydoun has ordered extra curricula and an extension of the
academic year from nine to 10 months.
</P>
<P>
But he ignored their demand by teachers for corresponding
allowances as well as their original demand for equality with
secondary and high-school teachers.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Pan-Lebanon Teachers' Union George Saadeh said
that they will continue their strike until their demands are
met.

<HEADLINE> Former Nazi Collaborator Could Have Fled France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Nazi collaborator Maurice
Papon who was convicted of crimes against humanity could have fled
France.
</P>
<P>
In a communique sent from an unidentified place on Wednesday,
Papon said that he has chosen to go into exile rather than
spending the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
Papon, 88, was condemned to 10 years of prison in April 1998
for deporting thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps from the
Gironde region in southwest France.
</P>
<P>
He was not put under police surveillance after his conviction,
said authorities.
</P>
<P>
Papon, who has not been seen for weeks in his residence in
Bordeaux, has appealed to the European Court of Human Rights,
accusing the French judicial authorities of injustice.
</P>
<P>
The French highest court, the Cour de Cassation, is expected to
reject his final appeal on Thursday and order the implementation
of his prison terms.
</P>
<P>
Papon will have to surrender to the French authorities, short
of which he will be arrested.
</P>
<P>
Papon said that the declaration by the French authorities that
he is in a "state of prisoner" contradicts with the stand of the
European Court of Human Rights. The European Court of Human
Rights does not regard one as in a state of prisoner until his
final appeal is rejected.
</P>
<P>
Papon, who was a senior police officer under a collaboration
regime in Gironde during the Nazi occupation, also published a
letter on Wednesday in the Bordeaux-based Sud Ouest daily, saying
that he is not in a state of prisoner.
</P>
<P>
The letter is accompanied by a photo believed to be taken
recently, in which Papon was wearing summer clothes, raising
readers' speculation that he could be living in a southern
European or North African country.
</P>
<P>
Some Jewish and civil groups have warned that a fleeing of
justice by Papon would be a great "humiliation" for them.
</P>
<P>
The French government said that once the Cour de Cassation
rejects Papon's appeal on Thursday, an international arrest
mandate will be issued against him.

<HEADLINE> FedEx Cargo Plane's Black Box Recovered in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The black box of the U.S.
Federal Express (FedEx) cargo plane which crashed into Subic Bay
in northern Philippines after overshooting the airport runway was
recovered Wednesday, Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Victor Mamon, official of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority
(SBMA) was quoted as saying that the black box, the plane's voice
and data recorder, was retrieved by combined SBMA frogmen and
FedEx-hired professional divers at the crash site.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated plane, which plunged into the Subic Bay last
Sunday, remained where it crashed near the northeast end of the
Subic Bay International Airport, the PNA added.
</P>
<P>
Mamon said the black box has already been turned over to the
Air Transportation Office which will turn over the same to the
United States authorities who would conduct their own
investigation on the accident.
</P>
<P>
A joint SBMA-FedEx team is still undertaking salvage operations
at the crash site to extricate the remains of the plane together
with its cargo, mostly electronic goods and garments that have
been submerged under water since the crash.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SBMA Chief Operating Officer Antonio Rex Chan said
the beaches near the crash site will resume normal operations next
week.
</P>
<P>
"The salvage team is still cleaning up the wreckage debris from
the crash site so we have temporarily closed nearby beaches," Chan
explained.
</P>
<P>
"Possibly by next week, if all debris have been cleared, we
will resume normal operations in these beaches," he added.

<HEADLINE> Pirated Discs Manufacturing Center Smashed in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs officers
Tuesday smashed a major piracy syndicate after the neutralization
of its underground CD factory and three storage centers in New
Territories, the government said on today.
</P>
<P>
During the anti-piracy operation, the officers of the Hong Kong
Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau impounded two
production lines and seized more than 600,000 pirated optical
discs, totally worth 20 million HK dollars (2.56 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Acting on investigations, Customs officers raided the piracy
syndicate's factory in Sha Tin and three storage centers, seized
the pirated discs and arrested six men and one woman aged between
19 and 58.
</P>
<P>
According to the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance, the
maximum penalty for operating a CD factory without a valid license
is a fine of one million HK dollars (128,205 U.S. dollars) and
four years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers have so far this year smashed nine unlicensed
optical discs factories and impounded 14 production lines, worth a
total of 69.9 million HK dollars (8.96 million U.S. dollars), a
spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Customs officers smashed a heroin
manufacturing center and arrested two men and two women in Tuen
Mun and Fotan districts following the seizure of 2.41 kilograms of
heroin, worth about 1.5 million HK dollars (192,308 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> No Catholic Jailed For Religious Beliefs:Religious Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The principle of religious
freedom is fully observed in China, which is now at its historical
best in terms of religious practices, said Liu Bainian, vice-
chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, during an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In response to recent United States State Department
accusations of alleged violation of religious freedom in its "
Annual Report on International Religious Freedom for 1999," Liu
said that in China, no Catholic has been jailed for religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
"China is a country ruled by law, everybody is equal in front
of law. If a person was jailed, the only reason will be that he or
she has broken the law and this will have nothing to do with his
or her religious belief," he said.
</P>
<P>
If a nation can have stones thrown at it because a small number
of its religion people are jailed for having committed crimes,
then the U.S. will be the first country to have 'religious
persecution', because most prisoners in the U.S. believe in
religion, Liu emphasized.
</P>
<P>
According to him, every year for the past ten years, more than
60,000 people in China have been baptized. Churches in China have
their own publishing houses, printing altogether 3.4 million
copies of religious materials.
</P>
<P>
He added that nationwide, more than 1,000 Catholic religious
staff are now deputies to the people's congress and committee
members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
at all levels.

<HEADLINE> T-bonds to Contribute 2 Percentage Points to GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The additional issuance of 60
billion yuan in treasury bonds is expected to contribute 1.5 to 2
percentage points to China's gross domestic product (GDP) growth
this year, according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
The T-bonds will bring along some 250 billion yuan in bank
loans, stimulate domestic demand, and help to continue rapid
economic development, said an official with the finance ministry,
Cong Anni, at today's opening of the China Economic Forum, themed
"China Entering the New Millennium."
</P>
<P>
China adopted the pro-active financial policy in the latter
half of last year by increasing 100 billion yuan-worth of T-bonds
to focus on infrastructure, which were reported to have
contributed 1.5 percentage points to the country's GDP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newly-issued financial bonds will go to major
infrastructure projects under construction, technological
upgrading projects in some key sectors, hi-tech industrialization,
environmental protection and ecosystem construction, as well as
facilities for science and education.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists hold that the expansive financial policy
will still remain the central government's main choice to promote
economic growth for a relatively long period.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the scheduled 7 percent GDP growth target for
1999 can be met and even exceeded as the state policies linked
with this effort are paying off, said Qie Jianwei, an official at
the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
The three-day forum will address a wide range of topics, with
senior Chinese government officials from various departments
describing economic prospects, elaborating on relevant policies
and revealing the opportunities and challenges for China's
economic development in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, officials from such international organizations as
the World Trade Organization and the European Central Bank will
present their views on China's economic development in the context
of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The conference is jointly sponsored by the SDPC Academy of
Macroeconomics Research and the French BNP Prime Peregrine Group.

<HEADLINE> China Develops More NC Machine Tools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China has developed more than
500 varieties of numerical control machine tools so far, doubling
the figures in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
At the Sixth China International Machine Tool Show which opened
here today, domestic manufacturers exhibited high-tech digitally-
controlled machine tools developed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Of the 592 Chinese-made machine tools on display, 362 are
computerized.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Lin, senior engineer from the China Machine Tool and Tool
Builders' Association (CMTBA), noted that the machine tool
industry, especially the segment including high-tech digital
control machine tools, is of great strategic importance for
economic development as it helps manufacture all kinds of
machinery for civil and military use.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China has quickened efforts to research and
make digital control machine tools. The rapid development of
software products and electronic components and parts in recent
years also stimulated the research.
</P>
<P>
The domestic machine tool manufacturers have benefited from the
rapid pace. In 1998, domestic machine tools had 53 percent of the
total shares on the home market, up from some 36 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The machine tool industry has also regained growth after five
consecutive years of losses, with the total output value in the
first eight months of this year growing by 11.3 percent from the
same period last year. Total export volume of machine tools from
January to August this year also rose by 14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhou attributed the pick-up to the nation's ongoing efforts to
expand domestic demand and to support growth of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
She added that nearly all machine tool manufacturers are doing
their utmost to adjust their industrial structures, develop new
products, and seek breakthrough developments in key technologies.
</P>
<P>
The machine tool show, sponsored by the CMTBA, will last seven
days. More than 1,000 major machine tool manufacturers from 25
countries and regions put on display over 1,000 machine tools and
thousands of related items in a 60,000-square-meter exhibition
area.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said today
that an important element of the country's economic and technical
policy is the adoption of international technical standards and
advanced standards in order to improve Chinese products and
services and boost international trade.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo told an International
Standardization Organization ISO) conference that by adopting
international technical standards China can learn and digest
advanced technologies and management experience and apply them to
its products and services.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech to the 22nd ISO General Assembly, which
opened in Beijing today, Wu said that during the ongoing
negotiations on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (
WTO), China has focused on and carefully studied the active role
of international standards in eliminating non-tariff technical
trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
"Great efforts have been made to gain a full understanding of
the obligations to be assumed by China and the rights to which the
country will be entitled upon entry into the WTO," he told the
assembly.
</P>
<P>
The three-day assembly, the first of its kind held in China or
other developing countries in its 52 year history, is focusing on
the organization's major policy-making, long-term plans, and
issues related to technical assistance to standardization
organizations in developing countries, as well as personnel
training.

<P>
"The Chinese government is doing what it can to do away with
unnecessary impediments which technical regulations and standards
tend to impose on trade," the vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
"An important theme ISO has consistently committed itself to is
helping developing countries solve the problems of resources and
technologies and management in standardization efforts, so as to
bridge the gap between developed and developing countries in this
regard."

He said China is ready to play an active role in the work of
the international standardization organizations, and work together

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Seminar on Supplementary Pension Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Seminar of
Supplementary Pensions in China's Enterprises opened today in
Beijing attended by more than 100 scholars, experts and government
officials, mainly from China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jianlun, vice-minister of labor and social security, said
in his opening remarks that in recent years, enterprises'
supplementary pensions have been given great attention by the
Chinese government, enterprises and researchers.
</P>
<P>
"Only the establishment of a multi-tiered pension system,
including supplementary pensions, can assure that reform of the
basic pension system matches other aspects of the economy,
supplements the basic pension, rationally shares the risks,
mitigates the increasingly acute contradictions between supply and
demand of retirement benefits, and protects and improves the basic
living standard of retired workers," she said.
</P>
<P>
China began to sponsor supplementary pension plans in the late
1980's. However, according to Wang, it is still in a start-up
phase in China.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, she said, the number of workers participating in
supplementary pension plans was less than five percent, while in
countries with a fully developed supplementary pension plan system,
this figure can reach 50 percent or even 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is now taking measures to adjust and
standardize the supplementary pension system as well as to improve
related policies in order to promote the healthy development of
supplementary pension plan in enterprise," she said.
</P>
<P>
Today's seminar was jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Labor
and Social Security and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (
MetLife) of the US.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1868 and headquartered in New York, MetLife is one
of the world's leading providers of insurance and financial
products and services to a broad spectrum of individual and group
customers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Banks Free to Merge, but with Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's central bank
Wednesday announced the new ruling for local banking institutions
to merge with a new deadline.
</P>
<P>
Local banking institutions will now be free to form their own
merger groups and choose their own leader in each group to lead
the merger process, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Governor Ali Abul
Hassan Sulaiman said here in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "They should then proceed to complete all
aspects of the merger exercise by end-December 2000."
</P>
<P>
This represents a major departure from the previous ruling by
BNM that the 58 financial institutions merge into six anchor
banking groups by April 2000.
</P>
<P>
The bank governor said the move was made in view of the recent
announcements by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the statement
by Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said domestic institutions would be allowed to terminate the
memorandum of understanding signed with the earlier partners by
September 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The institutions are also required to revert to Bank Negara by
end-January 2000 on their respective merger groupings as well as
the agreement in principle from the major shareholders of the
banking institutions in the group, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ali said the (latest) flexibility provided to the banking
institutions does not in any way reduce the importance of bank
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
"We need a strong and efficient banking system that is
resilient in order to support the financing needs of the economy
so that the nation can continue to achieve a strong and
sustainable growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that given the impending liberalization and
globalization of the banking sector, the consolidation of domestic
banking institutions is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
A fragmented system would only increase the vulnerability of
the financial system and vulnerability of the economy as a whole,
he said, adding the policy to consolidate domestic banking
institutions and strengthen the banking system would therefore
continue to remain a priority objective of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that under the new approach, greater
responsibility is now with the shareholders of the domestic
banking institutions to initiate and drive the merger process, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In the event that the shareholders of the banking institutions
do not make full use of the flexibility accorded to merge among
themselves, BNM would intervene directly to select the merger
partners to ensure that the consolidation objective is achieved,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the proposed bank consolidation exercise
would not increase the level of unemployment in the country as
evidenced by the recent merger of Bank Bumiputra and Bank of
Commerce which did not lead to staff lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
He reminded banks that the merger exercise should not disrupt
their normal operations and they should continue to place special
emphasis on loan growth, a vital ingredient of the recovery
process of the economy.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China's Economy Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Wednesday that China has been able to maintain a
stable economic growth thanks to the series of strong measures it
has adopted.
</P>
<P>
"China's economy on the whole is doing well," Jiang said at the
welcoming luncheon hosted by the China-Britain Business Council.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president, who is on a five-day state visit to the
United Kingdom, added that China will take further steps to
increase effective demand, speed up infrastructure construction,
readjust the economic structure, keep agriculture on a course of
steady development, push forward technological progress of
enterprises and industrial upgrading, step up the ecological and
environmental development and raise the quality and efficiency of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of a 7-percent economic growth projected for
this year can be attained," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's economy is also faced with some new situations and
new problems on its way ahead," Jiang admitted.
</P>
<P>
The new problems he listed in the speech are as follows:
</P>
<P>
--- The impact of the Asian financial crisis is yet to be
completely eliminated;
</P>
<P>
--- Deep-seated contradictions in the course of reform are in
dire need of solutions;
</P>
<P>
--- Economic and industrial structures must be urgently
readjusted;
</P>
<P>
--- Exports are under considerable pressure due to the sagging
consumption in the domestic market;
</P>
<P>
--- It is an arduous task to divert and resettle the redundant
employees in state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
"In a word, our persistent efforts to strike a right balance
between reform, development and stability have made it possible to
promote sustained, rapid and healthy growth of China's economy and
also to maintain a sound social and political stability," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"China follows a basic economic system of simultaneous
development of multiple ownerships with the state sector playing
the main role," Jiang elaborated. "SOE reform is a central link of
China's economic restructuring. It concerns with whether China can
secure sustainable economic growth, establish a socialist market
economy and continue to improve people's living standards."
</P>
<P>
Jiang reaffirmed China's commitment to opening up, saying it
is a long-term basic state policy.
</P>
<P>
"To press ahead with economic growth, we in China need to
bring about greater openness," Jiang said. "We will join the world
as a more active player and work to improve the all-dimensional
and multi-leveled opening-up pattern in wide-ranging areas."

<HEADLINE> Work On Sino-Russian Nuclear Power Plant Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Work on the Tianwan Nuclear
Power Plant, the largest joint venture between China and Russia,
began today in Lianyungang, a coastal city in east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
This represents a remarkable step forward by China in nuclear
power development, said Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo at the
ceremony for the start of the project here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin exchanged letters of congratulations on the event.
</P>
<P>
The Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant eventually will have four
pressurized water reactor nuclear power generators, each with a
generating capacity of one million kilowatts. The first two
generators will begin operation in 2004 and 2005 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that nuclear power is an economic, safe and clean type
of energy and the construction of the new plant as scheduled will
be conducive not only to the development of the nuclear power
industry and the local economy but also to environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Russia have established close and
favorable cooperative ties since December 1997 when the two
countries decided to jointly build the plant.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides will further enhance
cooperation and make the plant safe and well-performing.
</P>
<P>
China now has four nuclear power projects under construction.
The other three are the second and third phases of the Qinshan
Nuclear Power Plant in east China's Zhejiang Province and the Ling
'ao Nuclear Power Plant in southern Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the ceremony were dozens of other Chinese and
Russian officials, including Russia's Vice-Minister of Nuclear
Energy E.A. Reshetnikov and Russian Ambassador to China Igor
Rogachev.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Slams Alllegd Israeli Military Threats to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has lashed out at reported
Israeli threats to take military actions against Syria should
Damascus refuse to resume peace talks with the Jewish state, the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The threats by Israel to attack Syria are hollow and will not
shake the Arab stance" on seeking solutions to the Arab-Israeli
conflict, Osama el-Baz, political adviser of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An Arabic-language daily has reported that during a recent
visit to the United States by Jordanian King Abdullah, U.S.
officials conveyed to him the Israeli threats.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Jordanian officials have refused to comment on the
reports, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The threats "seriously challenged the concept of regional
peace," el-Baz told reporters after a meeting between Mubarak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Egypt's Mediterranean port
city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to take any opportunity to restart" the
Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations from where they broke off, which
should be based on the land-for-peace principle, el-Baz stressed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was taking the Israeli threats seriously, he said,
calling on Israel to "halt such threats."
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Syria and Israel were suspended in
early 1996 due to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights
that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
After the moderate Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, took
office in early July, leaders of both countries have said they
are interested in resuming the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted that late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin pledged a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. It insists
that the talks be resumed on that basis. But Israel disagrees.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Meets PM, Ministers on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
held a meeting with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and top cabinet
ministers on Wednesday to discuss the situation around the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,
Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo, foreign intelligence and
domestic security service chiefs attended the meeting at Yeltsin's
country residence outside Moscow, where he was recovering from flu.
</P>
<P>
Putin, riding a wave of popular support for the military
campaign in Chechnya, flew to the troubled North Caucasus region
on Wednesday to discuss the refugee crisis and decorate the war
heroes, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
While in Krasnodar, Putin will hold a meeting with senior
officials of the Ministry for Emergency Situations, Ministry of
Health and Ministry for the Press to discuss ways of assisting
refugees and the North Caucasus region as a whole, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign came after two waves of armed incursions
into Dagestan led by Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab,
a Jordanian native known only by his last name. The two have also
been accused of being behind a spate of apartment building
explosions that killed about 300 people in Moscow and two other
Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
From Krasnodar, Putin is expected to fly to Mozdok in North
Ossetia to visit a number of federal bases.
</P>
<P>
Putin is expected to present state awards to the servicemen
fighting against Chechen rebels and meet with the commanders of
the federal forces in the North Caucasus, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Federal forces have seized one-third of Chechnya and efforts
are being made to reestablish governing bodies and resume normalcy
to the areas liberated by federal troops.
</P>
<P>
The federal advance and bombing raids against rebel positions
in the breakaway republic have triggered an exodus of nearly 160,
000 refugees, posing immense difficulty for the neighboring
regions to feed and house them.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, federal planes continued their bombing
raids on rebel positions, delivering missile and bombs on rebel
formations near Alkhan-Yurt near Grozny, the Chechen capital, and
in Chechnya's southern districts, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 missions were flown during the period as Su-25
attack planes and frontline bombers rendered mountain roads in the
Argun Gorge impassable and destroying a bridge near the village of
Chiri-Yurt, two ammunition depots, and an air defense system.
</P>
<P>
About 50 rebels were killed in the raids and several kilometers
of mountain roads were mined from air, Interfax said, quoting
federal military sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, air reconnaissance operations have "revealed new
targets," which means more air strikes will be delivered in the
coming days.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Extends Ban on Foreign Exchange Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) Wednesday extended its ban on trading of foreign exchanges
in the open market until October 24.
</P>
<P>
The bank banned foreign exchange trading until October 20 after
last week's takeover by the military. The move was intended to
check a possible slide in the value of the Pakistani rupee and
forestall flight of capital.
</P>
<P>
In an official announcement, the bank extended the ban through
Sunday and instructed money changers to keep their premises closed
for public dealings and not to carry out any trading until the ban
is lifted.
</P>
<P>
"The ban (on foreign exchange trading) was extended through
mutual consultation between the Forex Association of Pakistan and
the SBP," President of the Forex Association Malik Bostan said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Forex Association and the State Bank
are working together to control illegal flight of capital.
</P>
<P>
"The association has already made arrangements of 20 million
U.S. dollars to meet any pressure when the market will open on
Monday (October 24)," Bostan said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani authorities feared speculative trading, flight of
capital and devaluation of the local currency, the rupee, after
the military coup last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves are believed to be at a
level of 1.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> UN Review Finds Air Cleaner Than Decade Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The air is definitely cleaner
now than a decade or two ago, said the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UNECE) in a report published here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, sulfur emissions have halved since 1980, nitrogen
oxide emissions (NOx) are down 16 percent on their 1990 levels,
emissions of volatile organic compounds are 20 percent lower than
in 1990, and ammonia emissions have dropped 18 percent since 1990,
according to UNECE's Major Review of Strategies and Policies for
Air Pollution Abatement.
</P>
<P>
UNECE said that these impressive achievements are largely the
result of the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air
Pollution, which was drawn up under the auspices of the UN agency.
</P>
<P>
The framework convention and its seven protocols have forced
the signatory countries to make sweeping cuts in air pollution and
also put political pressure on non-signatories to keep their
emissions down.
</P>
<P>
The review includes tables with the emission levels of those
air pollutants that are covered by the protocols and maps of the
most vulnerable ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
It shows that the emissions of sulfur in Austria, Finland and
Sweden are less than a fifth of their 1980 level and those in
Canada and Bulgaria are respectively 45 percent and 30 percent
lower.
</P>
<P>
However, UNECE said, Ireland, France, the United States, Italy
and Spain, which are all parties to the NOx Protocol, have not cut
their emissions of nitrogen oxides. The United States still emits
21.2 million tons of NOx a year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Moslems Enjoy Complete Religious Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China's 20 million Moslems are
enjoying complete religious freedom endorsed by China's
Constitution. The religious activities of Moslems are protected by
law, said Wan Yaobin, vice-president of the Islamic Association of
China.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a recent report on religion in China published by
the US State Department, Wan said: "This is using the name of
religious freedom to meddle in the internal affairs of China."
</P>
<P>
Ten colleges conducting Islamic higher education as well as two
other Islamic schools in Xinjiang have been set up with government
support. "Altogether 20,000 students have graduated from various
Islamic colleges and mosques." "Some have even graduated abroad,"
Wan said.
</P>
<P>
To maintain social stability and unity in Xinjiang and ensure
normal religious activities of Moslems, the local government has
cracked down on terrorist and sabotage activities according to law.
This has nothing to do with "religious persecution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wan said a mosque was mentioned by the U.S. report as being
destroyed in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. Actually this mosque was
pulled down in accordance with city planning and a new mosque,
larger and more splendid was built 50 meters from its original
site.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Power Station Adopts Advanced Safety Standards (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tianwan Nuclear Power
Station jointly undertaken by China and Russia is under
construction in Lianyungang, a coastal city in east China's
Jiangsu Province, and it has met world-level safety standards.
</P>
<P>
A group of Chinese nuclear safety experts issued the conclusion
following a recent examination of the station, said Ouyang Yu, an
academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The station has in particular given full consideration to the
prevention of severe accidents and in terms of safety standards
will be comparable to all other Chinese nuclear power stations in
operation and under construction," said Ouyang, who is also chief
engineer of the Jiangsu Nuclear Power Co., Ltd..
</P>
<P>
The new station, the main part of which goes under construction
today, is designed in accordance with the latest safety
regulations from the International Atomic Energy Agency and also
takes into consideration the experience of Russia and other
Western countries in building and operating nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
Key technology used for it has been modeled after that used by
the 20-odd pressurized water reactor (PWR) nuclear power stations
built in Russia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Ouyang, the new station, the largest cooperation
project between the two countries, will have two Russia-made PWR
generating units installed for the first phase, each with a
generating capacity of one million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Ouyang said that the project will be China's first nuclear
power station with double containment which can better prevent
nuclear radiation and leakage.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Reform Financial Procedures to Curb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set
up a task force to speed up the proposed reform of existing
procurement and financial procedure to check the endemic
corruption in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to enthrone transparency and
accountability in the conduct of business in the country,
particularly within the government establishments, Finance
Minister Malam Adamu Ciroma said in capital Abuja Tuesday when
inaugurating the 23-member task force.
</P>
<P>
The proposed reform would bring immense benefits to the
country, especially the rational utilization of resources,
official New Nigerian newspaper Wednesday quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The task force is assigned to prepare a Country Procurement
Assessment Report and the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment studies to be considered at a three-day workshop
scheduled for Abuja next month.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the studies were aimed at working out an
 internationally acceptable, comprehensive and operational
procurement and financial management system.
</P>
<P>
Apart from discouraging corruption in the conduct of public and
private sector business, the proposed reform would promote
competitiveness and ensure value for money in the award of
contracts, Ciroma noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the finance minister, the Nigerian government has
already taken some measures to not only ensure transparency and
accountability, but minimize the incidence of corruption in
procurement and financial transaction in government
establishments.
</P>
<P>
The measures include review of the civil service rules and the
financial regulations, re-introduction of competitive bidding
system in contract awards, introduction of financial limits for
defined levels of authority, and the statutory weekly meetings of
the Federal Executive Council under the chairmanship of the
president.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that the task force was constituted
after preliminary works and visits to three states by government
officials and representatives of the World Bank in July this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
The new Station will have four safety backup systems, compared
with two at other nuclear power stations, and there will be
controls in place to handle unforeseen accidents.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technology is to be used to lengthen the burning time
of nuclear fuel so as to make better use of it.
</P>
<P>
Siemens digital instrumentation and control systems, believed
to be the most advanced in the world, will be adopted to ensure
sound operation of the station.
</P>
<P>
"All these measures will help enhance safety in the future
operation of the station," said Wang Jun, an official of China's
National Nuclear Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
To successfully build the station in accordance with advanced
international standards, Wang said, both China and Russia have
pledged to strengthen cooperation while taking further steps to
gain an even higher technological level.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Japan's recent nuclear accident, Wang said that
China will not have such occurrences because it has laid a firm
foundation for nuclear research and established a strict
technological management system.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a team of Russian experts are stationed in
Lianyungang providing technical guidance, while a group of Chinese
nuclear specialists have been sent to Russia to supervise the
manufacture of the equipment.

<HEADLINE> E. Asia Stands at Important Juncture: EAES Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Co-Chairman of the ongoing
East Asia Economic Summit Tommy Koh, who is also Singapore
ambassador-at- large, said here Wednesday that East Asia stands at
an important juncture and must leave behind some old ways of doing
business.
</P>
<P>
Koh, who is also executive director of the Asia-Europe
Foundation, made the remarks at a press conference by the
co-chairmen of the summit to brief reporters on their impressions
of the discussions at the summit organized by the
Switzerland-based World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the discussions in the past two and half days, Koh
said there is consensus at the summit that East Asia is recovering
and should continue to achieve a consolidated and sustainable
recovery.
</P>
<P>
On what East Asia should do in the aftermath of the Asian
economic crisis, Koh said, "We are at the threshold of a new era,
but it is not obvious there will surely be a new Asia. East Asia
stands at a very important juncture."
</P>
<P>
He said there are two roads before East Asia, one is a high and
difficult road which will lead to a new Asia but has a lot of
obstacles to overcome while the other is a low, easy road that is
back to old East Asia but has no passes.
</P>
<P>
East Asia must choose the high and difficult road and co-create
the new Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to how a new Asia can be realized about, Koh said East
Asia must leave behind some old ways of doing business and abandon
KKN, the acronym for corruption, collusion and nepotism in the
Indonesian language.
</P>
<P>
"We must embrace for good corporate governance," he said,
adding that the three core values of governance, whether in the
public or private sector, are transparency, accountability and
integrity just as Secretary-General of the Organization of the
Economic Cooperation and Development Donald Johntson had said at
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Koh also urged East Asia to embrace new technology, such as the
IT, and follow new ways in doing business.
</P>
<P>
It is a major challenge for East Asia to leave behind some
century-old culture which emphasizes harmony, order and respect
for authority, Koh said.
</P>
<P>
Koh said the quality of manpower is the sole answer for East
Asia to remain competitive and offer foreign investors higher
returns for their investments.
</P>
<P>
Without high-quality manpower in East Asia, foreign investors
will obtain their investment returns from other parts of the
world, he indicated.
</P>
<P>
Koh said East Asia must address substantially education and
training of the young people and produce a new generation who are
able to do high-valued jobs.
</P>
<P>
Saying that "East Asia can not take the journey alone," he
urged participants of the summit to support the multilateral trade
system and work hard in Seattle next month to arrive at a
share-balanced agenda to launch the millennium-round negotiation
of world trade.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sees Rapid Growth in Tourism for Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe,
central bank of the country, said that tourist arrivals and
receipts during the decade from 1989 to 1998 grew at annual
average rates of 18.5 percent and 25 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in its economic highlights released here
Wednesday that arrivals rose from 1.3 million in 1997 to two
million in 1998 while receipts increased by 50 percent to over one
 billion U.S. dollars in last year alone.
</P>
<P>
This year, the sector has been projected to earn more than 1.3
billion dollars from about three million tourists, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The large growth in tourism has seen its overall contribution
to the economy rise to 12.5 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) and account for a 4. 5 percent of national employment totals
with an additional four percent in related activities," said the
bank.

<HEADLINE> New Vehicle Sales Drop in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's new vehicle
manufacturers have sold 6,471 units by the end of September this
year, compared with 7,496 units during the same period last year,
representing a 13.7 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Motor Industry Association said that of the sales,
3,428 vehicles were imported as fully built units while 3,043 were
assembled ones.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Kenya's new vehicle sales totalled 10,069
units last year, 11,713 units in 1997 and 12,654 units in 1996,
the People Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the decline in vehicle sales to the
country's economic problems. The Kenyan economy grew by only
1.4 percent in the year to July, 1999 as against 1.8 percent in
1998 and 2.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Economists here predict that the economy in the east African
country will not perform any better for the full year.
</P>
<P>
"The economic slowdown has depleted people's purchasing power,"
said Mwaniki Mageria, corporate manager at Amazon Motors.
</P>
<P>
He added that increased competition from importers of used cars
has cut the market share controlled by the makes of new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
However, operators in the used car sector say their sales have
also declined due to sharp depreciation of the local currency
shilling which has devalued by more than 20 percent since January.

<HEADLINE> China to Make Environmental Protection Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Overburdened by an inefficient
pollution treatment system, China plans to turn environmental
protection into something more profitable, according to a senior
Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Governments, banks, domestic and overseas firms and individuals
will all be allowed to invest in the environmental industry, Song
Ruixiang, deputy director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA), said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, China will have a large number of pollution-
treating companies which can provide professional service to
enterprises," Song told the ongoing annual meeting of the China
Association for Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the lack of investment and efficient
systems has been hindering pollution treatment work in China.
</P>
<P>
The country has long abided by a principle that enterprises
should be responsible for dealing with their own pollution
problems, but this can result in the unnecessary duplication of
treatment facilities and low efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Song Ruixiang said only one-third of the pollution treatment
facilities in China are in working order at present.
</P>
<P>
"After the market-oriented service system is established, those
enterprises will just pay for the service," he said.
</P>
<P>
The environmental burden on China has been increased in the
wake of industrialization. An estimate by the World Bank showed
that economic losses brought on by environmental damage in China
accounted for eight percent of its gross domestic product in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Total investment into dealing with China's key industrial and
air pollution areas has largely outnumbered profits from
industries in those areas, according to the SEPA.

TOKYO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan Vice Defense Minister
Shingo Nishimura Wednesday resigned from his post after receiving
strong criticism for suggesting that Japan arm itself with nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Nishimura said in an interview with the Weekly Playboy
magazine that Japanese parliament "should consider the fact that
Japan may be better off if it arms itself with nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Democratic Party of Japan, Social Democratic
Party and the Japanese Communist Party issued statements accusing
Nishimura's remarks of running counter to Japan's policy on
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Nishimura, a member of the Liberal Party, sparked controversy
in 1997 when he made a trip to China's Diaoyudao Islands (known in
Japan as Senkaku Islands) in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Nishimura became vice minister on October 5, 1999 when Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi reshuffled his cabinet to launch a new
coalition government of the Liberal Democratic Party, Liberal
Party and the New Komeito Party.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is to hold an initial
discussion with some cabinet members Thursday on ways of
implementing a political and security separation from the
Palestinians. Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Foreign
Minister David Levy will present Barak with ideas on how to
address issues arising from a separation.
</P>
<P>
According to an Army Radio report, the two will recommend a
demilitarized Palestinian state with an electric fence separating
it from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is unlikely to agree to give Israel
substantial funding to either a final-status agreement with the
Palestinians or a deal with Syria, American sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new assessment of the American reluctance stems from budget
battles in Washington between the Democratic-ruled administration
and the Republican-dominated Congress, specifically from Congress'
refusal to include an aid package to Israel promised as part of
the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite skepticism from the Israeli Foreign Ministry and
denials from Iran, former South African President Nelson Mandela
remained adamant Tuesday that Iran is interested in a peaceful and
stable Middle East. He also said Iranian leaders assured him that
the 13 Jews arrested there on espionage charges will have a fair
trial.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The dismantling of West Bank settlement outposts began
Tuesday night, when settlers took down a water tower from a
hilltop near the settlement of Shvut Rahel north of Ramallah
under a compromise deal with the government.
</P>
<P>
The tower was taken apart not long after Barak and security
officials issued veiled threats that the army and police might
have to intervene if the settlers fail to remove it themselves.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's President-Elect Thanks Megawati </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's newly-elected
President Abdurrahman Wahid Wednesday thanked Megawati
Soekarnoputri, general chairman of the Indonesian Democratic Party
of Struggle, who lost in the presidential election, and her
backers for their understanding about his health condition.
</P>
<P>
"I deeply appreciate Mega because she has known that I am not
healthy, but she does not bob up and down on my sickness. Herself
and her assistants must be respected," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid alias Gus Dur had a brain surgery after experiencing a
stroke in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The nearly-blind Wahid said he will meet outgoing President
B.J. Habibie after calling on a mass gathering at the Semanggi
flyover and the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle here Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Mega and I will soon go to calm down the people gathering at
Semanggi and Hotel Indonesia. From there, I will go ahead to meet
Habibie because he is eventually our brother," Wahid said moments
after he was declared winner in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Megawati conveyed her calls for her supporters
to understand the ballot result of the presidential election which
was in favor of Wahid.
</P>
<P>
Wahid won the presidential race with 373 out of the total 691
votes in a secret ballot conducted by the People's Consultative
Assembly Wednesday. He will be the fourth president of the
Republic of Indonesia after independence.

<P>
SEOUL, October 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday expressed
regret over the remarks by Japanese Vice Defense Minister Shingo
Nishimura that Japan should consider arming itself with nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We express regret because Nishimura's remarks violated the
principle of Japan's decision policy, which is based on its
pacifist constitution, a defense-only policy and the three
principles of non-nuclearization," said a spokesman of the South
Korean Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman hoped that Nishimura's opinion does not represent
Japan's official position on the nuclear issue.

In an interview with Weekly Playboy magazine which was put on
sale Tuesday, the Japanese vice defense minister said the Japanese
parliament "should consider the fact that Japan may be better off

<P>
NICOSIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian man with Cypriot
citizenship under a Greek Cypriot name was arrested on suspicion
of involvement in the work permits scandal at Cyprus' Immigration
Department.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Wednesday that
37-year-old Mahmoud Al Masri was arrested Tuesday afternoon as
part of the investigation into the alleged selling of work and
residency visas by officials.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police last week launched an emergency probe into
allegations that police officers are involved in flesh-trading
and are paid to supply fake residence permits for foreign women in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has acquired a bad reputation for importing female
cabaret dancers who are then allegedly forced to work as
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' immigration chief Christodoulos Nicolaides was arrested
last Friday on suspicion of accepting bribes to "fix" permits for
foreigners, including cabaret dancers.
</P>
<P>
According to police, Masri has been living under the name
Socratis Kosiaris for the past three years and operates an
aluminum workshop.
</P>
<P>
Police said he took money from foreigners, mostly Syrians, to
secure visas and citizenship and in exchange did the decoration
works of the houses of Nicolaides and his relatives free of
charge.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Abdurrahman Wahid, New Indonesian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Abdurrahman Wahid won the
presidential election at a voting conducted by the Indonesian
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) here on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Wahid is the general chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the
largest Muslim organization in Indonesia with around 30 million
members.
</P>
<P>
Born in Jombang, East Java, on August 4, 1940, Wahid,
affectionately known as Gus Dur, is the oldest of six brothers.
His farther, A. Wahid Hasyim, was a religion minister. Abdurrahman
Wahid studied at a number of Pesantren, or traditional Islamic
boarding schools in Java before undertaking tertiary level studies
at the Al-Azhar Islamic University in Cairo, Egypt, in 1964. From
Al-Azhar he went on to further study in the field of literature at
the University of Baghdad in Iraq in 1966, and returned to
Indonesia in 1970.
</P>
<P>
From 1972 to 1974, he was dean of the Faculty of Theology
(Ushuludin) at the Hasjim Asyari University in Jombang. From 1974
to 1980, he became secretary-general of the Tebuireng Pesantren in
Jombang. In 1978, he took up the leadership of Pesantren Ciganjur
in South Jakarta. After moving to Jakarta in 1978, Abdurrahman
Wahid became increasingly involved with the national leadership of
NU. He was made first secretary (Katib Awal) of the NU Supreme
Religious Council (Syuriyah) in 1979 in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
In December 1984, at a National Congress meeting of NU,
Abdurrahman Wahid was elected NU general chairman and re-elected
in 1989 and 1994, for five-year terms.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of his chairmanship of NU, the government
welcomed his presence as a voice for moderation and stability. In
recent years, however, he has increasingly been seen as an
opposition figure as he, together with some leading intellectuals,
launched the ginger group "Forum Demokrasi" (Democratic Forum) to
campaign for democratic reform. His public criticism of former
President Soeharto had put him under considerable political
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Abdurrahman Wahid upholds Islamic education and national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He was married with Nuriyah in 1968 and has four children.

<HEADLINE> INTELSAT Pledges Efforts in Narrowing Urban-Rural Information Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The International
Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) has pledged
to help narrow the information gap between urban and rural areas
by signing a memorandum of understanding with the International
Telecommunication Union.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sideline of Telecom 99 + Interactive 99 held on
October 10-17 in Geneva, John Stanton, vice president of INTELSAT
Sales and Marketing told Xinhua that in a world where three fifths
of the 6 billion people have never no access to basic
telecommunications services, communications satellites can play an
irreplaceable role in providing universal access.
</P>
<P>
Unlike optic cables, communications satellites have no
terrestrial congestion and can cover the whole planet including
those isolated areas where there are no cables. What is more, it
is less expensive for national and local communications services
providers to start their businesses via satellites, Stanton said.
</P>
<P>
INTELSAT, created in 1964, is an international consortium with
143 member countries. Its revenues in 1998 reached over one
billion U.S. dollars while it is supposed to be a "non-profit"
organization.
</P>
<P>
With a fleet of 18 geostationary satellites covering the whole
globe, INTELSAT satellite system now transmits voice, data and
video communications to customers in about 200 countries and
territories 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1965 when INTELSAT launched its first communications
satellite Early Bird, it could only handle around 200 phone calls
and video transmission for one television station.
</P>
<P>
Stanton said he is pleased that INTELSAT has maintained a very
good relationship with China Telecom, which provides
telecommunications services to millions of Chinese including those
in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
He will visit China in two weeks to explore continuity and
expansion of INTELSAT's cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Stanton said that the INTELSAT is undergoing a privatization
process which will not interrupt INTELSAT's operations and that
its commitment to the development of the developing countries'
telecommunications infrastructure will continue because all
relations between INTELSAT and its customers have already been
kept in a business-like way.

</P>
<P>
The province has 1,015 towns, ranking fourth in the number of

lines, highways and coastal areas. The construction of urban
facilities has also developed rapidily. The number of taxi cars in
the province, for example, has risen to nearly four million.

<HEADLINE> Safe Passage to Open Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A safe passage route linking
Gaza and the West Bank is now scheduled to open Monday, after
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators overcame their last disputes
over its technical arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"A final agreement was reached on the safe passage issue, and
the road will open next Monday," the two sides said in a statement
late Tuesday night after talks between Director-General of
Israel's Internal Security Ministry Arye Ramot-Schiffman and
Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Jamil Tarif.
</P>
<P>
The 43-kilometer route, which links the Gaza Strip and the
southern West Bank city of Hebron, was supposed to open on October
3 under the latest Israeli-Palestinian agreement, signed in Sharm
el-Sheikh, Egypt on September 4.
</P>
<P>
But technical arrangements and security issues, such as which
side would have the right to issue the magnetic passes, have
delayed the opening for three times.
</P>
<P>
The route will allow Palestinians to travel relatively freely
between the two separated Palestinian self-rule areas for the
first time in decades.
</P>
<P>
In response to charges by opposition legislators over the
security arrangement, Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami said Tuesday that Israel will have the right to make
arrests on the passage since it is under total Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the Israeli side has given a commitment to
the Palestinian National Authority not to exploit the route to
ambush wanted Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the two sides are close to agreement
on the location of an Israeli checkpoint for another safe passage
route linking Gaza and the northern West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, the northern safe passage
route will be opened in next January.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Golkar Chairman to Run For Vice Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Akbar Tandjung, general
chairman of Indonesia's ruling Golkar Party, will be ready only
for the vice presidential race after the party withdrew his
nomination as presidential candidate Wednesday, a party leader
told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"For the vice presidency, he is ready, but not for the
presidential race," Golkar's Deputy Secretary General Rully
Chairul Azwar said.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Akbar had never prepared himself for the
presidential candidacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Akbar was nominated Wednesday morning by Golkar as the party's
candidate to run for the presidential election after the party's
former presidential candidate B.J. Habibie was rejected in a
voting on his accountability speech.
</P>
<P>
Golkar is the house's second largest political party which has
ruled the country for the last 32 years.
</P>
<P>
To replace Habibie, the party executives in a meeting on
Wednesday morning agreed to pick up Akbar as its presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
But just hours before the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
was to take a vote on the country's next president, Golkar
withdrew Akbar as its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Azwar said it was difficult for Akbar to refuse when Habibie
asked him to be the presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
But then in the last minute, Akbar decided to pull out of the
race, he said.
</P>
<P>
"After he thought further, he decided not to enter into the
presidential rivalry," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Golkar Party Marzuki Darusman said
the decision to withdraw Akbar from the presidential election was
for the sake of the party itself.
</P>
<P>
"It is for the sake of Golkar. It is the best decision," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Darusman did not say whether the decision was made
under pressure.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will elect the country's new vice president on
Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 20 (Xinhua)-- Some graduates of Chinese
universities have volunteered to assist with education in Gansu
Province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 graduates of 22 universities are taking part in a
nationwide education and poverty-relief program in five provinces
including Gansu.
</P>
<P>
About 20 have worked for more than a month in Gansu's Yuzhong
County and have become an important part of the local schools,
making full use of their professional background.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lang of Beijing Normal University has seen how the area
lags behind the rest of China in education and wants to try to be
an information envoy to bring knowledge from eastern parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
China faces serious challenges in providing better education
for its 1.2 billion people and especially for rural and
impoverished people. In addition to providing more financial
support, the Chinese government has been asking for volunteers to
give a hand.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 6,600 community volunteer groups with
10 million volunteers working in education, environmental
protection, poverty reduction, and other areas.

<HEADLINE> Double-Digit Economic Growth In Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The city of Guangzhou in
Guangdong Province registered a GDP of 141 billion yuan in the
first nine months, a 12.7 percent increase on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The city's industrial output was nearly 200 billion yuan, up 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth was partly brought about by increased
spending on key construction projects and urban facilities. Total
spending on fixed assets reached 37 billion yuan in the first
three quarters, up 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign funds coming to Guangzhou was down in the
first quarter, but there was a turn for the better in April after
the city government adopted measures to improve the investment
environment and increase the number of areas open to foreign
investors. As a result, Guangzhou used 2.4 billion U.S. dollars
worth of foreign funds in the first nine months, up 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city's revenues were up 40 percent and yuan
deposits in its financial institutions grew 8.4 percent in the
nine-month period.

<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Central Board of
Health has placed Central Province on cholera alert, following
three deaths out of 18 reported cases in the area.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the health board, Ben Chirwa, confirmed the
cholera outbreak and deaths in Lusaka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Central Province is on alert for emergency preparedness of
medical staff and to ensure supply on hand for control measures,"
Times of Zambia newspaper Wednesday quoted Chirwa as saying.
</P>
<P>
The refugees fleeing the war in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo contributed to the spread of cholera, the health official
said, adding that the health board had mounted an aggressive
campaign countrywide.
</P>
<P>
He said with the coming of the rainy season, cholera would
easily spread if people did not take preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
At the peak of last rainy season, the Zambian government banned
all public gathering after cholera ravaged the country, claiming
159 lives.
</P>
<P>
At least 5,597 cases of cholera have been recorded countrywide
between January and March this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Develop Substance to Prolong Life of Flowers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a substance which can prolong the life of flowers.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Heilongjiang Academy of Science in northeast
China said the effectiveness of the substance is equivalent to the
same product on the international market, but it is a lot cheaper
than its international counterpart.
</P>
<P>
"The gelatinous substance has high purity and low toxicity and
it can also prevent flowers from being harmed by pests," said Liu
Yuguang, one of the researchers at the Academy.
</P>
<P>
Liu explains that the substance prolongs the life of flowers by
releasing nutrients to flowers. Water and earth cultivation often
make the flowers wither because of a shortage of nutrients or too
much of them.
</P>
<P>
Liu also says the amount of nutrients put into the substance
can be delayed or advanced to control the flower blooming process.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Ex-President Vows to Beat Opponents From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the opposition United
National Independence Party (UNIP) and former president, Kenneth
Kaunda, has vowed to beat those fighting to oust him and replace
him.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said in Lusaka Tuesday that he has campaigned vigorously
to beat UNIP Chairman Malimba Masheke, Secretary-General Sebastian
Zulu and Professor Patrick Mvunga, should they go ahead and
contest the party presidency at the extraordinary congress of the
party to be held in December this year.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready for them, I will beat them and welcome them back as
members of the party," Zambia Daily Mail Wednesday quoted the
former state president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who was defeated in the 1991 elections by current
President Frederick Chiluba, said that he is working hard to seek
funds for the congress and announced that he will kick off the
2001 presidential election campaign soon after the congress.
</P>
<P>
"I am doing everything possible to build the party, that is
what is ringing in my head everyday," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, whose parents are Malawian, was barred from running for
the presidency in the elections in 1996, when a constitutional
amendment was adopted under which foreign nationals and those with
foreign parentage are prohibited from contesting the position.
</P>
<P>
UNIP Chairman Masheke told the press last Saturday that the
general view of the party members is that Kaunda should be
challenged at the next party extraordinary congress.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Home Networking Set for Major Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 19 (Xinhua) -- About 650,000 U.S. homes
have some form of networking installed and that number is expected
to reach 10 million by 2003, according to a report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A networked home is the point of digital convergence and today
it means that consumers can access the Internet from anywhere in
their homes, said the report from the Yankee Group, a U.S.
information technology research firm. But soon familiar products
like telephones, stereos and televisions will take on a whole new
life, it added.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of high-speed broadband Internet access
services will also serve as a critical catalyst to the explosive
growth of home networking.
</P>
<P>
According to Yankee Group analysts, broadband Internet brings
with it the need to share access among multiple PCs and to deliver
Internet and multimedia content to many different devices and
locations within the home. This generates instant demand for home
networking solutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the market and consumers in the United States are
ready for the digital home. In fact, according to a Yankee Group's
survey, more than 17 million U.S. households are already
interested in home networking.
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly 10 million homes expected to have networking
solutions by 2003, the Yankee Group predicts that the majority of
these will be employing PC-based networking.
</P>
<P>
More than 4 million PC-based homes will install phone line-
based networking over existing wiring, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1.5 million homes will use wireless networking
technology, and about 300,000 home will use power line networking
that works over existing electrical wiring.

Chen added that most groups of cities are concentrated in the
Yangtze and Pearl River deltas, as well as on Liaodong Peninsula
and in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area. Some 200 medium-sized
cities have been developed on the basis of the fast-growing towns.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that rapid urbanization has to a certain
degree improved the uneven distribution of cities between eastern
and western China. The east is home to 44 percent of cities and
the west 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that China's urbanization development strategy has
paid off by controlling the number and scale of large and extra-
large cities and giving greater room to medium-sized and small
cities as well as small rural towns.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China has worked out a series of
laws and rules to govern the country's urban development, with the
Law on Urbanization Program being widely practiced nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Construction has issued a succession
of rules and regulations concerning choice of sites for urban
construction projects, city development programs, transfer of
state-owned land, and development areas open to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
To ensure harmonious urban and regional development, various
local authorities, such as those in the Yangtze River delta areas,
the Pearl River delta areas and cities and towns surrounding
Shanghai, have worked out their own urban development plans in
accordance with the country's Urbanization Program Law.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. official met with a
representative of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan over the
handover of Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi millionaire accused
of masterminding the 1998 attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa, the
State Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Foley told reporters that Michael Sheehan, the
department's coordinator for counter-terrorism, met Taliban
representative Abdul Hakeem Mujahid in New York on Monday,
following a U.N. Security Council vote Friday that threatens
sanctions on the Taliban unless bin Laden is handed over within 30
days.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Sheehan explained to Mr. Mujahid the implications
of last Friday's U.N. Security Council vote that will impose
sanctions on the Taliban unless international terrorist Osama bin
Laden is turned over to authorities in a country where he can be
brought to justice," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States hoped the Taliban, which controls
most of Afghanistan, would meet the 30-day deadline specified in
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar said in remarks published
Monday that his movement would not hand over bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
But he also told the London-based Arabic-Language al-Hayat
newspaper that his movement would not allow bin Laden to stage
attacks from Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Polish PM Reshuffles Cabinet for Third Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek Tuesday reshuffled his cabinet for the third time in his
two years in office.
</P>
<P>
Longin Komolowski was appointed deputy prime minister to
replace Janusz Tomaszewski, who was dismissed early September.
Another post held by Tomaszewski, the Ministry of Internal Affairs
and Administration, has already been turned over to the 40-year
old Marek Biernacki.
</P>
<P>
Besides his new title, Komolowski maintains his post of
Minister of Labor and Social Policy.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Agriculture and Food Economy Artur Krzysztof
Balazs was dismissed and reappointed Minister of Agriculture and
Rural Development.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Health and Social Welfare Franciszka Cegielska
was dismissed and reappointed Minister of Health.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and
Forestry Jan Szyszko was dismissed and Antoni Tokarczuk was
appointed Minister of Environment.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Committee for Scientific Research, Andrzej
Wiszniewski, was dismissed and reappointed Minister of Science.
And the Minister of Culture and Art, Andrzej Zakrzewski, was
dismissed and reappointed Minister of Culture and National
Heritage.
</P>
<P>
The two governing blocs in Poland, the Solidarity Election
Action (AWS and the Liberal Union for Freedom (UW), have been in a
bitter dispute since the free-market reform began early this year.
</P>
<P>
The AWS caucus wanted to have the deputy Prime Minister,
Finance Minister and UW leader Leszek Balcerowicz sacked while the
UW called for a new face to replace Buzek.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the Polish economy, which shows no sign of
recovery, has aroused strong discontent among the people. The two
governing blocs were forced to reshuffle the cabinet in response
to a call by the people for the government to resign.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. inflation at the
consumer level rose 0.4 percent in September, the biggest increase
in five months of this year, thanks to the higher prices for
gasoline, cigarettes and clothing, the Labor Department reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month's sharp increase in the Consumer Price Index, the
government's most closely watched inflation gauge, followed a 0.3
percent rise in August, the department said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 2.8 percent, sharply higher than the tiny 1.6 percent
increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The faster pace of inflation will mean a bigger cost of living
increase for the 44.2 million Americans getting Social Security
checks, who will see their benefits rise by 2.4 percent starting
in January, nearly doubling the 1.3 percent increase they received
this year.
</P>
<P>
Growing worries about inflation have set off alarm bells on
Wall Street with investors concerned that the Federal Reserve will
be forced to raise interest rates again at their next meeting on
November 16.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan contributed to the
investor unease last week by warning that banks and other lenders
need to make sure they are prepared for the possibility of a "
bursting bubble" of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
September's gain in prices at the retail level was the biggest
increase since a 0.7 percent spurt in last April.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration in inflation this year has come from energy
costs, which through September have been increasing at an annual
rate of 16.1 percent, compared to a decline of 8.8 percent for all
of 1998, when the Asian currency crisis cut sharply into global
demand for crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that energy prices jumped by 2.7 percent in
September, the third straight month of sharp increases. Gasoline
prices climbed 2.6 percent last month while home heating oil shot
up 6.2 percent, the biggest increase in three years.
</P>
<P>
But food costs rose a modest 0.2 percent for the third straight
month as a big drop in fruit prices helped offset sharp increases
in the cost of vegetables and beef.
</P>
<P>
Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, prices were up 0.
3 percent, leaving the so-called core rate of inflation rising at
a much more moderate 1.9 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The core CPI increase of 0.3 percent would have been an even
smaller 0.2 percent in September had it not been for a sharp spurt
in tobacco costs, which were up 6.5 percent. That was the largest
monthly rise since an 18.5 percent spurt in tobacco costs last
December.
</P>
<P>
Clothing costs, which had dropped for four straight months,
were also up in September, increasing by 1.2 percent, as retailers
raised prices for fall and winter clothing lines.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Tuesday, the Commerce Department said that
construction on new homes and apartments dropped by 3.2 percent in
September, the second monthly decline, as the impact of rising
mortgage rates and the hurricane dampened activity.
</P>
<P>
The decline, which was bigger than had been expected, pushed
housing construction down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.62 million units.
</P>
<P>
The weaker-than-expected housing report made bond prices to
initially rally a bit with investors hoping that the slowdown in
this key area of the economy may convince the Fed that its two
earlier rate increases are having the desired effect of slowing
the economy.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi, Indian Border Forces Chiefs to Meet Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The directors general of the
Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and India's Border Security Force (BSF)
will meet at a four-day meeting here beginning next Monday, in an
effort to defuse the prevailing tension on the borders, The
Independent daily newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a regular meeting of the chiefs of the BDR and the
BSF... But the coming meeting assumes special significance as the
situation on the common borders of Bangladesh and India is not
normal for the last couple of months," a senior government
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two chiefs formally meet twice a year, once in Dhaka and
once in New Delhi, he said.
</P>
<P>
Major General Azizur Rahman, director general of the BDR, and
E.N. Rammonhan of the BSF are expected to discuss the existing
situation on the borders with a focus on the recent violent
incidents that claimed a number of lives.
</P>
<P>
At least 13 violent incidents have occurred since August 19
this year at different points along the borders, in which the BSF
opened fire inside the Bangladeshi territory killing nine people,
including two BDR personnel, and injuring five others, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The border situation became tense on August 19 when the 99th
BSF Battalion caught four BDR members from the Bangladeshi
territory at Newagram of Sylhet, northeast Bangladesh. The four
BDR personnel were released later following intervention of the
higher authorities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the BSF tried to push Bangla-speaking Indian
nationals into the Bangladeshi territory several times, but the
attempts were foiled by the BDR," said the official.
</P>
<P>
A total of 73 Bangladeshi people, including six members of the
BDR, the country's border forces, were killed and 84 others were
injured in firing by the BSF in the border areas over the last
four years, according to records of the Home Ministry and the BDR.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Foils Smuggling of Priceless Sea Shells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Customs has foiled a
recent attempt to smuggle out a collection of priceless sea shells
to Canada, the official Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News said the rare collection of 3,133 varieties of
sea shells packed in 14 boxes was considered as one of the finest
and largest in the region.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the smuggling attempt was made by the
collector, a leading Sri Lankan environmental conservationist. But
it did not specify the name of the collector.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent of Customs Biodiversity Protection Unit Samantha
Gunasekera said 30 percent of the collection were from Sri Lanka
and the rest from other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said special permission is required from the Wild Life
Department to possess or export a collection of this nature. But
the collector had no supporting legally valid documents.
</P>
<P>
The suspected smuggler had first said he collected these shells
and was merely trying to exchange some of them with those of other
collectors from different parts of the world. Later he claimed
that they were gifts.
</P>
<P>
Gunasekera said this was probably not the first time for the
collector to smuggled out shells as he was migrating to Canada
with his collection.
</P>
<P>
The collection reportedly outnumbers the 2,000 specimens of the
country's sea shells on record.
</P>
<P>
The collection was confiscated and the smuggler was fined
17,000 rupees (240 U.S. dollars). Further investigations are being
conducted by police.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Presidential Candidate of Indonesia's Crescent Star Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Crescent Star Party
Wednesday morning nominated its General Chairman Yusril Ihza
Mahendra as the party's presidential candidate to run for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Mahendra was born to a poor family in Belitung, South Sumatera,
on February 5, 1956. His father was a staff in a local religious
office and an activist of Islam-based Masyumi party.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Mahendra moved to Jakarta and joined the Law Faculty
in the state-run University of Indonesia. He later went to the
Graduate School of Humanities and Social Science in University of
the Punjab, India.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1993, Mahendra joined the Institute of Post
Graduate Studies in the University Sains Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mahendra was a speech writer of former president Soeharto, who
was forced down on May 21, 1998 amid the country's worst economic
and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mahendra formed the Crescent Star Party in July last year.
According to him, the big idea underlying the establishment of the
party is Islamic modernism which ensures the promotion of
universal Islamic teachings endowed by God to mankind to solve
their problems in life, either in this world or the next.
</P>
<P>
Mahendra told reporters here Wednesday that he hoped all layers
of the nation prayed for his participation in the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
"God willing, I will not ever resign from this candidacy.
Winning or losing is an ordinary thing. The most important thing
is that I have contributed to democracy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Internal Struggle in Albania's Ruling Socialist Party Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The internal struggle of the
Socialist Party of Albania (SPA) has been intensifying and may
lead to the division of the party.
</P>
<P>
Fatos Nano, former prime minister and president of the SPA,
proposed on Tuesday to hold the final meeting of the SPA's third
congress on October 22, since 36 out of the 80 members in the
party's Steering Council did not gain half the votes in the
congress between October 9-10.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has brought turbulence within the party. SPA
Secretary General and Prime Minister Pandeli Majko asked Nano to
reconsider, saying that it "would not have a positive effect on
the domestic situation."
</P>
<P>
Later, 40 Steering Committee Councilors, headed by Majko,
released a signed statement criticizing Nano's proposal of no
responsibility. The proposal "will destroy the unity and
leadership of the party and will not do good to the country's
stability," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said Majko was afraid the majority in the
congress who supported Nano would submit a no-confidence motion to
the current government during the congress meeting. He strongly
opposes Nano's proposal to hold another congress.
</P>
<P>
Since the majority of the Steering Council back him, he urged
them to hold a council meeting instead.
</P>
<P>
So far, Majko has rejected a congress meeting. But Nano has
pointed out that if 50 percent of the representatives attended the
meeting, any decision by the congress would be effective.
</P>
<P>
The struggle within the SPA will affect the party's position as
well as the political situation in the country, which has already
grown more complicated.

<HEADLINE> Tudjman's Statement on Bosnia-Herzegovina Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Some international organizations
in Sarajevo on Tuesday criticized Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman's opinion that Bosnian Croatia in Bosnia-Herzegovina
should become an entity.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for High Representatives of the Peace
Implementation Council to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Alexander Stiglmayer,
said the Dayton Agreement stipulates clearly that Bosnia-
Herzegovina is a country consisting of three ethnic groups and two
entities.
</P>
<P>
He said Tudjman, as a signatory to the agreement, should know
that high representatives will not allow any unilateral attempt to
modify the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Europe's representative Frane Maroevic noted
that an earnest implementation of the Dayton Agreement is an
important condition for countries in this region to integrate into
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe (OSCE) to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Aldxander
Nitzsche, said that Tudjman's statement violated the Dayton
Agreement and disappointed the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman told journalists in Zagreb on Monday that Bosnia-
Herzegovina should have three entities, in which Bosnian Croatia
should be one.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia-Herzegovina has two entities, the Bosnian Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serbs' Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Conflicts not only exist between the two entities, but also within
the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation itself.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition to Hold Summit Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Top leaders of Bangladesh's
opposition alliance will hold a summit meeting early next month to
intensify their "one-point" movement for ousting the government
and holding an early general election, press reports here said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be the first of its kind since the Jatiya Party
(JP, Ershad) joined the opposition alliance at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
"Four leaders will meet in a summit in the fist week of
November," JP Secretary General Naziur Rahman said on Tuesday
after a meeting of secretaries general of the JP, the major
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jamaat-e-Islami
(Jamaat) and the Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ).
</P>
<P>
JP Chairman H.M. Ershad was present at the meeting. The
secretaries general had their first meeting with BNP Chairperson
Khaleda Zia on October 8, and will meet the chairperson of Jamaat
on Wednesday and IOJ chief on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no confusion about the summit. We all at the meeting
felt that a summit is essential in the present stage of one-point
movement," Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
The next course of action program of the opposition will be
decided on Thursday night after a day-long hartal (strike) on that
day, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reiterated the decision to boycott the Upazilla
(sub-district) election scheduled for later this year, and city
corporation election under the present government and incumbent
Chief Election Commissioner Mohammad Abu Hena.
</P>
<P>
"An all-out resistance will be built up if the government wants
to hold the polls keeping us out of the fray," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Awami League had requested the Election
Commission postpone the Upazilla election and hold it early next
year.
</P>
<P>
The commission, however, rejected the suggestion saying that it
was obliged to hold the Upazilla election by December 27 this
year.

SHENYANG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, has launched a science award to
encourage technology innovation in the province.
</P>
<P>
The "Science Contribution Award" is awarded to scientists twice
a year for their outstanding achievements in science and
technology. Each award is worth 100,000 yuan (12,048 U.S. dollars).
This year's winners are Liu Jiren, vice president of Northeast
University, Yang Zhenyu, a hybrid rice expert and four other
scientists. These scientists were awarded for their innovation in
software or in fine seed breeding.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the award is aimed at pushing Shenyang to

encourage scientists to transfer their innovations into
commodities and set up high-tech enterprises, the province earlier
adopted a series of preferential policies, including reduced
personal income tax, credit assurances and venture capital funding.

JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's outgoing President
B.J. Habibie Wednesday asked the nation to fully support any
elected president and vice president who will lead the country
toward the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
"I call all my brothers and sisters to uphold the law and avoid
any action which could harm the reform process," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the result of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR)'s voting on his accountability speech, Habibie said, the MPR
has concluded that he had failed in carrying out his duty.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the People's Consultative Assembly has
concluded that Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie has failed to carry out
the duty mandated to him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said he was unable to accept his nomination as a
presidential candidate for the 1999-2004 term of office.
</P>
<P>
"I hereby state that I cannot accept the nomination of
Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie as a presidential candidate for the

JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian People's

Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
With the ratification, the MPR decree No. VI/1978 on the

The revocation of the decree is in line with the agreement

East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the

</P>
<P>
The majority of East Timorese voted for independence in the
August 30 ballot and the MPR accepted the result of the ballot, in
which more than 78 percent of voters rejected Indonesia's wide

TIRANA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping said here on Tuesday that all Kosovo people, whatever
their ethnic group or beliefs, they should and can live there
together peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Scharping, who ended his one-day visit to Albania Tuesday, made
the remark at a joint news conference with his Albanian

<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping force, of which the German troops are an

in Kosovo have sought revenge against Serbs. The Serbs in Kosovo
continue to feel threatened despite NATO's promise to protect them
and safeguard their property.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Assembly Endorses Election of President, Vice President by Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in its
54-year history, Indonesia will have its president and vice
president elected by vote this year, the Jakarta Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) unanimously endorsed
on Tuesday a decree stipulating that a presidential candidate
requires a simple majority in a secret ballot in the Assembly to
win. A vote would not be held if all the factions in the Assembly
were united in nominating a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
The decree took effect upon its endorsement, meaning the
presidential and vice presidential elections on Wednesday and
Thursday will comply with the new ruling.
</P>
<P>
The decree states the presidential election precedes the vice
presidential election, adhering to the long-standing custom.
</P>
<P>
In a departure from former procedures, however, each faction
can pick more than one presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
A presidential candidate can also be proposed by a group of at
least 70 Assembly members regardless of their factions.
</P>
<P>
A nomination must be submitted to the Assembly leadership with
the written consent of the candidate. The candidacy must be
submitted at least 12 hours before the presidential election,
although this stipulation was breached on Tuesday after a vote on
the president's accountability speech went beyond the 22:30 local
time (15:30 GMT) deadline. Thus, the Assembly unanimously agreed
to extend the deadline to 07:00 local time (2400 GMT) on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A presidential candidacy would be invalid if a nominee withdrew
or the faction or group of Assembly members canceled the
nomination. A replacement would be allowed only if it was made
before the Assembly leadership announced the list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
According to chapter 14 of the decree, the election must be
attended by at least two-thirds of the Assembly members. If the
Assembly fails to meet the requirement, the meeting would be
postponed for one hour and for a maximum of five times
consecutively.
</P>
<P>
Chapter 15 opens the possibility for a two-step election in the
event of three candidates. The issue would be settled if one of
the nominees won more than 50 percent of the total vote.
</P>
<P>
"When there is no candidate who wins more than half the votes,
the two candidates with the most votes would contest the next
secret ballot," the decree states.
</P>
<P>
If the two remaining candidates win an equal share of the vote
or neither one of them is able to win more than half of the total
vote, another round of voting would be held a minimum of 24 hours
later.
</P>
<P>
If the vote remained equally split or no candidate won more
than half of the vote, alternative presidential candidates must be
proposed and a new secret ballot would be conducted.
</P>
<P>
Soekarno was appointed to head the Committee for Indonesian
Independence Preparation just one day after he and Mohammad Hatta
declared independence on August 17, 1945. The founding president
never contested an election, despite organizing a general election
in 1955, until he ceded power to Soeharto in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The New Order regime held six general elections, but Soeharto
was always elected unopposed. The Assembly last elected him in
March 1998, but requested he step down two months later.
</P>
<P>
The decree states that presidential and vice presidential
candidates must be Indonesian natives who are aged at least 40
years.
</P>
<P>
It maintains preceding rulings stipulating that candidates must
never have been involved, directly or indirectly, in any
treacherous activities against the Republic of Indonesia.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Wednesday expressed welcome to the decision of Indonesia's
People's Consultative Assembly approving the separation of East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that the decision faithfully implemented the will
of the majority of the East Timorese people and would be welcomed
by all Australians.
</P>
<P>
"It marks a new start for East Timor," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Howard said a United Nations transitional authority in East
Timor, to be known as UNTAET, would take responsibility for the
administration of East Timor and prepare for its independence once
preparations were finalized in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said the multinational force INTERFET, led by Australia and
to which 16 countries were contributing, was making good progress
in restoring peace and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>

<P>
LIMA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Peru's trade deficit in the first
nine months of this year reached a total of 575 million U.S.
dollars, or a 75 percent reduction compared with the same period
of 1998, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to a document from the Association of Exporters (ADEX)
carrying figures from the customs department, besides the fall in
imports, the reduction of trade deficit has benefited from the
rising price in raw material exports, especially those of fishing
and mining.
</P>
<P>
Traditional exports in the aforementioned period grew 13.31
percent, while non-traditional exports fell 10.5 percent. Imports
saw a fall of 22.47 percent.
</P>
<P>
The document explained that the traditional exports have been
bolstered by the fishing sector which grew by a staggering 72.5
percent, and also by mining exports which rose 12.3 percent. The
farming sector suffered a reduction of 22.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
About the non-traditional exports, the document said that
agricultural products and industrial farming increased 49.7
percent, while wood and paper industries went up 38.4 percent, but
the performance of the remaining sectors was negative.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Golkar's Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Golkar Party
Wednesday morning nominated the party's General Chairman Akbar
Tandjung as the presidential candidate to run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Born in Sibolga, North Sumatera province, on August 14, 1945,
Akbar decided on a political career as early as his student days
at the University of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He moved to Jakarta halfway through his senior high school
study in 1962, and joined the Faculty of Technology of the
state-run university in 1964. Akbar once recalled that he entered
the university at a time when every student was expected to join
one of the many political organizations that had established bases
on campuses.
</P>
<P>
Akbar chose the Association of Muslim Students (HMI), and
poured his energy into the organization. One of the reasons why he
took his time to complete his study was because he was too busy
playing politics. He graduated in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Akbar served as HMI chairman from 1972 to 1974, chairman of the
Indonesian Young Generation for Renewal from 1978 to 1979, and
chairman of the Indonesian National Youth Committee from 1978 to
1981.
</P>
<P>
He has been a member of Golkar (Functional Group), set up by a
group of military and civilian leaders in 1966, since his student
days, and worked his way up the political ladder through the
various youth and student organizations he joined.
</P>
<P>
His first major break in Golkar came when he was appointed
deputy secretary-general in 1983 after helping Sudharmono get
elected to the chairmanship. Golkar has been dominating the
legislative body since the establishment of the New Order
administration led by former president Soeharto in 1967.
</P>
<P>
His two previous political mentors, former Golkar General
Chairman Sudharmono and Soeharto, saw Akbar as a skilled
administrator and a highly able organization man.
</P>
<P>
Sudharmono recruited Akbar as his deputy secretary-general when
he chaired the political organization from 1983 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto enlisted Akbar to serve in his cabinet. In 1988-1993,
he was state minister of youth affairs and sports. In 1993-1998,
he served as state minister of housing and settlements.
</P>
<P>
When Soeharto was re-elected in March last year, Akbar was
again asked to serve in the cabinet, keeping his old housing
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Given his administrative and organizational qualities, and
political skills, Akbar played a vital role in the meetings of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest
decision-making body, both in 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Akbar was one of the 14 members of the cabinet who wrote to
Soeharto on May 20 stating that they were not willing to serve in
his cabinet any more. Soeharto resigned the next day.
</P>
<P>
When B.J. Habibie took power on May 21 last year, Akbar's
political capabilities were exalted, and he was moved into the
inner circle as the powerful minister/state secretary for the new
president.
</P>
<P>
At the extraordinary congress of Golkar in July last year,
Akbar became the first general chairman of the political
organization to be elected by a secret ballot, beating former
defense minister Gen. (retired) Edi Sudradjat. The Golkar was
officially declared a political party in March this year.
</P>
<P>
In order to concentrate on the June 7 general election this
year, Akbar quit his cabinet post in earlier May. The party came
in second in the election with 120 seats, trailing behind the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle which got 153 seats in the
new House.
</P>
<P>
Akbar was elected new speaker of the House of Representatives
(DPR) on October 5.
</P>
<P>
Akbar married late in his life, at 35 years old, a factor which
again he attributed to his political activities. He met his wife
Krisnina Maharani from Surakarta, Central Java, when he was active
in the Indonesian National Youth Committee. The couple now have
three children, all girls.

years, which accounted for 19.27 percent of the 5.6415 billion
dollars of total foreign investment flowing into the country in

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorian Currency Drops to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian currency, which
has seen its value falling over the last 20 days, suffered another
setback Tuesday when the U.S. dollar jumped 2,000 sucres to a
record high of 18,700 sucres.
</P>
<P>
In Quito, the dollar opened at 16,500 sucres and quickly rose
to 18,700 sucres, a record high in Ecuadorian money market.
</P>
<P>
In Guayaquil, the dollar stood at 17,000 sucres at the start of
the trading and closed at 17,866 for sale by noon.
</P>
<P>
The figure of 18,000 sucres was a ceiling registered in March
when the government decreed a bank holiday and the freezing of
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's figures indicated that the Ecuadorian currency was
devalued by 10.4 percent in a single day, compared with Monday's
figure of 16,560 sucres against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the depreciation of the sucre in the dollar
price has reached 156.6 percent, compared to the dollar exchange
of 7,124 sucres at the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the decline in the currency will continue,
since the crisis was caused by speculations and aggravated by the
delay of the National Congress to approve the government budget
for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, some other experts believe that the dollar's rise is a
response to the lack of funds in the country's money market.
</P>
<P>
Various banking institutions with upcoming foreign obligations
might also have pressured the dollar price and brought it upward.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, in its worst economic crisis in decades, has said it
cannot repay its 13 billion-dollar foreign debt, which takes up
more than half of its budget each year.

<HEADLINE> Bamboo Culture Festival In South China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The China Bamboo Culture
Festival opened on October 18 in the city of Yiyang in Hunan
Province, with more than 2,000 business people from China and
abroad attending and displaying exhibits of some 10,000 bamboo and
rattan products from Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hunan provinces and
other parts of the country as well as from other countries.
</P>
<P>
China has a long history of bamboo and rattan use for household
articles and this has developed into a unique folk culture. The
exposition has bamboo and rattan clothing, books, umbrellas, and
mats. One bamboo skirt from Zhejiang made of thousands of tiny
bamboo slices is a particular hit. Bamboo articles have been
exported to Europe, America, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
China has the world's largest number of bamboo varieties and
forests. The bamboo industry earned 500 million U.S. dollars worth
of foreign exchange last year and the output value of 4.2 million
hectares of bamboo forests was worth 17 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lei Jiafu, a State Forestry Administration official, says that
developing the bamboo industry will contribute to the country's
environmental protection by reducing the use of other forms of
timber.
</P>
<P>
The International Bamboo and Rattan Network has an exhibit
arrangement at the festival. It is the first international inter-
government organization headquartered in China. It has 13 member
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Compared with the rest of the
nation, the backwardness of Italy's southern regions is just as
visible in public service as it is in economic development and
wealth, statistics released Tuesday show.
</P>
<P>
Only 311 billion lire (about 168 million U.S. dollars) are
invested annually in water, transport, rubbish disposal,
electricity and gas services in the south, said the confederation
of municipal utilities.
</P>
<P>
"The south of Italy is lacking in all the essential services,"
said Chairman Fulvio Vento of the confederation.
</P>
<P>
Vento also cited figures showing that only 19 percent of people
working in public services were employed in the country's poor
south, which is inhabited by roughly a quarter of Italy's 57
million population.
</P>
<P>
The confederation's dossier calls for investments worth at
least 120 trillion lire (65 billion U.S. dollars in the next
decade to even out the geographical imbalance in public services.
</P>
<P>
"These investments will have an enormous impact on development
and employment," Vento said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Ready to Take Action Against Petrol-Driven Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Italian Treasury Minister Giuliano
Amato said Tuesday evening that the government would take action
to hold down inflation if high oil and petrol prices threaten to
push the Italian rate above that of its European partners.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with visiting German
Finance Minister Hans Eichel, Amato said he expected world oil
prices to stabilize or be reduced.
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping an eye on oil markets and we think the price of
crude should now stabilize with a downward tendency," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If this does not happen, we will see in other ways that Italy'
s inflation rate does not rise far above the European average," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Amato gave no indication of what action the government might
take, but last week the Italian Minister of Industry Pierluigi
Bersani spoke of "fiscal measures," presumably cuts in fuel taxes,
to prevent petrol prices from getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
The government also talked about introducing petrol price-caps
to hold back spiraling prices when international oil prices began
rising in the spring.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1999, crude prices rose by 47
percent, peaking at 25 U.S. dollars a barrel earlier this month.
However they have fallen back recently, and on Monday the price of
crude was back to 22 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Beijing On Alert Against Influenza Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital city of
Beijing heavily hit by an influenza epidemic last winter is on the
alert again against possible outbreaks again.
</P>
<P>
As another peak season for influenza approaches, health experts
in Beijing are intensifying disease-control efforts. Measures
include increasing the surveillance on possible mutation of
influenza virus strains and advising those vulnerable to catching
the common cold to have themselves vaccinated well in advance.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Health has worked out a
vaccination plan encouraging the elderly, patients with chronic
diseases, medical personnel, school children,and workers to
protect themselves through vaccination. However, influenza experts
fear that mutation of virulent strains may weaken the
effectiveness of vaccination.
</P>
<P>
"Three different types of influenza virus caused serious
epidemics last winter," said Dong Zhenying, a influenza expert
with the Beijing Station of Epidemic Prevention.
</P>
<P>
During the November-January period more than 1.1 million
Beijing residents were infected by the virus. According to an
influenza report just released by the Beijing Health Bureau, the
prevalence rate for influenza was almost 30 percent in the mid-
December period. The report stated that people over 55 had three
to four times the risk of developing other illnesses than other
age groups after they suffered from influenza.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Philadelphia 76ers forward-
center Theo Ratliff, a second-team NBA All-Defense selection last
season, is expected to miss at least the first week of the regular
season due to a stress fracture in his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
Ratliff will be out of action the next three weeks and then
will be re-evaluated, according to a 76ers' spokesman,
Philadelphia plays its first game of the 1999-2000 regular season
on November 2 against the defending champion San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
In a related move, the Sixers signed veteran center Stanley
Roberts who played for Philadelphia coach Larry Brown in the 1992-
93 season when both were with the Los Angeles Clippers. He is
expected to be soon fully recovered from shoulder surgery in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
The team leader in rebounds and blocked shots last season,
Ratliff suffered the ankle injury in a preseason game against the
New York Knicks on October 12. He originally was thought to have
merely sprained the ankle.
</P>
<P>
Ratliff was coming off his best season as the 76ers advanced to
the Eastern Conference semi-finals in their first trip to the
playoffs since 1991. A starter for the first time in his four-year
career, he averaged 11.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 3.0 blocks per
game.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Outgoing President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Following the People's
Consultative Assembly's (MPR) rejection of his accountability
speech, Bacharuddib Jusuf Habibie, the sole presidential candidate
of Indonesian Golkar Party, decided to withdraw from the
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Born in the remote village of Nepo, Parepare, South Sulawesi,
on June 25, 1936, Habibie was brought up in a strictly religious
Muslim family.
</P>
<P>
Habibie is the third of four children. His life-long religious
devotion continues in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
His father, Jali Habibie, from the South Sulawesi town of
Gorontalo, died when Habibie was 13 years old. Then his Javanese
mother brought her children to Bandung, West Java.
</P>
<P>
After attending the Bandung Institute of Technology for about a
year in 1954, Habibie won a scholarship from the Ministry of
Education and Culture to study aircraft construction engineering
in Aachen, West Germany, a course he completed in 1960.
</P>
<P>
As a research assistant at Aachen's Technische Hocheschule
(1960-65), Habibie created a design of deep sea submarine and a
high-pressured room for Julich Atomic Center.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, President Soeharto called Habibie home and assigned
him as his technological consultant. He was state minister of
research and technology from 1978 to March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The strengths of Habibie, who was elected vice president on
March 11 last year at the general session of the People's
Consultative Assembly, include his popularity among the majority
Muslim community, the esteem he holds among youths and his long
service as state minister.
</P>
<P>
Habibie was sworn in as president on May 21, 1998 after
Soeharto resigned amid the country's worst political and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the last 16 months since he assumed the presidential office,
Habibie and his government has launched several political and
economic reforms including the release of political prisoners,
press freedom and holding a multi-party election to push forward
political and economic democracy process in the country.

<HEADLINE> 21 Foreign Bank Offices Still Operating in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Only 21 foreign bank
representative offices are still in operation out of the 39
stationed in Myanmar, the October issue of the Today magazine
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 21 bank offices include those from Bangladesh, France,
China's Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The 18 others have withdrawn for various reasons, including the
impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
These foreign bank offices were set up in the country after it
reformed its financial management system in line with the
market-oriented economic policy introduced in late 1988.
</P>
<P>
As the first phase of its financial reform, Myanmar allowed the
 establishment of foreign bank representative offices in the
country as well as local private banks.
</P>
<P>
The reform process entered the second phase in the last two
years with the signing of memorandums of understanding on setting
up joint-venture banks between six Myanmar private banks and six
foreign banks which had already opened offices in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of local private banks has fallen to 17
from 19, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Of the local private banks in Myanmar, the Asia Wealth Bank,
the Yoma Bank and the Myanmar Mayflower Bank are leading in
business and have opened 32, 28 and 12 branches respectively.

<HEADLINE> 7.6 Million Children Work in L.America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- There are 7.6 million children
between the ages of 10-14 working in Latin America, Luis Anderson,
general secretary of the Inter-American Regional Organization of
Workers (ORIT) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by ORIT, 60 percent of the children were
boys and 55 percent live in rural areas. The ratio of child
workers employed in informal sectors and formal sectors are 90
percent and 10 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Compared with those young adults who start working at the age
of 18, three out of four child workers will have to drop out of
their school studies for two years, said Anderson in the report.
</P>
<P>
Haiti has the highest incidence of child workers in the entire
region, followed by Paraguay and Argentina, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The ORIT, with its headquarters in Venezuela's capital of
Caracas, was founded on January 12, 1951, with 33 trade unions and
workers organizations in 29 countries in the Americas as it
members.

<HEADLINE> No-show Collymore Hit with Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa have fined striker
Stan Collymore two weeks wages after the striker failed to report
for training.
</P>
<P>
Collymore returned to the Midlands club last week after
spending three months on loan at first division Fulham but Villa
manager John Gregory said on Tuesday that he had not showed up for
training.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't turn up at all. It's not my problem. He was fined a
fortnight's wages when he was at Fulham as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm more concerned about the players I've got that played so
well last night (against Sunderland)." Villa lost 2-1 to
Sunderland in the league on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gregory said he hoped a permanent deal could be negotiated with
Fulham.
</P>
<P>
Collymore became the most expensive player in English football
when he joined Liverpool in 1995 for 8.5 million pounds(14.20
million U.S. dollars) but his career has been dogged by negative
publicity and depression.

<HEADLINE> Barcelona, Lazio Reaches Last 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona and Lazio became the
first two teams to reach the last 16 of the Champions League with
respective wins on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona of Spain maintained their unbeaten start to the
European campaign by defeating Arsenal of England 4-2 in Wembley,
London while Lazio of Italy thrashed Slovenia's Maribor Teatanic 4-
0.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Manchester United of England were deprived
of a record-equalling unbeaten run in Europe by Olympique
Marseille of France, which won the match 1-0 on home soil.
</P>
<P>
United were just 21 minutes away from equalling Ajax Amsterdam'
s all-time record of 19 unbeaten matches in a row when William
Gallas beat Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich and scored for the
home side.
</P>
<P>
The match ended 1-0 to Marseille, a result that put the French
champions top of group D and two points clear of the team that
beat them 2-1 at Old Trafford last month.
</P>
<P>
It was Bosnich's Champions League debut for United after he
suffered an early season injury and then apparently fell out of
favour with manager Alex Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't match them and we deserved to be punished for it to
be honest," said a disappointed Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona coach Louis Van Gaal, who helped Ajax to set their
record between 1994 and 1996, stunned Barca supporters when he
dropped regular Dutch goalkeeper Ruud Hesp in favour of the
inexperienced Francesc Arnau.
</P>
<P>
Arnau had played just twice for the first team previously but
the gamble paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian striker Rivaldo provided a 15th-minute penalty and
Luis Enrique added the second goal a minute later before Dennis
Bergkamp narrowed the gap a minute before half time.
</P>
<P>
Luis Figo then made it 3-1 in the 56th and Philip Cocu put the
game beyond Arsenal's reach in the 70th. Marc Overmars scored a
consolation goal in the 84th.
</P>
<P>
The win left 1992 champions Barcelona with 10 points at the top
of Group B while Arsenal were under pressure from a resurgent
Fiorentina with both teams on five points.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina took their first win in Group B. Argentine
international Gabriel Batistuta sent them on their way to a 3-0
win in Florence against AIK Stockholm of Sweden, who have so far
taken just one point from four matches.
</P>
<P>
The game was stopped for four minutes in the first half due to
a partial floodlight failure before Enrico Chiesa made it 2-0 in
the 36th and then Abel Balbo rounded it off in the 86th.
</P>
<P>
Lazio, the new Serie A leaders, cut a second-half swathe
through Maribor to take command of group A with 10 points.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav international Sinisa Mihajlovic opened the scoring in
the 34th minute but the Italians did not really click until the
second half when Simone Inzaghi scored twice and Dejan Stankovic
grabbed another goal.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Bayer Leverkusen stayed second in Lazio's group, with
five points, despite a heavy 4-2 defeat to Dynamo Kiev, who
leapfrogged over Maribor to move off the bottom of the table.
</P>
<P>
It was the Ukrainian side's first win in four matches and came
after they twice squandered the lead.
</P>
<P>
Vitaly Kosovsky gave Dynamo the lead four minutes after the
start but Ulf Kirsten equalised in the 12th. Maxim Shatskikh put
the home side back in front in the 36th only for Oliver Neuville
to equalise again in the 49th.
</P>
<P>
Olexander Holovko put Kiev back in front in the 61st and
Vladislav Vashchyuk made it 4-2 a minute from time.
</P>
<P>
Austria's Sturm Graz scored their first goal and first points
in group D in a shock 1-0 win at home to Croatia Zagreb. Tomislav
Kocijan was the scorer in the 40th minute.
</P>
<P>
Norway's Rosenborg Trondheim took the lead in Group C with an
upset 3-0 defeat of Borussia Dortmund in Germany. Borussia had
Lars Ricken sent off after 68 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The result left Rosenborg on eight points, ahead of Dortmund on
five. Dutch side Feyenoord have four points and Portugal's
Boavista two after the two teams drew 1-1 with two late goals.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says Asian Crisis Might Be Avoided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday that the world financial
turmoil might well have been avoided if affected countries had
developed strong bond markets to back up their banking systems.
</P>
<P>
In searching for lessons from the currency crisis that leveled
a number of economies beginning in 1997, Greenspan said the
problems could have been dealt with more easily if businesses in
crisis countries had been able to raise money in capital markets
after banking systems got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
"Had a functioning capital market existed, along with all the
necessary financial infrastructure, the outcome might have been
far more benign," Greenspan said in remarks to a Fed-sponsored
banking conference in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the world turmoil in the fall of 1998 did
not derail the U.S. economy largely because its banks were able to
step in and replace the bond market as a source of business loans
after bond investors became fearful of buying any new debt issues
following Russia's default.
</P>
<P>
He said that "What we perceived in the United States in 1998
may reflect an important general principle: Multiple alternatives
to transform an economy's savings into capital investments act as
backup facilities."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said this could be one of the major lessons of the
Asian crises: Economies are better able to withstand financial
turmoil if they have a bond market that can provide lending when
banks get in trouble and capital markets freeze up.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was understandable that Asian economies, which
had enjoyed three decades of phenomenally solid growth, would not
see a need for a backup to their banking systems.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, who covered many of the same areas today that he had
in a speech last month to the World Bank and the IMF, said that
U.S. mild recession in 1990-91 could have been far more severe if
bond investors had not been willing to step in to provide capital
to businesses after bank lending dried up.
</P>
<P>
He added that Japan's prolonged economic troubles in this
decade, reflect the fact that its bond markets have not been able
to replace banks and keep capital flowing to businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Diversity within the financial sector provides insurance
against a financial problem turning into economy-wide distress,"
Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> British Queen, Chinese President Praise UK-China Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth II of Britain
hosted a state banquet Tuesday evening to welcome Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on his state visit, the first to the UK by a
head of state of China.
</P>
<P>
Proposing a toast, the Queen voiced satisfaction with the much
closer relationship between the two countries that has developed
since their exchange of ambassadors in 1972 and, in particular,
since the successful return of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
"Britain and China have both been shaped by their long, rich
pasts and strong traditions which have, in different ways,
contributed so much to world civilization," she said. "In the
years ahead we shall continue to work together for world peace,
prosperity and the protection of the environment."
</P>
<P>
In reply, Jiang recalled that 13 years ago, the Queen paid a
successful visit to China, the first ever by head of state of the
United Kingdom, and that visit marked a major milestone in the
development of bilateral relations between China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am here in your country as the first head of state of
China to visit Britain," he added. "I am confident that this will
open up a new chapter of further growth of China-UK relations."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the the recent "golden jubilee" of the People's
Republic of China, Jiang noted that in the past half century, New
China has "traversed an extraordinary path".
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people have, united as one, worked with a firm
determination to make the country strong, and scored remarkable
achievements acclaimed by people of the world," he said.
"Particularly, in the past two decades since the adoption of
reform and opening-up, China's economy has been growing at an
average rate of 9.8 percent annually, its economic aggregates rose
to the seventh largest in the world, and China is now the world's
11th largest trading nation."
</P>
<P>
Now China's enjoys political stability, economic growth,
national unity and social progress, he said. "The people of all
ethnic groups in China are going all out for all-round progress in
the reform, opening up and modernization drive."
</P>
<P>
"If we keep on working hard for another 50 years, we will turn
China into a strong, prosperous and modernized socialist country
with a high degree of democracy and civilization," he said.
</P>
<P>
But China cannot develop and prosper without a peaceful
international environment and without the support and cooperation
of other peoples in the world, he said. "China will unswervingly
pursue an independent foreign policy of peace and continue to
develop friendly ties and cooperation with all countries in the
world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has all along attached importance to
China-UK relations, hoping to see a long-term and steady
development of friendly relations and cooperation between the two
countries, he said. "We are happy to note that in recent years,
particularly since the return of Hong Kong, our bilateral
relations have maintained a good momentum of development, our
exchanges and cooperation in various fields have expanded
steadily."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the two countries issued the China-UK Joint
Statement, announcing the establishment of a comprehensive
China-UK partnership, he said. "This has set a basic framework
for the cross-century development of our bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that through the concerted efforts of the two
governments and peoples, we will bring the friendly relations and
mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries to a new
high," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang's wife Wang Yeping, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
and other members of the entourage attended the welcome banquet.
</P>
<P>
Among the British personages attending the banquet were the
Queen's husband, Duke of Edinburgh; the Prince of Wales, and other
members of the royal family, along with Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Some London-based foreign envoys were also invited to the
banquet.

<HEADLINE> China, UK Should Work for New Fair World Order: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
speaking Tuesday evening at a state banquet Queen Elizabeth II of
Britain hosted in his honor, said China and the UK together should
make due contribution to the establishment of a fair and equitable
new world order.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Francis Bacon, the English philosopher, Jiang said:
"Histories make men wise". He went on to cite the Chinese saying
"To draw lessons from history, one knows why dynasties changed."
</P>
<P>
The curtain is going to be lowered for the 20th century, in
which mankind created enormous wealth but also suffered the
scourge of two world wars, he noted.
</P>
<P>
At this historical juncture of the turn of the century, the
world is undergoing profound changes, he said. "People of all
countries in the world long for peace and stability and work for
economic development and social prosperity, and they are looking
forward to a better world in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"But one should not fail to see that there are still some
disturbing dangerous tendencies in the international situation, he
said. "Regional and local conflicts have kept cropping up, acts
of power politics and wilful encroachment on norms governing
international relations are found from time to time and the gap
between rich and poor is still being widened."
</P>
<P>
Many big international issues are bearing on world tranquility
and people's interests are awaiting urgent solutions, he said.
"To safeguard world peace and promote common development has
become a strong call by people of all countries in the world."
</P>
<P>
As permanent members of the UN Security Council, both China and
UK shoulder major responsibilities for world peace and
development, and our two peoples should, together with other
people of the world, make due contribution to the establishment of
a fair and equitable new international political and economic
order, he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Investigative Commission on Cermis Tragedy Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Lower House on Tuesday
voted by an overwhelming majority to set up its own investigating
commission that will look into the February 1998 incident when an
American military jet slice a cable in the Italian Alps sending a
ski gondola crashing to the ground killing all 20 inside.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote saw 215 in favor, 11 against and 105
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Communist Refoundation voted against while the
center-right Freedom Front abstained.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be made up of 24 parliament's members who
will have ten months to "shed full light on the events and causes
that led to the incident".
</P>
<P>
At the end of its investigation, the commission will have two
months to draw up a report for Parliament. The commission will
have the same powers and limitations of a judicial authority.
</P>
<P>
Opposition MPs claimed they abstained not because they were
against the commission, but because they felt the time allotted
was too short and the fact that American authorities have already
issued their sentences.
</P>
<P>
More important, the opposition said, was to focus on damages
for the victims.
</P>
<P>
A bill was presented last Monday to the House earmarking 3.8
billion lire (about 2 million U.S. dollars), for each of the 20
families of the Cermis tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The sum would be an advance on the amount the U.S. Congress is
expected to allocate, after recognizing the responsibility of the
American military for the crash.
</P>
<P>
Captain Richard Ashby, pilot of the U.S. military "Prowler" cut
the cable in Cermis, was recently freed after five months of
detention.
</P>
<P>
Ashby was charged with but cleared of manslaughter charges in
the case but sentenced to six month's detention for concealing
evidence, a video take during the flight. He was let out a month
early for good behaviour.
</P>
<P>
Ashby's navigator Captain Joseph Schweitzer admitted destroying
the potentially incriminating video. He escaped a prison sentence
but was expelled from the Marines.
</P>
<P>
The other two marines on board the electronic surveillance jet
- which was on a training mission - were not tried.
</P>
<P>
Ashby and Schweitzer's acquittal raised a flurry of protests in
Italy and the countries from which the 20 dead came.
</P>
<P>
A total of seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two
Poles, two Austrians and one Dutch citizen were killed in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The relatives of the 20 victims and their lawyers are in
separate negotiations with the Defense Ministry for compensation.
</P>
<P>
The disaster occurred when the tail-fin of a U.S. Marine EA-6B
Prowler surveillance plane sliced the Mt. Cermis ski-lift cable
during a ground-hugging training flight out of the NATO air-base
in nearby Aviano.

<HEADLINE> S.African Leader on More Diversity in Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday night urged journalists and heads
of media to do more to encourage diversity of ownership in the
industry and to promote to new voices in print and on air.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Forum of Black Journalists fund-raising dinner
in Johannesburg, Zuma stressed the need to accelerate the change
of ownership structures.
</P>
<P>
He said: "New ways need to be found to ensure the survival of
emerging media, such as the myriad of fledgling community media
stations."
</P>
<P>
"But an even greater challenge is to facilitate the birth of
new media initiatives, particularly those which bring women and
the youth into the mainstream of the media and the media
industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
The dawn of the next millennium provided the media with an
opportunity for a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
The media should embark on a series of "Millennium Projects".
One of these could be a conscious campaign to involve South
Africans in a debate on their understanding of media freedom.
</P>
<P>
For a start, he said, it would probably benefit the media to
make a conscious, clearly spelt-out commitment to the training and
development of journalists.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the greatest challenges facing the media right
now to train and retain skilled people from various backgrounds,
to ensure the highest quality journalism on radio and television,
in our newspapers and magazines, and on the growing numbers of
news websites on the Internet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said the media had a critical role to play in using new
technology to expose corruption.
</P>
<P>
The media should also commit itself to reporting the truth.
</P>
<P>
The government wanted a media industry which "acknowledges its
responsibility to ensure the deepening of democracy by being
constructive, developmental, educational, transformative and
generally positive about our future," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Secretary-General Annan Calls For Prevention of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday called for more efforts
by the international community to prevent war, creating a
favorable environment for economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Development has no worse enemy than war," Annan said at the
World Bank where he delivered a speech entitled "Peace and
Development--One Struggle, Two Fronts".
</P>
<P>
Annan said the world as a whole is both more peaceful and more
prosperous than it was in 1945. But that progress has not been
equally shared, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the world's population, an estimated 2.8 billion
people, is still struggling to survive on less than two U.S.
dollars a day, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to one estimate, five and a half million people have
died in war during the 1990s. And the vast majority of these
conflicts occur in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Prolonged armed conflicts don't only kill people: they destroy
a country's physical infrastructure, divert scarce resources and
disrupt economic life, including food supplies. They radically
undermine education and health services," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that no one single factor can explain all conflicts,
and therefore no simple nostrum can prevent them all.
</P>
<P>
"Prevention policies must be tailored to the particular
circumstances of the country or region, and must address many
different issues at the same time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan noted that economic stagnation or decline -- sometimes
caused by factors quite outside a governement's control, such as a
deterioration in the terms of trade -- do make conflict more
likely.
</P>
<P>
"If war is the worst enemy of development, healthy and balanced
development is the best form of conflict prevention," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In this context, he commended World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn for his call for the bank and its partners to
"integrate a concern for conflict prevention into development
operations."

<P>
NEW YORK, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks mostly rose
in a nervous market Tuesday at the 12th anniversary of the 1987
market crash.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 88.65 at 10,204.93.
The blue chip index rose 96.57 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 7.19 at 1,261.32. But the technology heavy Nasdaq index
fell 0.97 at 2,688.18.
</P>
<P>
The market opened higher after the Labor Department reported
that its Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent in September, the
biggest increase in five months but in line with Wall Street
expectations. The report suggest that inflation remained under
control, easing concerns about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were also pushed higher by slow construction report on
new homes and apartments, and strong corporate earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
Fears of inflation and higher interest rates drove the the
stocks down steeply last week and the sharp rise in Producers
Price Index in September sank the Dow index below the 10,000
milestone briefly in the session last Friday. Investors have since
watched today's market closely because it is the 12th anniversary
of the October 19, 1987 crash.
</P>
<P>
Despite new report on the Consumer Price Index, the market was
still nervous today as investors feared that the report is
unlikely to prevent the Federal Reserve from raising rates. The
Dow index fell back from an earlier gain of 219 points.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 5.43 at 585.05 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 1.43 at 775.92. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 2.03 at 410.93.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,630 up, 1,425 down and 478
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 900.04 million shares from 798.13
