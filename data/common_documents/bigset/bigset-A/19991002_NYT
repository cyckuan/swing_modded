METS STAY ALIVE WITH WIN OVER PIRATES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scoreboard that looms in right field at Shea
Stadium was a garish monolith that blinked in yellow lights the
scores from the Houston and Cincinnati games Friday night, the
scores that would go a long way toward determining whether the
postgame New York Mets clubhouse would be about bitter reflection
or sustained tension.
</P>
<P>
   The board had already shown bad news for the fans: the Mets had
surrendered a two-run lead to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the eighth
inning and were in extra innings for the second straight game.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Mets batted in the 11th, it also showed that the
Astros had lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in Houston and the
Brewers were on their way to defeating the Cincinnati Reds in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   So there was good reason to roar when Shawon Dunston hit a
leadoff single and the Mets loaded the bases with two out for Robin
Ventura, who had hit a home run earlier. On a one-ball count,
Ventura singled to right field to score Dunston for a 3-2 victory
that kept the Mets' gasping season breathing for another day.
</P>
<P>
   With two games left in the regular season, the Mets are a game
behind in the National League wild-card race. A victory over
Pittsburgh Saturday night and another Sunday still won't guarantee
a postseason shot if the Reds or Astros fail to lose this weekend.
But Friday night's victory and losses by the Astros and the Reds at
least gave the Mets a better chance to perhaps force a one-game
playoff on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the struggling I've had, it's nice to contribute and do
something to help win the game,'' said Ventura, who made the
game-ending out in Thursday's 11-inning loss to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard served as much as a target as it did a warning
sign Friday night. But after Ventura and Mike Piazza had hit home
runs to give the Mets a 2-0 lead, the scoreboard reflecting the
Mets' doings brought nothing but smiles to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Mets gave up the lead in the top of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers had pitched spectacularly until then, but he tired
and walked the leadoff pinch hitter, John Wehner. After striking
out Al Martin on a curveball _ Rogers' 10th strikeout _ he yielded
an infield hit to Pat Meares that rolled so slowly toward Rey
Ordonez at shortstop that he could not make a play.
</P>
<P>
   A single by Aramis Ramirez cut the Mets lead to 2-1 and brought
right-handed Turk Wendell in from the bullpen. He struck out Kevin
Young on fastballs, but then he walked Chad Hermansen on four
pitches to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wallace, the Mets' pitching coach, headed to the mound with
the crowd howling. They knew what was coming. Dennis Cook was
unavailable because he was serving a suspension for bumping an
umpire in Tuesday's game. So it would be John Franco, who has been
mostly ineffective since returning from the disabled list, to face
the left-handed Warren Morris, a .292 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch, Morris rapped the ball back to the mound,
and it caromed off Franco's leg slowly toward Edgardo Alfonzo at
second. Alfonzo's throw to first was too late, and Meares scored
the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets loaded the bases in the bottom of the inning off two
Pirates relievers. But Marc Wilkins got Melvin Mora to hit into a
force play at second to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row, manager Bobby Valentine used
closer Armando Benitez in a nonsave situation. Benitez pitched two
splendid innings on Thursday, and this time he struck out the side
in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort failed to inspire his teammates, who did not
score in the bottom of the ninth, forcing extra innings for the
second straight night.
</P>
<P>
   The sparse crowd of 29,528 _ did they misunderstand and think
the Mets were already out of it? _ provided a midseason,
laissez-faire mood. In the clubhouse before the game, there was
something closer to resignation. General manager Steve Phillips
sounded as if he were already talking about the team's postseason
hopes in the past tense when he essentially said that if it did not
make the playoffs, it would have underachieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our minimum goal was to get to the playoffs,'' he said.
``Therefore, we will not have reached our minimum goal. We assumed
competitiveness and that we'd have an exciting team. With that
being the basis, it won't feel like a success. This season has been
filled with small successes but that's not what we're in it to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets continued to grasp for larger success by matching the
control pitcher Rogers against the Pirates' hard-throwing Jason
Schmidt. The Mets had a few scoring opportunities in the first two
innings, but Schmidt got out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, though, Ventura came to the plate. He had been in
a 2-for-13 funk on the homestand before this game. Worse, his left
knee had to be drained before Wednesday's game to relieve swelling
from a soreness he first felt in Houston more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   But on a 3-1 count, Ventura pivoted on the left foot and slugged
one of those 92 mph fastballs over the right-field wall, to the
right of the scoreboard. It was his 32nd home run and it gave the
Mets a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, that was all Rogers needed. The former Yankees
left-hander is still battling the label that he is incapable of
success in New York. But in this game he used his curveball
extensively, and was as dominant in the early innings as he has
been since joining the Mets two months ago. And he benefited from
the Pirates' own inadequacies.
</P>
<P>
   They had won four of their last five games, but they were 13 for
78 (.167) with runners in scoring position over the previous nine
games. The biggest early threat from Pittsburgh came in the fifth
inning, when the Pirates had runners on first and third with two
out and Martin at the plate. On a 1-2 count, Rogers threw Martin a
curveball that dropped sharply. But Martin swung and missed, and
the inning was over.

PETTITTE SHAKY BUT YANKS CLOSE IN ON HOME FIELD   ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ David Cone was shaken out of sleep this
morning by a pounding on the door of his hotel room, and there were
shouts and screams, voices he recognized. Some of his teammates had
just arrived from Baltimore, where the Yankees had clinched the
American League East hours before.
</P>
<P>
   They yelled for Cone to open the door, but the pitcher declined.
Cone had flown to Florida a day ahead of the others to ensure a
full night's sleep in preparation for his start against the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees may have clinched the division, but they will remain
on full alert until they exhaust their possibilities for home-field
advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a short and lousy outing from Andy Pettitte, the
Yankees pummeled the Devil Rays, 11-7, and with two games to play,
they matched Cleveland's 97-63 record; the Indians lost to Toronto
Friday night, 8-6. If the Yankees finish with a better record than
the Indians, or in a tie, they will possess home field advantage
throughout the AL playoffs because they took 7 of 10 games from
Cleveland during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte surrendered six runs on six hits and six walks in
four-plus innings, hardly a confidence boost for the left-hander in
his last start before the playoffs. But the Yankees overcame his
poor performance. Tino Martinez, who seems to have finally regained
his stroke at the best possible time, banged a three-run homer,
just before Darryl Strawberry unloaded what he thought was his
longest home run ever.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's drive caromed off a pole that hangs from the
ceiling over right field, the point of contact some 120 feet above
ground. The estimated distance of Strawberry's shot was 425 feet,
to where it traveled before ricocheting onto the field. If the ball
hadn't hit the pole, it would've gone much further. ``That thing
was longer than Reggie Jackson's home run in the '71 All-Star Game
in Detroit,'' said manager Joe Torre, who played in that game
against Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone chuckled about the 425-foot estimate. ``Off by about
100 feet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably once in a lifetime I can hit a ball like that,'' said
Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, the Yankees will open the best-of-5
division series on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium against the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is fluid, and without knowing for certain who
the Yankees will play Tuesday, or where they will play, Torre will
wait at least one more day before naming the starting pitcher for
his team's first playoff game. Either Roger Clemens or Orlando
Hernandez will pitch Game 1, but Torre said Friday that he
continues to weigh his choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to know what all the aspects of the decisions
are,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had the most victories for the Yankees this season
with a 17-9 record, and his ratio of quality starts _ which is
perhaps the best measure of consistency _ is among the best in the
league at .697. Torre knows from last year's postseason that
Hernandez is unfazed by pressure, and if the division series is
forced to a deciding fifth game, it would be pitched by the Game 1
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is more durable within each game than perhaps any
pitcher in baseball. Opponents have batted .232 against him in his
first 75 pitches of games this season, according to STATS Inc., but
incredibly, they have hit .202 after his 75th pitch.
</P>
<P>
   There are arguments to start Clemens in the first game, too. His
earned run average is about 2 1-2 runs lower when he has pitched at
Yankee Stadium this year, as compared with when he pitches on the
road. Game 1 and Game 5 would be in Yankee Stadium, if the Yankees
have home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has not pitched well when he gets more than his usual
four days of rest, and if he does not pitch Game 1, he may have to
wait more than week for his next start.
</P>
<P>
   If Clemens does not start Game 1, Torre said ``he's just going
to have to simulate'' game action until he makes his next outing,
in Game 3 or Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, acknowledged that
if Clemens is not the Game 1 starter, he might pitch some on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There are other choices to be made. Torre, who will meet with
the team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner, for lunch
Saturday, will pick between Clay Bellinger and Shane Spencer for
the 25th spot on the roster. Bellinger appears to have an edge. He
must also pick a 10th pitcher to round out his postseason staff,
and that will probably be Hideki Irabu or Jason Grimsley.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, too, must decide who will catch. Jorge Posada always
works with Hernandez, Joe Girardi with Pettitte, a left-hander. In
late August, when Clemens was in a deep pitching funk, Torre
switched Girardi _ who usually caught for Cone _ to Clemens, and
Posada to Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has generally pitched better since then, while Cone has
not done so well. It has been apparent, in several games, that Cone
is not as comfortable with Posada as he is with Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still things we are evaluating,'' Torre said.

BIBLE WEEK SUIT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By EDYTHE JENSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bible Week'' once again has a prayer in Gilbert, thanks to a
court ruling in a lawsuit against the town and Mayor Cynthia
Dunham.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Roslyn Silver of U.S. District Court said in the ruling,
released Friday, that Gilbert residents and Holocaust survivors
Ellis and Ellen Sklar did not have standing to sue. Nor could they
prove they were injured by Dunham's vow to designate Nov. 22-29,
1998, as Bible Week, the judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not address the proclamation's constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Civil Liberties Union filed the suit in November on
the Sklars' behalf after Dunham said she would set aside a week to
honor the Bible, as she did in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull and mayors of other Phoenix area cities abandoned
plans to proclaim such a week after the ACLU launched its legal
challenge in Gilbert. Dunham halted plans for the 1998 proclamation
after Silver issued a restraining order. Dunham was in Utah on
Friday and couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Vice Mayor Maggie Cathey said she will encourage Dunham to
sign a 1999 Bible Week proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU Executive Director Eleanor Eisenberg said her organization
may appeal Silver's ruling or file other challenges if Dunham tries
to proclaim Bible Week again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling came as a surprise because we believe the Sklars
were injured,'' Eisenberg said. ``A violation of a fundamental
constitutional right is in and of itself an injury. One of those
constitutional rights is freedom from government intrusion in our
religious lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg said the fact that Silver did not rule on the
constitutionality of Bible Week leaves the door open for future
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Sklar said the ruling was ``a shame, a terrible shame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Dunham is a despot,'' she said Friday after learning of
the dismissal. ``She believes all people should abide by her
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure she's feeling proud of herself and her right-wing
attorneys right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Evangelist Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice
represented the mayor at no cost to the town.
</P>
<P>
   Town spokesman David Cannella said Dunham was told of the
dismissal and issued a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' the mayor's statement read. ``I felt all along
that the proclamation did not violate the separation of church and
state, and am happy and grateful that the court reaffirmed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannella said Dunham has received hundreds of messages and
letters about Bible Week, and ``better than 90 percent (were) in
support of the mayor's position.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Larry Morrison, who supported Dunham's proposed 1998
Bible Week proclamation, said Friday that he will neither encourage
nor discourage her from issuing it this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad at this point it seems to be over,'' Morrison said,
``And I hope we can go on with more important issues of the town,
like what are we going to do about taxes and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathey believes Silver's ruling vindicates the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we've listened to the ACLU, and we want to
recognize all groups,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Evans' vocal opposition to Bible Week created a
rift between him and Dunham, his political running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because something isn't illegal doesn't mean that it's
right,'' Evans said Friday. ``Bible Week is an activity in which
the town shouldn't be taking part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sklars said Friday that they are bracing for hate mail and
anti-Semitic telephone calls like those they received after they
sued last year.
</P>
<P>
   They're also leaving Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a big error in judgment moving here,'' Ellis Sklar
said. ``Our friends in Philadelphia warned us that Arizona was one
of the most anti-Semitic states in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we won this lawsuit,'' his wife added, ``we would have
lost, because either way, the phone calls will start.'' &QL;

ANGELS' BAVASI STEPS ASIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Citing irreconcilable differences in their approaches
to make the Angels a winner, team president Tony Tavares and
general manager Bill Bavasi decided a change needed to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi, who has served as the club's GM since 1994, has resigned
and was re-assigned as a special assistant to Tavares.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was reached Thursday when the two had lunch.
Tavares had planned to meet with Bavasi after the season, but
Bavasi felt it was something that couldn't wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is not a happy day,'' Tavares said during a
news conference. ``Any time we get involved in change, there is
consternation caused and unpleasantness in it. But in this case
it's minor because Bill and I like each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference stems from Bavasi's unwillingness to make drastic
changes to a team that he had a huge role in developing. Many of
the club's ``core'' group of players ascended through the minor
league system when Bavasi was the minor league director.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Bavasi said: ``There will not be a
housecleaning approach. We have to get better at certain spots. You
can't clean house. Cleaning house is a knee-jerk reaction, and it's
a wrong one. I heard the same things in '96, but I'll say the same
thing I said then: We'll be real aggressive to change things in the
clubhouse, but there will not be a housecleaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi, however, is no longer in a position to decide who stays
and who goes. And Tavares made it clear that no one is untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is, this seems to be a team that for whatever
reason always gets this close and falls off,'' Tavares said. ``What
we'll try to do is analyze this and determine what causes this.
Anyone out there can say we need a second baseman, a catcher, more
pitching, but that's easy to recognize. It's deeper than that. We
decided to call timeout and take a hard look at where we're at.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi was asked if he was too attached to his players to be an
effective general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, maybe...'' he said. ``I never had a problem trading
guys, not emotionally. Did I over-evaluate a player or two?
Possibly, but I still don't think so. I think there are players who
haven't reached their potential yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Tavares admits he has no business evaluating baseball talent.
But he believes the club's problems have nothing to do with talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What troubled me is when we got everybody back (from
injuries), why didn't we jell, why didn't we come together?'' he
said. ``We have to take a hard look at how we develop players. Not
fundamentals, but do we instill the proper values? What's missing
is the concept of `team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tavares pointed to the finger-pointing during the club's
collapse, calling what came out of the clubhouse on nearly a daily
basis ``revolting.'' But he said the club wouldn't make personnel
decisions without thoroughly thinking them through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get to the point where we make irrational or
emotional judgments on people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi's role as a special assistant to Tavares has not been
defined. Tavares said that he ``still respects'' Bavasi and will
seek his advice, though Bavasi said he didn't anticipate having
much input on deciding who will be the next GM. Once the club hires
a GM, his first order of business will be to hire a manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seek out a new GM as soon as possible,'' Tavares said.
``But we haven't even put a list together. We haven't talked to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi, normally unemotional and stoic, had to pause to collect
his emotions once during the news conference and spent a lot of
time thanking many in the organization and former members of the
organization he's worked with.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi, 41, also said he is ``very happy right now'' with his
situation, although there is disappointment in the team's
performance this season. He began his career with the organization
as a minor league administrator in 1980, was appointed director of
minor league operations in 1984, became assistant GM in 1993 and
took over as GM in January 1994.

BAVASI JOINS SELECT GROUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (set ital) Today's defrocked Halo edition of The Sporting Muse:
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bavasi may not have succeeded in getting the Angels to a
World Series, but he joins a rather privilaged group by resigning.
</P>
<P>
   It includes his father Buzzie, who was G.M. for seven years
(1988-94), and Bill never let anyone the stature of Nolan Ryan get
away, although we'll always wonder how things might have changed if
the Angels had traded for Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes trader Harry Dalton (1972-77), who lived up to
his name but never had a winning season. It also includes Fred
Haney, the team's first G.M., and Mike Port, who, like Bavasi and
Buzzie, had three winning seasons during their stay.
</P>
<P>
   This stat is more indicative of the Angels than any of Bavasi's
wins and losses. Success eludes the Angels, flirting with the team
just long enough to make the pain feel worse.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi's efforts were sincere, and they were a lot more
heartening to fans than the rent-a-free agent philosophy elsewhere
in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi and Bob Fontaine scouted, signed and nurtured the nucleus
of the current Angels. If the Angels hadn't fallen to earth so hard
in the last month of 1995, and had made the postseason, Bavasi
likely would have been mentioned in the same breath as Atlanta's
John Schuerholz and Cleveland's John Hart as smart and savvy
baseball architects.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of those players and the effort they gave, Bavasi
hasn't a single regret. ``The players are special. It isn't a crime
if someone underachieves for a season, or if a guy gets hurt.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Considering all of the turmoil in 1999, which saw many of
Bavasi's favorites berating each other and Bavasi himself having to
admonish their actions, it might have been difficult for the same
cast to move forward. Terry Collins realized the situation was out
of his control, and Bavasi's policy took too much friendly fire.
</P>
<P>
   But as easy as it is to say Bavasi and Collins failed, it's a
major challenge this days to find the right people to make a bad
situation better. One only has to look at the struggles of Kevin
Malone and Davey Johnson, men respected in the field, to see how
difficult starting over can be. ...
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of up the road, Disney could do worse than consider
hiring Fred Claire and Bill Russell as their G.M. and manager. The
old Dodgers image is very sympatico with Disney's. In light of the
way Fox has bollixed the Dodgers, it wouldn't necessarily cast a
Dodger shadow over the franchise. ...
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the Dodgers' Raul Mondesi: The best time to apologize to
fans for your conduct is not (set ital) after (end) the final home
game of the season. ...
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line on Homermania, the sequel: I'm glad both Sammy Sosa
and Mark McGwire hit 60 again to show it was no fluke. I'm even
more pleased than no one else shot up to 60. And I'm ecstatic that
70 didn't fall, because it would have cheapened last year's
celebration. ...
</P>
<P>
   I know UCLA once played stout defense, because the Bruins
produced nine All-Americans on that side of the ball between 1987
and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But they've had only one since (Shaun Williams in 1997), and the
points allowed under Bob Toledo now exceeds the gross national
product of Guam. Headed into today's game at Arizona State, Bruin
opponents have scored 30 points or more in 16 of Toledo's 39 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was vogue to blame '98 defensive coordinator Nick Alioti for
the troubles last season, but the problem dates back to the weird
attack defense installed by his predecessor, Rocky Long. The '97
team thrived and survived on turnovers, which always has more to do
with mistakes by opponents than planning by a defense. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's strange to see the way certain patterns emerge over time.
USC, once revered for its running game, has had difficulty
recruiting blue chip backs and offensive linemen the last decade,
and UCLA hasn't produced a first-team all-conference defensive
lineman since current assistant Terry Tumey in 1987. ...
</P>
<P>
   If Paul Hackett is such an offensive specialist, why doesn't he
use the whole field?
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's Trojans definitely pass more than previous teams, but
most of those passes are on the perimeter. The middle of the field
gets ignored, which seems like a waste of perfectly good space R.
Jay Soward and Kareem Kelly could be using.
</P>
<P>
   Isolating fast receivers on the edges obviously has merit, as
does spreading a defense from sideline to sideline. But the lack of
variety in the attack seems limiting. ...
</P>
<P>
   I could definitely get behind a Stanford-Purdue Rose Bowl, and I
could care less whether they play for the national title or free
car rentals at National.
</P>
<P>
   The final score of the game would be 69-66 in double overtime.
There would be 1,800 yards of total offense and the game would last
five hours, long enough for Keith Jackson to retire and then
unretire. ...
</P>
<P>
   I could not, however, support a Raiders-Rams Super Bowl. And the
way the 1999 season is going, it's not an entirely dismissable
notion.
</P>
<P>
   The topsy-tursy season has put life into several division races
that seemed pre-ordained during the preseason. Thanks to the sudden
mortality of the Broncos and Jets, every AFC team outside Ohio
seemingly has a shot. And while the NFC Central is a monster, with
Green Bay, Minnesota and Tampa Bay solid, Detroit surprising and
the Bears improved, they could easily knock each other silly before
the playoffs. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Eagles have a very good chance of becoming the
first team to go winless since the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers went
0-14. The 1982 Baltimore Colts were also winless, but with an
asterisk: They went 0-8-1 during the strike-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a pair of games against the struggling New York
Giants, the pivotal game on the Eagle schedule is an October date
at Chicago. Cleveland is in the hunt for anti-perfection, too, but
two games against Cincinnati could spoil things. ...
</P>
<P>
   This week's official ranking of soon-to-be fired NFL coaches: 1,
Bruce Coslet, Cincinnati (unanimous); 2, Jim Fassel, N.Y. Giants;
3, Andy Reid, Philadelphia. Honorable mention: Dennis Green,
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   This week's official one-man Heisman poll: 1, Stanford wide
receiver Troy Walters. 2, Florida State wide receiver Peter
Warrick. 3, Purdue quarterback Drew Brees. 4, Georgia Tech
quarterback Joe Hamilton. Great prices can be found on Great (Ron)
Dayne t-shirts at the Wisconsin campus bookstore. ...
</P>
<P>
   Gazillionaire Marvin Davis wanted to buy an NFL expansion in Los
Angeles for his two sons. Now he'll just have to buy them Nintendo
like everyone else. ...

HOUSECLEANING HAS JUST BEGUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Remember that enchanted broom in ``Fantasia?'' The one
that danced magically across the castle floor?
</P>
<P>
   Disney had better get it out of storage. The Angels'
housecleaning will need all the help it can get.
</P>
<P>
   It officially began Friday, when vice president and general
manager Bill Bavasi announced his resignation in a tearless and
emotionally stunted news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The level-headed Bavasi did not break down during the 30-minute
session in the press dining room. But his departure signals that
almost everything else colored periwinkle will this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi was the final shield, the final protector for a season
gone horribly awry and a sniping, back-biting clubhouse that only
further corroded it.
</P>
<P>
   With Bavasi gone, this team stands to be ripped apart _ if you
can call this season's collection of players a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing missing on this amalgamation of players,'' club
president Tony Tavares said, ``is what it means to play as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tavares said it became clear during a lunch meeting Thursday
that he and Bavasi were in conflict as to the team's future
approach. Tavares described it as being ``on different planes.''
Bavasi said it was ``something between Tony and I.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither would specify on the nature of that insurmountable
fracture. But it was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Tavares wants to take the wrecking ball and start over. Bavasi
wants to keep the team's core together.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi worked five years to sign those players, and nine more
before that as farm director developing them.
</P>
<P>
   Gary DiSarcina, Garret Anderson, Jim Edmonds, Tim Salmon, Troy
Percival, Chuck Finley _ they were more than Bavasi's home-grown
signings. They were members of his extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi remained committed to his core to the end. The same
caustic, bickering bunch that has caused this once-blooming season
to become a foul cauldron.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players ... are special to me,'' Bavasi said, stopping for
the only time to compose himself and clenching his jaw to hold back
tears.
</P>
<P>
   He defended the 1995 team, whose September collapse made the '69
Cubs look like a slip on a banana peel. He defended the current
bunch of malcontents, citing injuries as their downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of faith in the players we have here,'' Bavasi
said. ``This year, a few guys underperformed. Having a bad season
is not a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Given another chance, Bavasi said he felt this year's team could
contend next season.
</P>
<P>
   Add a starting pitcher or two and Bavasi might be right. But
that postulation clearly will not be tested. Key personnel will be
gone, swept out the door like so much rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   Tavares hasn't made the personal investment in the current core
that Bavasi has. And after seeing the way the team responded to an
adversity-filled season, Tavares is fuming.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels fired public shots at each other to the point where
then-manager Terry Collins couldn't walk through the clubhouse,
fearing he would be caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   When Collins resigned 28 days ago, Tavares made no effort to
hide his outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Angels' 16-10 record since Collins' departure _ their
first winning September since 1991 _ hasn't cooled Tavares' anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is shocking what went on here,'' Tavares said Friday. ``I
am disgusted. Revolted.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Tavares would go down to the clubhouse and discuss
Friday's move with players, he responded: ``What useful purpose
would that serve?''
</P>
<P>
   So Tavares will have his way. The edifice will be razed. The
demotion of the team's architect is a clear enough signal.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels aren't two days away from the offseason. They're two
days away from Hurricane Tony. And even the longest-tenured players
are at high risk of being uprooted.
</P>

DODGERS' GAGNE STOPS ASTROS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Oh, the tension was great. Could John Franco get out
of the eighth? Could Cincinnati hold on to the three-run lead?
Could Houston stage a comeback that would vault it to within a win
of the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite what the Dodgers had in mind, and in order to
fully appreciate the drama, one would need a satellite dish or a
good seat in the Astrodome press box with a few televisions on. But
it was there.
</P>
<P>
   And after 159 games, the Dodgers finally had an impact on the
playoff race as rookie Eric Gagne continued his eye-opening streak
in a 5-1 win against the postseason-hopeful Astros in front of
50,791 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne (1-1) pitched six shutout innings for his first
major-league win, and his ERA fell to 2.10 in five starts. He took
pride in not allowing the Astros to inch closer to the wild card or
NL Central title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to mess it up a little bit because I know they're in
it with the Mets and Cincinnati,'' said Gagne, who allowed five
hits, walked five and struck out five. ``I'm sure they're not too
happy about it, with the Mets winning, but I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros and Reds (both 95-65) remained tied atop the division
because Cincinnati lost to Milwaukee in 10 innings. The Mets beat
Pittsburgh in 11 innings to creep within a game of Astros and Reds
in the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming out and playing hard and not playing (poorly) and
rolling over,'' Dodgers center fielder Devon White said. ``That's
not what you do in this game. We don't want it to come down to
(teams thinking) we did (roll over). We're going to do the best we
can to win all three games here. It's what we would want if we were
in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   So while folks in New York rant and rave about the Dodgers not
pitching Kevin Brown in Sunday's finale, Gagne went out and
frustrated the Astros as he was helped by Gary Sheffield's bat.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield homered in the first off Houston's Shane Reynolds
(16-14) and had a two-run single in the third to make it 3-0. The
single also pushed Sheffield's RBI count to 101, the third time in
his career he's reached triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he may shut the
ailing Sheffield down for the final two games on the hard Astrodome
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send our best team out there for the pennant race,
but you have to look out for yourself, too,'' Sheffield said.
``We're not paying attention to which team is involved in the race
and which is not. We're trying to evaluate ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last two days, the Dodgers, if even an inkling, have
to like what they've seen. Thursday, rookie Jeff Williams made his
third major league start and in front of a sellout crowd, not to
mention it being the last game at Candlestick Park, the lefty
pitched five gritty innings and recorded the win.
</P>
<P>
   Then in front of a near-capacity crowd in Houston, with millions
of fans in two other cities glued to the scoreboard as well as
their team's game, the 23-year-old Gagne allows one earned run or
less for the fourth time in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gagne) didn't have his really good control, didn't go after
it the way he usually does, but he made some pitches,'' Johnson
said. ``He continues to impress.''

KINGS START FAR FROM HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ The Staples Center opens in less than three weeks,
but the Kings are still a long way from home.
</P>
<P>
   Before they play the first sporting event at L.A.'s new arena
they will play seven road games, beginning tonight against the
second-year Nashville Predators.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have much of a choice since the Staples Center is
not yet complete. But seven games is a difficult undertaking,
especially for a rebuilding team that did not make the playoffs
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two ways to look at it,'' said first-year coach Andy
Murray. ``You can take the negative approach and say we are going
to struggle and take all the enthusiasm away from the new building
or you can take a positive approach. Teams bond on the road, get to
know each other and it breeds success. I've seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is Murray's first NHL coaching job, he has been an
assistant with three other clubs. He knows the Boston Bruins often
open on the road for that very reason. And the Bruins have won
their last 13 season openers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings acquired high-scoring winger Ziggy Palffy and
agreed to terms with veteran defenseman Mattias Norstrom late
Thursday, Murray's biggest task is accentuating the positive with
his club.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Kings never really recovered when coach Larry
Robinson publicly admitted in November he doubted whether he wanted
to be a coach. Robinson was a Hall of Famer, but his comments were
so draining to his players that they never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy is a potentially explosive scorer teamed on the first
line with Luc Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel. But more critical will
be the attitude the club builds before they get home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the team is very excited about the new building and I
think that might have had something to do with getting me in here
and getting off on a good foot,'' Norstrom said Friday. ``I was at
the practice today and the turnaround in attitude was incredible.
We'll use this time together to build something good.''
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom probably won't play tonight against the Predators, who
last year finished six points behind the Kings (32-45-5) in the
Western Conference. But during his holdout, he has been skating for
at least two hours a day with the Kings' minor-league affiliate in
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom wasn't certain where the negotiations were headed
earlier in the week, but things developed quickly after a phone
conversation with Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really meant a lot because I could tell how committed he
is to making this team better,'' Norstrom said. ``For about three
weeks I didn't hear anything from them and I really didn't know
where I stood. But this is a business and if you're lucky you only
have to go through one of these in your career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were happy to see me today and it was great to be
back. The mood is so upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Murray's concerns on the road is the other team's
emotional lift playing in their home opener. After Nashville, the
Kings fly to St. Louis for a Monday game with the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday and Thursday they play in Miami and Tampa Bay and
finish the week Saturday night in Washington D.C. against the
Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will then fly home for five days but will not play any
games. Then it is off to Calgary and Edmonton for games Oct. 15-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the surprises in the schedule I found was how much time
off teams have before they face us,'' Murray said. ``There are a
lot of times when we get back to L.A. and teams already are here
waiting for us. But that will only make us work harder.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WISHING AND HOPING FOR METS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robin Ventura slammed a game-winning hit in the 11th
inning Friday night and Mets fans went wild. But all you needed to
see to understand the intensity of the Mets' madcap chase for a
playoff berth was the scene inside the Mets' clubhouse 15 minutes
after the victory.
</P>
<P>
   While the stars of the Mets' victory answered questions before
circles of cameras and microphones, pens and pads _ John Olerud
over here, Ventura at a stall over there, Mike Piazza across the
room _ a cluster of other players were riveted to television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Mets had learned that Los Angeles had beaten
Houston, and now the Milwaukee Brewers were tracking down the
Cincinnati Reds, moving into the bottom of the ninth inning tied at
3-3. When a Milwaukee batter reached base, the players cheered;
when the Brewers put men on first and third, the Mets roared; they
groaned when the inning ended still tied.
</P>
<P>
   When the Brewers won an inning later, the clubhouse exploded. In
72 hours the Mets had seen their hopes dashed to pieces by Atlanta,
then picked up and at least partly reassembled by Los Angeles and
Milwaukee. Kenny Rogers, who pitched 7 1-3 innings Friday night,
said it was comforting to know that Houston and Cincinnati were
feeling the heat the Mets have felt for nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tough games _ every pitch, every strike, is
important,'' Rogers said. ``There really is no margin of error.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day Rogers and outfielder Darryl Hamilton made
the drive from Manhattan to Shea Stadium. Since coming to the Mets
in trades _ Hamilton from Colorado, Rogers from Oakland _ the two
new Mets settled in the same Manhattan apartment building and have
ridden to the ballpark together. At first the conversations were
light and general _ Rogers talked about hitters, Hamilton about
pitchers. When the Mets began gaining ground on Atlanta in what
seems like ages ago, they talked division. The last few days the
conversations have been mutual therapy sessions on handling the
immense pressure of a postseason berth nearly gained and then
nearly lost, and now one that hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every day we're talking about must-win games,''
Rogers said. ``This was a big win. Now tomorrow is a must win.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mets' season boils down to wishing and hoping; it comes
down to a bushel of ``what ifs'' and one of the most awful laments
of human existence: woulda, coulda, shoulda. The Mets have to play
the hoping and wishing game. Hoping that Los Angeles and Milwaukee
will go as hard at Cincinnati and Houston as Philadelphia came at
the Mets last week and Pittsburgh came at them Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're facing the same obstacles that we faced last week,''
Hamilton said. ``They're looking at it like: `It's right there for
us, all we got to do is go out and win.' That sounds so simple, but
really, it's not. I don't expect Milwaukee, and I really don't
expect the Dodgers to sit there and look at the celebration. You
hate being in a position like that, but that's the position we're
in.''
</P>
<P>
   So many of the Mets' problems during their recent slump revolved
around the fact that the Mets went from executing the plays to
hoping that someone would execute. Even as recently as Thursday,
when the Mets tied the game at 2-2, and then at 3-3, Hamilton felt
the Mets relied on faith and miracles, not consistent execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's been our problem,'' Hamilton said. ``We've been
hoping for that big break, waiting for that big break to happen,
and it hasn't happened. When you wish for breaks, basically you're
hoping that the other team screws up. When you play good teams like
the Braves, it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, you go to the Mets' clubhouse not really
knowing what to expect, especially now that the team's fortunes
hang by such a slender thread _ pitch to pitch, inning to inning.
What will it be this weekend? Jubilation? Exhilaration? Depression?
</P>
<P>
   Friday, at the beginning of the Mets' final series of the
season, everything seemed normal. This team, with its back against
the wall, appeared loose as it prepared for yet another crucial
series, this time with Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said he thought that in the last two weeks there was a
collision of wills on the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who were here last year were hoping it wasn't going
to happen again,'' Hamilton said. ``The guys brought in for this
year were saying it's not going to happen again. All of a sudden
it's happening and we're wondering, `What are we going to do
now?'''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy. Hope. &QL;

order to play golf, and he has been nothing but a professional
since. !dtpost!!dlim!!head!Golf's

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; MORENO VALLEY _ On the driving range at Moreno Valley
Ranch Golf Club Friday morning, Casey Martin was chatting with a
fellow Nike Tour pro about playing with pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wear contact lenses?'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw,'' said the blond young man at the next tee.
</P>
<P>
   They were talking about how sunny and windy it's been the past
two days in the dusty hills of Riverside County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' Martin said. ``By the end of the day, you want to rip
your eyes out.''
</P>
<P>
   See, he's not much different from everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half after Martin, 27, became a legal !ital!cause
celebre!off!, the strange thing about watching the man with the
painfully withered right leg pursue a PGA career in a golf cart is
how normal it all seems.
</P>
<P>
   The cart he drives in the Nike Tour's Inland Empire Open this
week does not come equipped with a hammock and wet bar. It carries
a plastic water bottle, a scorecard and a stumpy little pencil.
There's a crumpled napkin in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The cart does not allow him to speed ahead of his pedestrian
partners and take extra minutes pondering his next stroke. Nor does
it lag behind and hold everybody up. Martin chugs along at a
walking pace.
</P>
<P>
   The cart is not used as an easy chair between shots. Martin
stands and banters with rivals about the slow players in front of
them or the foibles of pro-am partners. He helps to look for an
opponent's lost ball.
</P>
<P>
   Martin hasn't caused golf's Triple-A tour to be overrun with
adoring throngs or crowds of protesters. His group's gallery Friday
never grew larger than 20.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, despite some people's fears in February 1998 when
the former Stanford teammate of Tiger Woods won a court ruling over
the PGA Tour, granting him clearance to ride in tournaments, none
of his fellow pros has concocted a congenital condition in a bid
for the advantage the cart supposedly gives Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Martin is neither tearing it up nor embarrassing
himself on the Nike Tour. He hasn't won a tournament in 1999, but
he's 14th on the money list with $101,527.
</P>
<P>
   This is the guy who was going to turn golf upside down?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like that big a deal,'' Martin said with a
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Which has been his point all along.
</P>
<P>
   I got my first in-person glimpse of Martin in action as he shot
a 68 in the second round here to move to 7-under par, tied for 12th
and six strokes off Patrick Lee's lead. Watching him changed my
perception of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Burke, a PGA and Nike tour veteran from Coto de Caza,
played with Martin for the first time Friday. The experience
changed Burke's perception too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit different playing with Casey,'' Burke said,
and then he smiled. ``Because he's nice. Do I envy him sometimes on
a (hot) day like this? Yeah. Does it get in the way? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first, hair-trigger reaction (to the controversy) was, `You
joined the tour, you follow the rules.' (Now he thinks) as a human
being, `Should guys who have injuries, or life issues like Casey
has, not be allowed to play?' ``We need more great stories (in
golf).''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has a congenital problem with circulation in the lower
leg; it might eventually require amputation. Other players have bad
knees or temporary injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Burke would have the PGA Tour take up cart requests by players
like them on a case-by-case basis, though he fears that would
result in different rules for different people, depending on their
value to the tour marketing department.
</P>
<P>
   But the PGA Tour apparently isn't interested in such a
common-sense approach to the issues raised when Martin won the
famous court victory in his native Oregon under the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour is appealing the ruling. A decision by the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is due in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   That could hit Martin with a cruel blow, barring him from PGA
Tour competition even if he qualifies by remaining in the top 15 in
Nike Tour earnings after the Oct. 21-24 season finale in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if he's just one of the guys. His crowds, though
small by Tiger standards, are bigger than anybody else's on this
Tin Cup circuit where gallery ropes are necessary only at the tees
and greens. His sponsor is a major insurance company, something few
at this level can claim.
</P>
<P>
   Kids don't beg autographs from Mike Grob and Ashley Chinner.
They do pester Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tuesday press conferences are no longer needed. And last
year's public frenzy, Martin said, sitting in the cart at the end
of a relatively pain-free day on the course, ``has died down.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is doing this the right way. He passes up the
sponsor-granted berths in PGA Tour events that his unique fame
could bring. If he makes the big tour, he'll do it by earning his
way, by finishing the Nike season strong.
</P>
<P>
   Golf for Casey Martin these days is a test of heart and mind,
not much different from everyone else. &QL;

FOOD GIVEAWAY BY GRAMMY-WINNING GOSPEL SINGERS IS LABOR OF LOVE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Food for body and soul was on the menu at the
fourth annual Help Heal our Streets block party.
</P>
<P>
   Help Heal Our Streets, a community outreach arm of the New
Christ Memorial Church in Pacoima, is distributing 40 tons of food
to needy in the Pacoima area of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
But, as they do every year, organizers are making sure the giveaway
is only a portion of a larger event _ a two-day block party
designed to entertain, inspire and unite an entire community. On
Friday, organizers estimate that 2,000 to 3,000 people came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful. A lot of churches don't participate in
the community, but this one does,'' said Karen Thomas, who came to
the event for her mother, Pacoima resident Pearline Thomas.
Pearline Thomas went last year but is sick in the hospital this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have fallen on hard times one way or another,'' said
Thomas, visiting from Washington, D.C., and getting her sacks
loaded with Hi-C juice, Campbell's soup, onions, and dry beans and
rice doled from 100-pound sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in this society who care about others,'' said
Sandra Crouch, co-pastor with her brother, Andrae, of the New
Christ Memorial Church. Both are San Fernando Valley natives and
Grammy Award-winning gospel singers.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch said the volunteers at her church feel it's important to
go outside its four walls to help those in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you to know somebody loves you, and that somebody is
God,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch said an essential part of the gathering is the sense of
togetherness it tries to foster in the ethnically diverse area _ a
message Jennifer Corley, 24, said was one of several things that
attracted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music, to hear the Gospel Word and all the free food, and
to see the community come together, all races,'' Corley said.
``Help Heal Our Streets _ I think that's really neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday and again today, the block party will feature carnival
rides, face-painting for children, magic shows, fire eaters,
professional wrestling matches and craft booths. In addition,
dancers will perform in Indian, African and hip-hop styles, while
musicians ranging from country and western to mariachi and jazz
will play. The Crouches themselves will perform at 9 p.m. tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really good for the community. And it will really
help me personally,'' said Nancy Misfeldt, 43, the single mother of
three teen-agers, waiting in the food distribution line.
</P>
<P>
   The block party has its origins in the aftermath of the
Northridge Earthquake. Crouch said church members saw people in
long lines at social services offices and handed out tuna and
peanut butter sandwiches to them. They also distributed water to
apartment buildings that had none.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with pallets full of nonperishable food donated by the
international relief agencies Feed the Children of Oklahoma City
and the Children's Hunger Fund of Los Angeles, the church hopes to
help about 10,000 people, Crouch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody looks at anybody like, Who are you? We don't say, let
me see your ID,'' she said. ``I imagine that if people stand in a
line three blocks long, they need the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Chatman Edwards, spokeswoman for Help Heal Our Streets,
added that people don't often speak up even if they're going
without.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because someone looks like they're working, they look
like they're OK _ they may have nothing at home in the
refrigerator,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said she found herself in that situation 20 years ago
when she was a single parent struggling to raise her 7-year-old son
and her salary as a bank employee was barely enough to cover
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to bed not eating sometimes, so my son could
have something to eat,'' she said. ``I wish there had been
something like this then.''

ANGELS RALLY TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Their leaders have fallen, and now all that's left
for the 1999 Angels is to play their final series against the team
that is sitting atop the A.L. West, a place the Angels had hoped
and expected to be.
</P>
<P>
   In what the schedule-makers foresaw as a season-ending division
showdown between the Texas Rangers and Angels has instead turned
into a sidelight thanks to general manager Bill Bavasi's
resignation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with Terry Collins' resignation as manager Sept. 3,
Bavasi's resignation and re-assignment in the front office
essentially has left the Angels players alone in their sea of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Angels rallied from a five-run deficit to
beat the Rangers, 7-6, on rookie Jeff DaVanon's ninth-inning home
run Friday night before 25,515 at Edison Field. Never mind that
they are in the midst of their first winning September since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened on the field the past four weeks has little
meaning compared to the transformation the club is undergoing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rangers have something to play for -- the American
League's best record. With the Indians losing Friday, the Rangers
had a chance to cut the Indians' lead to one game. And they got off
to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez, one of the leading candidates to win the A.L.
MVP, singled in the first inning, stole second (No. 25) and scored
on a single by Rafael Palmeiro. Rodriguez was at it again in the
third inning, hitting a solo homer (No. 35) to give the Rangers a
2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With 35 homers, Rodriguez set an American League record for home
runs in a season by a catcher, breaking Terry Steinbach's mark of
34 set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers used the longball again in the fourth inning,
getting a three-run homer by one of their most unlikely sources.
Tom Goodwin hit his third homer of the season with Lee Stevens and
Royce Clayton on base to put Texas in front, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels began their rally in the bottom of the fourth,
getting an RBI single from Mo Vaughn and a two-run homer from Troy
Glaus (No. 29). Vaughn now has 107 RBIs, tying him for sixth best
on the Angels' single-season all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers knocked Angels starter Ramon Ortiz out of the game
in the seventh after Ortiz walked Goodwin and gave up a single to
Scarborough Green. Green scored later in the inning on a wild pitch
by reliever Mike Holtz, the Rangers going up, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, in his final start of the season, went six-plus inning
and allowed six runs and eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   Down three going into the eighth, the Angels benefitted from an
error by third baseman Todd Zeile. After a walk to Vaughn, Tim
Salmon double home one run and Glaus singled home two more to tie
the game at 6.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan entered the game in the ninth and DaVanon, who got
his first major league hit earlier in the game (single), homered
over the center-field fence to win it.

KINGS' THOMAS CONTACTED BY FOX'S WELTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Sacramento Kings president John Thomas said he was
contacted by Rick Welts, president of Fox Sports Enterprises, and
wouldn't rule out joining one of baseball's most prestigious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Welts called Thomas to talk about becoming the next Dodgers
president. The two are longtime business associates from Welts'
tenure in the NBA. Thomas is one of six candidates to replace
recently fired Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly flattering to be mentioned in the context of
the Dodgers with Fox and Rick Welts, but all my focus is with
what's going on with the Sacramento Kings,'' Thomas said Friday.
``We have one of the most exciting teams in the NBA and we're
getting ready for the season. It's the first day of training camp
and all my focus is on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Welts' and Thomas' relationship goes back to their days together
in the NBA. Welts worked in the NBA office under David Stern and
Thomas was working for the Houston Rockets and Comets (WNBA).
Thomas, who accepted the job as president of the Kings, Sacramento
Monarchs (WNBA) and Sacramento Knights (Arena Football) in July,
also worked for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said it was too early to tell if he would interview with
Welts, but said the two had a strong working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be sensitive to the issue,'' Thomas said. ``I
don't want to speculate on the future. The recent developments down
there ... are flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheff shutdown?: After playing half of the season with pain in
his shoulders and knees, left fielder Gary Sheffield's season may
be over after hitting a homer and driving in three runs Friday
against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   His two-run single in the third inning also enabled him to
eclipse the 100-RBI mark for the third time in his career, and the
first time since 1996 when he drove in a career-high 120 with
Florida. His first-inning homer also tied him with Karros for the
team lead with 34 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not play him again this year,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``With his shoulder and his knees, I don't know.... A
very tough year for a lot of us on this club, his perseverance has
been a bright spot. If everybody on this club took his approach in
every aspect of the game, we'd be a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson doesn't use his all-star left fielder again,
Sheffield would join Duke Snider (1955) as the only Dodger to bat
at least .300 in a season, hit 30 homers and reach the century mark
in RBI (101), runs (103) and walks (101).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go with whatever he says,'' Sheffield said. ``If he
doesn't want to play me, I don't have a problem with that. You have
to see what other guys can do.''
</P>
<P>
   They hate L.A.: The New York airwaves are scorching the Dodgers,
and this time it has nothing to do with leaving Brooklyn. With the
Mets engaged in a playoff battle they are frittering away (for the
second straight year), the folks in the Big Apple are miffed that
Dodgers' ace Kevin Brown won't start in Sunday's season finale
against Houston. It's the last regular season game in the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he still isn't sure who will start, but signs point
toward Robinson Checo. Johnson previously said Brown's season ended
with his Wednesday loss in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to go, but to me, our year is over,'' Johnson said.
``I don't feel comfortable, with the year he's had, bring my ace
back on three days' rest. I think it's one of those things if
you're trying to the playoffs (you try it), but it's another thing
to stress him.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Right-hander Ismael Valdes won't return to the team this
season. Valdes has been in his native Mexico since Monday. He went
there after learning his father was involved in a car accident....
Eric Karros' first-inning single extended his hitting streak to 11
games, tying the longest by a Dodger this season. Adrian Beltre,
Mark Grudzielanek and Sheffield also hit in 11 straight.... The
Dodgers announced Beltre and catcher Angel Pena will play winter
ball in the Dominican Republic, former Santa Paula High and Ventura
College star Brent Cookson will play in Mexico, Matt Herges will
pitch in Venezuela and Onan Masaoka and Jeff Williams will pitch in
the Arizona Fall League.

PIPPEN GETS HIS WISH AS ROCKETS TRADE HIM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A disgruntled Scottie Pippen, who skewered his teammate Charles
Barkley this week and seemed to be campaigning mightily for a trade
from the Houston Rockets, got his wish Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Western Conference executive who spoke on
condition of anonymity, the Rockets will send Pippen to the
Portland Trail Blazers for six role players.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after signing a five-year, $67 million deal and
moving from the Chicago Bulls to the Rockets, Pippen is expected to
be dealt for Kelvin Cato, Walt Williams, Stacey Augmon, Ed Gray,
Brian Shaw and Carlos Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Barring salary-cap complications, the deal is expected to be
made official at the league's Manhattan office Saturday, the
executive said. It comes two days before National Basketball
Association teams open training camp for the 1999-2000 season and
several days after Pippen verbally eviscerated Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley started the ruckus. Saying he sacrificed to make salary
cap room on the Rockets for Pippen, Barkley knocked Pippen. ``For
him to want to leave after one year, it disappointed me greatly,''
he said. ``The Rockets went out of their way to get Scottie, and
the fans have treated him well, so I was just disappointed in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   That was benign compared to Pippen's barrage on ESPN: ``I
probably should've listened to Michael a year ago when he said that
Charles will never win a championship because he doesn't show any
dedication,'' Pippen said. ``He's a very selfish guy. He doesn't
show the desire to want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had openly pushed for a trade to the Lakers ever since
his former coach Phil Jackson was given the Lakers job last June.
Pippen said he would never consider apologizing to Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't give Charles Barkley an apology at gunpoint,'' he
said. ``He can never expect an apology from me. If anything, he
owes me an apology'' for the way he played. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' owner, Les Alexander, instructed team officials to
listen to offers for Pippen, but not to pull the trigger on a deal
until all offers had been weighed. Cato and Williams were the only
players Houston was genuinely interested in, a Rockets official
said on condition of anonymity. Because of Pippen's $14 million
salary for this season, a six-for-one deal was the only way the
trade could be consummated.
</P>
<P>
   Denver had offered Nick Van Exel, even though the Rockets
engaged in an 11-player deal in August _ the largest-player
transaction in league history _ to acquire rookie point guard Steve
Francis from Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, 34, asked to be traded several times while with the
Bulls during their championship run, and always ended up mending
relationships and coming back.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was reported by the Houston Chronicle earlier this
week. KRIV-TV in Houston reported Friday night the deal is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the league, the trade bolsters Portland standing
in the Western Conference playoff picture. Already the Trail
Blazers dealt for veteran shooting guard Steve Smith in the
off-season and rid themselves of Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   With Damon Stoudamire at point guard, Smith at shooting guard,
Pippen at small forward, Brian Grant at power forward and Arvydas
Sabonis, Detlef Schrempf and Rasheed Wallace playing major minutes,
the Blazers appear on course to contend with San Antonio.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-POLITICS (Tehran, Iran) _ Iran's supreme religious leader
moves decisively to head off a fresh confrontation with the
country's reformist president, instructing hardline Muslim clerics
and their loyalists in the country's police not to ``take matters
into their own hands'' in a new and potentially explosive dispute
involving Tehran university students. By John F. Burns. 1,300
words.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-GANDHIS (Rampur, India) _ The political and personal soap
opera of Sonia Gandhi and Maneka Gandhi: Sonia is the aloof woman
who now wants to run the country. Maneka is the ``other
daughter-in-law,'' and oh, how the irony grates on her. She has
been in politics for 20 years, Sonia for two. She is the widow of
Sanjay, who was his mother's right-hand man. Sonia's husband was
Rajiv, an airline pilot disinclined to governance. Sonia is the
leader of the venerable Congress Party; Maneka, the cabinet
minister for welfare. From 1974 to 1982, the two daughters-in-law
lived under the same roof. ``They hated each other's guts from the
word go,'' said the writer Khushwant Singh. By Barry Bearak. 1,900
words.

</P>
<P>
   NY-NEWYEAR-VACANCIES (New York) _ Despite everything you may
have heard about millennium madness, out-of-towners have not booked
every overpriced hotel room in the city for New Year's Eve. They
have not snapped up every $3,000 seat in the Rainbow Room,
purchased every $1,000 ticket to every ``gala'' event, hired every
limousine _ or even every baby sitter. By Leslie Eaton. 1,700
words.
</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients.)
</P>
<P>
   GOVS-EDUC-ASSESS (Undated) _ The last time American governors

latter group, are things any better? By Francis X. Clines.

<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-R-US (Undated) _ Last fall, shoppers at Toys ``R'' Us,
armed with holiday wish lists, often left the chain's cavernous
stores frustrated and empty-handed, and the company felt the pain
acutely in its bottom line. This year, as the company heads into
the crucial Christmas season, it is trying mightily to do things
differently. By Dana Canedy.

</P>
<P>
   MORRIS-BIOGRAPHY (Undated) _ In ``Dutch,'' a biography of Ronald

Michiko Kakutani. 2,200 words.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares of area health maintenance organizations
closed lower Friday, as some of the country's most prominent
lawyers confirmed they are preparing class-action lawsuits against
the nation's largest HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Following nearly double-digit percentage losses Thursday, shares
of WellPoint Health Networks fell 37.5 cents to close at $56.625
while shares of Foundation Health Systems lost 6.25 cents to close
at $9.375.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Sellers, an attorney with Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP;
Toll in Washington, said he was ``in the process of developing a
class-action lawsuit against one of the nation's largest HMOs
alleging fraud.'' He said he expects the lawsuit to be filed next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers wouldn't name the company, but said the lawsuit would
allege the HMO ``is willfully misrepresenting the benefits it
provides patients in an effort to maximize profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the attorneys participating in drafting the various
lawsuits is Richard Scruggs of Pascagoula, Miss., who helped
produce tobacco settlements nationwide that totaled $246 billion;
and Sellers' co-counsel David Boies, who recently concluded the
U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   David Olson, senior vice president of investor relations with
Foundation Health Systems Inc., described the lawsuits as
``absurd,'' saying, ``Any action is truly and completely without
merit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role is to be certain that patients get all the health
care they need. That is our duty to them,'' said Olson.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint Health Networks spokesman Larry Bryant said the
company had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suits are grossly inappropriate,'' added Walter Zelman,
president of the California Association of HMOs Inc. in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers said the suits won't seek to dismantle managed care.
``We want people in HMOs to get the information they need,'' he
said, to get proper care.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Chockley, president of the Washington-based National
Institute for Health Care Management, said that if a lawsuit
forcing more health care were successful, the lawsuits could be
very harmful to the managed care industry nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to drive up health care costs, which will lead to
more people losing their insurance,'' said Chockley. In California,
an estimated 7 million people are without health care, which
continues to grow by approximately 50,000 people each month, said
Zelman.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of WellPoint and FHS dropped sharply Thursday on the
first report of the lawsuits. WellPoint fell $6.1875 to $57; FHS
dropped $1.0625 to $9.4375.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint shares fell 8.9 percent at their low Friday, before
rallying. FHS shares were down 9.9 percent at their low point.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton hopes the Supreme Court this term
will grant him the authority to regulate tobacco and to prevent
states from selling personal information gleaned from driver's
license applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds are against Clinton as the high court, under Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, has reined in federal power in recent
years. The conservative court, in a series of 5-4 decisions, has
interpreted narrowly the authority the Constitution gives the
president and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a major test of the president's authority, one that pits
Clinton against Big Tobacco, the justices will consider whether the
federal government can regulate cigarettes as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   Washington business attorney Roy Englert Jr., in explaining what
is at stake for Clinton and the tobacco industry, called the
Supreme Court case ``a battle royale pitched at the high levels.''
A presidential victory would create a ``dramatic vista of powers''
for the federal government in its effort to deter cigarette
smoking, particularly by teen-agers, Englert said.
</P>
<P>
   States have taken the lead in regulating cigarette sales to
minors, but Clinton has made tobacco control a major agenda item of
the last two years of his presidency, angering the industry.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case, FDA vs. Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
is the validity of strict regulations Clinton's Food and Drug
Administration has imposed on the sale of cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco to children.
</P>
<P>
   The well-heeled tobacco companies and their retailers have
successfully argued so far that FDA lacks the statutory authority
to regulate their products.
</P>
<P>
   In support of Clinton, Texas has joined 38 other states in
urging the justices to rule in favor of FDA's regulatory authority.
The states argue that carcinogenic tobacco products have imposed
enormous health costs on the nation and should be subject to
federal as well as state regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, a staunch opponent of the tobacco industry, settled a
lawsuit with cigarette companies in January 1998 for $17.6 billion
to recover its Medicaid costs for treating victims of
smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   FDA's controversial regulations prohibit the sale of cigarettes
and smokeless tobacco to anyone under age 18, require retailers to
check the identification of would-be tobacco buyers under age 27
and restrict vending-machine sales of cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco to adult-only locations.
</P>
<P>
   In another case addressing federal authority, Reno vs. Condon,
the justices will decide whether states must comply with a U.S. law
barring them from selling to companies and individuals the personal
information gleaned from driver's license applications.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the controversial law, the 1994 Driver's Privacy
Protection Act, after it was revealed that Rebecca Schaeffer's
killer, Robert John Bardo, was able in 1989 to track down the
California home address of the television actress through state
motor-vehicle records.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, in an argument that appears to
contradict recent Supreme Court precedent, says Congress'
constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce allows the
federal government to bar states from selling information in their
possession. The administration also argues that the federal
restriction on the sale of information is necessary to protect
citizens' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, in its apparently contrary 5-4 ruling, said in
1997 that the U.S. government's ability to compel state officials
to act is limited. In that case, Printz vs. United States, the
court said Congress could not order state police to conduct federal
criminal background checks on people seeking to buy firearms.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Carolina case now before the justices, the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals cited the Printz decision in ruling the
federal restriction on the sale of driver's license information is
inconsistent ``with the system of dual sovereignty established by
the Constitution'' between the federal and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   Urging the justices to strike down the law, South Carolina says
the law unconstitutionally permits the federal government to
trample on the states' sovereign right to handle driver's license
information as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of driver's license records can be quite lucrative for
states, as New York in one recent year earned $17 million from
individuals and businesses who sought access to the information,
the federal government reported.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative majority that formed the Printz decision still
dominates the high court and asserted its control most recently on
June 23, the final day of last term.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of three decisions, the conservatives, led by
Rehnquist, struck down federal laws that sought to give individuals
and businesses the right to sue states for money damages. The
court, in its 5-4 rulings, held that the Constitution's 11th
Amendment generally grants states ``sovereign immunity'' from being
sued in federal and state courts.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases restricting federal authority over states,
Rehnquist was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M.
Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Composing the minority
then, as they continue to do in cases of federal authority, were
Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer.

POLICE WORK, POLITICS, PORN AMONG ISSUES ON HIGH COURT DOCKET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Oct. 3)

(Optional trim included)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court officially returns to work
Monday, prepared to consider cases that could change the methods
police use in high-crime neighborhoods, affect how people finance
candidates and college campus groups and limit the way officials
can regulate pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The court also will consider a case that could alter
governmental treatment of parochial-school students. The justices
are expected to render their decisions by July.
</P>
<P>
   But the nine-member court might have to start its 1999-2000 term
with only eight justices on the bench. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
appointed by President Clinton in 1993, is recovering from
colon-cancer surgery and might miss the first two weeks of oral
arguments, which begin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg could still participate in the court's decisions, many
of which might have broad significance for police, politicians,
pupils and pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in an Illinois case being closely watched by police
and civil rights groups, the high court will consider whether the
Constitution allows police in crime-ridden areas to stop and frisk
people solely because they run upon seeing officers.
</P>
<P>
   The case pits the interest of law enforcement against the Fourth
Amendment right of people to be free from unreasonable searches.
The Illinois Supreme Court, in a ruling against the police, said
Sam Wardlow's decision to run from Chicago officers did not give
them sufficient reason to suspect him of having committed a crime
or frisk him.
</P>
<P>
   The search uncovered a firearm and led to Wardlow's conviction
for unlawful gun possession and two-year prison sentence, which the
Illinois high court overturned.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois' appeal to the Supreme Court, the state argues that
police in dangerous neighborhoods nationwide would be hamstrung in
their ability to fight crime if they were prohibited from chasing
people who bolt at the sight of officers. The Clinton
administration and the National Association of Police Organizations
have submitted briefs to the justices supporting Illinois'
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unprovoked flight from identifiable police officers is
ordinarily a sufficiently valid indicator of illicit conduct to
justify a brief investigatory stop,'' the administration wrote.
``Although such flight may be undertaken for innocent reasons, it
is not behavior in which innocent persons commonly engage _ and it
is far more likely to signal a consciousness of wrongdoing and a
fear of apprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wardlow counters that the constitutional rights of innocent
people would be jeopardized if police were allowed to search them
simply because they run. The NAACP Legal Defense &AMP; Educational Fund
agreed in a brief to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why an inner-city resident flees at the sight of a police
officer is at best ambiguous, and cannot by itself provide
sufficient indicia that the citizen is about to commit a crime,''
the group wrote. ``Many residents in such communities, and
particularly minority members, have in the past been harassed by
some law enforcement officers and continue to suffer from such
abuse. They possess a legitimate and reasonable fear of such
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Also before the high court is the issue of campaign finance,
which has dogged Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican
presidential candidate. The justices will consider in a Missouri
case, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government Political Action
Committee, whether a state law limiting campaign contributions for
state elections violates the First Amendment free-speech right of
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised more than $50 million, angering party and
Democratic opponents who say he is bought and paid for by special
interests. Supporters of limits on campaign donations say the
controversial restrictions are needed to prevent the appearance, if
not the reality, of political corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In the case before the court, Missouri is urging the justices to
overturn an 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that struck
down the state's contribution limits as a violation of political
donors' right to free speech. Under the Missouri statute,
individuals may contribute at most $1,075 to candidates for
statewide office, $525 to candidates for state senate and $250 to
state representative candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which is urging the justices to
uphold the law, praised the campaign limits as a narrow,
constitutional way for states to ensure that elections are not
tainted by the corruption that can be associated with large
donations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Missouri political action committee, joined by longtime
foes the National Rifle Association and the American Civil
Liberties Union, is pressing the justices to rule the state's
restrictions unconstitutional. The committee says political
contributors ``speak'' through their financial support for
candidates and that laws that limit their contributions infringe on
their First Amendment right.
</P>
<P>
   In considering the case, the high court will revisit its
landmark 1976 decision in Buckley vs. Valeo in which the justices
upheld the constitutionality of a $1,000 limit for personal
contributions in federal campaigns. But the high court in recent
years has displayed unease with its 23-year-old ruling, increasing
speculation that the justices might scale back that decision and
permit greater, if not unlimited, campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In another First Amendment case, which could affect political
advocacy on college campuses, the justices will decide whether a
state university can require students to make financial
contributions toward groups with whom they disagree.
</P>
<P>
   In University of Wisconsin vs. Southworth, conservative law
students are challenging the school's mandatory $331.50 activity
fee, which helps support the gamut of campus organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the
conservative students, saying the mandatory charge violates their
First Amendment right to refrain from financing groups that espouse
views they find repugnant, such as abortion- and gay-rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Wisconsin, in its appeal to the justices, argues that a
school should be a forum for diverse views and, to ensure
diversity, it must assess fees on students. Wisconsin adds that the
fee revenue is distributed to all campus groups, without regard to
the viewpoints they espouse.
</P>
<P>
   The law students, however, counter that if the justices
eventually rule for the school, ``a state university could force
Jewish students to fund a Christian evangelical newspaper (and)
force African-American students to fund neo-Nazi or Ku Klux Klan
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
All Texas state universities have mandatory student activity fees,
similar to Wisconsin's, that go toward funding campus organizations
without regard to the opinions they espouse. University of Houston
law Professor Michael A. Olivas said many campus voices would be
silenced if students were free to select the groups to which their
money goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (would) ruin student affairs as we know it,'' said Olivas,
an expert in higher-education law. ``Only those programs that have
a small band of zealots to organize funding will be able to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a free-speech case involving Playboy's television channel,
the justices will consider the constitutionality of a federal law
that requires cable operators either to block sexually explicit
channels from reaching nonsubscribers' homes or air its shows
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., when children likely would not be
watching.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, which lost in the U.S. District Court in
Delaware, argues that its controversial demand on cable companies
is necessary to prevent curious, impressionable children from
glimpsing lewd televised images even when the images are scrambled
for nonsubscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society has an interest independent of the choices made by
parents in seeing to it that children are not exposed to sexually
explicit materials,'' the Clinton administration wrote in its brief
to the justices.
</P>
<P>
   But Playboy Entertainment Group Inc., a media conglomerate that
provides sexually charged programming, counters that the broadcast
restriction violates the company's right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a Louisiana case involving religious rights, the Supreme
Court will consider the constitutionality of a federal program that
helps states provide computer equipment to parochial as well as
public and private nonsectarian schools. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, which governs Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, said
the program violates the First Amendment's prohibition on
governmental establishment of religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and parochial-school parents in
Jefferson Parish, La., are urging the high court in Mitchell vs.
Helms to rule the program constitutional, arguing that providing
computers to sectarian as well as secular schools does not favor
religion. The program simply ensures that no child is denied access
to computers at school, no matter where he or she attends classes,
the administration argues.
</P>
<P>
   But parish taxpayers challenging the program contend that the
federal government is violating the constitutional separation of
church and state by assisting religious institutions.

Service for AMs of Sunday, Oct. 3:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-RECKONING (Santiago, Chile) _ The arrest of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet in London a year ago has opened a quiet and long-postponed
reckoning in Chile over its years of dictatorship that is finally
bringing former military officers to task for the deaths or
disappearances of thousands of political opponents. By Clifford
Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-DOME (Greenwich, England) _ When the first stanchions
went up in 1997 for the mammoth cupola being erected here to mark
the millennium, the image that rose in the mind's eye of many
Britons had the pale coloration and oversized contours of a white
elephant. ``The millennium fiasco,'' The Evening Standard called
it. Now, though, the $1.2 billion Millennium Dome has developed a
more alluring fragrance, and become a beast that Britons seem eager
to climb aboard for their ride into the new century. By Warren
Hoge. (With photo and map.)
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-POOR (Jagdispur, India) _ When Laloo Yadav, the son of an
illiterate cowherd first came to power in the northern state of
Bihar in March 1990, he symbolized the rise of India's peasant
castes to the political heights _ and the hope that this new
generation of leaders would improve the lives of people long
dominated by the ruling upper castes. For various reasons, these
hopes have been dashed. By Celia A. Dugger. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ Russian troops continued to move into
Chechnya on Saturday, spurring speculation that the Kremlin may be
planning a land offensive against the breakaway republic. By
Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-NUKE-ASSESS (Tokyo) _ A string of embarrassingly
unanswered questions stretched long in the wake of Japan's worst
nuclear accident, one day after the crisis was officially declared
over. An analysis. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   TIMOR-RDP (Dili, East Timor) _ All across Dili _ and now in an
increasing number of towns around East Timor _ patrols like this
are constantly on the move as they attempt to intimidate and flush
out the irregular militias that have wreaked havoc here. By Seth
Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-JOSPIN (Paris) _ A political cartoon here last week
showed France's Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, getting
ready to meet a roomful of reporters. Behind a closed door, Jospin
_ sweating with effort _ was repeating to himself: ``I am from the
Left. I am from the Left. I am from the Left.'' Since he declared
two weeks ago that the Government ``could not be expected to
control the economy,'' Jospin has been under heavy pressure to take
back his words. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-RUSSIA-HOTLINE (Moscow) _ The United States and Russia,
updating the ``hot line'' concept between leaders of the world's
most heavily armed nuclear powers, opened a new state-of-the-art
video-conferencing center Saturday that will enable Russian and
American nuclear officials to see, as well as talk directly to each
other during a nuclear emergency. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-VOTE (Vienna, Austria) _ Can a politician so tanned that
he's known as the Hero of the Solarium, so narcissistic that he's
posed in everything from lederhosen to silver togas to near nudity,
and so controversial that his opponents openly call him a
crypto-Nazi actually beat this conservative country's red-and-black
coalition government until it's black-and-blue? That question will
be answered Sunday, when Austria's voters go to the polls. By
Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-PEACEKEEPING (United Nations) _ The U.N. strategy for
dealing with regional conflicts has undergone a significant shift,
as shown by its new involvement in Kosovo and East Timor, and a
third mission under consideration in Sierra Leone, U.N. officials
and other diplomats say. By Christopher S. Wren.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-UNREST (Najaf, Iraq) _ This year tensions are again running
high in southern Iraq, whose overwhelmingly Shiite population has
long harbored deep resentment against a central government
dominated by minority Sunni Muslims. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CLINICAL-TESTS (Undated) _ For years, Dr. Larry Norton tried
to conduct a medical study to determine, once and for all, whether
bone marrow transplants could really save the lives of women
desperately ill with breast cancer. His efforts _ and those of
dozens of other doctors _ were largely futile. Year after year, few
women were willing to participate in the clinical tests, which, to
be scientifically valid, required patients to be randomly assigned
to either the experimental treatment or standard chemotherapy. By
Gina Kolata and Kurt Eichenwald. (With a graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PEDIATRICS _ If there is a model for an effective way to
handle experimental procedures, it is the world of pediatric
cancer. In that arena, most doctors refuse to offer such treatments
outside clinical trials, insurance companies usually pick up the
tab and experimental procedures are tested quickly, before they
reach the marketplace. The result is that the procedures that work
are adopted widely; those that do not are quickly abandoned. By
Gina Kolata and Kurt Eichenwald.
</P>
<P>
   NY-MUSEUM-OPENING (New York) _ The Brooklyn Museum opens its
controversial show at 5 p.m. Saturday. Protests are slated for 11
a.m. By David Barstow.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON-ASTRODOME (Houston) _ Once promoted as the Eighth Wonder
of the World, the Astrodome is now a relic, as outdated as a
polyester leisure suit. On Sunday, the Astros will play their last
regular season game at the Astrodome before moving next season to a
new, state-of-the-art downtown ball park. Mammoth enough to contain
an 18-story building, the Dome was a monument to the Texan appetite
for big things and an emblem of a colorful era when men like the
stadium's eccentric creator, Judge Roy Hofheinz, reshaped Houston
and Texas through will and money. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   HEMP-BIRDSEED-FIGHT _ What do 40,000 pounds of birdseed have in
common with America's war on drugs? Nothing, says Jean Laprise, an
Ontario farmer who shipped the birdseed _ sterilized seeds
processed from industrial hemp _ to his American customers only to
have it seized when it crossed the United States-Canadian border.
Everything, say the U.S. government and its critics, but for
altogether different reasons. By Christopher S. Wren.
</P>
<P>
   BOX-BATTLE-OF-SEXES (Bremerton, Wash.) _ Both fighters are
brashly predicting a knockout, which is nothing new in boxing. But
some of the other prebout banter is certainly unusual. After the
state of Washington declared that its gender-equity laws give it no
authority and indeed no reason to prevent the match, what is billed
by its promoters as the nation's first officially sanctioned bout
between a man and a woman was scheduled for Oct. 9 at Seattle's
Mercer Arena. By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-FRAUD (Washington) _ A look at fraud in federal programs
that are meant to feed poor children in day care homes. By Robert
Pear.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS (Washington) _ Opening its new term on Monday, the
Supreme Court returns from a three-month recess to a docket that
places the Justices squarely in the midst of some of the country's
most passionate debates, from health care to campaign finance to
government aid to religious schools. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-MILK-FEUD (Washington) _ For most families, the outcome
of a battle in Congress over milk prices will mean just a few cents
a week at the supermarket counter. But the livelihoods of tens of
thousands of dairy farmers are at stake, and the issue has provoked
a civil war between lawmakers from the East and those from the
Midwest. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>

   BRADLEY-SPORTS-POLITICS (Washington) _ For most of his nearly 40
years in the limelight, Bill Bradley, the former senator and
basketball star, regarded celebrity _ his own, in particular _ with
a gimlet eye. Once asked if too much fame inevitably ruined the
famous, he replied, ``Absolutely.'' But in his tightening race for
the Democratic presidential nomination, Bradley, 56, has decided to
exploit his Hall of Fame career to the hilt, recruiting a host of
basketball greats to help him raise money, grab attention and

   GREENWICH, England _ When the first stanchions went up in 1997
for the mammoth cupola being erected here to mark the millennium,
the image that rose in the mind's eye of many Britons had the pale
coloration and oversized contours of a white elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millennium fiasco,'' The Evening Standard called it,
reflecting the widespread public view. ``Dump the Dome'' declared
Britain's best-selling tabloid, The Sun, and an early sniff of the
project was enough for The Financial Times to declare, ``The
millennium exhibition has about it the smell of disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that as the government was proposing lavish
spending on millennial festivities, it was cutting its welfare
budget and preaching austerity to sectors of society long
accustomed to state subsidies. There was also no shortage of better
ideas for spending all that money. One caller to the BBC said it
would be better to take the fabric to cover the dome and stretch it
over Wimbledon so the tennis tournament would not always be
interrupted by rain.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, just under three months from its completion and
gala inauguration by Queen Elizabeth, the $1.2 billion Millennium
Dome has developed a more alluring fragrance, and become a beast
that Britons seem eager to climb aboard for their ride into the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the size of the current world-record-holding Georgia Dome
in Atlanta, the new building here sits astride the prime meridian
that gave the name to Greenwich Mean Time. Prime Minister Tony
Blair, a man of digital speed velocity at coining a sound bite,
pronounced Britain ``the home of time'' and launched the largest
millennial commemoration of any country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Greenwich celebration originated with the
Conservative government of John Major but was eagerly endorsed by
Blair as a showcase for the innovative, trend-setting role he
envisioned for 21st-century Britain. Officials of the Blair
government have gone into giddy celebratory overdrive as the date
has drawn closer, overseeing fireworks extravaganzas that will
light up London's skies as Big Ben chimes in the new millennium and
organizing a 200-foot-tall line of fire speeding through the city
along the Thames at 300 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite hilariously,'' wrote John Vidal in The Guardian, ``one
of the most self-avowedly Christian, puritan, uptight governments
Britain has known, one which never ceases to extol the virtues of
social obligation, which gives us few laughs, makes us work the
longest hours in Europe and gives us the fewest public holidays, is
sponsoring at vast expense, an enormous pagan midwinter festival of
dance, fire and light.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An early sign that the new dome might rise above its many
detractors was word that $245 million in sponsorship money was
raised six months ahead of schedule from an initially underwhelmed
British business community.
</P>
<P>
   The project still suffered from reports of cost escalations and
crippling delays and a series of blowups in the creative team, with
dramatic walkouts accompanied by front page exit tantrums. For
months it appeared that no one had any idea of what to put under
the world's biggest roof, and that much empty space was a
tantalizing invitation for critics to fill it with ridicule and
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The focused wooing of the business establishment, which gave the
dome the ballast to withstand the flood of abuse, went largely
unreported though. ``London is a network-driven town, and the dome
people went out of their way to target the powerful, influential
opinion formers, who were not impressed at first, organize them and
take them out there to show them what was being done,'' said the
vice president of a leading investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his company had decided not to become a sponsor _
and therefore asked that his name not be used _ but that the
persistent dome boosters came back with ``impeccable commercial
acumen,'' offering package deals and incentives to lure their
thousands of employees to buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the dome's promoters are such habitues of the age of
spin that they insist even the negative publicity was nothing but a
boon. ``Ninety-five to 96 percent of the public know all about the
dome,'' said Sholto Douglas-Home, the project's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   With expectations of attracting 12 million people during the
year 2000, the dome is now awash in corporate logos representing
Britain's largest companies. ``In terms of getting consumer mind
share _ that feeling that each morning when you wake up, you are
aware of certain brands _ companies ended up with no choice but to
be in the dome,'' the banker said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Construction looks likely to end ahead of schedule and under
budget, and the dome's managers finally have something other than
20 acres of unfilled space to back up the lofty expectations they
have been raising in promotional language.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that under the world's largest roof there will be
14 themed pavilions with titles like Journey, Faith, Body, Money,
Play, Shared Ground and Self-Portrait where visitors can experience
what a just-launched saturation advertising campaign calls ``one
amazing day.''
</P>
<P>
   They will be able to take virtual reality trips inside the body
and outside the earth's atmosphere, assume whatever new look they
like with morphing machines, explore the inside of the brain
through medical imaging technology, observe the complex behavior of
a colony of 500,000 Trinidadian leaf cutter ants, become their own
computer game heroes, inhabit a structure made completely of
recycled cardboard, and blow (PS)1 million _ $1.65 million _ with a
fantasy credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The first tickets went on sale late last month, and bulk buyers
like travel agencies have been keeping the call centers and
Internet sites busy. Additional tickets are on sale at the
country's 25,000 National Lottery outlets. The price for an adult
day ticket is $32.50, with family tickets bringing the per-head
price down to $18.50.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dome can accommodate 35,000 people at one time, with 12,000
of them in the sunken arena in the center where a glittery theater
piece will take place up to five times a day. Directed by Mark
Fisher, who has staged concerts for U2, Pink Floyd and the Rolling
Stones, and composed by the rock musician Peter Gabriel, the show
features 60 performers using the entire 164 foot roof-to-ceiling
space as their stage, and tracing what the boosters describe as a
family traveling through time, inspired by the Bible, ancient
mythology, William Blake and Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dome management, New Millennium Experience Co., has
countered objections to the high cost of the project with the
argument that it is not spending taxpayers' money. The largest
contribution, $650 million, comes from the proceeds of the national
lottery. Business sponsorship brought in $250 million, and the
remaining $320 million is expected from commercial revenue and
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been made on use of the dome once the year 2000
ends, but there will be permanent housing, transportation and
beautification gains along the River Thames in what had been a
neglected and largely derelict part of the shoreline. The dome's
creator is Richard Rogers, the noted British architect, whose
passion for restoring London's central waterway is such that when
he entered the House of Lords he chose the title Lord Rogers of
Riverside.

CHILEAN MILITARY NOW FACES RECKONING FOR ITS DARK PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet in London
a year ago has opened a quiet and long-postponed reckoning in Chile
over its years of dictatorship that is finally bringing former
military officers to task for the deaths or disappearances of
thousands of political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrest of Pinochet, the former dictator, 25 officers
have been arrested on charges of murder, torture and kidnapping,
including a member of one of the juntas that helped rule the
country for 17 years after 1973. And government officials privately
predict that a long list of generals and other officers once
thought untouchable will be arrested over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of arrests is unprecedented in this country, where
amnesty and avoidance have been used to grease a sometimes tenuous
transition to democracy since 1990. It results from a sea change in
the attitudes of Chilean judges and senior military officers that
came with the arrest of Pinochet on charges of crimes against
humanity last Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the general, a once-towering figure who dominated
Chile for two decades, and the embarrassing attention cast anew on
past tortures and disappearances have put conservative military
officers on the defensive and left them politically unable to block
the prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pinochet's repeated legal setbacks in trying
to avoid extradition to Spain, where the charges were brought
against him under international statutes, have encouraged more
moderate military officers to acknowledge publicly for the first
time that human rights abuses did indeed occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day of Pinochet's arrest last October marks a key point in
Chile's transition to democracy,'' said Pamela Pereira, a prominent
human rights lawyer. ``The army now understands it has a human
rights problem and that they have to do something about the
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 people were executed or disappeared during the
Pinochet dictatorship, and tens of thousands more were tortured or
forced into exile. Most were leaders and members of the Communist
and Socialist parties as well as other political and labor groups
that supported or took part in the government of the Socialist
president, Salvador Allende, which was overthrown in a military
coup supported by the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   But now a new generation of military leaders led by Gen. Ricardo
Izurieta, the army commander, have opened negotiations with human
rights lawyers that senior government officials say are likely to
establish, finally, the fates of many people who disappeared and
identify dozens of officers suspected of ordering their torture and
execution.
</P>
<P>
   While human rights activists are expressing almost giddy
pleasure, the shift has inspired surprisingly little excitement
among most Chileans. They appear to want to jettison their painful
political memories and to move forward to a more prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
   The leading presidential candidates make few comments on human
rights or Pinochet's fate, preferring to concentrate on economic
issues. But even military officials concede that a shift toward
accountability for past abuses is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma said in an interview last
week that a new attitude toward past abuses was emerging among the
military high command: ``You deal with it, or it will never go
away. You have to confront it _ that's the changed attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Vivanco, a Chilean lawyer who is executive director
of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, said, ``The recent
developments in the courts signify very important progress in human
rights in Chile that we never dreamed of before Pinochet's
arrest.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Recently, for instance, the Supreme Court upheld the indictment
of retired Gen. Humberto Gordon and Brig. Gen. Roberto Schmiedt for
the killing of a labor leader in 1982. Gordon was a member of the
four-man junta and chief of Pinochet's secret police, and his
arrest on Sept. 14 made him the highest-ranking military official
ever to be detained and prosecuted in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been bottled up in court for years by a judge close
to the military, which contended that the labor leader, Tucapel
Jimenez, had been stabbed to death by a carpenter. The carpenter
was later found with both wrists slashed in what was called a
suicide, although investigators said the gashes were too deep to
have been self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court reopened the case in March and replaced the
judge, who was found to be sitting on incriminating evidence. To
escape arrest earlier this month, Schmiedt tried to hide in an army
base but officers ordered him to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Senior government officials say that in the next few days
another former director of the secret police, retired Gen. Hugo
Salas Wenzel, along with his chief subordinate, Gen. Humberto Leiva
Gutierrez, will be arrested for ordering the killing of 12 Marxist
guerrillas in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and government officials point to a Supreme Court
decision in July as the most important jolt to the military's
traditional impunity _ one that has put pressure on the military
high command to go to the negotiating table with human rights
lawyers and religious leaders traditionally critical of the armed
forces to decide how best to account for the disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the Supreme Court upheld a decision by a lower
court that an amnesty declared by the former Pinochet regime to
protect military officers involved in political crimes committed
between the 1973 coup against Allende and March 1978 _ the period
in which the worst political violence took place _ was no longer
applicable to cases in which people disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that until the bodies of the victims were
accounted for, the crime committed was not murder but kidnapping _
meaning that the original crime was a continuing event that went
beyond the 1978 deadline. That creative departure from previous
decisions made by judges since Pinochet stepped down in 1990 has
opened the way for the prosecution of retired Gen. Sergio Arellano
Stark and four other army officers on kidnapping charges.
</P>
<P>
   The five officers are accused of forming a helicopter-borne
commando unit called the Caravan of Death that removed 75 political
prisoners from military jails in the month after the 1973 coup,
killed them and buried them in secret graves. The bodies of 56 of
the victims have been recovered, but 19 are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   The new Supreme Court interpretation could, at least
theoretically, leave Pinochet open to prosecution for ordering
disappearances. The general is currently awaiting the decision of a
London magistrates court, due on Oct. 8, on whether he can be
extradited to Spain to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   President Eduardo Frei has argued that the recent arrests prove
that the attempts of a Spanish judge to extradite and prosecute
Pinochet are unnecessary because he could now just as easily stand
trial in Chile. A senior Chilean judge has even sent him questions
about his involvement in various crimes and is awaiting a response
that could be used in a future trial.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists remain skeptical, however, in part
because no judge here has challenged the parliamentary immunity
against prosecution Pinochet has as a senator-for-life.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean government officials privately say that whether the
former dictator faces charges here or abroad could be an academic
question anyway since legal proceedings leading up to any trial
would take at least three years. With Pinochet nearing 84 and
ailing, they say, he would probably not live long enough to be
convicted anyway.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Court proceedings involving the recently arrested officers could
take many months or even years, and the lengths of any sentences
remain uncertain. It took heavy pressure from the United States
before former Gen. Manuel Contreras was convicted and imprisoned in
1995 on charges he was involved in the planning of the 1976
car-bomb murder of former Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and an
American assistant in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras was sentenced to a seven-year term in a prison
compound specially outfitted with unusual comforts like a
well-stocked bar, cellular telephone and personal computer with
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials say the military is finally losing its
impunity because of the emergence of a more liberal judiciary after
nine years of civilian presidential rule and the natural change of
military command that has yielded a younger, more modern senior
officer corps.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and other analysts credit Izurieta, who
took over from Pinochet as army commander in 1998, with quietly
beginning to nudge the military in a new direction even before the
former dictator was arrested.
</P>

   Senior government officials said Izurieta apparently did not
consult with Pinochet when in July 1998 he had the military hand
over to a judge a list of hundreds of former secret police agents
with their code names to aid an investigation into the 1987
killings of 12 guerrillas. The case had been stalled in the courts
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they say, Izurieta's policy of cautiously moving the
military to acknowledge past abuses as a way to clean up its image
is progressing with the military's talks with human rights lawyers
that began in August. Senior government officials say privately
that the talks would have been impossible before Pinochet's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A senior military official said the military hoped a compromise
could be reached in which ``an amnesty would be applied to all
cases before 1978 in exchange for all information we can acquire
for locating where the disappeared are buried.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say they are hopeful that even if the
guilty officers escape prosecution, at least the truth about
hundreds if not thousands of killings will finally be told.

   Executions in America are so routine and shielded from wide
public view nowadays that not many have noticed that, with three
months still to go in 1999, this is already the death penalty's
biggest year in nearly half a century _ 76 killers put to death in
18 states.
</P>
<P>
   Back when hangings were a gruesome public spectacle, people paid
more attention; they often turned out themselves to see the show _
Mark Twain included.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, even his eyewitness account of a celebrated 1868
hanging in the mining town of Virginia City, Nev., has been all but
overlooked since it was published in a Chicago newspaper more than
a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   It has now been rediscovered by Nevada's state archivist, Guy
Rocha, who was researching an obscure period of the early career of
Samuel Clemens: the humorist's second lecture tour through Nevada _
only the first one turned up in ``Roughing It'' _ just after his
trip to Europe and the Holy Land (which would yield ``The Innocents
Abroad'').
</P>
<P>
   Rocha knew that during this Nevada sojourn Twain, then 32, had
written for a number of newspapers to augment his income. He found
the articles stashed away in Twain archives at the Library of
Congress and the University of California at Berkeley. Among them
was a correspondent's ``letter'' to The Chicago Republican on a
variety of topics, including his account of the hanging _ which is
rarely even mentioned in Twain biographies, much less quoted. ``As
far as I know this letter, verbatim, has not been published in 131
years,'' said Rocha.
</P>
<P>
   He said the account sheds light on Twain's later public
opposition to capital punishment. It appears in the current issue
of Nevada Magazine and is reprinted here with its original
spellings and punctuation.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Context: The hanging took place on April
24, 1868, with 4,000 people on hand. The condemned was John Melanie
(or Millian), a Frenchman convicted of killing Julia Bulette, a
prostitute. She would soon achieve dime-store novel status in
Nevada as a fallen angel ``with a heart of gold.'' (There's not
much evidence of this, though she did support the local fire
department.) In his rambling article of May 30, Twain abruptly
changes subjects to tell of the hanging under the heading ``Novel
Entertainment'': (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But I am tired of talking about mines. I saw a man hanged the
other day, John Melanie, of France. He was the first man ever
hanged in this city (or country either), where the first twenty-six
graves in the cemetery were those of men who died by shots and
stabs.
</P>
<P>
   I never had witnessed an execution before, and did not believe I
could be present at this one without turning away my head at the
last moment. But I did not know what fascina(tion) there was about
the thing, then. I only went because I believed that if ever it
would be possible to see a man hanged, and derive satisfaction from
the spectacle, this was the time. For John Melanie was no common
murderer _ else he would have gone free. He was a heartless
assassin. A year ago, he secreted himself under the house of a
woman of the town who lived alone, and in the dead watches of the
night, he entered her room, knocked her senseless with a billet of
wood as she slept, and then strangled her with his fingers. He
carried off all her money, her watches, and every article of her
wearing apparel, and the next day, with quiet effrontery, put some
crape on his arm and walked in her funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward he secreted himself under the bed of another woman of
the town, and in the middle of the night was crawling out with a
slung-shot (makeshift blackjack) in one hand and a butcher knife in
the other, when the woman discovered him, alarmed the neighborhood
with her screams, and he retreated from the house. Melanie sold
dresses and jewelry here and there until some of the articles were
identified as belonging to the murdered courtezan. He was arrested
and then his later intended victim recognized him.
</P>
<P>
   After he was tried and condemned to death, he tried to curse and
swear at all who approached him, and he once grossly insulted some
young Sisters of Charity who came to minister kindly to his wants.
The morning of the execution, he joked with the barber, and told
him not to cut his throat _ he wanted the distinction of being
hanged.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man I wanted to see hung. I joined the appointed
physicians, so that I might be admitted within the charmed circle
and be close to Melanie. Now I never more shall be surprised at
anything. That assassin got out of the close carriage, and the
first thing his eye fell upon was that awful gallows towering above
a great sea of human heads, out yonder on the hillside _ and his
cheek never blanched, and never a muscle quivered! He strode firmly
away, and skipped gaily up to the steps of the gallows like a happy
girl. He looked around upon the people, calmly; he examined the
gallows with a critical eye, and with the pleased curiousity of a
man who sees for the first time a wonder he has often heard of. He
swallowed frequently, but there was no evidence of trepidation
about him _ and not the slightest stir of braggadocia whatever. He
prayed with the priest, and then drew out an abusive manuscript and
read from it in a clear, strong voice, without a quaver in it. It
was a broad, thin sheet of paper, and he held it apart in front of
him as he stood. If ever his hand trembled in even the slightest
degree, it never quivered that paper. I watched him at that
sickening moment when the sheriff was fitting the noose around his
neck, and pushing the knot this way and that to get it nicely
adjusted to the hollow under his ear _ and if they had been
measuring Melanie for a shirt, he could not have been more
perfectly serene. I never saw anything like that before. My own
suspense was almost unbearable _ my blood was leaping through my
veins, and my thoughts were crowding and trampling upon each other.
Twenty moments to live _ fifteen to live _ ten to live _ five _
four _ three _ heaven and earth, how the time galloped! _ and yet
that man stood there unmoved though he knew that the sheriff was
reaching deliberately for the drop while the black cap descended
over his quiet face! _ then down through the hole in the scaffold
the strap-bound figure shot like a dart! _ a dreadful shiver
started at the shoulders, violently convulsed the whole body all
the way down, and died away with a tense drawing of the toes
downward, like a doubled fist _ and all was over!
</P>
<P>
   I saw it all. I took exact note of every detail, even to
Melanie's considerately helping to fix the leather strap that bound
his legs together and his quiet removal of his slippers _ and I
never wish to see it again. I can see that stiff straight corpse
hanging there yet, with its black pillow-cased head turned rigidly
to one side, and the purple streaks creeping through the hands and
driving the fleshy hue of life before them. Ugh!

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Dr. Larry Norton tried to conduct a medical study to
determine, once and for all, whether bone marrow transplants could
really save the lives of women desperately ill with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts _ and those of dozens of other doctors _ were
largely futile. Year after year, few women were willing to
participate in the clinical tests, which, to be scientifically
valid, required patients to be randomly assigned to either the
experimental treatment or standard chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Many believed the experimental treatment was their only hope,
and were unwilling to leave anything to chance. So most chose to
get transplants from a growing number of hospitals and cancer
centers that are part of a multimillion dollar industry that sells
experimental treatments. There, for more than a decade, many women
were told that the procedure was the only thing that could save
their lives _ when, in fact, no one knew for sure whether it was
better or worse than the standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got so angry,'' Norton said. ``Fifty years from now, we will
look at this period with horror and say `How could this have
happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Norton, head of the division of solid tumor oncology at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he
understood why the women refused to join the study: Few patients,
faced with an advanced and likely fatal disease, would risk passing
up a supposedly cutting-edge treatment simply to advance scientific
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that tens of thousands of such personal decisions,
made under enormous emotional strain, are significantly slowing the
search for cures for dire diseases like cancer. The wide
availability of unproven procedures sops up the vast majority of
potential test subjects, they say, making it difficult, or
impossible, to assess which treatments work and which do not.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of untested treatments are being sold to
desperate patients with ailments like cancer, heart failure and
Parkinson's disease. Today, experimental procedures can be
purchased outright from community hospitals, university medical
centers and even from publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand the workings of this system, The New York
Times examined one of the most widely offered procedures _ bone
marrow transplants for solid tumor cancers like breast cancer. The
examination found that this procedure entered the medical
marketplace in the 1980s before studies to test its effectiveness
had even begun. By the time testing was under way, the business had
taken on a life of its own. Patients were unavailable and tests
were delayed for years or had to be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arises because medical procedures, like the bone
marrow transplants or new surgical techniques, are not regulated,
reflecting the government's usual reluctance to interfere with
doctors' practice of medicine. By contrast, federal rules require
that new drugs or devices like a heart valve be proven safe and
effective before being sold to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, of course, can voluntarily regulate themselves and
those in one tiny specialty, pediatric cancer, have done so. These
doctors have agreed to provide experimental procedures only to
patients who participate in valid research. In that specialty, new
ideas for treatments are rapidly tested, allowing them to be
adopted nationwide if they work, or tossed aside if they prove
useless. As a result, the advances in this field have been
phenomenal, far outracing anything seen in adult medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often people have access to therapies that are not
proven,'' said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer
Coalition, a patient group. ``As a result, we don't get enough
individuals to participate in the clinical trials, so it takes a
long time to get answers, or we never get answers.''
</P>
<P>
   In breast cancer, testing of bone marrow transplants took twice
as long as anyone expected. Throughout the 1990s, doctors and
hospitals reported to a national registry that about 15,000 women
had purchased bone marrow transplants for treatment of breast
cancer. Medical experts said that the voluntary reporting system
missed about half of the women who actually received the procedure.
Yet, while as many as 30,000 women had bone marrow transplants for
breast cancer, only 1,000 participated in the scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
   In ovarian cancer, it proved impossible to even conduct a trial
of bone marrow transplants. Doctors at more than 100 medical
institutions nationwide spent two and a half years seeking 285
women who would participate. They enlisted just 25. Last April,
researchers admitted defeat. The ovarian cancer trials collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors, like Dr. Maurie Markman, director of the Taussig
Cancer Center at the Cleveland Clinic, were unable to enroll a
single patient despite monumental efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy that we can't do a randomized trial in the
United States to answer this,'' Markman said. ``Unfortunately, if
someone says they can cure you and I say I can't, it is very
logical that people will drift to those who can give you hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who sell experimental procedures have a different view.
They say they are helping patients who have run out of options and
that researchers who are only focused on determining whether a
treatment works are out of touch with the needs of patients
suffering with a disease now.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not guinea pigs, this is not a fascist society,''
said Dr. William H. West, chairman of Response Oncology, a publicly
traded, for-profit company that sells the procedure. ``We are an
open marketplace, and that's true in clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   But other experts point out that the same arguments could be
made about drugs and medical devices. In those cases, the
government has decided that treatments must be proven safe and
effective before they are offered on a large scale. Abandoning that
standard for procedures, these experts said, is perilous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians must demand the same high standards of science for
new procedures as we do for new medicines,' said Dr. C. Warren
Olanow, professor and chairman of the department of neurology at
the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. ``The alternative
is uncontrolled human experimentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in bone marrow transplants, the uncertainty lives on,
tearing at women as they face the decision of whether to undergo
this difficult procedure. With so many years having passed since
the idea of bone marrow transplants first emerged, they struggle to
understand how a medical system so advanced could not yet answer a
question so basic: Does the treatment work?
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Porter, 44, who has breast cancer that has spread to
other parts of her body, is among those wondering. Seven years ago,
Mrs. Porter, of Imlay City, Mich., had a breast removed to combat
her cancer. She felt certain she had been cured. Then, recently she
learned the cancer was back, worse than ever. Figuring she would
take a gamble, she elected to have a bone marrow transplant two
weeks ago at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she arrived home. Now, she waits, wondering if the
experimental treatment she received will help her, and why medical
science still cannot answer that question for so many thousands of
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has got to be done,'' she said, ``So we don't have
to keep doing this.''

<P>
   The Procedure: Early Success Leads to Competition
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gabriel Hortobagyi was something of a rebel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, when the options for treating breast cancer were
limited, Hortobagyi was one of a handful who ventured into
uncharted territory: treating the cancer with a bone marrow
transplant. When the first patient appeared to do well, Hortobagyi
offered the procedure to another woman, and another.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy procedure. Known within the field as
high-dose chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplant or stem
cell rescue, the experimental treatment is based on a simple
concept: If a little chemotherapy killed some of the cancerous
cells in a woman's body, a lot might kill them all.
</P>
<P>
   So doctors remove some bone marrow or red blood cells from the
patient, then load her with huge amounts of toxic drugs, quantities
that destroy the bone marrow. The hope is that the high doses will
eliminate the cancer and that the saved bone marrow, when returned
to the body, will grow back quickly enough so that the patient does
not die from infection. A version of the procedure, using donations
of bone marrow, had long been established as effective for blood
cancer, but solely because the cancer was in the marrow that was
being replaced. The use of the treatment for breast cancer involved
a completely different _ and untested _ reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hortobagyi and a handful of other pioneers at
academic centers selected patients who were young and otherwise
healthy, they could not save some from the terrible effects of the
powerful anticancer drugs. Fifteen to 20 percent of the women in
those early days died from the harsh drugs alone; others had
permanent injuries, including hearing loss, nerve damage and heart
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The outlaws became heroes by the late 1980s, when they began
announcing what looked like amazing outcomes. The data were not
scientifically valid proof that the treatment worked _ each medical
center looked at less than a few dozen patients and had to infer
how they would have fared without a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   But the data appeared to make a startling point. Women with
advanced breast cancer who had had transplants experienced
remission rates of 50 to 60 percent. The general population of
women with advanced breast cancer who had received conventional
chemotherapy had remission rates of just 10 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who were involved got very, very excited,''
Hortobagyi said. ``We told our patients, `Look at the results we're
getting.'''
</P>
<P>
   The patients were not the only ones who looked. With the
apparent success of the bone marrow transplants, a new business had
been born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed so logical,'' Norton said. ``It started getting
accepted without clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Data from a voluntary registry, the Autologous Blood and Bone
Marrow Transplant Registry of North America, show the growth in the
popularity of this procedure. The registry, which records about
half of the bone marrow transplants in the United States, found
that 271 women with breast cancer had transplants in 1989. Two
years later the number had jumped to 749. By 1997 there were 2,853
bone marrow transplants for breast cancer reported.
</P>
<P>
   For-profit corporations offering bone marrow transplants emerged
by the late 1980s. Response Oncology, one of the first, started
offering the procedure in 1989 as part of what it called a
``clinical trials program.''
</P>
<P>
   That program involved only trials that gave everybody the
procedure and watched how they fared. These studies cannot be used
to demonstrate whether the procedure is any better than the
standard treatment, because there is no comparison group of similar
patients. Therefore, there is no way of knowing how the patients
would have fared with conventional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But the trials did help Response Oncology earn profits. West,
the chairman of the company, said the profit margin from bone
marrow transplants is 15 percent. All told, Response Oncology
brought in $128 million in revenue in 1998, largely from its cancer
centers providing bone marrow transplants.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, the company, based in Memphis, approached the
sale of the experimental procedure like any other business. It
undercut potential competitors on price, charging $80,000 per
transplant at a time when others were charging $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a very competitive force,'' West said. ``What
happened was a battle over the franchise _ who owns high-dose
chemotherapy?''
</P>
<P>
   Private hospitals also joined the fray. Institutions like a
hospital in Zion, Ill., owned by Cancer Treatment Centers of
America, advertise heavily for patients and even pay for patients
to travel there for the procedure. Hospitals associated with giant
for-profit chains, including the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. and
Tenet Healthcare, opened bone marrow transplant programs that
offered the treatment to women with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the academic medical centers _ even those trying to recruit
patients for clinical trials _ did not stand aside and let all the
profits go elsewhere. By the early 1990s virtually every major
medical center was offering bone marrow transplants for breast
cancer patients and a growing number of community hospitals were
offering them as well.
</P>
<P>
   At academic centers, bone marrow transplant programs quickly
became ``the cash cow for the cancer service,'' said Dr. William
McGuire, an ovarian cancer specialist at Mercy Medical Center in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors who provided transplants were rewarded with money
and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bone marrow transplanters are kings,'' said Dr. I. Craig
Henderson, a breast cancer expert at the University of California
at San Francisco. ``They usually get a higher salary, they usually
get more money. And more important, they have security and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Every entity offering the experimental procedure tried a
different sales pitch. Some promoted the prestige of their
institutions, others the convenience of their locations, others
their caring attitudes and patient support, and others, like
Response Oncology, their lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, with competition red hot, a new business spinoff emerged:
Doctors, hospitals and companies began selling bone marrow
transplants to patients with other types of tumors, like ovarian
and brain cancers. But if the breast cancer treatments were based
on a theory, these new uses were theories on a theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a technology based on a hypothesis,'' McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   Paying for the procedures turned out not to be a problem for
many patients: Their insurance companies ended up footing the bill.
The insurers at first refused, pointing out clauses in their
policies saying they would not pay for experimental procedures. But
under pressure from patients, doctors, lawyers and lawmakers, most
insurance companies gave in.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Rita Hartmann, a 60-year-old elementary school
teacher from Wooster, Ohio. When her ovarian cancer recurred, Mrs.
Hartmann and her husband agonized over what to do. Cancer Treatment
Centers of America told her she had a 30 percent chance of a cure
if she had a transplant, but her insurance company said it would
not pay. Mrs. Hartmann's husband wanted to mortgage their house,
sell all they owned to raise the money. But Mrs. Hartmann held
back. ``I said, `That's too traumatic,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she called a staff aide for her senator, Mike DeWine, a
Republican. The aide in turn reached Mrs. Hartmann's insurance
company. In addition, Mrs. Hartmann and 20 of her friends wrote
pleading letters to her insurer. Three months later, on Valentine's
Day last year, the company agreed to pay. Mrs. Hartmann had her
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Her cancer returned within nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from doctors and patient groups, Congress even
mandated in 1994 that insurers for federal employees pay for bone
marrow transplants for women with breast or ovarian cancer. Soon,
lobbied by doctors, hospitals and patient groups, about a dozen
states adopted their own mandates that the experimental procedure
be covered.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the rush to offer the treatment to more cancer patients
with solid tumors was the fact that the procedure still had not
been shown to work even for breast cancer, where it got its start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It evolved into a standard of care,'' said Dr. John Glick,
director of the Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
``It isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patients Rejecting Trials In Quest for a Cure
</P>
<P>
   The poison seeped through the catheter implanted in Deborah
Holmes' chest, slowly destroying cells throughout her body. The
bone marrow transplant was painful and experimental, but Ms. Holmes
believed it her only real hope of beating her ovarian cancer. With
it, the doctors performing the procedure assured her, she had a 30
percent chance of wiping out the malignancy; without it, they said,
she would probably die.
</P>
<P>
   After being assured that her insurance company would pick up the
$150,000 bill, Ms. Holmes traveled halfway across the country for
the treatment, from her home in Hamden, Conn., to the hospital in
Zion, Ill., operated by Cancer Treatment Centers of America. To Ms.
Holmes, it was worth the trip. ``There was so much hope there, so
much positive energy down to the nurses and the doctors,'' Ms.
Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   At Brown University in Rhode Island, a 90-minute drive from Ms.
Holmes' home, the mood was far less positive. Despite the happy
assurances of 30 percent cure rates at places like Cancer Treatment
Centers, researchers at the university knew the truth: No one could
say whether this procedure worked for ovarian cancer patients like
Ms. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was part of a consortium of institutions scouring the
nation for just 285 women with ovarian cancer to participate in
research to determine whether bone marrow transplants prolonged
lives. But with so many desperate patients like Ms. Holmes flying
anywhere to get the experimental treatment, finding test subjects
was almost impossible. On April 25, after two years of trying to
enroll women, researchers admitted defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Holmes, unaware of the national clinical trial, believed
what Cancer Treatment Centers of America had told her _ that
transplants could cure women like herself. When her cancer returned
last November, five months after her transplant, Ms. Holmes said
she guessed she was just one of the unlucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   She died on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the ovarian cancer trials underscores the
problems with the current system for selling unproven medical
procedures. Even though there may be plenty of patients eligible to
join such studies, they may be unwilling to participate when they
can obtain the procedure elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer clinical trials had begun several years before, in
1990, but struggled to find patients. There were two national
trials: one for women whose breast cancer had spread throughout
their bodies and another for women whose cancer had spread to at
least 10 of the lymph nodes under their arms. Researchers expected
it would take about three years to enroll about 1,000 women in the
two studies. Instead it took seven years. For every 10 women who
could have been in a clinical trial, one actually enrolled, Norton
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not so surprising, Henderson said. Patients in the
clinical trials must sign a consent form spelling out their grim
prognosis and stating that there is no evidence that bone marrow
transplants are any better than the standard therapies.
</P>
<P>
   To enter the trial, he said, ``you have to face these realities,
which is never easy.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the patient has a transplant outside a trial with a
control group of patients, known as a randomized trial,
enthusiastic doctors may tell her that a transplant could save her
life. Although patients ``have a right to the truth,'' Henderson
said, they understandably ``are not going to go to doctors who take
away hope''
</P>
<P>
   Medical centers had to make a choice: Offer only the randomized
clinical trials _ and watch patients leave in droves _ or offer
bone marrow transplants outside the randomized trials for those who
would not participate in the research studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew L. Pecora, chief of the adult blood and marrow stem
cell transplant program at Hackensack University Medical Center in
New Jersey, gave women an option of having a transplant outside a
randomized trial. ``I offered the clinical trial to every
patient,'' he said. ``But I did not force them to do it.'' Few
entered the trial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Norton refused to provide transplants outside the trial. His
patients went elsewhere. ``I was disheartened but I wasn't
surprised,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the business was booming and the trials staggering,
Hortobagyi, one of the pioneers who had helped get transplants
started, was having second thoughts. Those initial stunning results
he and others had reported were with carefully selected patients
younger than 60 and otherwise healthy _ no heart disease, no
emphysema, nothing that might make the high doses of drugs even
more risky.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers had compared their outcomes with the outcomes
with conventional chemotherapy for all women with advanced breast
cancer, even though most breast cancer patients were older and
sicker than those who had transplants. Hortobagyi decided to go
back and compare the outcomes in the women who had transplants with
those of women who were just as young and healthy but who had
conventional chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The women, he discovered, did just as well when they had
conventional chemotherapy. The women he had provided with
transplants did not survive in greater numbers because of the
procedure. They survived because they were healthier to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard fact to face.
</P>
<P>
   In promoting transplants, ``we deceived ourselves and we
deceived our patients,'' Hortobagyi said. ``We oversold it.''
</P>
<P>
   But that realization came too late.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Future: Dismay as Results Prove Disappointing
</P>
<P>
   Last May 17 a crowd of breast cancer specialists filled a
conference room half the size of a football field at the Georgia
World Congress Center in Atlanta. Those who came too late to get
seats spilled into two smaller rooms nearby with closed circuit
television screens. Few at the annual meeting of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology wanted to miss this moment when the
leaders in their field would present the long-awaited data from
clinical trials of bone marrow transplants for women with advanced
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Five studies had been completed _ two large clinical trials from
the United States, two large trials from Europe, and a small one
involving 154 women from South Africa. In all, about 2,000 women
had been randomly assigned to have the experimental procedure or
conventional chemotherapy and enough time had elapsed to ask if the
women who had transplants lived longer than those who did not have
them.
</P>
<P>
   The results were not the triumph that many had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   In four of the five clinical trials, there was no difference in
survival between women who had transplants and those who had
conventional therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the South African study did the women who received bone
marrow transplants outlive the patients in the group who received
standard therapy. But on closer inspection of the data, even that
success seemed suspect: The women who had transplants lived about
as long as the women in the other studies. But the women who had
conventional chemotherapy in the South African study did far worse.
The results did not indicate that transplants improved survival,
but that the outcomes for the control group were poor.
</P>
<P>
   No one on the podium that day claimed that the studies showed
that transplants were a triumph. Indeed, the trials' failure to
show the expected benefits of transplants gave rise to a troubling
question: When the best available data provided no evidence that
bone marrow transplants were any better than conventional
chemotherapy, should transplants continue to be promoted and sold?
</P>
<P>
   For the National Breast Cancer Coalition, which represents
cancer patients, the data spoke for themselves: Bone marrow
transplants had been tested and had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anybody look at these data and think this is something
we should continue doing or that they are inconclusive?'' asked Ms.
Visco, the coalition's president. The group put out a news release
saying, ``It is time to move beyond the infrastructure'' created
around transplants.
</P>
<P>
   But cancer specialists were less definitive. Many said they
still saw promise in transplants, arguing that it was too soon to
say for sure that the procedure offered no benefits. They urged
that nothing change for the time being while the women in the
studies were followed for longer periods to see if those who had
transplants eventually did better. They also said that chemotherapy
had improved over the last decade and because the studies used
older drugs, it remained possible that bone marrow transplants with
new drugs might be better than conventional chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting these views, the American Society of Clinical
Oncologists put out a news release saying that the papers presented
at the meeting ``report mixed early results'' and that more years
of study are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen S. Lichter, the departing president of the society and
dean of the University of Michigan Medical School, urged that
nothing change for the time being while new studies get under way
and the women in the initial studies continue to be followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a nontransplanter and a keen observer of this research, I
don't think there is enough information to say it should die,''
Lichter said. He also said that because not every woman is eligible
for a clinical trial or has ready access to one, transplants should
still be available outside trials. ``I for one am not ready to say
that this should only be done in a clinical trial,'' Lichter said.
</P>
<P>
   West of Response Oncology said his company intended to keep
selling transplants. Calls to stop offering them are ``an
oversimplification,'' he said, because the trials were not
definitive. More trials and years of further study are needed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, he said, critics are missing the point. What matters,
he said, is not whether the treatment has been shown to work but
whether studies are producing more knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say there was only one important question and you
didn't answer that one,'' West said. ``I know you want to think of
it as a drug that either works or doesn't. I think of it more as a
platform that needs to be modified and studied.''
</P>
<P>
   So now oncologists and companies say they will press ahead,
continuing to sell a painful, expensive procedure that the best
available science says is no improvement over standard care, which
is less traumatic. Some patient advocates and doctors find this a
troubling abandonment of the rigors of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with oncologists who say, `We really
have to do something for these patients, they are facing a terribly
short future,''' said Dr. Alan Garber, a professor of medicine at
Stanford University. ``The problem is when they start to do things
that have been tested and have not proven effective. Then you are
leaving the arena of science and going into blind faith.''

<P>
   There is perhaps no more unsettling noise in medicine than the
sound of infertility specialists tinkering with the biological
clock. Witness the ethical uproar over their latest technological
triumph, the apparent reversal of menopause in a 30-year-old
ballerina who suffered from ovarian cysts. Doctors removed her
remaining ovary, froze the tissue, and, two years later,
reimplanted it. Now, they say, she is producing eggs again.
</P>
<P>
   The ballerina story follows the same plot line as every other
tale of modern baby-making, a genre that began in 1978 with the
birth of the first test-tube baby, Louise Brown. The drama
typically unfolds as follows: Whiz-bang scientists develop new
technique (in vitro fertilization, donated eggs, frozen eggs,
frozen ovaries) that makes it possible for childless woman
(subtext:  &UR; old &LR;  childless woman) to conceive. Media circus ensues.
Ethicists ponder potential abuse. Media circus subsides. Family
life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most remarkable thing about the supposed end of the
biological clock may be just how unrevolutionary the reproductive
revolution has been. It has, of course, created legal and ethical
quandaries King Solomon could never have envisioned, like who gets
custody of the frozen embryos when the couple gets divorced? And
it's true that parents' night at some preschools are beginning to
resemble grandparents' night. But as Barbara Katz Rothman, a
sociologist at City University of New York, says, babies still wet
their diapers. ``Kids still need help with their math homework. And
the social order has not particularly changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more people have babies the old-fashioned way. In 1997, the
most recent year for which statistics are available, 24,582 babies
were born in the United States as a result of in vitro
fertilization, which accounts for most births through assisted
reproductive technology. That is six-tenths of one percent of the
nearly 3.9 million babies born that year. Among 45- to
49-year-olds, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics, the birth rate was four babies for every 10,000 women.
That is less than the rate in 1970, when it was five babies per
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Why then, does the technology provoke such a visceral reaction?
Scientists who stave off death are cheered on, but decried when
they try to create new life. Certainly, the new technology raises
the prospect of redefining sacrosanct notions of motherhood, work
and family, and re-drawing old images of fertility and youth. It
also raises a double standard; the idea of older mothers seems much
more problematic than the reality of older fathers, perhaps because
older fatherhood doesn't necessarily require tinkering with nature.
The biological clock has always been predicated on the cold,
scientific fact that a woman's eggs deteriorate as she ages.
Science has not yet put the clock out of business, but it could,
and that's what gets some people nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Already, egg donation, in which a patient conceives with another
woman's eggs, has made it possible for women _ at least those who
can afford the steep fees _ to spend more time building a career,
or looking for the right mate, before having children. It has also
made fatherhood possible for gay men, using egg donors and
surrogate mothers, to have families.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of egg freezing is even more sweeping. Imagine an
18-year-old girl banking her eggs. She could finish college,
medical school, train in a specialty and start a practice before
settling down to have a family with her own, younger and presumably
healthier eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are developing the potential to redefine some of the most
basic elements of human life,'' said Kevin Wildes, who teaches
medical ethics at Georgetown University. ``All kinds of couples who
could not have children before can have them now. We just have no
way to think about this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is over-analyzed, and science-fictionalized. Last
week, 3,700 doctors and researchers attended the annual meeting of
the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Toronto. More
than 1,000 papers were presented. Only the ovary story, about an
Arizona woman, made news.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that, at 30, the patient is five years younger than
the current cutoff for ``advanced maternal age'' or that she is not
pregnant. Never mind that the procedure is meant to preserve
ovarian function in cancer patients who face infertility as a side
effect of chemotherapy, and that transplanting ovaries from one
woman to another probably isn't feasible now because of organ
rejection. The mere flicker of the idea that lost fertility might
someday be restored was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the old backlash of `This is God's will that this
couple is infertile,''' said Pamela Madsen, the mother of two boys
by in vitro fertilization and head of the American Infertility
Association, a New York advocacy group. ``We don't say this about
any other disease. No one says to a woman with breast cancer that
this is God's will. We say, `Let me find you the best doctor in the
world. I heard about this new technique; it's experimental. Let's
try it.'''

   Far more people have babies the old-fashioned way. In 1997, the
most recent year for which statistics are available, 24,582 babies
were born in the United States as a result of in vitro
fertilization, which accounts for most births through assisted
reproductive technology. That is six-tenths of one percent of the
nearly 3.9 million babies born that year. Among 45- to
49-year-olds, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics, the birth rate was four babies for every 10,000 women.
That is less than the rate in 1970, when it was five babies per
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Why then, does the technology provoke such a visceral reaction?
Scientists who stave off death are cheered on, but decried when
they try to create new life. Certainly, the new technology raises
the prospect of redefining sacrosanct notions of motherhood, work
and family, and re-drawing old images of fertility and youth. It
also raises a double standard; the idea of older mothers seems much
more problematic than the reality of older fathers, perhaps because
older fatherhood doesn't necessarily require tinkering with nature.
The biological clock has always been predicated on the cold,
scientific fact that a woman's eggs deteriorate as she ages.
Science has not yet put the clock out of business, but it could,
and that's what gets some people nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Already, egg donation, in which a patient conceives with another
woman's eggs, has made it possible for women _ at least those who
can afford the steep fees _ to spend more time building a career,
or looking for the right mate, before having children. It has also
made fatherhood possible for gay men, using egg donors and
surrogate mothers, to have families.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of egg freezing is even more sweeping. Imagine an
18-year-old girl banking her eggs. She could finish college,
medical school, train in a specialty and start a practice before
settling down to have a family with her own, younger and presumably
healthier eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are developing the potential to redefine some of the most
basic elements of human life,'' said Kevin Wildes, who teaches
medical ethics at Georgetown University. ``All kinds of couples who
could not have children before can have them now. We just have no
way to think about this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is over-analyzed, and science-fictionalized. Last
week, 3,700 doctors and researchers attended the annual meeting of
the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Toronto. More
than 1,000 papers were presented. Only the ovary story, about an
Arizona woman, made news.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that, at 30, the patient is five years younger than
the current cutoff for ``advanced maternal age'' or that she is not
pregnant. Never mind that the procedure is meant to preserve
ovarian function in cancer patients who face infertility as a side
effect of chemotherapy, and that transplanting ovaries from one
woman to another probably isn't feasible now because of organ
rejection. The mere flicker of the idea that lost fertility might
someday be restored was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the old backlash of `This is God's will that this
couple is infertile,''' said Pamela Madsen, the mother of two boys
by in vitro fertilization and head of the American Infertility
Association, a New York advocacy group. ``We don't say this about
any other disease. No one says to a woman with breast cancer that
this is God's will. We say, `Let me find you the best doctor in the
world. I heard about this new technique; it's experimental. Let's
try it.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Infertility doctors also invoke the metaphor of disease. ``We
try to facilitate nature and to correct what is abnormal,'' said
Dr. Zev Rosenwaks of Cornell University. ``It is no different than
the doctor who treats diabetes with insulin.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some doctors are conflicted. As they push back the age at
which women can conceive, some worry they are sending a dangerous
message to would-be mothers: that they can wait to have children
because technology will be there to save them when they are ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it my `Connie Chung campaign,''' said Dr. Maria
Bustillo, referring to the newscaster's much publicized 1990
announcement that, at age 44, she was cutting back on work to
pursue ``a very aggressive approach to having a baby.'' In the
United States, said Bustillo, 2.4 million couples experience
infertility that has nothing to do with eggs that deteriorate
because of age. ``We should be using this technology to help the
truly infertile,'' she said, ``not just people who are infertile
because they are 45.''
</P>
<P>
   And the truth is that treating infertility is indeed different
than treating diabetes. When a doctor treats a diabetic, the
treatment ends with the patient, says Dr. Paul Root Wolpe, a fellow
at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics. When a
doctor treats an infertile woman, he said, the treatment ``will
affect future generations, and that is what evokes the greatest
fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering with reproduction, of course, is not entirely new. The
first successful artificial insemination was reported in 1790,
according to the reproductive society, although it did not become
common until the 1960s, when doctors learned how to freeze sperm.
There was little outcry at that time, Wolpe said, in contrast to
the current furor over egg donation, where questions have been
raised about everything from what to tell the children to whether
the donors are being overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   This gender gap has long characterized the public discussion
over babies conceived in the lab. Two years ago, when a 63-year-old
woman gave birth through egg donation, people expressed shock, and
complained it was unfair to the child. When the actor Tony Randall
became a father at age 77, most people looked on with bemused
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to envision the ways that infertility research might
operate as a great technological force for women's liberation. But
some argue that scientific baby-making can be as much of a trap for
women as it is a path to reproductive freedom. When there was
little recourse for infertility, women were forced to mourn that
loss and then make other choices, whether adoption or
childlessness. Now, modern medicine, with its boundless
opportunity, makes what the psychologists call ``closure''
virtually impossible. As infertility specialists continue to refine
their techniques, some patients feel pressure to keep trying, no
matter how slim the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always another specialist, another procedure, another
technique,'' said Hilary Hanafin, a psychologist at the Center for
Surrogate Parenting and Egg Donation in Beverly Hills, Calif. ``I
had a woman come in the other day, she's 53. She spent 10 years and
$100,000 on things that did not work.''
</P>
<P>
   The real challenge for women may be one that feminist author
Betty Friedan posed last year. On the one hand, Ms. Friedan said,
it's wonderful that science has offered women the flexibility to
alter the seasons of their lives. ``On the other hand,'' she mused,
``somehow I don't think it's cutting edge. It still assumes that
the major defining value for women is the having of children. If we
are going to have, as the statistics indicate, a good 80-year-life
span, is the only thing to do with those new years of life the
things you did when you were younger?''

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ This is a nation that prides itself
on casting aside old labels. The ``Europeans only'' signs hang in
museums now. Blacks and whites rub shoulders in the formerly
segregated halls of Parliament. Five years ago, South Africa
formally set aside the old notions of apartheid. Ever since, it has
proclaimed a rainbow identity and officially celebrated all people
as fellow citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a bespectacled white man stood up and declared: ``I am an
African.''
</P>
<P>
   And members of the intellectual community here gasped.
</P>
<P>
   When Max du Preez, a journalist, used his column to plead for
full identification with the black majority last summer, some
blacks raged that whites _ with their long history of oppressing
black Africans _ have no right to claim the title ``African''
(which, under apartheid, had been a synonym for black). Some whites
wondered why a white guy would even want the title. And soon the
heated debate exposed the anxieties over old labels and new
identities that still simmer in this changing society.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the death of apartheid, some people are still
struggling to redefine themselves and their roles here. And as the
debate burns on, some are finding that old classifications fade
slowly from the hearts and minds, the politics and economics of the
new South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from the white left,'' explains du Preez, who crusaded
against apartheid only to find himself unsure of his place in a
country where most leading actors proudly identify themselves as
black and African. ``I put myself on the side of democracy, on the
side of the majority. But now, I fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be accepted in this nation, to be part of this
celebration of democracy, this so-called rainbow nation,'' he said
in an interview. ``If people say you're not an African, that means
you're a European. That makes you a visitor. I do not want to be a
visitor. I do not want to be a moneyed, separate white person. My
family has been here for 11 generations. And I have a need to
belong, very, very deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he wants the very word used by apartheid to
divide this society to be turned on its head to define a new,
nonracial unity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, which continues on radio talk-shows, in newspaper
columns and letters to editors, is far from settled, and it still
rings loudest in the ivory towers of this society. While their Boer
ancestors had called their own language Afrikaans, for instance,
there seems to be no rush among ordinary whites to reclassify
themselves as ``African,''
</P>
<P>
   A search for identity resonates in different places, in
different ways, among other minority groups around the world _
among the ethnic Russians in Kazakhstan, the Muslims in India, the
Arabs in Israel. But the issue plays out with a special kind of
pain in South Africa. Here, even the liberal whites who embrace an
African identity typically hail from a wealthy elite that
disparaged Africans and African-ness and benefited from a racial
ideology that forced blacks to the lowest rungs of society.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot remains, in the ordinary pattern of life here, that
gets in the way of seeing across racial lines. Government
bureaucracies still categorize individuals as white, colored, Asian
and African for purposes of counting and integrating the
population. And while skin color no longer determines where you can
dine, it still largely determines which political party you vote
for, which neighborhood you live in, and whether you have a job or
electricity or indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Only 27.3 percent of blacks, for example, have running water in
their homes as compared to 96 percent of whites, according to
census figures. And unemployment, which stands at nearly 40 percent
among blacks, is virtually nonexistent for whites at 4 percent.
Meanwhile, many whites have come to feel crowded out and
unsatisfied in the new South Africa, as crime rises and their
political power ebbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pigmentation in South Africa, even after 1994, is not just a
little detail,'' said Khehla Shubane, a research officer at the
Center for Policy Studies. ``The life chances of a person are
determined to a very good extent depending on where a person is in
the racial hierarchy. And at the bottom, you still find Africans.
At the top, you still find whites.''
</P>
<P>
   Shubane, who is black, said he applauded whites who participated
in the liberation struggle and embraced them as fellow South
Africans. But within the broader national identity, he said,
individual identities remain: Whites and Africans are among them,
separate and distinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't share my ancestors, my culture, my history, my
language or my religion,'' said Thobeka Mda, an education professor
at the University of South Africa, who fired off an angry column in
response to du Preez's. Both columns ran in The Star. ``This
African-ness, it's only a land thing, a way of claiming the right
to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Mulholland, a white journalist who waded into the fray
two weeks ago, said blacks could keep the African label; he has no
need of it. ``I am a South African,'' he wrote in The Sunday Times.
``My citizenship and residency do not require me to have
continental or racial loyalties.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jakkie Cilliers, a white military expert who considers
himself African, said South Africa will only become a nonracial
society when whites and blacks learn to see each other and to
accept each other as people, as fellow Africans, regardless of
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South African transformation is not just a change in
government, it is a transformation of the whole society and how we
view ourselves,'' said Cilliers, who runs the Institute for
Security Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under apartheid, we whites convinced ourselves for years that
we were an extension of Europe,'' he said. ``But we aren't. And
that's why I don't like black South Africans calling themselves
Africans. Because I am also African.''
</P>
<P>
   And some blacks agree.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Mankahlana, a spokesman for President Thabo Mbeki, says
skin color is not the crucial issue. True Africans _ black and
white _ are easy to find, he says: They are the people working for
a better society. And that means, he says, giving the debate yet
another twist, that some blacks are not truly African.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were asked to choose between Max du Preez or Mobutu as a
fellow African, who do you think I would choose?'' asked
Mankahlana, referring to Mobutu Sese Seko, the former president of
Zaire who was noted for his abusive rule. ``Definitely it's Max du
Preez.''

   The idea that grandparents have a right to see their
grandchildren, even after their son has died or divorced the
child's mother, has a lot of sentimental appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But legally, the question of which third parties should have
visitation rights, even against a parent's will, is not so simple.
</P>
<P>
   Should a man who helped raise his lover's son for all the years
he lived with her have the right to keep seeing the boy even after
the mother's new husband adopts him?
</P>
<P>
   Do a man's parents and siblings have the right to maintain a
relationship with his child, born by artificial insemination, after
the man and his mother-in-law shoot each other in a gunfight?
</P>
<P>
   These are among the real Washington state cases in which
visitation rights were awarded and appealed under a law adopted in
1972 opening such privileges not just to grandparents, but also to
unspecified third parties. Last week, in a case that is being
closely watched by family-law experts, the U.S. Supreme Court
agreed to consider the constitutionality of the Washington law.
</P>
<P>
   As society's sense of what makes a family has shifted, and the
possibilities of child-bearing and child-rearing become more fluid,
courts across the nation are being asked to balance parents' rights
to autonomy against the claims of others seeking an ongoing
connection with their children.
</P>
<P>
   The laws have expanded dramatically since the 1970s, when the
issue was framed around a Norman Rockwell-ish view of grandparents'
rights: Almost every state responded to grandparents' advocates
lobbying for laws that would protect their ability to visit their
grandchildren after their children's marriage ended through death
or divorce _ and, in some states, even when the married children
just wanted to keep the grandparents and grandchildren apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``While conservatives generally support parents' rights, this is
one area where they favored grandparents over parents, because of
lot of this came in the context of grandparents who thought their
hippie children were behaving badly and raising their children in a
disorderly way,'' said Carol Sanger, a family law professor at
Columbia University's law school.
</P>
<P>
   The movement to give third parties visitation rights was also
fed by a growing acceptance of the idea of the ``psychological
parent'' _ the adult, not necessarily a biological parent, to whom
the child is most securely attached.
</P>
<P>
   These days, there are all kinds of people clinging to
relationships with children they have loved and cared for, without
any biological tie: widowed stepparents who spent years raising a
spouse's child, gay parents who have split up with their former
partners, and former live-in lovers. There are also a handful of
cases brought by would-be adoptive parents who were forced to give
up babies they were raising when a biological parent reclaimed
them.
</P>
<P>
   The case the high court will hear grew out of the claims of Gary
and Jennifer Troxel, who won the right to spend one weekend each
month with their two young granddaughters after their son, Brad,
committed suicide in 1993. The girls' mother, Tommie Wynn, now
married to a man who has adopted the girls, did let the Troxels see
their grandchildren from time to time, but opposed court-ordered
visitation as a violation of her authority over the girls' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Her appeal was joined in the state Supreme Court with the two
other cases cited above.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with those cases, the state supreme court declared
the law unconstitutional, ruling that it violated parents' rights
to privacy and liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks they're acting in the best interests of the
child, but it really should be the parent who decides what's best
for the child, except where the court sees some harm to the child
if the contact is stopped with a strong psychological parent,''
said Catherine Wright Smith, the lawyer for two of the three
mothers who appealed the visitation orders to the Washington state
Supreme Court. ``But that's rare, and in the more common cases, I
don't think grandparents' desire for contact is a good enough legal
reason for the government to interfere with a parent's
child-rearing.''
</P>
<P>
   While most legal experts were shocked that the Supreme Court has
ventured into such a messy area of law and family life, many are
hoping that the case will set forth useful guidelines for how this
kind of dispute should be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view is that whatever the rule is, it ought to apply to
all families, that we shouldn't give the married, two-parent family
living with their children any protection from state intervention
that we wouldn't give to a single mother who is divorced, widowed,
or never married,'' said Nancy Polikoff, a family law professor at
American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional realities of third-party rights are complicated.
Many family law experts say the law should reflect, and respect,
the variety of nontraditional families that now raise many
children. But, they caution, there should also be some way to make
sure that children will not be dragged into unnecessary litigation,
torn between two sets of people they love.
</P>
<P>
   The politics are complicated, too. In California, when
gay-rights advocates sought legislation that would let gay and
lesbian parents win visitation of children they had helped raise,
by opening visitation rights to anyone who had lived with a child
for a significant time period, the effort was blocked by advocates
for battered women, who argued that such a law would force many
mothers who had fled abusive boyfriends to share their children
with those batterers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington law, giving any third party the right to seek
visitation, is too broad, and really does intrude on parents'
rights to raise their children as they want to,'' said Ms.
Polikoff. ``But I also think there has to be some way to recognize
the rights of people who function as parents, but who don't have
the legal status of parents. These are hard questions.''

CANDIDATE BRADLEY REACHES INTO HIS BASKETBALL PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES DAO and DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For most of his nearly 40 years in the limelight,
Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator and basketball star,
regarded celebrity _ his own, in particular _ with a gimlet eye.
Once asked if too much fame inevitably ruined the famous, he
replied, ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his tightening race for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Bradley, 56, has decided to exploit his Hall of Fame
career to the hilt, recruiting a host of basketball greats to help
him raise money and remind a younger generation that this balding,
slightly potbellied candidate once had a velvety jump shot of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill was not blessed as a player with phenomenal physical
skills,'' said Bill Walton, the former Portland Trailblazer who
recently introduced Bradley at a breakfast in La Jolla, Calif.,
that raised $150,000. ``He was a guy who could always outthink the
opposition. And that's why he will win.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 14, Bradley's campaign is planning to hold a huge
afternoon fund-raiser at Madison Square Garden, where Bradley
played for 10 years as a New York Knick, that will feature a raft
of basketball legends, including Jerry West, John Havlicek, Willis
Reed, Julius Erving, Bill Russell and Isiah Thomas. The event,
where the most generous contributors will most likely be invited to
shoot against the stars, could raise $1 million, Bradley's aides
say.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, the campaign is planning a similar
fund-raiser in Los Angeles, where it is counting on another cast of
Hall of Fame players to help garner a similar amount.
</P>
<P>
   Raising money is just part of the Bradley campaign's efforts to
use sports and sports stars to burnish his image, particularly
among voters who do not follow politics closely. And the
culminating event of that strategy may be recruiting the assistance
of Michael Jordan, who has quietly pledged to support Bradley,
possibly through appearances, fund raising or a commercial. Jordan
and his wife, Juanita, have each contributed $1,000 to Bradley's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is willing to help Bill,'' said Phil Jackson, a close
friend of Bradley's who coached Jordan to six world championships
with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to quantify how much professional athletes have
helped raise for Bradley, and much of his money comes from people
outside sports.
</P>
<P>
   But one Chicago event alone, called Hoopla, where contributors
were allowed to shoot against former All Stars, raised $350,000 in
July. Several former players and coaches, including Jackson, Billy
Cunningham of the Philadelphia 76ers, Calvin Hill of the Dallas
Cowboys, Dean Smith of the University of North Carolina and Dave
DeBusschere, a former Knicks teammate of Bradley's, have also been
featured speakers at events that raised several million dollars.
And many other athletes have contributed money or called friends
and business acquaintances on behalf of the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking to people on my own, unbeknownst to the
campaign,'' said Oscar Robertson, whom Bradley once called ``the
perfect player.'' Asked why he supported Bradley, Robertson said,
``He's an honorable person who handles himself well under
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley fund-raising network now extends well beyond his
former basketball colleagues. Abe Pollin, owner of the Washington
Wizards basketball team, is one of his fund-raisers. So is John
Moores, chairman of the San Diego Padres baseball team. Moores is
part of a group that has raised more than $500,000 for Bradley in
the San Diego area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If sports is all we were about, it wouldn't bring people
out,'' said Moores, who met Bradley through another Padres
executive, Larry Lucchino, who played basketball with Bradley at
Princeton. ``But it helps the story. It's another difficult area at
which he excelled.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the fund-raising race, Bradley has pulled slightly ahead of
his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, having raised $6.7
million in the last quarter to Gore's $6.5 million. Bradley, who
was called Dollar Bill by his Knicks teammates because of his
reputation for frugality, also has slightly more in the bank than
Gore because his campaign has spent less.
</P>
<P>
   But fund raising is just part of a broader effort by Bradley,
who played for the Knicks from 1968 through 1977, to weave
basketball into the daily fabric of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At rallies, his aides distribute autographed basketballs.
Bradley also recently published a book, ``Values of the Game,''
describing lessons that he learned playing basketball, like
courage, leadership and teamwork, which just happen to be central
themes of his campaign. And his stump speeches are peppered with
anecdotes, jokes and morality tales from his hardwood days.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To a group of union workers in Oakland, Calif., he recounted
serving as the Knicks representative to the players union and
negotiating to get longer beds for his tall teammates. At an event
in Harlem, he could point to a former Knick teammate, Dean
Meminger, in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   And to voters everywhere, he pokes fun at politicians' vanity by
describing how, after he helped the United States win an Olympic
gold medal in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson refused to be
photographed with him because Bradley, at 6-foot-5, was 2 inches
taller.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As with all politicians, Bradley uses such stories to help him
connect with audiences. But basketball serves a deeper purpose as
well. By talking about the game, Bradley, who represented New
Jersey for 18 years in the Senate, is also telling voters that he
had a career before politics and is not a Washington insider, as he
describes Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Often it works. ``I like Bradley,'' said Len Larson, 53, a
building contractor in Manchester, N.H. ``Maybe it's because he's a
basketball player. Or maybe it's because he's not hooked up with
the Clinton administration.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By telling stories about the stars he once played with and
against, Bradley is also able to remind people that he was a very
good player _ an All-American, Olympian and two-time NBA champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports plays a special role in our society,'' said Bob Teeter,
a Republican pollster. ``There are probably more people, if you
asked them, who would say they would rather be sports stars than
actors or other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls in New Hampshire and New York, which show Bradley
neck-and-neck with Gore, or even slightly ahead, also indicate that
Bradley is doing well among men, which pollsters and political
strategists say may be largely a reflection of their fond memories
of his talent and intense work ethic as a Knick.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides say that his stardom is not enough to get people
to give him their votes or their money. But they acknowledge that
it does help draw people to his rallies who might not normally be
interested in politics. So does having former NBA stars speak at
his fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people know who all these old stars are,'' said Rick
Wright, Bradley's financial chairman. ``The legends really appeal
to all age groups.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of Bradley's using his sports connections as a
campaign weapon is that he has long been ambivalent about his
celebrity. Lionized as the nation's greatest collegiate player
while at Princeton and celebrated in an article in The New Yorker,
John McPhee's ``A Sense of Where You Are,'' when he was 21, Bradley
considered quitting basketball after college because he felt fans'
expectations had become hopelessly high.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two years at Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, he
signed a four-year contract with the Knicks worth $500,000, making
him the league's highest paid player. But he refused endorsements,
saying they demeaned and commercialized the game.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, he struggled at first, and felt the wrath of angry
fans, whose catcalls deeply hurt him. Years later, after getting
elected to the Senate in 1978, he again fretted that once-adoring
fans would expect his speeches to dazzle just because his jump shot
once did. ``When those magic moments don't materialize, they feel
double let down,'' Bradley wrote in his 1996 memoir, ``Time
Present, Time Past.''
</P>
<P>
   In his early years in the Senate, Bradley avoided playing in
congressional pickup games. But he understood the political value
of basketball and started playing with House members when he was
lobbying for his tax reform bill of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that he and others friends had to coax Bradley into
using basketball on this campaign. ``We kind of encouraged him that
it was a relating point to reach back to his past history,''
Jackson said. ``It is a way to relate to a generation that did not
see him play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who played with Bradley on the Knicks, is the new coach
of the Los Angeles Lakers, the Knicks' archrivals of the 1970s.
(One of Jackson's top players, Shaquille O'Neal, recently endorsed
Gore.)
</P>
<P>
   But before accepting the Los Angeles coaching job in June,
Jackson was asked by Bradley to manage his campaign in Iowa.
Jackson said he spent a few days in Des Moines on a road trip from
Chicago to California. ``I wanted to see what it would be like,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he found that it felt as if he were running for office
himself, a role he was not quite comfortable with. So he took the
Lakers job instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of regret it,'' Jackson now says. ``There won't be
another campaign like this, and there might be another similar
basketball opportunity along the way.''

BUSH FINDS HIS FUTURE INTERSECTING WITH HIS FATHER'S PAST

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a recent banquet here of some formality, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, a man seldom inclined to sartorial musings,
recalled a conversation with his wife, Laura, about what he planned
to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush informed the hundreds of men and women he was addressing
that Mrs. Bush had begged him not to dust off a ratty outfit that
was crying out for replacement. But he had stood firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read my lips,'' he said he told her. ``No new tuxes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrific line, but a curious one. On the one hand, it
took his father's infamously scuttled promise of ``no new taxes''
and turned it into a weightless joke. On the other, it brought to
mind the worst miscalculation of President George Bush's years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   As the younger Bush stakes his own claim to the White House,
both son and father still seem to be resolving _ or, just as often,
failing to resolve _ how to play this whole filial-parental thing.
And they continue to discover that the older Bush's history and the
younger Bush's destiny intersect in odd and unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   Last week provided several examples. On Tuesday, former
President Bush was on the ``Today'' show, and what he ended up
doing there was damage control over the assertions, in a new
biography of President Ronald Reagan, that Reagan and Bush, his
vice president, were not on the friendliest, most respectful terms.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer etiquette would call on Bush to quibble with this. But his
son's political ambitions absolutely demand a denial. In Republican
circles these days, Reaganism is a holy creed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, past and present collided again. Gov. Bush, in
Bakersfield, Calif., questioned whether ``personal vendettas''
might be at play in an apparent alliance between the conservative
commentator Pat Buchanan, who may seek the presidential nomination
of the Reform Party, and Ross Perot, that party's benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was alluding to the fact that in 1992, when his father lost
the White House, President Bush's efforts were hampered by both
Buchanan and Perot. Buchanan, who ran for the Republican
nomination, attacked President Bush viciously in the primaries, and
Perot, the Reform Party candidate, siphoned many votes away from
President Bush in the general election, which Bill Clinton won.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's pronouncement in Bakersfield reflected his
inconsistency and indecision about how and when to invoke Dad.
Previously, advisers had said that Gov. Bush was avoiding any
confrontation with Buchanan in part because he did not want to
sanction certain kinds of speculation about the motives behind his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he reacts too aggressively,'' said one adviser, before
Bakersfield, ``you're getting into that whole situation of: Are you
trying to right the wrongs done to your father?''
</P>
<P>
   What Bush often seems to be doing is burnishing his father's
legacy and recasting his father's record in terms that are always
flattering but occasionally disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Bush made his first major policy speech on the
military in September, he mentioned his own familiarity with the
sacrifices and heroism of the men who fought World War II. He was
alluding to his father's decorated stint as a fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Bush's memories were selective. As he criticized the
Clinton administration for spending too little on national defense,
he never acknowledged that President Bush had begun winnowing that

are Texans with no connection to the elder Bush's presidency,
several of President Bush's former advisers have indeed risen anew

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a recent banquet here of some formality, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, a man seldom inclined to sartorial musings,
recalled a conversation with his wife, Laura, about what he planned
to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush informed the hundreds of men and women he was addressing
that Mrs. Bush had begged him not to dust off a ratty outfit that
was crying out for replacement. But he had stood firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read my lips,'' he said he told her. ``No new tuxes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrific line, but a curious one. On the one hand, it
took his father's infamously scuttled promise of ``no new taxes''
and turned it into a weightless joke. On the other, it brought to
mind the worst miscalculation of President George Bush's years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   As the younger Bush stakes his own claim to the White House,
both son and father still seem to be resolving _ or, just as often,
failing to resolve _ how to play this whole filial-parental thing.
And they continue to discover that the older Bush's history and the
younger Bush's destiny intersect in odd and unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   Last week provided several examples. On Tuesday, former
President Bush was on the ``Today'' show, and what he ended up
doing there was damage control over the assertions, in a new
biography of President Ronald Reagan, that Reagan and Bush, his
vice president, were not on the friendliest, most respectful terms.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer etiquette would call on Bush to quibble with this. But his
son's political ambitions absolutely demand a denial. In Republican
circles these days, Reaganism is a holy creed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, past and present collided again. Gov. Bush, in
Bakersfield, Calif., questioned whether ``personal vendettas''
might be at play in an apparent alliance between the conservative
commentator Pat Buchanan, who may seek the presidential nomination
of the Reform Party, and Ross Perot, that party's benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was alluding to the fact that in 1992, when his father lost
the White House, President Bush's efforts were hampered by both
Buchanan and Perot. Buchanan, who ran for the Republican
nomination, attacked President Bush viciously in the primaries, and
Perot, the Reform Party candidate, siphoned many votes away from
President Bush in the general election, which Bill Clinton won.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's pronouncement in Bakersfield reflected his
inconsistency and indecision about how and when to invoke Dad.
Previously, advisers had said that Gov. Bush was avoiding any
confrontation with Buchanan in part because he did not want to
sanction certain kinds of speculation about the motives behind his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he reacts too aggressively,'' said one adviser, before
Bakersfield, ``you're getting into that whole situation of: Are you
trying to right the wrongs done to your father?''
</P>
<P>
   What Bush often seems to be doing is burnishing his father's
legacy and recasting his father's record in terms that are always
flattering but occasionally disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Bush made his first major policy speech on the
military in September, he mentioned his own familiarity with the
sacrifices and heroism of the men who fought World War II. He was
alluding to his father's decorated stint as a fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Bush's memories were selective. As he criticized the
Clinton administration for spending too little on national defense,
he never acknowledged that President Bush had begun winnowing that
budget before Clinton arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gov. Bush had forgotten, or had not been duly reminded;
after all, the elder Bush has said he is not providing counsel to
his son's campaign, that the younger Bush is entirely his own man.
And yet, even though the central figures in Gov. Bush's campaign
are Texans with no connection to the elder Bush's presidency,
several of President Bush's former advisers have indeed risen anew
with the son.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be any new tuxes this time around. But there are a
few old suits.

   WASHINGTON _ In life's rich pageant, few spectacles are as
dizzying as watching Congress spend the public's treasure. The sums
are huge, the oratory windy, the techniques tricky as three-card
monte.
</P>
<P>
   As the old fiscal year ended and the new one began Friday,
Congress was playing a giant shell game, saying one thing, doing
another, and all the while juggling more than half a trillion
dollars, leaving a huge stack of spending bills undone and the
government running on three weeks of legislative life support.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on here is no carnival. There is a crossroads
coming between the old ways of Congress and a new way, a trail
still unblazed.
</P>
<P>
   Just as this dimming decade, the post-Cold War era, is defined
by what it is not, the Republicans running Congress keep defining
themselves by their opposites. Democrats tax and spend, they say;
we cut taxes and spending. But they cannot this year; the green
eyeshade of accountability doesn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have promised _ publicly, daily, fervently _ not
to finance the operations of the government by spending money out
of the Social Security trust fund. No Congress has done this since
1967.
</P>
<P>
   To try to keep this pledge, they have used every accounting
device in the book, and some previously unrecorded.
</P>
<P>
   More than $20 billion dollars, nearly twice the previous record,
is being drawn down from the ledger for fiscal 2001. A nearly equal
amount is simply being erased from the books by a device known as
``directed scorekeeping,'' which one respected federal budget
analyst, Stan Collender of the Fleishman-Hillard public relations
firm, defines as ``lying about the numbers.'' Venerable projects
like the decennial census ($4.5 billion), a home-heating assistance
program ($1.1 billion), agricultural aid ($8.7 billion at last
count), along with still-uncounted billions for defense, have been
deemed unforeseeable ``emergency spending'' _ meaning Congress can
pretend they do not really count against the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is subterfuge,'' said Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina,
ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more, much more, as the millennial fiscal year
2000 began. On the floor of the House, members of Congress almost
unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution _ a promise made with
fingers crossed _ pledging never again to spend a dime of the
Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, at that minute, their number-crunchers at the
Congressional Budget Office were calculating that they were in fact
spending $18 billion of the surplus, a number growing with every
closed-door conference.
</P>
<P>
   And at the very moment President Clinton was signing into law a
pay increase for members of Congress averaging $4,600 a year,
Republican strategists were figuring that the only way to avoid
spending the surplus was to delay a tax break for 20 million
Americans on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   None other than Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
Republican standard-bearer, denounced the idea, saying, ``I don't
think they should balance their budget on the backs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders figured that by delaying that tax
break, they could say with a straight face that they would be $400
million shy of dipping into the Social Security coffers. At the
same time, behind closed doors, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
was convincing them to add $500 million for an aircraft carrier to
be built at his home state's shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   Most ennobling of all was the speechifying in the well of the
House as Rep. Wally Herger, R-Calif., led the charge for the vote
resolving not to spend the Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is break the addiction that we have
had,'' he said, and sat back as Democrats ridiculed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gentleman from California ought to get the equivalent of
the Congressional Medal of Honor for being picked to drag this
mother out here,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. Rep. Lloyd
Doggett, D-Texas, said the resolution ``gives hypocrisy a bad
name.'' Democratic Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said it was like
``saying we're going to quit drinking while we pour out a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed, 417-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was barely two years ago that Congress overwhelmingly passed
the Balanced Budget Act, which the president called a monument and
Lott hailed as ``the beginning of a new era of freedom.'' The act
helped balance the budget, all right, although the tax revenues
generated by a roaring economy were the key. They created what
would have been the first real surplus in general government funds
in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   For each of those 30 years that the government ran in the red,
Congress has used the money from Social Security revenues to make
up the difference. But now the spending limits, or caps, imposed by
the Balanced Budget Act have cut spending on domestic programs,
excluding the military, to their lowest level, expressed as a
percentage of the overall economy, since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   This relative penury in boom times proved intolerable for many
Republicans. They have drained the once-in-a-generation general
government surplus and are about to draw down the Social Security
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Democrats express shock and dismay at the
Republicans' spending practices, things were arguably worse in many
of the 40 years from 1955 through 1994, when Democrats controlled
congressional spending panels and became skilled at extracting
federal dollars for their own districts.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures on the Republican leaders to spend more money than
they have on hand continue. The Pentagon consumes half the money
they will spend this year, and what's left is not enough to divide
between members clamoring for money to distribute to constituents,
and popular programs like education, health care and medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   The path from the past that no one has charted is how to spend
money wisely in a coming era of surpluses, linking public policy to
public funds, instead of the present gathering at the federal
trough.

NONPROFIT GROUPS FOUND POCKETING CASH TO FEED POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EXCLUSIVE; 4 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 7 p.m. ET EMBARGO
for electronic media.) 
(ATTN: Calif., Ariz., Utah, Ohio, N.Y., Ala., Pa., Mich.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Officers of many nonprofit organizations have
illegally enriched themselves by pocketing millions of dollars of
federal money that was meant to feed poor children in day care
homes, federal investigators and state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general of the Agriculture Department, Roger C.
Viadero, said the nonprofit organizations had routinely filed false
claims overstating the number of meals served at the homes, which
are recruited and supervised by the nonprofit groups. Some of these
groups, he said, claimed federal money for meals served to
``nonexistent children'' in fictitious day care homes, while others
extorted money by demanding kickbacks from legitimate day care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of fraud takes food out of the mouths of children,''
Viadero said, summarizing what his agents had found in more than
3,200 unannounced visits to private day care homes and child care
centers that receive federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government spends $1.7 billion a year to provide
meals for 2.4 million children in day care. Viadero began a
nationwide investigation of the program after a whistle-blower
complained about problems at a nonprofit organization in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Viadero's office issued a comprehensive audit last month laying
out the abuses, which he said were attributable in part to basic
flaws in the program's structure that federal officials had not
moved fast enough to correct.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit groups, known as sponsors, play a critical role as
middlemen between the government and day care homes and centers.
The sponsors are supposed to monitor the day care homes. They
review and pay claims for meals served. And they are supposed to
insure that the meals meet federal nutrition standards.
</P>
<P>
   So far the federal government has filed criminal charges against
44 people, asserting that they defrauded the program, known
formally as the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Twenty-eight of
them have been convicted or pleaded guilty; the other cases are
still open.
</P>
<P>
   Child care advocates see the federal program as a guarantor of
quality care. But Viadero said children were often short-changed.
</P>
<P>
   In his audit report, Viadero, a former New York City police
officer who worked for 15 years at the FBI, said: ``Day care
providers and their sponsors were found to be submitting false
claims on a grand scale. Some were engaging in money laundering,
embezzlement, forgery and extortion. Many simply padded their
payrolls to justify fatter government checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine J. O'Neill, a dietitian at B.J. Enterprises in
Scottsdale, Ariz., a sponsor for 380 day care homes, said the
federal investigators had focused too much on paperwork and
bookkeeping errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children can be happy even if day care providers don't do all
their paperwork on time,'' said Ms. O'Neill, whose company was
criticized for such errors. ``Kids are eating better because of
this program. Instead of a bologna sandwich and Kool-Aid, they have
a turkey sandwich, lettuce, fruit and milk for lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for day care has grown in recent years because a
booming economy has drawn more parents into the labor force and
millions of women are trying to comply with work requirements of
new federal and state welfare laws.
</P>
<P>
   On the average, each sponsor supervises 150 day care homes, but
some are responsible for more than 1,500. State licensing rules
vary, but typically a home may have up to six children. Most of the
children are under the age of 5, but some may be as old as 12. Day
care homes receive more federal money if they are in low-income
neighborhoods or serve children from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The audit cited many improprieties. In California, the
husband-and-wife owners of Pacific Asian American Family Care
pleaded guilty to defrauding the government and were ordered to pay
$2.2 million in restitution. Prosecutors said the owners had
submitted claims for inflated budgets, which included payments to
nonexistent employees and bogus business entities.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the defendants, Kyung Ho Moon and Wan Hee
Moon, used federal money to buy four houses and to pay college
expenses for their children. Mrs. Moon worked simultaneously for
the state of California, monitoring the work of child care
sponsors, including her own company.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, federal prosecutors said a Salt Lake City
couple had misappropriated federal money ``designated solely for
the reimbursement of meals previously eaten by underprivileged
children.'' The indictment says the couple, William and Magda
Evans, demanded kickbacks from legitimate day care providers and
claimed federal payments for day care homes that did not exist or
had been excluded from the program. A trial is scheduled for Nov.
15.
</P>
<P>
   In Toledo, Ohio, the New Jerusalem Church of God in Christ
claimed federal reimbursement for meals served in day care homes
that did not exist. The homes listed vacant lots and abandoned
houses as their addresses. Seven people have pleaded guilty and
been ordered to pay restitution totaling more than $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his recent report, the inspector general said, ``We found
sponsors operating as nonprofit organizations, but enriching
themselves at the expense of the children to whom they were
supposed to provide meals.''
</P>
<P>
   In some places, Viadero said, sponsors have retained 15 percent
to 30 percent of the food money intended for child care centers.
``This is one of the most significant causes of fraud and
mismanagement'' in the program, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors defend the practice by saying they need the money to
cover their administrative costs. But the inspector general said he
could find ``no correlation'' between the sponsors' actual costs
and the amounts they kept for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general said that many sponsors ``honestly did not
understand'' the child care food program, and that federal
officials ``could have prevented or detected much of the fraudulent
activity'' if they had been more vigilant. Officials of the Food
and Nutrition Service, a unit of the Agriculture Department, have
often failed to act on warnings from the inspector general for the
last four years, Viadero said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said he was working with the
inspector general to root out fraud in the child care food program.
Samuel Chambers Jr., administrator of the Food and Nutrition
Service, said the agency would propose stricter rules for the
program later this year. But Viadero said, ``We do not believe that
the corrective actions proposed to date go far enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Several state officials said that local sponsors had shared
information about how to run scams without being detected. But
federal officials said they did not see evidence of a multistate
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general found that sponsors were reluctant to
enforce federal requirements because they receive more federal
money as they sign up and supervise more day care homes. In effect,
he said, sponsors compete against one another, and homes tend to
prefer the more lenient sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Viadero said this was ``a basic flaw in the design'' of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, while acknowledging some responsibility, said
the federal government had also been at fault. Harley R. Fancher,
administrator of special nutrition programs in the Arkansas
Department of Human Services, said, ``The basic problem is that the
U.S. Department of Agriculture has been in the business of
shoveling out money with little or no accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Fancher, who worked for the Federal Food and Nutrition Service
for 20 years, said: ``In some cases, a sponsor signs up a bunch of
day care providers by mail and never visits the homes. The
providers are not trained in meal preparation or record-keeping.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has a list of nonprofit organizations
cited for serious deficiencies and tries to keep them out of the
program. But Fancher said a company excluded in one state might try
to reinvent itself and enter the program in another state.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example,'' he said, ``if XYZ Inc. does something wrong in
North Carolina, it may come back as the ZYX Corporation in Arkansas
or Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Kenny, a spokesman for the New York State Health
Department, said that the federal government was conducting two
investigations of the child care food program in New York, but that
no one had been accused of wrongdoing to date. The New York program
receives $120 million a year in federal money to feed 55,100
children in family day care homes and 242,000 youngsters in child
care centers.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report cited many other examples of
problems in the food program, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-three day care providers in Decatur, Ala. _ more than 40
percent of those reviewed _ claimed reimbursement for meals served
to children on days when the homes were closed or the children were
absent.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Pennsylvania, an officer of a nonprofit organization, CT
Child Nutrition Services, pleaded guilty to embezzling $92,000 of
federal money. She used the money ``to cover personal expenses,
such as her mortgage, and to buy equipment for a restaurant she
owned.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A former member of the Detroit school board was convicted of
fraudulently obtaining $15.5 million in federal food money. She
overstated the number of meals served at 16 day care centers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the office manager of a nonprofit organization in
Phoenix, Feeding Arizona Kids, pleaded guilty to theft of
government money after investigators found that she had written 60
checks to people whom she falsely identified as day care providers.
She deposited the checks in her personal account.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last weekend, I deposited a fat six-figure sum into
my checking account. The windfall, alas, was from the sale of my
home, not from my weekly paycheck at The New York Times, where for
the past several weeks I have been writing about a major
money-laundering investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the single biggest bank deposit I have ever made, and the
sleuths at Chase Manhattan took notice right away. Their system
rejected my deposit.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a very nice, very harried, branch manager called
to tell me the deposit was too large for my account. Moreover, the
account was only in my name and the checks were made out to me and
my wife. Set up a new account or take your money elsewhere, advised
the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are supposed to do this. After all, how do the Chase folks
know where I got all that money from? Still, I was amused. How did
billions of dollars from Russia _  &UR; billions &LR;  _ zip through a
handful of accounts at the Bank of New York for almost two years
without anyone taking notice?
</P>
<P>
   Paper checks deposited in a local branch are pretty easy for
banks to track. But much of the money flowing around the world
these days flits across borders electronically in the blink of an
eye. And that can be much harder for banks to monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York, now entangled in the biggest money
laundering investigation in history, processes billions of dollars
of transactions a day. Understandably, a lot of money could sneak
by unnoticed when there's that much passing through. But at least
$3 billion slipped through just nine accounts at the Bank of New
York between 1996 and 1998, right before the FBI marched in to
examine all that activity.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way: A python swallows a frog and nobody
notices the frog is missing. Then the python swallows a rabbit: Not
a lot of guess-work here because you can see where the poor rabbit
is _ it's stuck right in the middle of the python.
</P>
<P>
   When an obscure operation called Benex Corp. deposited billions
of dollars of Russian funds into accounts at the Bank of New York,
it looked like the python swallowed a pig _ yet despite the
tremendous bulge in Benex's accounts, nobody at the bank examined
it closely.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, alarm bells started ringing about Benex and related
accounts at Republic Bank in August 1998, just one month after the
bank installed a new system to monitor wire transfers. The heavy
traffic in the accounts concerned Republic, which alerted federal
officials immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In the new era of looser financial regulation, banks are
expected to be the first line of defense against criminals.
Essentially, this requires them to be vigilant and know the
backgrounds of their customers. If something about an account makes
them suspicious, banks are required to notify regulators right
away.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New York chief executive Thomas Renyi acknowledged in
recent congressional testimony that the bank failed to supervise
the Benex accounts effectively. That lapse will be a matter for
regulators to address. Beyond that, however, it is not clear
whether the bank did anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The exact sources of some $7.5 billion that moved through Benex
accounts at the Bank of New York between 1996 and 1999 are still
unknown and the bank has not been charged with wrongdoing. Other
than Renyi's testimony, the bank has largely declined to comment
except to say it is cooperating with the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the mass of investigators swarming around the case
face enormous hurdles unraveling the traffic through the Benex
accounts and proving that sources of the funds were tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering refers to the criminal practice of taking
ill-gotten gains, or ``dirty'' money, and filtering them through a
sequence of bank accounts so they are ``cleaned'' to look like
legitimate profits from legal activities. Exposing this process,
however, is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to prosecute money laundering because
disproportionate activity in an account doesn't mean you have money
laundering,'' said Mark Seltzer, an attorney with Goulston &AMP; Storrs
in Boston and a former federal prosecutor. ``You have to prove that
the source of the money that created this activity in your accounts
was ill-gotten gains from specific criminal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most high-profile financial fraud prosecutions in
recent years, the 1991 case against the Bank of Credit &AMP; Commerce
International that was spearheaded by Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau, did not result in convictions of two of the most
notable defendants in the case, Washington power broker Clark
Clifford and his protege, Robert Altman.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the legal community view Morgenthau's prosecution of
BCCI as a landmark success because it unraveled an illegal
financial scheme clearly operating beyond the pale and helped force
the payment of more than $1.5 billion in fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just look at the criminal prosecution, it obviously
wasn't successful,'' said Robert Powis, a former deputy assistant
secretary for enforcement at the U.S. Treasury. ``But they helped
shut the apparatus down and they did get heavy fines disgorged and
that's another measure of success.''
</P>
<P>
   But BCCI was a rogue bank. At worst, based on what has surfaced
so far, the Bank of New York may have had a troubled operation
inside its walls, but no one in the banking community has ever
considered it to be a rogue bank. The comparison with BCCI, then,
lies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relevance of the BCCI matter is that it demonstrated the
difficulties of prosecuting these kinds of cases,'' said Harry
Albright, the court-appointed trustee of First American, a bank
once controlled by BCCI. ``It is very difficult to unravel banking
cases these days because of their international scope. There is no
quick fix because the cases require cooperation across borders.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the ultimate answers to the questions swirling
around the Bank of New York can only be found in Russia. And
getting real cooperation from the Russians in the Bank of New York
case may be the biggest hurdle that American investigators face.

<P>
   Once upon a time, the Rev. Mason Weems wrote a book about a
president who chopped down his father's favorite young English
cherry tree: ``The sweet face of youth brightened with the
inexpressible charm of all-conquering truth, he bravely cried out,
`I can't tell a lie, Pa; you know I can't tell a lie. I did cut it
with my hatchet.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Run to my arms, you dearest boy,' cried his father in
transports. `Glad am I, George, that you killed my tree. Such an
act of heroism in my son is more worth than a thousand trees.'''
</P>
<P>
   So much for ``all-conquering truth.'' Parson Weems made up the
cherry tree story, and lots of others about Washington now found in
paintings, on postage stamps and in the popular imagination. But a
legend was born.
</P>
<P>
   Today, mythologizing is more difficult, as shown by last week's
publication of ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' (Random House).
Edmund Morris knew he would be laughed out of town if he tried to
spin tales of cherry trees, so he makes a more post-modern attempt
at spinning. He turns himself into a fictional character who runs
into Reagan over the years, throwing in other imaginary characters,
plus scenes in screenplay format.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he invented a new kind of biography inspired by his
subject. He didn't meet Reagan in 1926, but can imagine doing so. A
lot of people who haven't read the book but can imagine reading it
have complained that too much of it is imagined. I myself can
imagine how it all came about.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)(Fade in: The oval office. A president, an
in-house historian, an old friend. Two notebooks. A jar of jelly
beans.)(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   RON: Let me tell you about the time I played football in 1924
... or was I in a movie?
</P>
<P>
   ED: Mr. President, no one could ever understand what it's like
to try to write about you. Maybe if I made up some characters _ one
who hates your guts, one who follows you around. You're like the
sum of people's projections. You don't exist without an audience.
</P>
<P>
   RON: You're kind of a character yourself, Ed. Have a jelly bean.
</P>
<P>
   JENNY LYN (to Ed): Maybe you're spending too much time with him.
</P>
<P>
   ED: What are you doing here?
</P>
<P>
   JENNY LYN: I put myself in. It's a new journalism technique,
inspired by you.
</P>
<P>
   RON: Jenny Lyn, would you like a jelly bean?
</P>
<P>
   JENNY LYN: Thanks.
</P>
<P>
   RON: Ed?
</P>
<P>
   ED: Mr. President, I don't want a jelly bean! I want a narrative
that coheres!
</P>
<P>
   JENNY LYN: Shh. Ed, you seem upset.
</P>
<P>
   ED: I think I'm going to have to invent a new genre to convey
what he's like. It's going to combine elements of academic writing,
personal memoir and B-movies. And it'll switch smoothly but
suddenly, without warning, just like he does.
</P>
<P>
   JENNY LYN: Don't worry, you'll do it. It'll be wild. I've seen
it.
</P>
<P>
   ED: How is that possible?
</P>
<P>
   RON: Anything is possible. You're the first presidential
in-house historian. Make it up.
</P>
<P>
   And so he did, even bursting into stretches of first-person
italics when necessary. Between the debunking of myths and the
magic of digital enhancement, it's almost impossible to idealize
legendary figures these days, but it's quite possible to hang out
with them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) When I used to encounter Ed, on the tarmac
boarding Air Force One, or on the White House porch, he had the air
of a man with a serious mission. Our friends would worry that he
was just writing another historical-gimmick thing like ``Forrest
Gump,'' or ``Zelig,'' or ``Dick,'' taking huge historic license,
trying to pass off fiction as nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   I lived across the street from Ed in Washington, and at that
time everyone I knew in D.C. was doing it.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what was odd about his little project. When he
told me the title I nearly fell over. He was mixing biography and
autobiography! A ``memoir''? I guess a memoir is nonfiction without
the responsibility. But isn't a memoir supposed to be stuff you
remember? How can a memoir just be conjured up?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I think Ed was up to something else. He was just
trying to make myths the only way they can be made in our ironic
times: by pretending another guy is narrating.
</P>
<P>
   And if an invented character remembers memories for you, is that
character accountable? It reminded me a little of something Ron
once said: ``Mistakes were made.''
</P>
<P>
   This was more like a mystical happening: ``Books were written.''
</P>
<P>
   Myths were made. (END ITALICS HERE)

   JENNY LYN: Thanks.
</P>
<P>
   RON: Ed?
</P>
<P>
   ED: Mr. President, I don't want a jelly bean! I want a narrative
that coheres!
</P>
<P>
   JENNY LYN: Shh. Ed, you seem upset.
</P>
<P>
   ED: I think I'm going to have to invent a new genre to convey
what he's like. It's going to combine elements of academic writing,
personal memoir and B-movies. And it'll switch smoothly but
suddenly, without warning, just like he does.
</P>
<P>
   JENNY LYN: Don't worry, you'll do it. It'll be wild. I've seen
it.
</P>
<P>
   ED: How is that possible?
</P>
<P>
   RON: Anything is possible. You're the first presidential
in-house historian. Make it up.
</P>
<P>
   And so he did, even bursting into stretches of first-person
italics when necessary. Between the debunking of myths and the
magic of digital enhancement, it's almost impossible to idealize
legendary figures these days, but it's quite possible to hang out
with them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) When I used to encounter Ed, on the tarmac
boarding Air Force One, or on the White House porch, he had the air
of a man with a serious mission. Our friends would worry that he
was just writing another historical-gimmick thing like ``Forrest
Gump,'' or ``Zelig,'' or ``Dick,'' taking huge historic license,
trying to pass off fiction as nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   I lived across the street from Ed in Washington, and at that
time everyone I knew in D.C. was doing it.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what was odd about his little project. When he
told me the title I nearly fell over. He was mixing biography and
autobiography! A ``memoir''? I guess a memoir is nonfiction without
the responsibility. But isn't a memoir supposed to be stuff you
remember? How can a memoir just be conjured up?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I think Ed was up to something else. He was just
trying to make myths the only way they can be made in our ironic
times: by pretending another guy is narrating.
</P>
<P>
   And if an invented character remembers memories for you, is that
character accountable? It reminded me a little of something Ron
once said: ``Mistakes were made.''
</P>
<P>
   This was more like a mystical happening: ``Books were written.''
</P>
<P>
   Myths were made. (END ITALICS HERE)

   WASHINGTON _ The imagery that China chose to send around the
world as it celebrated the 50th anniversary of the People's
Republic on Friday seemed a throwback to communism's brighter days:
Half a million troops and citizens on parade, endless columns of
missiles and armor, fighters and bombers screaming overhead. It was
enough to make an old China hand like John Paton Davies, now 91,
wonder whether the ever-emotional dynamic between the United States
and China was headed into ``another era in which we fear the
Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   The days when Davies and his State Department colleagues were
purged in the peculiar madness of the McCarthy era for arguing that
the Chinese Communists would be around for a while seem as remote
today as pre-revolutionary Beijing. But the underlying fear that
rattled the country in those years _ later to take the form of
oscillating uncertainty about how to think about China and the
kinds of threats it might pose _ has really never lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mystery to me back in 1952,'' Davies said, his voice
now whispery. ``And it is still a mystery to me today. Our
infatuation with China _ whether it is a potential enemy or a dear
friend to be protected and indulged _ hasn't changed all that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans like to think they have a far clearer, more balanced
view of China today than they did when Washington was seized with
the question of who lost it, as if it was in America's power to win
or lose. But ask the old China hands, and they will tell you that
the pendulum of public opinion about China swings as vigorously as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of nuclear spies, and threats that China, if pushed, would
resort to force to prevent Taiwanese independence rekindle wariness
of a fearsome power whose real intentions seem forever cloaked.
</P>
<P>
   But opposite images of a New China also spilled across the
screen last week: jammed Internet cafes in Beijing, screaming stock
traders in Shanghai, the cell-phone middle class in Guangdong
taking the kids to soccer. Stitched together, those paint a
comforting mosaic: a Chinese people who have _ finally _ become
more and more like Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Both images, of course, carry more than a little truth, and
suffer from more than a little exaggeration. But they are also the
yin and yang driving Washington's ``engagement'' policy _ usually
driving it in circles.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask the old China hands _- men like Davies who traveled
the Chinese countryside as Mao battled the Nationalists _ the
popular imagery Americans have of China has almost always been out
of sync with the reality.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous fear that China and the old Soviet Union would team
up against America masked a bitter split between the two. Yet it
seized Washington until the two countries actually began firing on
each other in the 1960s. Then, in 1972, the exuberance around
President Richard M. Nixon's visit largely ignored the death and
terror of the Cultural Revolution. And the rush to invest in
China's booming economic growth in the '90s masked the depths of
its economic troubles _ the billions in bad loans, the wildly
inefficient state-owned industries, the tens of millions of
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've so often deceived ourselves,'' said Culver Gleysteen,
who grew up as the son of missionaries in Beijing and who, on Oct.
1, 1949, was among the few U.S. diplomats left in China _ vice
consul in the port of Dalian. Talking from his home in Boothbay,
Maine, Gleysteen said that in the years just after China changed
hands ``everyone in the State Department knew Chiang Kai-shek was a
loser and we had to think about dealing with the Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gleysteen recalls that his' questions about engaging Mao
prompted Walter J. Robertson, the undersecretary of state for Asian
affairs, to ask, ``Is that young man Red?''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the arguments about how to deal with China are only
occasionally tinged with questions of loyalty. But America's allies
still worry about the periodic swings of views about China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it comes from the fact that the U.S. is so
idealistic,'' said Kunihiko Saito, who has just ended a stint as
Japan's ambassador in Washington. ``So you become far more
disappointed than we Japanese do when China does not act according
to American standards.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that America is finally shedding some of its
illusions. The companies that poured investment into China are
pulling back, recognizing that the market that they thought would
be the way to near-instant riches will, in fact, be a long slog.
The think-tanks are consumed by a debate over two very different
China threats: The China that gradually builds up its now small
arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles or the China that
risks an economic implosion that could set off the next Asian
crisis. For every article about whether China will try to retake
Taiwan, there is another asking whether it will be the next
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are, of course, people who fear a resurgent China, and
China itself still fuels those fears,'' said Robert Suettinger, who
spent his career China-watching at the CIA. ``But sort of backwards
and by mistake we are moving toward a more realistic view, one that
can avoid the ups and downs. We have to learn to live with great
powers that are not our friend, but not our enemy either.''

AUSTRIA VOTE MAY PUT FAR-RIGHT PARTY IN THICK OF THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Can a politician so tanned that he's known as
the Hero of the Solarium, so narcissistic that he's posed in
everything from lederhosen to silver togas to near nudity, and so
controversial that his opponents openly call him a crypto-Nazi
actually beat this conservative country's red-and-black coalition
government until it's black-and-blue?
</P>
<P>
   That question will be answered Sunday, when Austria's voters
choose between the Social Democrats (the reds), the conservative
business-and-church-oriented People's Party (black), and the newly
powerful right-wing Freedom Party (color code: blue) led by Joerg
Haider. (The Green Party and the ``yellow'' Liberal Forum are not
expected to do well enough to tempt pundits with a ``traffic-light
government.'')
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters predict that the reds will hang on to their No. 1 spot
with about 35 percent of the vote, but that Haider's blues are
expected for the first time to outstrip the black column, 27
percent to 25 percent. If the People's Party slips to third place
for the first time since 1945, its leader says he will drop out of
the longstanding red-black coalition to rebuild his demoralized
forces. Color schemes aside, that leaves Haider _ whose party had a
mere 5 percent when he took it over in 1986 _ as a potential
kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The idea horrifies the Austrian political establishment. After
all, the reds and blacks only got together in their highly unusual
left-right coalition in 1986 in order to keep Haider from power.
And their partnership has lasted mostly on the shared perception
that it was necessary to keep things that way. Vienna's liberals,
who are prominent in the press and academia, also shudder at the
prospect of Haider gaining even more influence in Austrian
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The vision reverberates, too, beyond Austria's borders: Guenter
Grass, Germany's new Nobel laureate for literature, celebrated the
honor on Friday morning by giving the early morning weather
forecast on German state television. He predicted sunshine in the
south Sunday, and then directly urged Austrians _ many of whom
watch German television _ to vote against Haider, widely
characterized as the head of Europe's largest far-right party.
</P>
<P>
   The terms used to describe Haider would barely be utterable in
Germany: his parents' time in the Hitler Youth is repeatedly
brought up; his takeover of the Freedom Party and ousting of its
liberal wing is called a putsch, the corps of handsome young men
around him is likened to a Praetorian Guard or 1930s street thugs.
Dozens of protesters at a Haider rally Friday night chanted
``Nazis, out!''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Haider has not helped. In 1991, he snapped at a Socialist rival
in his home province of Carinthia: ``They had a sound employment
policy in the Third Reich, which is more than your government in
Vienna has managed,'' and was immediately accused of endorsing
slave labor and forced to resign as the province's governor, an
office he regained after a comeback in provincial elections last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Haider spoke to a reunion that included former Waffen
SS men, calling them ``decent people with character who stuck to
their belief through the strongest headwinds.'' The Museum of
Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles displays
Haider's picture in its Contemporary Demagogues section, alongside
the former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, Louisiana's David Duke and
the French rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But a Haider party leader, Peter Sichrovsky, who is Jewish,
bristles at Nazi cracks. ``It's a stupid comparison, and I don't
accept it,'' he said. ``I will accept any criticism of our
immigration policy, but I refuse dialogue with anyone comparing us
to mass murderers. The Green Party in Rome has an anti-Gypsy policy
and no one compares them to Mussolini.'' Haider, he said, has
visited Israel and took his daughters through Washington's
Holocaust Museum shortly after it opened.
</P>
<P>
   The party does want all immigration halted, but insists that
jobs, not skin color, is the issue. ``Our strongest supporter is
the Turkish guy who's been here 10 years cleaning floors and is
scared a guy from the ex-Yugoslavia will take his job for half the
money,'' Sichrovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The party also has ideas for which Americans know the roots: it
wants a 23 percent flat tax and calls its platform Contract With
Austria. But other platform planks are, in American terms, classic
tax-and-spend liberalism: Haider promises $400 a month to every
Austrian mother so she can stay home with her children. Workers
like him because he defends costly cradle-to-grave benefits against
cuts made by the current government in order to qualify for
Europe's single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's opponents say his books do not balance _ tax receipts
would sink to $30 billion from $40 billion while expenses soared, a
Social Democrat spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What is baffling is why a far-right party is having such success
now.
</P>
<P>
   Austria is not remotely in crisis; economically, it approaches
paradise. It has only 8 million people _ about as many as desperate
Zimbabwe _ but they produce enough to have a higher standard of
living than the Germans. Unemployment is 4.3 percent; inflation is
negligible. No one ever strikes. The spotless streets of Vienna and
Salzburg brim with culture, and women walk them safely at night.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, 10 percent of the population consists of
immigrants. Without them, the economy would fibrillate: Polish
carpenters build housing, Filipino nurses staff hospitals,
Hungarian nannies tend babies.
</P>
<P>
   So why do a quarter of all Austrians believe Haider's assertions
that the country is going to the dogs?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly in a nation that has Sigmund Freud, a native
son, on its equivalent of the $5 bill, there is no shortage of
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fatigue _ Austrians are complainers,'' said Hans Raucher,
a political columnist for the newspaper Der Standard. After 13
years of the same government, and almost 30 years under Socialist
chancellors, ``People are really fed up with the same faces in
power.''
</P>
<P>
   The reds have dominated Parliament for three decades, and Haider
plays on old resentment over the careful red/black control of daily
life. For decades, anyone seeking a civil service job, even as a
teacher, bank teller, postman, railway porter or street sweeper
usually had to first join one of the two governing parties.
</P>
<P>
   Austrians are also apprehensive. During the Cold War, this was a
neutral island in the Alps. Now, hard by the crisis in the
countries that were part of the larger Yugoslavia, it is debating
joining NATO and would be the doorsill for eastern European
countries if the European Union's door opens to them.
</P>
<P>
   Haider takes these jitters and weaves an earthquake, saying
child molesters are buying their way out of jail and foreigners
have turned the country into ``a center for international crime _
drug dealers, car thieves, pimps and bandits.'' His crime slogan:
``No mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole, even inflated to absurdity, does not backfire on him
as Hitlerism does. Opposing the entry into the European Union four
years ago, he said Austrians would be forced to pump their bracing
water to Spain and import lice-infested yogurt. The yogurt is still
good; and he still draws crowds. His railing against immigration
actually changed policy. The government slowed it to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as he fans xenophobia, the ruling parties bicker and
run dull ads.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first black campaign blitz was a folk song book. ``This is
not still the country of the von Trapp singers,'' sneered a red
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Viktor Klima of the reds has said he will ``never,
never'' form a coalition with Haider, so his party is hoping the
black leader, Wolfgang Schuessel, will either change his mind or
even be ousted by someone less willing to give up ruling for
soul-searching. But Haider is still the one who makes every other
politician angry or nervous.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The only guy who speaks out, who wants to change anything, is
Haider,'' said Georg Hoffman-Ostenhof, a columnist for the Profil
weekly. ``And since he's so eclectic and voters are generally not
rational, they find him attractive.''

UNCIVIL WARS: NO PLACE FOR CIVILIANS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ War, wrote Gen. Omar Bradley in his memoir, ``A
Soldier's Story,'' was ``a wretched debasement of all the thin
pretensions of civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the thinnest pretensions is that civilians should be
spared the worst of war's horrors. In fact, modern war is too often
all about civilians, making it devilishly complicated to figure out
how to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The Associated Press disclosed new evidence of the
deliberate killing of hundreds of Korean civilians by U.S. soldiers
and warplanes near the village of No Gun Ri at the start of the
Korean War in 1950. The report raised the uncomfortable question of
whether U.S. soldiers committed an atrocity against the very
civilians they had been sent to protect, just as they have been
shown to have done at My Lai in Vietnam in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a larger question too: At the end of the century of
total war, can the protection of civilians ever be more than a thin
pretension, even when protecting civilians is the declared war aim?
</P>
<P>
   Recent experience in the Balkans is not encouraging. When NATO
forces, led by the United States, intervened in Kosovo last spring,
it was with the declared intention of protecting ethnic Albanians
threatened with massacre by Serbs. But the allies did not go in on
the ground and stop killings and wanton destruction there; instead,
intent on keeping their own casualties down, they waged an air war
that continued for 78 days before the Serb forces pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing from 15,000 feet so that they would not be shot down,
allied pilots on April 14 killed Albanian refugees fleeing in a
convoy mixed in with Serbian armored vehicles. Consequently, to
avoid further risk of civilian casualties, pilots were ordered not
to target such vehicles when they were mixed up with civilian
traffic. And one result was that Serbian forces could continue
laying waste to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The hard fact, as Kosovo illustrated, is that however much the
saving of civilians may be an ultimate aim of a war, commanders are
loath to place higher value on protecting specific civilians than
on protecting their own soldiers or mission.
</P>
<P>
   In Bradley's war, World War II, little heed was paid to the
notion that civilians and combatants were distinct at all. The
Nazis and the Japanese set the pattern for this, but by the end of
the war the Allies sometimes followed suit. Concentration camps on
one side, and the bombings of Hiroshima, Hamburg and Dresden by the
other side, bear witness.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the discovery of the enormity of the Holocaust, the
victorious powers tried in the Nuremberg trials to make war more
humane, by banning the most unthinkable actions as crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the countries that wrote the verdicts at Nuremberg
still sometimes fall into the abyss, as was made clear in 1968 with
the massacre at My Lai of up to 500 Vietnamese civilians by U.S.
GIs. And even then, the commanders were reluctant to admit fault.
Lt. William Calley's superiors let him take the blame, and then he
served only a fraction of the life sentence he received for his
conviction of murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the Korean War, military historians have long known of
reports of atrocities committed against civilians by both sides,
and have known that the North Korean communists often used
civilians as cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a common experience to see a herd of refugees shuffle
toward an American position, then sweep aside at the last moment to
reveal the North Korean infantrymen sheltering among them,'' wrote
British journalist Max Hastings in a 1987 book, ``The Korean War.''
But Hastings also quoted witnesses who said U.S. F-86 fighters
sometimes deliberately strafed columns of civilians on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Did U.S. commanders give soldiers free rein to shoot civilians
indiscriminately? New evidence that they did was what prompted
Defense Secretary William Cohen last week to order a new year-long
review of the historical evidence of a massacre; for several years,
U.S. officials had said they had no such evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No refugees to cross the front line. Fire everyone trying to
cross lines,'' ordered the 1st Cavalry Division, whose units were
dug in near No Gun Ri at the end of July 1950, when ill-prepared
U.S. troops were reeling in retreat from the Communist onslaught
that had begun a month earlier. ``Use discretion in case of women
and children,'' read the order, one of several recovered by The AP
from military archives.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with that last order is that in the heat of battle,
``discretion'' can be the first civilized pretension shed by
panic-stricken troops. ``The sense of facing a merciless Asian
enemy caused many Americans to extend their fears and suspicions to
the entire people of Korea,'' Hastings wrote. ```The gooks' meant
not merely the communists, but all Koreans. Communist atrocities
provoked callousness in many Americans, fighting a desperate
struggle for survival, toward the Asians around them, creatures
from another planet whose language they could not understand, whose
customs bewildered them, whose country seemed most vividly
represented by the universal stench of human excrement manuring the
fields.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the same factors would combine to bring U.S. soldiers
to shoot old Vietnamese men and peasant women and children in the
ditches of My Lai.
</P>
<P>
   It was My Lai _ indeed, the whole Vietnam War _ that led
Americans to question the premise that had seemed unassailable
during World War II, that lifting the restraints on military force
can be justified if the ultimate end is to achieve good.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991 did the United
States and some of its allies again mobilize on a grand scale to
chase an aggressor, Saddam Hussein, out of an occupied country,
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   When they did, it was with a new, and not entirely clear, set of
attitudes toward warfare and the risks that an aggressive military
strategy poses for civilians. And here the paradox behind those new
values first became clear. When U.S. guided bombs killed scores of
civilians who had taken refuge in a command bunker in Baghdad, the
Americans began to lose their nerve. That was one factor when
President George Bush halted the war without sending allied troops
all the way in to remove Saddam; one result is that Americans are
still waging an air war of pinpricks against him.
</P>
<P>
   During the Kosovo war, Col. Edward Boyle, one of the air war
planners, summed up the choices left to the planners this way: ``It
was not a perfect world out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But, then, war never is. Times change, but war is still hell, as
somebody else put it differently more than a century ago _ William
Tecumseh Sherman, who did not spare civilians on his march to the
sea. And they were his fellow Americans.

UNCIVIL WARS: NO PLACE FOR CIVILIANS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ War, wrote Gen. Omar Bradley in his memoir, ``A
Soldier's Story,'' was ``a wretched debasement of all the thin
pretensions of civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the thinnest pretensions is that civilians should be
spared the worst of war's horrors. In fact, modern war is too often
all about civilians, making it devilishly complicated to figure out
how to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The Associated Press disclosed new evidence of the
deliberate killing of hundreds of Korean civilians by U.S. soldiers
and warplanes near the village of No Gun Ri at the start of the
Korean War in 1950. The report raised the uncomfortable question of
whether U.S. soldiers committed an atrocity against the very
civilians they had been sent to protect, just as they have been
shown to have done at My Lai in Vietnam in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a larger question too: At the end of the century of
total war, can the protection of civilians ever be more than a thin
pretension, even when protecting civilians is the declared war aim?
</P>
<P>
   Recent experience in the Balkans is not encouraging. When NATO
forces, led by the United States, intervened in Kosovo last spring,
it was with the declared intention of protecting ethnic Albanians
threatened with massacre by Serbs. But the allies did not go in on
the ground and stop killings and wanton destruction there; instead,
intent on keeping their own casualties down, they waged an air war
that continued for 78 days before the Serb forces pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing from 15,000 feet so that they would not be shot down,
allied pilots on April 14 killed Albanian refugees fleeing in a
convoy mixed in with Serbian armored vehicles. Consequently, to
avoid further risk of civilian casualties, pilots were ordered not
to target such vehicles when they were mixed up with civilian
traffic. And one result was that Serbian forces could continue
laying waste to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The hard fact, as Kosovo illustrated, is that however much the
saving of civilians may be an ultimate aim of a war, commanders are
loath to place higher value on protecting specific civilians than
on protecting their own soldiers or mission.
</P>
<P>

   LONDON _ They set out to challenge the law. But when four
Britons dismissed from the British military because they are gay
accused the government of violating their basic human right to
privacy, they couldn't find a remedy in a domestic court. They had
to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, France.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in October 2000, however, people like Duncan
Lustig-Prean, Graeme Grady, Jeanette Smith and John Beckett _ who
won a landmark decision last week when the European court ruled in
their favor _ will no longer have to make that long trip to France.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, doggedly, somewhat nervously, Britain is preparing
itself for a constitutional revolution that will profoundly alter
its citizens' relationship to the state and to the rule of law. A
year from now, when Britain incorporates the European Convention on
Human Rights into domestic law, ordinary Britons will for the first
time have a set of fundamental human rights that can be enforced in
British courts, similar to those guaranteed by the Bill of Rights
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very exciting, and will make a significant change in the
landscape of the types of cases that can be brought in this
country,'' said Di Luping, a legal officer at Liberty, a human
rights group, which represented several of the complainants in the
military case.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's decision to enshrine personal rights in its own legal
system has been a long time in coming. In 1951, Britain ratified
the human-rights convention, which guarantees its citizens a set of
basic human rights including the right to privacy, the right to
freedom of expression and the right not to be tortured.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas behind the convention arose in the aftermath of World
War II, with much of the Western world united in horror at the
excesses that totalitarian regimes could visit upon their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Britain agreed to let its citizens seek redress in
Strasbourg. That was revolutionary in itself _ Britons never before
had specifically delineated rights, only implied ones arising from
common law _ but for various reasons, both political and
philosophical, successive governments shied away from making the
convention part of domestic law. This meant the European Court was
the only option for Britons with specific rights-based complaints,
and it is only open to people who could afford to pay: Legal aid is
not available for such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, aggrieved Britons have trekked to Strasbourg,
bringing cases about a host of issues, from the treatment of
suspected criminals to corporal punishment in schools and the
censorship of material offensive to religious groups. And time and
again, the British government has lost _ on more than 50 occasions,
giving it one of the poorest records among European nations _ and
has had to re-write various laws, however grudgingly, to take into
account the rights guaranteed by the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the days of a European court regularly forcing changes in
British law are nearly over. With the formal incorporation of the
human-rights convention in domestic law, a move that Tony Blair's
Labor government made part of its agenda, Britons will be able to
take complaints to British courts.
</P>
<P>
   Even Britons who feel that the modern culture of entitlement has
gone too far are pleased that, finally, in the words of Sir Ivan
Lawrence, a former Conservative member of Parliament, citizens will
be able to ``wash our dirty linen here, rather than in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Practically, the coming change means that new laws are already
being written with human rights in mind. Judges are undergoing
training to cope with the new system and will have increased power,
not to strike down laws, but to determine whether they adhere to
the rights guaranteed by the convention. And ordinary citizens will
for the first time be able to think of the law as granting them
positive rights, instead of just telling them what they can't do.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the notion that people have rights exists in British
law. But rights are generally couched in the negative, as in, for
instance, laws making it illegal for people to discriminate on the
basis of gender or race. ``Never before has there been enshrined in
any piece of legislation a set of positive rights,'' Ms. Luping
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Britain ever had a written constitution. Its laws are
based purely on precedent, said Francesca Klug, a senior research
fellow at the Human Rights Incorporation Project at King's College
London. It is a system in which old laws remain in effect only
until they are overtaken by new laws, and there is no underlying
written set of principles against which they are measured.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself makes the incorporation of the convention
thrilling to human-rights lawyers and many judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unique in our constitutional history,'' Ms. Klug said.
``We've never had a higher law which applies to everything _ to all
other laws _ before. In a more general sense, it's the first time
in the United Kingdom that we'll have had a set of values in which
we can say that this is what we stand for.''

AS TROOPS ENTER CHECHNYA, RUSSIA SAYS AIMS ARE LIMITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian troops continued to move into Chechnya on
Saturday, spurring speculation that the Kremlin may be planning a
land offensive against the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the troops have advanced only several miles into
Chechnya, according to Russian commanders.
</P>
<P>
   But the skirmishing inside the border and the Kremlin's decision
Friday to anoint an obscure group of pro-Moscow Chechens as the
``sole legitimate authority'' of the republic have prompted anxious
conjecture here about Russia's unfolding military strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The most conservative scenario laid out by the military has the
Russian army taking up and fortifying positions just inside the
Chechen border in an effort to seal that frontier. That would
enable Russia to contain the Islamic rebels who have made two
recent forays into the neighboring region of Dagestan from bases
inside Chechnya, and to put pressure on the authorities in Grozny,
the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Valery Manilov, the Russian military's first deputy chief
of staff, said Saturday that the military's goal was to develop a
three-tier security zone along the border.
</P>
<P>
   The aim, Manilov said, is to establish ``a tough and systemic
control over everybody and everything that crosses the border in
both directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Manilov insisted that there are no immediate plans for a
large-scale ground operation. But analysts say that the Russian
general staff has also developed a much bolder plan.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of this plan, according to Izvestiya and other
newspapers that splashed it across front pages Saturday, is gradual
occupation of the top third of Chechnya down to the Terek River.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons why the Kremlin might find this option
attractive. In terms of broad strategy, it would enable the Russian
military to use its ground forces against Chechnya without
embroiling itself the sort of all-out invasion that led to Russia's
defeat in the 1994-1996 Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Tactically, there are some advantages as well. Russian armor
could maneuver more easily in the northern plains of Chechnya than
in its mountain regions in the south, which are conducive to
ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military could use the Terek River as a defensible
boundary. The population in the north, where many Cossacks live, is
also thought to be more sympathetic to Russia than Chechens in the
rest of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military asserts that the air strikes Moscow has
carried out throughout Chechnya in the last two weeks have also
softened up the opposition. The extended use of air power is a
lesson, Russian officials continue to insist, that they learned
from NATO's campaign in Kosovo.

   Still, even the kind of limited invasion outlined in Saturday's
news media reports would entail enormous risks for the poorly
trained and unmotivated Russian military. The Russian forces in the
northern Caucasus are burdened by an unclear command structure and
would confront bad weather as winter settles in.
</P>
<P>
   It also remains very contentious politically. Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzkhov said the Russian military should insure that the territory
north of the Terek River is a ``militant-free zone.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov _ who is Luzhkov's
political ally and a leading contender to succeed Boris Yeltsin as
president after elections next summer _ Saturday repeated his
opposition to ``sweeping ground operation involving federal forces
in Chechnya, which might evolve into a war.''
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's politicians debate a land attack, some experts say
the Russian military may pursue a third and less obtrusive variant:
the gradual expansion of security zones along the border into the
Chechen interior. The Russian military would gradually extend its
reach into Chechnya but would be careful to avoid describing it as
an ``invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Step by step, the troops will seize zones in the north, west
and east,'' said Ruslan Aushev, the president of Ingushetia, a
republic bordering Chechnya. ``A repeat of 1994 is not likely, but
there is no doubt that the Chechen people will take up arms. They
simply have no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials confirmed that there were sporadic clashes
near the border Saturday. Dagestan's Interior Ministry, however,
said that Russian troops had seized the Chechen village of
Borozdinkova without opposition. The village is about 60 miles from
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Mayrbek Vachagayev, the Chechen representative in Moscow, said
it was possible that the Russian generals have not yet decided how
far to take the fight. He said that a Russian armored column had
penetrated several miles into Chechen territory from the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian troops have taken up positions in the hills there,
and the command of the federal forces does not know what to do
next,'' he told the newspaper Sevodnya.

   Clutch and choke _ as sporting terms, they came from auto racing
and spread to other sports. Hemingway, writing about Joe DiMaggio,
defined ``clutch'' performance for all time: ``Grace under
pressure.'' ``Choke'' has never needed a Hemingway to define it.
</P>
<P>
   Both words are much on the minds of New York baseball fans after
the New York Mets' pennant and playoff hopes were seriously set
back _ if not dashed _ by the Atlanta Braves in successive weeks.
For the most part, Mets fans hold one of two opinions.
</P>
<P>
   One faction, much the larger, holds that the Mets' losses to the
National League East-leading Braves (not to mention to the lowly
Philadelphia Phillies) were classic ``choke.'' The other, more
philosophical, faction holds that, after all, few really expected
the Mets to have 92 victories at that point in the season, and why
call it a choke when the team with the best record in baseball, the
Braves, wins a handful of tough, closely contested games? Isn't
that what the best team is supposed to do? The Mets didn't choke;
the Braves were just the better team. No one has asked the Mets
themselves, but they'd probably prefer the second argument.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, athletes tend to believe in clutch
performance while denying the existence of choke. Every
professional athlete is happy to talk about his favorite big-play
performance, but nobody ever wants to single out the chokers.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewing the former New York Yankee pitcher Jim Bouton a few
years ago, I was curious to see if he thought Ralph Branca choked
when he gave up that famous home run to Bobby Thompson in the 1951
playoffs. ``Why would you call that a choke?'' Bouton replied.
``Branca thought he made a great pitch. Didn't anyone ever hit a
good pitch for a home run?''
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Bubba Smith, the former Baltimore Colts defensive
lineman, if his team choked in the most famous of all Super Bowl
upsets, the 16-7 loss to the Joe Namath-led New York Jets in 1969.
``Hell, no,'' the 290-pound Smith shot back at me. ``We didn't
choke. We went right there and put our game plan into effect.''
Then, I timidly inquired, why did the 22-point-favorite Colts get
stomped? ``Because,'' he said, ``our game plan stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to pin down just what is a clutch or choke performance,
then, is like trying to find evidence for the existence of the Loch
Ness monster: Lots of people swear they have seen it, but no one
has been able to capture it. George Ignatin, an economics professor
at the University of Alabama in Birmingham and a longtime sports
statistician, is adamant. ``Clutch and choke performance in
baseball are illusions,'' he said. ``Someone has to win, someone
has to lose, and if you get a large enough sampling to make a valid
study, you'll find that what a player does in so-called pressure
situations is usually what he has done for his entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why is the impression that a player has choked or come
through in the clutch so strong? ``Because of the drama,'' says
Ignatin. ``We remember the big game in September or the hit in the
ninth inning, but we forget that the games in May or the hits in
the third inning are every bit as important when it comes to
winning games. We want heroes, so we make a hero out of John Elway
for leading fourth-quarter comebacks without noticing the guy who
didn't have to come back in the fourth quarter because he was so
great in the first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to say `He came through in the end with the game on
the line,' but we forget that the game is always on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   But if choking is an illusion in team sports, what about
one-on-one games like tennis, or even a sport involving solitary
performance like golf? Many tennis fans regard Jana Novotna's
Wimbledon flops in 1993 and 1997 as the biggest chokes in modern
time, but Allen St. John, who covered the match for Inside Sports,
insists: ``She was playing over her head, and when she realized it
she came down to earth, hard. Or, to say it another way, what
should have been happening from the beginning suddenly happened at
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In modern golf, no one has more of a crash-and-burn image than
Greg Norman, but Chris Hodenfield, the editor of Golf &AMP; Travel
magazine, thinks Norman's penchant for choking is overstated. ``If
you check, you find a lot of great players who have had similar
folds,'' he said. ``In the 1930s, Craig Wood, like Norman, lost
playoffs in all four major tournaments. Probably no one has more of
a reputation as a clutch performer than Arnold Palmer, but he lost
three playoffs in the U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodenfield calls Palmer's loss of a seven-stroke lead to a
charging Billy Casper in the '66 U.S. Open to be one of the biggest
collapses he's seen by a major player and notes: ``Funny how no one
ever called Arnie a choker. But Norman will probably never shake
that image now, no matter how well he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it would seem that all the evidence indicates that clutch
performance and choking are mostly illusion. The logical part of
the brain may accept that, but the fan in us wants to believe that
our heroes either come through in the clutch or choke with the game
on the line. They say there are no atheists in foxholes, and there
are no philosophers in the ninth inning of a close game.

   NUCLEAR MISHAP IS LATEST BLOW TO JAPAN'S EFFICIENCY IMAGE
</P>
<P>
   This has been the decade of myth-shattering about Japan. First
went the belief that Japan's bureaucrats had a golden touch with
the economy; instead, they turned a downturn into a decade-long
disaster. Then the country's image as a uniquely safe society was
forever damaged by a deadly terrorist attack on the Tokyo subways.
The Kobe earthquake revealed that the government, after endless
earthquake drills, was unprepared to handle the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with a nuclear accident at Tokai, Japan's first and
biggest nuclear complex, another myth is gone: that Japanese
training, care and precision could make inherently dangerous work
far less dangerous. For decades the country that relies on nuclear
power for a third of its electricity has told the Japanese people
that there was absolutely nothing to fear, and that they should
welcome the government's plans to build new and pioneering nuclear
plants and fuel re-processing operations.
</P>
<P>
   A series of previous minor accidents dented Japan's confidence
in those assurances. But Thursday's accident, in which workers
mixing uranium fuel put far too much in the wrong container, was
far worse. At least three plant workers suffered radiation doses
that are normally lethal, and some radiation escaped the plant.
Japanese were outraged by the carelessness and by the government's
failure to issue immediate warnings to the thousands living nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this should not lead to worries about the
nation's nuclear policy,'' said Hiromu Nonaka, the government's
chief Cabinet secretary. But Nonaka, a savvy politician with a good
sense of his country's mood, must have known that the policy is
unlikely to recover. The most advanced program in the world to
re-use nuclear waste, by reprocessing plutonium, was already in
deep trouble. Now even conventional nuclear power programs will be
viewed with enormous suspicion by a nation that, since Hiroshima,
has always had an anti-nuclear bent.

   Time was, likely candidates for president were supposed to be
governors or senators or, as columnist Robert Novak put it dryly
the other day, generals who engineered the defeat of Hitler. Then
the door opened wider, to entrepreneurial billionaires and
television commentators. Now, in the all-media-all-the-time age,
celebrity itself may qualify candidates for a public platform.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty didn't start the fire. As he noted last week, he
simply exploited ``a temporary vacuum that allows you to be
heard,'' in a serious and statistic-studded speech bemoaning the
Democratic Party's drift from liberal principles. Beatty probably
won't run for president, but he may create a little mischief for
those who are. He is hardly the least serious option. Cybill
Shepherd and Donald Trump have also threatened to enter the fray.
</P>
<P>
   And Beatty had barely popped his head up when Talk magazine
reported that another marquee name, Arnold Schwarzenegger, was
worried that his Republican Party might have become too
hard-hearted and was considering running for governor of California
as a compassionate conservative in 2002. ``Could be,'' the
Terminator said.
</P>
<P>
   The late Pat Paulsen ran five comic protest candidacies
beginning in 1968. But today's celebrity candidates are a different
breed, and the possibilities are tantalizing. Rob Reiner has
already volunteered to be Beatty's vice president, and David Geffen
his social secretary. Beatty's pal Garry Shandling had the most
succinct advice in a town where billing is all: ``If you run and
get elected, make sure you get your name above the title of the
country.''

   Doctor's Orders
</P>
<P>
   The next time Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is mentioned
in The New York Times, she will be Dr. Albright. In fact, she has
been doctor for 23 years, and secretary only two. But in The New
York Times, she was a Mrs. (recently updated to Ms.), until she
learned during a visit to the newspaper last week that holders of
doctorates can opt for ``Dr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard for it,'' said Dr. Albright, who earned her
doctorate at Columbia University. She wondered whether the change
might make her appear insecure, but when asked again, she said, ``I
don't see why it shouldn't be Doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who use the title include the likes of Dr. Faustus, who
came to no good, and Dr. Jekyll, who took care to shed the
honorific when he changed to Hyde. One of Dr. Albright's
predecessors, Henry Kissinger, was invariably referred to as Dr.
except by The Times, which took him at his word that he preferred
Mr.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from medical doctors, Americans generally dispense with
the title. But in a country where recent presidents have styled
themselves Jimmy and Bill, a Doctor may simply be a healthy
antidote.

his presidential campaign from Washington to Tennessee, where he

   Rising incomes lifted 1.1 Americans above the official poverty
threshold ($16,665 for a four-person household) last year. But the
nation's strong economy didn't help narrow the income gap between
rich and poor Americans. The gap didn't widen, but a high-end
household making $130,000 still earned eight times more than a
family at the poverty line, which is the same ratio that's existed
since 1993.

   Clinton Tells Prayer Group Of Spiritual Counseling
</P>
<P>
   The annual White House prayer breakfast has become a
confessional for President Clinton. At last year's gathering, held
in the midst of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he tearfully admitted
that he had sinned. Clinton stuck to the same theme this year,
seven months after he was acquitted at a Senate impeachment trial.
He thanked his family and others for forgiving him and revealed
that he has been undergoing regular spiritual counseling to recover
from what he labeled ``one of the most difficult years in my
life.''

little moral outrage to turn ordinary citizens into instant art

   California Aims at HMOs

   For years, consumer groups have complained that health

   Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation that will give consumers the
right to sue their health insurers to seek independent review of

   Court Gets Sex Crimes Case
</P>
<P>
   A law that permits victims of rape and other sex crimes to sue
their attackers for damages in federal court may seem an unlikely
battleground in the federalism wars. But that is what the Violence
Against Women Act became earlier this year when a federal appeals
court declared it unconstitutional as beyond the ``limited
authority'' of the federal government to enter a traditional
province of state law. Now the Supreme Court has announced it will
take up the case.
</P>
<P>
   One issue is whether Congress may, in enforcing the equal
protection guarantee of the 14th amendment, enact a law permitting
one private person to sue another.

   The appeals court said no, casting a shadow over other civil
rights laws and raising the stakes in this case.

   Yugoslavia gave its own estimate of the damage wreaked by NATO's

of damage, and demanded that NATO pay the bill. Some European
officials have estimated that it could cost $30 billion to $50
billion to repair the damage.

   Asked later for a tally of the repairs needed, the Yugoslav

   A Nobel for Guenter Grass
</P>
<P>
   Forty years after the publication of his masterpiece, ``The Tin
Drum,'' a book that vividly confronted the ghosts that post-war
Germany seemed inclined to forget, Guenter Grass was awarded the
Nobel Prize for literature. A man of passionate political
engagement, a persistent critic of what he has often portrayed as
the smug complacency of German society, Grass was praised by the
Swedish Academy for his portrayal of the ``forgotten face of
history.'' That face has come alive with an often Rabelaisian gusto
in the writings of the 71-year-old Grass.

   Man Dies in Gene Therapy
</P>
<P>
   An 18-year old patient died four days after receiving a gene
therapy treatment at the University of Pennsylvania. If the therapy
proves to be the cause, it will be apparently the first
treatment-related death in a gene therapy trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Gelsinger was among 18 patients being treated for a rare
metabolic disease caused by a genetic inability to process ammonia.
A high dose of adenovirus carrying a corrective gene was injected
into his liver.
</P>
<P>
   Although the virus is usually harmless, Gelsinger seems to have
reacted badly to it. Some 50 other gene therapy trials are now in
progress with adenovirus.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The government insisted the advisory was purely a matter of
safety. One outraged child-rearing expert called it
``self-righteous baloney.'' And many parents did not know what to
think when the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission warned
that sleeping with infants and toddlers can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1997, the agency found, 121 children under 2
were smothered by a parent or other adult sleeping in the same bed;
394 others died after becoming trapped in the bed structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not sleep with your baby or put the baby down to sleep in
an adult bed,'' said Ann Brown, the commission's chairman. Critics
charged that the study's methods were flawed. Practiced
responsibly, they argued, bed sharing is good for babies.

   Smithsonian Gets Huge Gift
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, the Smithsonian Institution has received huge
gifts from two refugees who were driven from the same homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The latest is from Steven Udvar-Hazy, whose family fled Hungary &QL; 
when the Soviet Union crushed the 1956 uprising. Udvar-Hazy, who
became a billionaire in the aircraft leasing business, is giving
$60 million toward a new aviation museum.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier gift was from the late Dr. Paul Singer, who left the
museum his collection of ancient Chinese artifacts, valued at $50
million to $60 million. Singer, a psychiatrist, was born in an
Austro-Hungarian town that is now in Hungary, and he fled Austria
in 1938 when the Nazis marched in.

   Vice President Al Gore, lagging in the polls and in fund raising
behind former Sen. Bill Bradley, has decided he needs more of an
``outsider'' image. As a result, he is moving the headquarters for
his presidential campaign from Washington to Tennessee, where he
spent his boyhood summers. He cuts the ribbon on the Nashville

over their latest technological triumph, the apparent reversal of

visitation rights, even against a parent's will, is complex. In
Washington state, visitation rights were awarded under a law giving

that the elder Bush's history and the younger Bush's destiny

pressure.' `Choke` has never needed a Hemingway to define it. By
Allen Barra.

<P>
   GOP-BUDGET-REVIEW (Washington) _ The GOP, custodians of fiscal
responsibility, in the hot seat. It has been the deliberate
strategy of House Republicans to promise the American people that
they would not finance the operations of the government by spending
money out of the Social Security trust fund. To try to keep this
promise, the Republicans thus far have used every accounting device
in the book, and some previously unrecorded, to try to make the
numbers add up the way they want. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY-LAUNDER-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at why it's so hard to
nail the bad guys in money-laundering cases. Much of the money
flowing around the world these days flits across borders
electronically in the blink of an eye. And that can be much harder
for banks to monitor than paper checks. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN-BIO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Critics have chided Edmund Morris
for writing Forrest Gump-or-Zelig-meets-the-Gipper instead of a
conventional biography of Ronald Reagan. But such comparisons are
inexact. Forrest Gump and Zelig were comic creations, while Morris
is a serious biographer with a serious mission. He is trying to
make myths in the only way they can be made in these ironic times:
by pretending someone else is narrating.
</P>
<P>
   TWAIN-HANGING-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Back when hangings were a
gruesome public spectacle, people turned out to see the show _ Mark
Twain included. His eyewitness account of a celebrated 1868 hanging
in Virginia City, Nev., was recently rediscovered. Some excerpts.

   CHINA-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ Half a century of fearing
China: if you ask the `Old China Hands' _ men like like John Paton
Davies and his younger counterparts who traveled the countryside as
Mao battled the Nationalists _ the problem of striking a balanced
view of China in Washington has never been easy. In fact, the
popular imagery has almost always been out of sync with the
reality. By Alan Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-MASSACRE-REVIEW (Paris) _ The report that U.S. soldiers
massacred civilians in the Korean War raises a larger question: at
the end of the 20th century, the century of total war, can the
protection of civilians ever be more than a thin pretension, even
when protecting civilians is the declared war aim? Recent
experience in the Balkans is not encouraging. By Craig Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-RIGHTS-REVIEW (London) _ Britain prepares for a
constitutional revolution that will profoundly alter its citizens'
relationship to the state and the rule of law. A year from now,
when Britain incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights
into domestic law, ordinary Britons will for the first time have a
set of fundamental human rights that can be enforced in British
courts, similar to those guaranteed by the Bill of Rights in the

   MONEY-LAUNDER-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at why it's so hard to
nail the bad guys in money-laundering cases. Much of the money
flowing around the world these days flits across borders
electronically in the blink of an eye. And that can be much harder
for banks to monitor than paper checks. By Timothy L. O'Brien.

<P>
   REAGAN-BIO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Critics have chided Edmund Morris
for writing Forrest Gump-or-Zelig-meets-the-Gipper instead of a
conventional biography of Ronald Reagan. But such comparisons are
inexact. Forrest Gump and Zelig were comic creations, while Morris
is a serious biographer with a serious mission. He is trying to
make myths in the only way they can be made in these ironic times:
by pretending someone else is narrating.

China: if you ask the `Old China Hands' _ men like like John Paton
Davies and his younger counterparts who traveled the countryside as
Mao battled the Nationalists _ the problem of striking a balanced
view of China in Washington has never been easy. In fact, the
popular imagery has almost always been out of sync with the
reality. By Alan Sanger.

   KOREA-MASSACRE-REVIEW (Paris) _ The report that U.S. soldiers
massacred civilians in the Korean War raises a larger question: at
the end of the 20th century, the century of total war, can the
protection of civilians ever be more than a thin pretension, even

constitutional revolution that will profoundly alter its citizens'
relationship to the state and the rule of law. A year from now,

set of fundamental human rights that can be enforced in British
courts, similar to those guaranteed by the Bill of Rights in the
U.S. By Sarah Lyall.

RIVAL BIOGRAPHIES OF BUSH ARE RUSHING TO PRINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has never been a
particularly fervent reader of books. But he is about to become a
favorite subject of them.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most telling measures yet of the aura of
inevitability surrounding his presidential candidacy, publishers
are rushing out a string of competing biographies of Bush, most of
which are due in stores even before the first Republican caucus or
primary in late January.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Times Books, a division of Random House, will
publish ``First Son: George W. Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty.''
That is not to be confused with ``Fortunate Son: The Rise of George
W. Bush and the Next Generation of American Politics,'' which
Thomas Dunne Books, an imprint of St. Martin's, will release around
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperion expects to join the scrum in January with ``W: the
Rise, Fall and Rise of the Bush Dynasty.'' And soon after that,
Random House weighs in again with ``Shrub: The Short but Happy
Political Life of George W. Bush,'' co-written by Molly Ivins, the
acerbic Texas journalist, and Lou Dubose, editor of the Texas
Observer, a liberal biweekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers and writers of these books say that even if
Bush's campaign falters in the months ahead, his ancestry and
stewardship of the nation's second most populous state make his
story a compelling one.
</P>
<P>
   But they also concede that there is an element of soothsaying
behind this literary gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely got the nomination,'' said Martha Levin,
publisher of Hyperion, referring to Bush's sizable lead over other
Republicans who want to represent the party in the general
election, which is still more than a year away.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin added that if Bush then fails to win the presidency
itself, ``There's no question in my mind that he'll be president at
a later date _ he's not going away.''
</P>
<P>
   These books _ all set in motion before Bush announced his
candidacy in June _ underscore the extraordinary extent of the
early, widespread, perhaps self-fulfilling assumption that Bush is
the presidential candidate to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But they also point out a potential downside of running so far
ahead of the pack: a level of scrutiny that has writers tripping
over one another to find new nuggets of information and fresh
strands of thought about Bush that could turn out to be
unflattering.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Bush and his aides have hastened to finish his
own book, which has had a turbulent production. A Texas journalist
originally paired with Bush to do the writing was replaced by Karen
P. Hughes, the director of communications for Bush's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers deemed it important that he answer the other
versions of his story with his own. So Ms. Hughes spent about four
weeks in August and September holed up in her Austin, Texas, home,
ensuring that the book, ``A Charge to Keep,'' published by William
Morrow and Co., will be in stores by November.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hughes, one of Bush's most trusted advisers, did not leave
her writing and return to the campaign trail even when Bush
encountered several tense days of repeated questions about whether
he had used illegal drugs in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush said that Ms. Hughes stepped in after the book's
initial author, Mickey Herskowitz, a sports columnist for the
Houston Chronicle who has known Bush for decades, missed his first
deadline in July.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said that the few chapters that Herskowitz, who has
written autobiographies with Mickey Mantle, Dan Rather and Gene
Tierney, turned in had been disappointing, lacking the kind of
insight into Bush's political decision-making that they wanted the
book to have.
</P>
<P>
   Herskowitz said that he had missed his first deadline by only a
few days. And he said he had trouble completing his work, because
Bush's advisers had expected him to write the majority of the book,
which was to be about Bush's political philosophy, by simply
reading transcripts of his speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Herskowitz said that when he asked Bush's staff for more
detailed policy information, he was told that it was still evolving
and that they did not want the book to pin Bush down or provide
fodder for later criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between your everyday book project and a
book that's attached to a political campaign,'' Herskowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidential candidates are also producing their own
books, in an increasingly standard rite of political passage that
blurs any line between literary and elective aspirations. ``Faith
of My Fathers,'' an autobiography of Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
one of Bush's rivals for the Republican nomination, is a current
best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan's recent historical book, ``A Republic, Not an
Empire,'' drew furious criticism for his isolationist views on
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is the only Republican in a crowded field of
presidential contenders who is inspiring so many unauthorized
biographies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bill Minutaglio, the author of ``First Son,'' said that one
reason was the fleetness of Bush's political ascent, which has
created a gap between people's awareness of him and their actual
familiarity with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real thirst for some knowledge,'' said Minutaglio, a
reporter for the Dallas Morning News who is based in Austin, the
state capital. ``People want to know: Why all the fuss?''
</P>
<P>
   Minutaglio's book _ the only one so far for which an advance
copy was available _ is written in a fairly detached tone and
strives to be an objective, comprehensive portrait of Bush's
ancestry, life and times.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ivins said that the book she and Dubose are writing, which
focuses on Bush's political record, reaches the pointed conclusion
that Bush ``is a gifted politician neither interested in, nor
gifted at, governance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sex, no drugs, no Sigmund Freud,'' Ms. Ivins added.
``Why would anyone read this book? Because it's funny _ it's about
Texas. We couldn't help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicity materials for ``Fortunate Son,'' by J.H. Hatfield,
make it sound a bit racier than its competitors and promise juicy
tidbits about the way Bush ``avoided the draft at the height of
Vietnam'' and the reason ``Bush's parents pressured him to break
off his engagement to his first fiancee.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield's previous book was a similarly unauthorized biography
of Patrick Stewart, the bald-headed star of the television series
``Star Trek: The Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin said that ``W,'' by Elizabeth Mitchell, a former
contributor to George magazine, will focus on the dynamics within
the Bush family and the extent to which Bush's presidential bid is
an attempt to avenge the 1992 defeat of his father, President
George Bush, by Bill Clinton.

AS CAMPAIGN CASH POURS IN, SPENDING RECORDS SHATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the phenomenal pace of political fund-raising
continues, candidates for federal office will spend about $3
billion in the 2000 campaigns, an increase of about $800 million
from four years earlier, according to projections based on Federal
Election Commission data.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has raised an unprecedented
$56 million in just seven months, is hardly alone in reaping the
benefits of this cash-flush political season. This year's
fund-raising totals for House and Senate incumbents and the
national political parties have shattered all records, easily
exceeding the most optimistic projections of chief fund-raisers and
political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   By November 2000, the congressional races alone could cost $1
billion, experts estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Fund raising for the congressional elections is being bolstered
by the intense fight for control of the House of Representatives,
where Republicans hold a six-seat majority. In the first six months
of 1999, House incumbents raised $77.9 million, which is 47 percent
more than they raised in the first half of 1997 and 88 percent more
than they raised in the first half of 1995, according to Federal
Election Commission statistics.
</P>
<P>
   And soft money donations, the unlimited contributions to the
parties for party-building activities, have increased 55 percent in
the first half of 1999 over the same period in 1997. Soft money
contributions are 75 percent higher this year than they were in the
first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Experts project that there is likely to be at least $525 million
in soft money contributed to the six major national political party
committees by November 2000. That would be more than double the
$262 million in soft money that was contributed to the parties in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate prepares to debate later this month the merits of
a sweeping campaign finance bill that would ban soft money, several
campaign finance experts helped The New York Times project the
total amount of money that would be raised by candidates and the
national parties for the 2000 federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a public policy
organization here, assisted the Times by studying the pace of fund
raising in the first six months of 1999 and comparing it with the
same periods in the past three election cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer estimated that the 2000 elections would cost nearly
$3 billion, which he called ``a conservative estimate.'' But he and
others said that the figure very likely could exceed $3 billion,
especially if campaign fund raising continued at its current torrid
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are extraordinary numbers,'' said Wertheimer, who is an
outspoken advocate of overhauling campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ending this century with oceans of political influence
money flooding our democracy and drowning out the voices of average
citizens,'' said Wertheimer, who has accurately projected costs of
campaigns for 20 years. ``The historic idea we have contributed to
the world, democratic self-government, is at risk here in our own
country because of the corrupt campaign finance practices that
pervade Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer said that fund raising was up 95 percent in the
House, but he estimated that the increase would be only 35 percent
by November 2000. ``Fund raising in the first six months this year
has been extremely intensive,'' Wertheimer said. ``But that doesn't
mean this pace will sustain itself for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Steurer, an aide to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is
the Senate's most ardent opponent of limits on campaign
contributions, did not dispute the $3 billion estimate, but he
added that the costs of campaigns had increased markedly.

<P>
   Some campaign finance experts say it is very difficult to
estimate at this stage how much money will be raised by the end of
the election cycle in November 2000. There are too many variables,
they say, and they cautioned that the projections could be gross
overestimates or underestimates of the actual figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's throwing darts,'' said Kent Cooper, a former senior staff
member at the Federal Election Commission who is the co-founder of
a Washington research firm, Public Disclosure Inc., that operates a
comprehensive research Web site (www.tray.com).
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raisers and campaign finance experts offer several
explanations for the windfall this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raisers attribute much of their success to the booming
economy, saying that the nation's prosperity makes it easier for
more people to write checks of $1,000, the maximum an individual
can give to one candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel flush,'' said Herbert E. Alexander, a professor
emeritus of political science at the University of Southern
California who has written extensively on campaign finance trends.
``People have enormous paper profits from the stock market boom,
and the technology people are suddenly millionaires and
billionaires. I just think there is a lot of money around, and
people want to use it to influence the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible explanation for the early fund-raising pace is
the early presidential primary schedule, in which most of the major
primaries will be over by late March. The earlier schedule has
added to the perception among fund-raisers that they have less time
to raise more money.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, the executive director of the Center for
Responsive Politics, said he agreed with the estimate that $3
billion would be spent on the 2000 elections. ``A 50 percent
increase from 1996 sounds right to me,'' he said. He also agreed
with the projection that at least $1 billion would be raised and
spent on the congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition breeds the appetite for money,'' Makinson said.
``It's impossible to imagine higher stakes. You have the real
tangible potential for the Republicans to control all three
branches of government _ the presidency, the Congress and let us
not forget the Supreme Court. A lot of donors are licking their
chops at the prospect of a Republican-dominated government, and
they will give big money to try to attain it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Makinson also said that he thought there would be ``an
explosion'' in independent expenditures on such things as issue
advocacy advertisements. In 1996, the Annenberg Public Policy
Center estimated that $45 million to $60 million was spent on issue
advocacy advertisements. In February, John J. Sweeney, the
president of the AFL-CIO, declared that the labor federation would
spend as much as $46 million in 1999 and 2000 on grass-roots
lobbying and campaigning. Sweeney emphasized that the money would
be used for political literature, phone banks to get out the vote,
issue advertisements and voter registration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the unions spent $35 million on such activities,
although the Republican leaders dispute that figure. Republicans
estimated that organized labor spent as much as $500 million on the
1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican congressional leadership, meanwhile, is also
helping to raise millions of dollars for issue advertising to
counter the union effort.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer said that he estimated that at least $200 million
would be spent this year and next year on such issue
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, fund-raisers said that they were astonished by
the rate of contributions pouring in for House and Senate
incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 73 Senate candidates have raised $50 million in the
first six months of 1999, according to election commission figures.
</P>
<P>
   That amount is more than seven times the $7 million that 50
candidates raised through the first half of 1993, the last election
cycle for the current group of 33 Senate seats that are now up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Makinson predicted that the presidential race might very well be
``locked up'' by October 2000, but that the fight for control of
the House would produce enormous last-minute contributions. ``Let's
not forget the impact of the wide-open race for control of the
House of Representatives,'' he said. ``When we're a month out, the
House race will be the most important race to be decided, and it
will attract a lot of last-minute money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than $60 million of soft money was raised in the first half
of this year, a 75 percent increase over the first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts predicted that the parties would raise
at least $500 million in soft money by November 2000. But they
cautioned that the figure could be significantly higher, especially
after more contributions solicited by Bush's ``Pioneers''
fund-raising club of 150 people are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Republican fund-raising officials have already said that the
Pioneers network is a ready-made soft money club. By June 1999, the
Pioneers had contributed $3 million of soft money, but campaign
finance experts predict that they will raise huge sums of money for
the Republican Party later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be going gangbusters for the unlimited soft money
contributions,'' Makinson said.

COMMENTARY: CULTURAL DRIFTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are some things you might not know about
George W. Bush:
</P>
<P>
   _ He hasn't gone out to see a movie in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   _ He likes Van Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   _ The last actress who made his heart race was Julie Christie in
``Doctor Zhivago.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He doesn't identify with any literary heroes, but is drawn to
Paul Newman's defiance in ``Cool Hand Luke'' and Jack Nicholson's
irreverence.
</P>
<P>
   _ He loved ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview about culture, W. gamely concedes there are
yawning gaps. Baseball, he says, is his favorite ``cultural
experience.'' (Like his father, he views cultural questions as some
kind of psychoanalysis.)
</P>
<P>
   We're in a van on the way to Reagan airport after his speech to
the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   He has one word for opera: ``No.'' He likes ``nice, quiet jazz
on the radio.'' He went to one ballet ``and was amazed by the
athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the Bushes are musical _ his uncle Jonathan was
in a Bronx, N.Y., revival of ``Oklahoma'' in 1958 and his uncle
Bucky plays the guitar and sings _ W. is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved `Cats,''' he says brightly.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't watch TV series, just news and sports.
``Culturally adrift,'' he says, making a funny face.
``Occasionally, I'll cruise into an A&AMP;E biography. The last one I
saw was about me.''
</P>
<P>
   He avoids cable chat. ``Now that I'm the subject, there's no
telling what you'll hear about yourself. So I've just chosen not to
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's usually asleep by Leno and Letterman, but adds:
``They're actually very funny. Even at my own expense.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked if he and his wife, Laura, ever fight over the clicker.
He says he's mostly doing work stuff or falling asleep. ``We're
both usually reading instead of battling over flickers.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not try to impress his librarian wife when they were
dating by reading more. ``Our first date was to go play putt-putt
golf,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As to literary preferences, he said: ``I've always liked John La
Care, Le Carrier, or however you pronounce his name. I'm mainly a
history person.'' He's just finished ``Isaac's Storm,'' a history
of the Galveston hurricane of 1900, and reads Robert Parker's
detective-for-hire stories.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he likes movies, he says: ``Not too much. I like 'em
OK. I haven't been to a movie theater since I've been governor. We
occasionally rent movies. We've got a Blockbuster card the girls
use more than Laura and me. The last movie I saw I really liked was
`Saving Private Ryan.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But prior to getting elected I did go to movies. Laura and I
were talking the other day about the last time we'd gone to a
movie. I think it was the day Ann Richards called me a jerk. It was
`Forrest Gump.'''
</P>
<P>
   Has he ever censored his twin 17-year-old daughters' movie
picks? ``I can't think of anything. Uh oh, a giant hole in the net
of censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with GQ, the 53-year-old governor said that when
he was at Yale in the '60s, he did not share the musical tastes of
the counterculture. He said he liked the Beatles before their
``weird, psychedelic period.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked who was his favorite Beatle. ``The first drummer,'' he
joked. ``As you know, I was a fraternity man at Yale. I had
parties. We had a lot of groups come in. I just was not, I mean, I
like music. But I'm not a great aficionado of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would set a cultural tone in the White House closer
to Jackie's Pablo Casals or Bill's Kenny G, W. replied: ``I imagine
it would be eclectic. You know we've had Lyle Lovett come to the
mansion to play. I probably won't be spending a lot of time making
the list up. I'll delegate.''
</P>
<P>
   W. sometimes waggles his hips when he's on a stage. Does he like
to dance?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``It's not a religious thing. I just don't
dance. At the last inauguration, I did the box step for about 25
seconds and declared my dancing over for the year. ... I don't go
to dances and I don't socialize very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Warren Beatty's presidential flirting, W. asks
something that probably hasn't even dawned on the Hollywood star:
``The question is, can he survive the Iowa caucuses?''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's perfect day would include running, fishing and
watching sports on TV, followed by dinner with friends with Van
Morrison playing in the background. Then, bed by 10.

JUSTICES TO RULE ON NATION'S MOST ARDENT DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening its new term on Monday, the Supreme Court
returns from a three-month recess to a docket that places the
justices squarely in the midst of some of the United States' most
passionate debates, from health care to campaign finance to
government aid to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the court will continue its re-examination of the
boundary between federal authority and state sovereignty, taking up
new cases that move the federalism battleground into the arena of
civil rights legislation, where the stakes are higher than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The justices accepted 15 new cases in the last three weeks,
bringing the total to 44 and filling their argument calendar
through January. Cases to be heard in the late winter and spring,
perhaps several dozen more, will be added over the next few months
to complete the 1999-2000 term.
</P>
<P>
   Important cases scheduled for the term's opening days suggest
the range of what awaits the justices. On Monday, they will hear
arguments on whether a 1996 law, the Anti-Terrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act, left any meaningful role for the federal courts
in reviewing state prisoners' convictions and sentences.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the court will hear Missouri's defense of its $1,075
contribution limit for statewide political campaigns, in a case
with clear implications for the similar limits under federal
election law.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the court will take up a constitutional challenge
to a provision of Hawaii law that limits to descendants of the
native Hawaiians the right to vote in certain elections.
Transcending its exotic locale, this dispute could be a vehicle for
a broader ruling about using race as a basis for government
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how early in the term Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg will be able to return to work, after her surgery for
colon cancer on Sept. 17. After her doctors found no sign that a
small tumor had spread, she was discharged from a hospital here
last week with an excellent prognosis. If Ginsburg cannot
participate in the early arguments, she has the option of listening
to the tapes and voting in the cases.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the opening day, the court will also announce the
disposition of more than 1,700 appeals that have accumulated during
the recess, nearly all of which the justices will turn down without
further review.
</P>
<P>
   These are the highlights of the new term so far:
</P>
<P>
   Federalism
</P>
<P>
   In a series of decisions over the last four years, the court has
invoked a variety of constitutional doctrines to curb the authority
of Congress to impose requirements on state governments or to make
the states answerable for their behavior as defendants in private
lawsuits in either federal or state court. Most of these cases were
decided by 5-4 majorities, and federalism remains the current
court's most contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   The four federalism cases on the docket for the new term may
well fan the flames even higher, because these cases have broad
implications for the ability of Congress to enact civil rights
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The question in United States vs. Morrison, No. 99-5, is whether
Congress had the authority to pass the Violence Against Women Act,
a 1994 law that permitted victims of rape and other crimes
``motivated by gender'' to sue their attackers in federal court. A
federal appeals court ruled that the law was not a valid exercise
of the power of Congress either to regulate interstate commerce or
to enforce the equal-protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In Kimel vs. Florida Board of Regents, No. 98-791, the court
will decide whether employees of state agencies can sue states for
age discrimination under a federal law, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act. The justices' answer may determine whether other
anti-discrimination laws, including such measures as the Americans
With Disabilities Act, can be applied to the states.
</P>
<P>
   The court will decide in Reno vs. Condon, No. 98-1464, whether
state motor vehicle agencies can be bound by a federal law that
prohibits the commercial sale of drivers' personal information,
which many states have found to be a profitable commodity. And in
Vermont Agency of Natural Resources vs. United States, No. 98-1828,
the question is whether states are constitutionally immune from
suit by private whistle-blowers under the federal False Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   Free Speech
</P>
<P>
   The court has six First Amendment cases on the docket, an
unusually high number that may reflect the unsettled nature of many
free-speech questions. For example, the lower federal courts appear
to be uncertain about the continuing validity of aspects of the
Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in Buckley vs. Valeo, which established
the current constitutional framework for campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in St. Louis struck down Missouri's
$1,075 limit on contributions, close to the $1,000 limit the court
upheld in the Buckley case, on the ground that inflation since 1976
has whittled the value of $1,000 to under $400. That amount is too
restrictive of the right of a citizen to ``speak'' by means of
political contributions, the appeals court said in Nixon vs. Shrink
Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Supreme Court does not appear to have much appetite
for reopening the campaign-finance issue itself, even a narrowly
based upholding of the Missouri decision could have that effect by
presumptively invalidating the federal limits.
</P>
<P>
   In a case involving the privacy of government records, the court
will decide the constitutionality of a California law that makes
arrest records available for journalistic and some other purposes,
but not for commercial use, such as for sale to lawyers and
insurance companies. In Los Angeles Police Department vs. United
Reporting Publishing Corp., No. 98-678, the department is appealing
a federal appeals court's ruling that the restriction on commercial
access violates the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Another First Amendment dispute involves student activity fees
at public universities. The federal appeals court in Chicago,
viewing the fee at the University of Wisconsin as equivalent to
compelled speech, ruled that students who objected to particular
student organizations that received a share of the money had a
constitutional right not to contribute. In Board of Regents vs.
Southworth, No. 98-1189, the university is arguing that the fee
simply establishes a public forum in which all viewpoints are
represented.
</P>
<P>
   Two cases concern sexually explicit speech or expression. In one
_ Erie, Pa. vs. Pap's A.M., No. 98-1161, the court will revisit,
for the first time in eight years, the government's ability to
regulate nude dancing. The question in United States vs. Playboy
Entertainment Group, No. 98-1682, is the validity of a federal law
requiring providers of sexually explicit cable television
programming to scramble the signal or limit the hours so that
nonsubscribing homes cannot receive the programming inadvertently
when children are watching.
</P>
<P>
   In Hill vs. Colorado, No. 98-1856, the court will consider, for
the third time in recent years, the validity of restrictions on
protests outside abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Religion
</P>
<P>
   A program under which local school districts use federal money
to provide computers and other equipment to private schools,
including religious schools, within their boundaries was declared
unconstitutional by a federal appeals court. The Clinton
administration is supporting the appeal in Mitchell vs. Helms, No.
98-1648, a case that may indicate how receptive the justices will
be in cases not yet before the court to arguments for publicly
financed vouchers for parochial school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Equal Protection
</P>
<P>
   Under the Hawaii Constitution, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs
decides how millions of dollars are to be spent on behalf of the
state's native Hawaiian people, and only people of Hawaiian
ancestry may vote for its trustees. The lower federal courts have
rejected a Hawaii-born white man's challenge to this restriction as
an illegitimate racial qualification on voting. Defending its
system in Rice vs. Cayetano, No. 98-818, Hawaii is arguing that the
restriction is based on Hawaii's special history and not on race as
such.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Law
</P>
<P>
   Several cases have important implications for federal regulatory
programs and policies. In Food and Drug Administration vs. Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco, No. 98-1152, the court will decide whether the
government has authority under current law to regulate tobacco as a
drug, a proposition that was rejected by a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   In Pegram vs. Herdrich, No. 98-1152, the justices will decide
whether people who receive medical care as a benefit of employment
can sue health maintenance organizations for putting
cost-containment goals above their duty to act in the best interest
of individual patients.
</P>
<P>
   The question in Friends of the Earth vs. Laidlaw Environmental
Services, No. 98-822, is whether a defendant in a suit brought by
private citizens under the Clean Water Act can escape liability for
civil penalties if it stops polluting while the lawsuit is in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Law
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois vs. Wardlow, No. 98-1036, the court will decide
whether someone's unprovoked flight at the sight of a police
officer is such inherently suspicious behavior as to justify the
officer in pursuing and stopping the person and conducting a
pat-down search.
</P>
<P>
   The question in Williams vs. Taylor, No. 98-8384, is what degree
of deference the federal courts owe to state-court determinations
in reviewing a state prisoner's constitutional challenge to a
conviction or sentence. The court will be interpreting the central
portions of the 1996 law by which Congress sharply restricted the
jurisdiction of federal judges to issue writs of habeas corpus; the
question is, how sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents' Rights
</P>
<P>
   In a case from the state of Washington, the court will rule on
the constitutionality of state laws that give grandparents, and
other relatives and ``third parties,'' the right to seek
court-ordered visitation over the objection of children's parents.
The Washington Supreme Court struck down the law as violating the
fundamental right of parents to decide how to raise their children.
</P>
<P>
   While this case, Troxel vs. Granville, No. 99-138, will give
high visibility to the question of grandparents' rights, it also
raises the deeper question, under the 14th Amendment's guarantee of
due process, of how courts should identify and analyze fundamental
rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAGDISHPUR, India _ Like a maharajah of old, Laloo Yadav,
self-proclaimed tribune of the downtrodden, sailed to this remote,
dirt poor village last week in a wooden boat, standing grandly at
its prow. His bejeweled fingers flashed as he waved to the people
on shore. A servant held an umbrella aloft to shade him from a
blazing sun.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade, Laloo, as he is universally known, has
ruled India's poorest and second most populous state with a sly,
rustic wit. He had come here to seek the votes of country people in
India's monthlong national elections. Voting largely concludes
Sunday, with counting on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When this son of an illiterate cowherd first came to power in
the northern state of Bihar in March 1990, he symbolized the rise
of India's peasant castes to the political heights _ and the hope
that this new generation of leaders would improve the lives of
people long dominated by the ruling upper castes.
</P>
<P>
   Yadav's theatrical defiance of the elite and his elevation of
his own caste members to high government position have given many
poor people a feeling for the first time that they have a place in
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But with the passage of years, the hope that Yadav's brand of
populism would materially improve the common people's standard of
living has been dashed. In the 1990s, as India's national
government has loosened its viselike grip on the economy and
business people have been given more freedom about where to invest,
the gap between the richest and poorest states has widened, with
Bihar bringing up the rear.
</P>
<P>
   While leaders in other states have courted private investors,
cut budget deficits and built roads and power grids, Yadav, who
heads his party, and his wife, Rabri Devi, who has served as chief
minister since he got in trouble on public corruption charges, have
let Bihar slide further into debt. Roads are crumbling. The state
has attracted virtually no foreign investment during their tenure.
Electrical power has remained in acutely short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Yadav, 51, still glories in his folk-hero status like a bantam
rooster and conjures the symbols of rural life with a showman's
mastery. He lets his billy goats graze in the rose garden of the
chief minister's mansion. He thumbs his nose at the Brahmans and
extols the virtues of cow dung on the floor of Parliament. And as
he picked his toes and squirted chewing tobacco juice from the side
of his mouth, he never let anyone forget that he had once been a
poor, shoeless farm boy who is missing toenails because water
buffalo stomped on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   But he and his wife have offered no broad vision for building
the economy or curbing population growth. In fact, they had nine
children because the first six were girls, and his mother, like
most Indians, favored boys.
</P>
<P>
   The state's failure to progress may finally be taking a toll on
his popularity. A recent poll found that 70 percent of Bihar's
voters are dissatisfied with the state government.
</P>
<P>
   The current election will test whether the alliance of Muslims
and Yadavs, the large caste of cowherds and small farmers, coupled
with some support from other low castes, can retain power.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yadav's party, which governs Bihar in an alliance with the
national Congress Party, is opposed by the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, which is largely dependent on upper-caste
voters in Bihar, and that party's state-level allies, who now
include another low-caste leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only explanation for Laloo's continuing hold on power
seems to be that he's a powerful symbol for the masses who support
him,'' said Ashutosh Varshney, a political scientist at Notre Dame.
``He has challenged upper-caste dominance of Bihar much more
frontally than any of his predecessors.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, northern states where a quarter of
India's 1 billion people live, the so-called backward castes _
above the lowest castes of untouchables but beneath the upper ranks
of Brahmans and traders _ have yet to move beyond the politics of
patronage and symbolism and secure better health, education and job
prospects for the rural poor.
</P>
<P>
   As economic growth surged across India this decade, Bihar, with
a population of 100 million, remained what Abusaleh Shariff, an
economist, called ``a black hole right on the face of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bihar's economy has stagnated despite its wealth of natural
resources. Its residents have left in droves to hunt for jobs
elsewhere. More than half the people are illiterate and grindingly
poor. Almost two-thirds of children age 4 or younger are stunted by
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Bihar has managed to get food grains that are heavily subsidized
by the national government to only one out of every 20 households,
while states in south India are consistently reaching seven or
eight out of every 10.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bihar's reputation for public corruption has
deepened. Yadav was charged in 1996 in what he says is a conspiracy
trumped up by his political opponents. He has been accused of
conspiring with state officials to steal vast sums of money from a
state agricultural program that was meant to help struggling
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Yadav went to jail in 1997, his party installed
his wife, Ms. Devi, a village woman with a fifth-grade education,
as chief minister. Freed on bail and with a raft of cases still
pending against him, Yadav won a seat in Parliament in 1998 and has
continued to serve as the president of his state-based party, the
Rashtriya Janta Dal, which, in Hindi, means National People's
Party.
</P>
<P>
   To visit his parliamentary constituency in the desperately poor
northeastern part of the state is to travel back into a feudal
time. The 160-mile journey along the pockmarked macadam from the
state capital of Patna to his district takes eight bone-jarring
hours. After heavy rains, every crater is full of water. Swarms of
mosquitoes rise from the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Except for an occasional police jeep or tractor, motorized
vehicles virtually disappear. The roads are thronged with rickshaws
and bicycles, ox carts and jangling horses and buggies, and above
all with men in loincloths and women in saris trudging along with
scythes and hoes over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Yadav does not drive to his district from Patna, but zips in by
helicopter and takes over the large home of a local hotelier.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, a crowd of supplicants and party workers
gathered outside the bedroom where he and his wife were ensconced.
The crowd craned for a peek into the room as a parade of servants
carried in tray after tray of breakfast food, plates of spicy
vegetables and pots of yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, about 9 a.m., Yadav, a compact man with a jiggling
belly, emerged in a pristine white shirt and pants. As he sat in a
chair, furiously plotting strategy with his cronies, men touched
his feet. He barely deigned to look at them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As he held forth, servants came bearing a small tray of betel
leaf, betel nuts and tobacco, which he stuffed into his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Yadav clearly loves an audience. After he finished the campaign
business, he sketched out the conspiracy against him for listeners
who jostled to get near. The Hindu nationalists, in league with the
multinationals and ``American money,'' had bought off the news
media and rigged the exit polls against the Congress Party alliance
he was part of, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the American money, the multinational money,'' he
said, his words garbled by his full cheek of tobacco. ``I will ask
my people to boycott the goods of multinationals. I do not want to
make India a consumer of the world. They are destroying employment
of the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   He headed out for a long day of campaigning. After his first
stop, he had to go by boat to reach the village of Jagdishpur
because the bridge had been washed out during floods.
</P>
<P>
   Once he arrived, Yadav mounted a small platform beneath a
spreading peepul tree, where lanky, barefoot boys dangled from the
branches. A crowd of thousands materialized from the surrounding
rice paddies and villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laloo Prasad Yadav is the Indian Mandela,'' he boasted from
the stage, as he directed the dusty, weathered people before him to
sit on the ground with a magisterial wave of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then he rose to speak. With his chest puffed out, his head
thrown back and his finger raised, Yadav, holder of a law degree,
declared in rising bursts of words: ``Like you, I slept on a dirt
floor. I grazed my cows. I prepared the cattle feed. I faced all
the poverty of life, but I worked for you. And because you backed
me, I became the chief minister.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, he got back into an air conditioned car and
his caravan of a dozen vehicles moved on to the next roadside
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who live along this stretch of road, there
seemed to be little enthusiasm. None of those interviewed, even
Yadav's supporters, said they were much better off now than when he
first took power.
</P>
<P>
   Surender Shah, a teacher bumping along the road on his bicycle,
said his village will vote against Yadav because it still has no
electricity and the local school, for 300 students in grades one
through eight, consists only of two decrepit classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dashrath Mandal, an illiterate laborer who owns only two water
buffalo, said he has got a little more wheat and rice from the
government in recent years, but his struggles to educate his
youngest son through the eighth grade have yielded only bitterness
and unemployment. Mandal said he cannot afford the bribes it takes
to buy a small-time government position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we go for jobs, people ask us for money, and we
don't have it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, even small scraps of government aid are important to
the poor, and Mandal will vote for Laloo. ``This is a Yadav
constituency,'' he said matter-of-factly as he sat on a bamboo
platform in his cow shed eating flat bread and fish from a tin
plate. ``We have to vote for the person who is winning.''

VIDEO VERSION OF HOT LINE LETS COLD WAR FOES EXPAND JOINT NUCLEAR
SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The United States and Russia, updating the ``hot line''
concept between leaders of the world's most heavily armed nuclear
powers, opened a new state-of-the-art video-conferencing center
Saturday that will enable Russian and American nuclear officials to
see, as well as talk, to each other during a nuclear-related
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   At a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday afternoon, Bill
Richardson, the American secretary of energy, and Yevgeny Adamov,
Russia's minister of atomic energy, said that the nuclear accident
in Japan last week showed the need for such real-time lines of
communication in the event of a nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the accident in Japan ``unsettling,'' Richardson said
that the opening of a joint crisis center showed that if a nuclear
incident takes place, leaders will be prepared to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the accident at the reprocessing plant near Tokyo, in
which 35 people were exposed to high levels of radiation,
Richardson and Adamov made an unprecedented offer of joint
technical assistance to Japan. Adamov said Saturday that Japan had
not accepted the offer so far and had informed his ministry that
``the situation is under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that had he been in Washington during the
accident and if the crisis center had been open, he and Adamov
undoubtedly would have used it to work out the details of their
offer to help Japan deal with the accident, the worst in Tokyo's
troubled history with nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
   But paradoxically, Richardson was in Russia when the accident
occurred and visiting Sarov, a closed nuclear-weapons city an
hour's flight away from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the sleek center on the second floor of the
Minatom building in the heart of Moscow is another indication of
the growing cooperation in critical nuclear matters between Russia
and the United States. The new system links Russia's atomic agency
with the Energy Department's Emergency Operations Center in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson toured once-closed nuclear weapons and energy sites
throughout Russia last week. He said Saturday that he was ``very
encouraged'' by the tangible evidence he had seen of what he called
the ``growing partnership'' in nuclear affairs between Moscow and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The center, with its spare gun-metal steel support beams, its
glass partitions, oversized black leather chairs around an oval
conference table, resembles a set from the ``Star Trek'' television
serial.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's contribution was a giant video-screen that covers
one of the room's walls and $500,000 worth of video conferencing
equipment. The Russian federation spent roughly an equal amount
designing and constructing the sound-proof facility.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the secure telephone line that links the White House and
the Kremlin, over which the Russian and American leaders can
discuss the most secret information, the crisis center linking
Minatom and the Energy Department is not equipped to provide for
such secrecy. But Russian officials hope to eventually be able to
link the center with all its key civilian and military nuclear
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The center will allow real-time communication between the two
energy agencies in times of nuclear or environmental emergencies
such as accidents at nuclear power or fuel facilities, the
accidental release of radioactive materials, or the theft or
diversion of nuclear weapons or other nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
   The center's first order of business Saturday, however, involved
not a nuclear crisis, but a humanitarian one. At the early morning
ceremony Saturday, Richardson announced that his agency and the
American-based Children of the World Foundation were sending two
Russian children to New York's Westchester Medical Center for
life-saving heart surgery. American technical experts learned of
the children's plight while working on projects monitoring nuclear
sites in Siberia, and worked out the arrangements with the
foundation.

COMMENTARY: HAZY IN HAVANA

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>

   HAVANA _ Walking through the Partagas cigar factory in Old
Havana is like smoking a box of Cohibas without ever having to
light up. You just breathe deeply as you follow the raw tobacco
leaves from the lower floors, where they are separated into
different qualities, to the upper floors, where they are rolled
into different brands, to the taste-test table, where our guide,
Teresa, has the job of smoking different cigars all day for quality
control.
</P>
<P>
   The best cigar rollers make about $15 a month, an average Cuban
wage. Upstairs, at a raised table in front of a room with 100 men
and women rolling cigars, sits the ``lector,'' who entertains the
workers by reading aloud all day _ newspapers in the morning, a
Cuban novel in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There is one bit of news everyone in the factory would like to
hear _ news they are sure could change their lives and make their
business explode: that Cuban-American relations have been restored
and the U.S. boycott of Cuba, and Cuban cigars, has been lifted.
``What that would mean for the cigar business,'' says Teresa, her
eyes wide, ``Imaginate! Imagine!''
</P>
<P>
   A week in Cuba teaches you that sooner or later almost every
conversation with a Cuban gets to this question: When might America
restore relations? Cubans know that no real opening of their system
is on the horizon, so only something from over the horizon might do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, it's like this. For 30 years Fidel Castro had a
bargain with the Cuban people: the communist state provided all the
basics of a job, education and health care, and the Cuban people
provided the state with blind allegiance. But given the limitations
of the Cuban economy, and the pain of the U.S. embargo, that
bargain was only sustainable with the help of $6 billion a year in
Soviet aid. When the USSR collapsed after 1989, so did the aid.
</P>
<P>
   In order to survive, the regime has had to open up a little to
tourism, a little to free enterprise _ people can have restaurants
in their homes, but with only 12 seats _ and a little to foreign
investment. But only a crack _ because the regime knows that if
people become independent of the state economically, they will
become independent politically, and that will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   As result, what you have in Cuba today is what I would call
``one party, no system.'' Cubans have the worst of all worlds: They
have neither the cradle-to-grave, Soviet-financed welfare state of
old nor the free-market, 
do-whatever-you-can-to-improve-yourself-just-don't-mess-with-the-reg
ime system China has opted for.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials insist that there is a logic to their system and
that growth is coming: ``Our choice does not lie between the U.S.
and China models,'' said Cuba's vice minister of economic planning,
Alfonso Casanova Montero. ``You can't compare us to China. China is
not blockaded by the U.S. We are bent on avoiding a process of
de-socialism. Given the aggression we have to constantly face from
the U.S., if the income of our nation were deconcentrated, and if
our political structure were deconcentrated, we would be much more
vulnerable to foreign pressure. So the pressure from the U.S. has
just the opposite effect on us than is intended.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in reality, this tight Cuban system clearly can't take care
of its people's needs _ ration books get you through half the
month. Yet it won't unleash them to freely lift their living
standards. So, many Cubans are forced to take second jobs, depend
on relatives abroad or engage in illegality. This is a shame,
because there is enormous talent here. If unleashed, this place
would be the Taiwan of the Caribbean, overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not being unleashed. Cuba's economy is a hodgepodge of
Castroism and Thomas Cook tours, Canadian investment and central
planning, Pepsodent billboards interspersed among Che Guevara
propaganda billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The system produces enough income not to collapse, but not
enough to really go forward. All the talk is about what they've
been, not what they might become. So the place just treads water, a
threat only to itself. And that's why people are hoping the United
States will take the initiative, which it should. Cuba's people
have suffered enough from being the rope in the U.S.-Castro tug of
war.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the United States doesn't move? ``Political reform''
is most unlikely here. The only hope is probably ``biological
reform,'' i.e., the passing away of the charismatic revolutionary
generation in Cuba _ and its virulent Cuban exile opponents in
Florida _ which might finally unlock the stalemate in
Cuban-American relations. Imaginate!

BATTLE IN CONGRESS OVER MILK PRICES PITS EAST AGAINST MIDWEST 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For most families, the outcome of a battle in
Congress over milk prices will mean just a few cents a week at the
supermarket counter. But the livelihoods of tens of thousands of
dairy farmers are at stake, and the issue has provoked a civil war
between lawmakers from the East and those from the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Normal allies like the liberal Democratic Sens. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin are at each other's throats.
Normal antagonists like Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Robert
Smith, the Republican turned Independent from New Hampshire, are
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Down Pennsylvania Avenue, President Clinton is on one side and
his wife, Hillary, the all-but-announced Senate candidate from New
York, is on the other. Mrs. Clinton's likely opponent, Rudolph
Giuliani, took one position when he was merely mayor of New York,
but he changed his mind when he began running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue ``is all about economic self-interest,'' said
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. That is apparent from
conversations with family farmers in the warring regions.
</P>
<P>
   David Krug, who has a 280-acre farm with about 75 cows in Owen,
Wis., that has been in his family for 105 years, calculates that if
a new pricing system developed by the Clinton administration goes
into effect, he might earn an additional $8,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But 800 miles or so to the east, in Swanton, Vt., near the
Canadian border, Paul Bourbeau, who has about 300 cows on a farm he
runs with his wife and two grown sons, figures that changes in the
system could cost him $16,000 to $18,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Krug and Bourbeau are relatively prosperous, and unlike some of
their neighbors, their farms will survive no matter how the
political questions are resolved. ``But it could make the
difference between profit and loss,'' Bourbeau said, ``the
difference in whether you keep up the buildings and replace the
piece of equipment you need.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a convoluted federal milk-pricing system that was
devised in 1937 to ensure that fresh milk was available in all
parts of the country. The minimum price that farmers can charge for
milk is fixed monthly by the Department of Agriculture. The country
is divided into 31 regions, and the set price is higher the farther
the regions are from Eau Claire, Wis., historically the center of
the dairy industry.
</P>
<P>
   Developments in dairy technology, transportation and
refrigeration have made the old system obsolete, but efforts to
change it have always failed because the stakes are so high.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1996, Congress approved a law, called the Freedom to
Farm Act, reducing and ultimately ending the subsidies for farmers
who grow corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, wheat and most other crops.
</P>
<P>
   Although the law retained the 60-year-old milk-price system, it
instructed the secretary of agriculture to develop a new, more
market-oriented system by this year. The law also permitted the
creation of the Northeast Dairy Compact, which puts a floor on the
price of milk that goes into bottles in the six New England states.
The compact is supposed to expire when a new federal pricing policy
is put into place.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Glickman offered the administration's new plan,
which would reduce, though not eliminate, the regional differences
in what farmers charge for milk. The plan will go into effect
unless Congress blocks it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safest thing for me to have done,'' the secretary said in
an interview, ``would have been to reaffirm the status quo, but I
thought it was important to have a more up-to-date policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department maintains that if its plan had been
in effect for the last 12 months, the average price farmers
received for milk would have been 58 cents higher for each 100
pounds of milk they sold, or nearly 5 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   But some farmers would have benefited more, and some would have
been hurt. The politics of the matter turn on the prevailing view
that the administration's plan would be to the advantage of farmers
in the upper Midwest and to the disadvantage of those in the East.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has calculated that its plan would
lower the supermarket price of milk by an average of 2 cents a
gallon nationally. The Consumer Federation of America figures that
the New England compact caused the price of bottled milk to rise 15
cents a gallon. A study by the Office of Management and Budget
found that consumer prices were 5 cents to 20 cents higher than
they would be without price fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Those calculations are difficult to prove conclusively and are
disputed by organizations representing dairy farmers in the East.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eastern lawmakers have spent the year scrambling to preserve the
Northeast Dairy Compact, regardless of what happens to the new
pricing plan. Eastern seaboard states outside New England,
including New York, want to join the price-fixing arrangement, and
Southern states want to form a compact of their own.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, it is almost always harder to change something than
to leave it alone, and the dairy system is no exception. A majority
appears to be in favor of blocking the administration's pricing
plan and allowing the New England compact to continue. But the
majority may not rule.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House of Representatives voted, 285-140, to
block the new pricing plan and leave the old one in effect. But the
latest word is that a House-Senate conference committee has
decided, under instructions from House Republican leaders, to drop
the section blocking the pricing plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders say they are philosophically opposed to
putting such policy in a spending bill. Their political opponents
say that Rep. Dick Armey, the majority leader, and Rep. Tom DeLay,
the whip, both Texans, are representing the interests of Suiza
Foods Corp., the Texas holding company that is the country's
largest dairy producer.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from the Midwest and the Northeast say they will
filibuster legislation that puts their dairy constituents at a
disadvantage, and neither side seems to have the 60 votes necessary
to break a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said that if Congress approved legislation blocking his
pricing plan, he would recommend that Clinton veto it. But
campaigning in dairy counties in upstate New York, Mrs. Clinton has
opposed the administration's plan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giuliani, who used to be against propping up the prices paid
farmers on the ground that consumers in New York City would have to
pay more for milk, announced in August that he had changed his mind
and now sided with the farmers.
</P>
<P>
   All this squabbling seemed about to end this week when the dairy
compact was supposed to go out of existence. But a federal judge in
Vermont provided a respite by issuing a temporary restraining order
preventing any change in government policy until hearings in a
related lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare their farms for winter, Krug in Wisconsin and
Bourbeau in Vermont are following the developments in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about what it will mean for the younger farmers
here,'' said Krug, 60.
</P>
<P>
   Bourbeau, 40, said: ``When I started farming here 17 years ago,
there were seven farms on my road. Now there are only two left.
This could make the difference to lots of people up here whether
they stay in business.''

 &HT;    Lance Armstrong's wife shares their experiences with in vitro
fertilization
 &HT;    By John Maher and Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The very day Lance Armstrong and his wife,
Kristin, were in Paris reveling in his improbable Tour de France
victory, Louise Brown was somewhere in England, celebrating her
21st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown became the world's first ``test-tube'' baby when she was
born on July 25, 1978. The process that helped produce Brown has
now more accurately become known as in vitro fertilization, from
the Latin term for ``in glass.'' The technique was introduced in
the United States in 1981, and an estimated 45,000 babies have been
born in this country through a variety of IVF procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The Armstrongs have been traveling that road to parenthood this
year. Lance Armstrong was rendered infertile by powerful
chemotherapy to treat his advanced testicular cancer from October
to December 1996. The couple are expecting their first child _ to
be called either Grace Elizabeth or Luke David _ on Oct. 25, which,
as coincidence would have it, is right in the middle of National
Infertility Awareness Week beginning Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly didn't plan it that way,'' Kristin Armstrong
said. ``We timed it strictly around the cycling season.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin recorded all the joy, wonder, fear, pain and uncertainty
of the IVF process in a pull-no-punches diary at the Lance
Armstrong Foundation Web site (www.laf.org).
</P>
<P>
   Kristin felt the diary, which detailed all the shots, surgeries
and doctor visits needed to have a child through IVF, was an
extension of one of the foundation's missions: improving the
quality of life of cancer survivors. Although some passages might
make some readers blush, she said the diary has helped the wives of
men suffering from testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Lance got sick, he was so open about everything,''
Kristin said. ``This is an addendum to that. This whole IVF
procedure, not very many people want to open up and talk about it.
But I've had so many e-mails from wives whose husbands have gone
through cancer treatments. They are so grateful to find someone
that they can ask, `What about this and what about that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It really addressed the whole issue of survivorship. Once you
finish your medical treatment, oftentimes, the doctors get you out
the door and say, `OK, get on with your life. Everything is great
and all is well.' They just expect you to return to normal, and all
is not normal. It's altered in so many ways. Survivorship is huge.
There are so many things that go with that. Going on with your life
and having a family is one aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband never tried to keep the details of the pregnancy a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been honest about everything else,'' Lance said.
``The (details) have been beneficial to some people, at least
that's what we've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the couple's openness, it's obvious the world has come a
long way since Louise Brown's secretive birth. IVF accounts for
less than 5 percent of infertility treatments, but it is often used
by women with blocked or damaged fallopian tubes. And it also helps
cancer survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The very treatment that saved Armstrong's life jeopardized his
chances of having children. The chemotherapy drugs, such as
platinum, attack the DNA of rapidly dividing cells, such as the
cancer tumors that had grown to the size of golf balls in
Armstrong's lungs. However, such drugs also damage cells in the
stomach lining, hair, fingernails and sperm.
</P>
<P>
   There was a possibility that Armstrong's sperm would be fine a
few years after his treatment. There also was a possibility they
wouldn't. So, before he began his treatment, and before he had even
met Kristin, he had some sperm saved in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Of fatherhood, Kristin said, ``Lance is so nurturing, so loving.
It has always been his dream of a lifetime to be a father. When he
was so sick, he'd thought he'd never be a father.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin, who worked for a local advertising firm, met her future
husband at a news conference at the Four Seasons Hotel in January
1997 when Lance announced plans for his first official Ride for the
Roses weekend.
</P>
<P>
   She eventually started volunteering for the foundation. By that
June, they began dating. By October, they were engaged. In May
1998, they were married in Santa Barbara, Calif., near where
Kristin and her family spent summer vacations when she was growing
up.
</P>
<P>
   Lance was declared cancer-free in October 1997, and that's when
they started discussing starting a family. Kristin, who turned 28
in August, always envisioned herself with children, but she hadn't
given much thought to when she should have them.
</P>
<P>
   She was ambivalent at first when Armstrong broached the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``But how can you tell someone whose motto is `live for the day'
that you want to put it off?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has made millions during his cycling career, so the
high cost of IVF wasn't an obstacle, but it still was a surprise.
Kristin estimated the drugs and other medical procedures cost about
$15,000. The couple's insurance did not cover any of the
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge issue,'' she said. ``It's completely not
covered, and it's so expensive. We had the resources to pay for it.
But it's sad for people who have trouble coming up with that kind
of money. Having a family shouldn't be a financial constraint.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine,
only about 25 percent of health plans cover infertility services,
and the cost of one cycle of IVF treatment averages between $8,000
and $12,000. Thirteen states, including Texas, require coverage of
infertility services, but few of the laws are very demanding.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DIARY
</P>
<P>
   Kristin started the IVF process in December.
</P>
<P>
   She started writing details of the treatment in her private
diary, then decided to make it public. Here are some of the
entries:
</P>
<P>
   _ Dec. 30, 1998: ``I have to say today was horrible ... Nurses
strapped me to this sliding X-ray table and stuck this torture
device inside of me that sprays dye. Then, when they take the
X-rays, they can see if you have blocked tubes or any other
problems ... I was sobbing the whole time and I wanted my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 6: An encounter with counseling. Kristin observed, ``It
was two hours of sex-ed, complete with old films of the sperm
swimming up the tubes. We've all seen it. We don't want to see it
again ... You know that you want to just get up and bolt, but you
can't find the right moment? Finally I had all my belongings packed
up, and couldn't take one more minute, so I stood up and
race-walked out of the room with Lance on my heel. We burst out of
the room, giddy like school kids, and ran to our car laughing and
out of breath. I wondered if we were fit to be parents. Then I
realized that we were absolutely perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 11: Kristin began her Lupron shots. It's often the first
fertility drug women use. It affects the pituitary gland and the
hormones it releases. ``Ten units a day until they tell me to
stop,'' she wrote. ``Lupron is a drug that prevents you from
ovulating. For someone with needle phobia, the whole daily concept
is highly unnerving. I had to administer it myself since Lance is
gone. My hands were shaking so badly and I couldn't get the tiny
bubbles out of the syringe. I finally just squished a blob of my
thigh together and swore out loud as I stuck myself.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 14: Kristin got a shipment from the pharmacy of another
drug, Gonal-F. ``These are the drugs that `stimulate the follicle,'
or make you lay more eggs. My body, once a temple, is now a
pincushion-henhouse. For some reason, I'm still excited about all
this. I'm starting to look at other people's babies, and they are
starting to look really cute.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later: ``Today I made the grand pilgrimage to the clinic
in San Antonio where we store what Lance calls his `frozen
tadpoles.' We pay rent on them every year, $100. I went to the IVF
office early in the morning and picked up this big frozen tank. It
filled up the passenger seat next to me and was pretty heavy. I
jammed to tunes and made it there in an hour. I lugged the tank
inside the building and up to the 13th floor. I read some House
Beautiful magazines while one of the nurses prepared my family for
the icy trip back to Austin. She even opened the tank briefly to
show me the initials LA etched into the vial. I said a silent
prayer that it wasn't some Larry Anderson and was on my way. This
time I drove very carefully and answered several inquiring calls
from Lance, checking progress. I never felt quite safe until I had
deposited the tank back into the safe hands of the IVC staff.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 16: With curious friends watching in the master bathroom,
Kristin suffered a mishap. ``Call it stage fright, call it slippery
fingers _ I drop the glass vial of Lupron on the bathroom tile and
it shatters. I stare at it, disbelieving, knowing full well that if
I miss my shot, I miss the entire cycle and have to start another
month. My eyes fill with tears and my friends help me clean up the
shards before the dog eats them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin phoned a nurse on call, looking for help and
reassurance. ``Oh dear,'' the nurse said. Kristin then desperately
tried to find a pharmacy that stocked Lupron and that was open on
Saturday night. She finally found one, and a helpful pharmacist
agreed to stay open 20 minutes late.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 19: After a sonogram, Kristin got a green light, dropping
the Lupron from 10 units to five and beginning her Gonal-F shots.
``Mixing the Gonal-F shots is hard to do. ... It comes in glass
vials in a powder form. You take a syringe with a long needle and
you draw a unit of this sterile water solution. Then you break the
tops of these vials of powder, and shoot the liquid into each vial
one at a time until your final shot has three units mixed together.
You have to flick the syringe to move this fat air bubble to the
top and squirt until the air pocket moves out of the needle. Then
you thankfully swap out the evil needle for a more familiar one and
inject it into your thigh. I'm thinking I should have gone to med
school, I'm getting so good at this.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 22: Kristin had blood drawn at a 7 a.m. doctor's
appointment. ``I looked away from the needle and focused on the Far
Side cartoons taped to the wall, for other squeamish victims like
me. I wonder how the heck I'll handle childbirth if I can't even
have blood drawn without feeling woozy.'' At 4 p.m., she returned
for a sonogram that showed she had 12 eggs growing.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, Lance had an appointment with his oncologist in
Portland, Ore. ``Ironic that he is at one doctor and I am at
another one for two entirely different purposes, or maybe not _
they are, in effect, to confirm the possibility of life. A very
beautiful thing.'' That day she received a shot of human chorionic
gonadotropin, which stimulates egg maturation, exactly 36 hours
before surgery scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 30: After a night of strange dreams about knives and
henhouses, Kristin woke up at 6 a.m. to be at the day surgery
center by 7 to have her eggs harvested. She wrote, ``Nurses asked
me 20 questions and had me sign away every right ever to be mad or
vengeful if someone should screw up. The one thing I did not like
was that I signed the right to cut open my abdomen to retrieve the
eggs if the traditional way didn't work. Thankfully that didn't
happen. I walked into the surgery room and was strapped to a table.
There were extensions for my arms so I felt crucified, and was
literally when they started my anesthesia IV. My world got foggy
and I went under _ feeling and remembering nothing of the whole
procedure. Lance says that I was awake when they brought me back to
the recovery room, but I don't remember it. All I remember was
waking up on the bed and seeing his face, knowing in that instant
that everything was going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Feb. 1: Kristin wrote, ``They defrosted the frozen tadpoles
and used a procedure called ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm
Injection), whereby they physically inject one sperm into each egg.
We had nine viable eggs to use. Of those nine, six are perfect, two
are possible and one broke. We decided to implant three of the six
perfect ones and freeze the other three. I'm freaking out that all
three will work and I'll be as big as a house and later a total
mental patient with three screaming toddlers scampering in
different directions. But despite that, I am beside myself with
excitement, wondering if it will work. On some level, I know that
it will.''
</P>
<P>
   According to data from the American Society for Reproductive
Medicine, only about 26 percent of the women who go through an IVF
cycle produce a baby. Of those who do, almost a third have twins
and 6 percent have three or more babies.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin went to a church and prayed, got a progesterone shot and
readied for the transfer of the eggs back into her body. ``I know
tonight is our last night of life as we know it and it feels
awesomely powerful and strange,'' she wrote. ``We are about to do
something that affects the rest of our lives, alters the very core
of our existence, and there is no turning back. From this moment on
we will never be worry-free again. The feeling is so intense, such
a rush, that I can only equate it to teetering on the edge of a
magnificent chasm.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day Kristin added, ``Today was tied for the most
momentous day of my life, the other being our wedding day.''
</P>
<P>
   The three embryos (all had eight cells) were injected into
Kristin with a syringe. Everything went fine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feb. 3: Kristin was confined to the house. Paying bills and
using the computer were the most strenuous tasks she was allowed to
do. She got ``hatching drugs'' four times a day. ``Apparently they
poked a hole in each of the fertilized follicles before they
transferred them. These drugs, along with that tiny hole, help the
embryos `hatch' out of that follicle and implant,'' she wrote while
starting an anxious, 11-day wait to see if the procedure would be a
success.

   _ Feb. 13: The Armstrongs awaited results of a pregnancy test.
``I was so nervous that I had the radio off and was praying to
myself on the way there and back. ... Just as I was taking the dog
out, the phone rang. Lance picked it up and was saying `uh huh _
yes _ uh huh,' and making notes on a paper. I motioned to him, `is
that her?' He shook his head `no.' I was about to get my purse to
get ready to go. He hangs up the phone and barrels into me with a
huge hug, his eyes filled with tears. `Babe, you're pregnant.' ...
I will never forget that hug for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Armstrongs knew Kristin was with child. But they had to wait
three more weeks to find out if she was with children.
</P>
<P>
   _ March 4: Kristin wrote, ``I have a sonogram appointment at 10
a.m. that will allow the doctor to see the heartbeat and number of
babies. They say my hormone levels are not indicative of triplets,
so that leaves one baby or a chance of twins. Lance is of the mind
that more is better. I'm unsure ...Try to picture me on an 11-hour
international flight with triplet boy babies. See also: insanity,
fatigue, catatonic state, insomnia, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   _ March 5: Kristin wrote, ``Well, we have one healthy baby! Not
twins, not triplets, but one bambino. I was relieved, but a tiny
part of me was oddly disappointed ... I couldn't ignore the vague
loss I felt wondering what happened to the other two.'' She asked
her doctor, wondering if she'd done something wrong. ``He said
absolutely not, and that there are still some things that are
natural and inexplicable _ even in a seemingly sterile, scientific
procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally on April 13, after a checkup at the end of Kristin's
first trimester, the Armstrongs figured they were ready to announce
the news to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin wrote, ``And you understand why this year, if Lance
rides like the wind, it's because Big Daddy Armstrong has a family
to support!''

 &HT;    A passion for quality ignites new PBS season
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ``culture vultures'' at PBS have an ever-steeper
incline on their annual uphill battle as they face financial
cutbacks and increased competition from artsy cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   But dating back to 1990, when Ken Burns' mega-documentary series
``The Civil War'' took a chomp out of the commercial networks' fall
ratings, PBS has tackledeach new season head-on, aggressively
programming instead of limping through the barrage with reruns. The
weapon of choice has been (you guessed it) more Burns programming.
Burns' ``Baseball'' wasn't quite the phenomenon that ``The Civil
War'' was, but it attracted a sizable crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Heralding PBS's fall season this year is a double whammy: Ken
Burns' two-part ``Not For Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth
Cady Stanton &AMP; Susan B. Anthony,'' airing Nov. 7-8, and brother Ric
Burns' mammoth 12-hour epic ``New York: A Documentary Film.'' The
latter airs Nov. 14-18 with the two-hour conclusion reserved for
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Burns brothers are two of the most important documentary
filmmakers of our time,'' crowed PBS programming chief John F.
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   They've certainly popularized the documentary form and attracted
millions of people to PBS. Ken Burns is generally credited with
reinventing the form, creatively using still photos, music and
actors to give voice to letters and other historical writings.
``Not For Ourselves Alone,'' the first documentary to chronicle the
women's suffrage movement, follows a similar style and oozes with
typical Burns passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was outraged that this part of history is so unknown,'' Ken
Burns seethed at a TV critics gathering in Los Angeles this past
summer. He noted that recent polls found that 74 percent of
Americans do not know what the 19th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution is or when women won the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ric is equally enthusiastic about his in-depth history of and
ode to New York, dubbed ``the King Kong of American cities.'' The
``other'' Burns spent almost three years producing the super-long
historical documentary, which he calls a ``tragi-comic story.''
</P>
<P>
   Such passion is what makes the Burns brothers' work great.
Perhaps a little more passion scattered throughout the PBS schedule
would ignite greater interest in the fall programming as the
network celebrates its 30th year on Nov. 3. There are promising
signs in upcoming shows that the Burnses' influence is burning
brightly, especially in two other fall documentaries:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``American Photography: A Century of Images'' is a three-hour
film that showcases the role of photos in the personal lives and
public history of 20th-century America and the profound effect such
images have. (Oct. 13 at 8 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Wonders of the African World with Henry Louis Gates Jr.'' is
a six-hour chronicle of the renowned Harvard professor's journey to
the ``dark continent,'' challenging Europeans' notion of a
primitive land. Gates' soft-spoken but powerful narration spins a
fascinating story of the great African civilizations that preceded
the arrival of slavers and white colonists. (Oct. 25-27 at 9 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   In other PBS premiere news, ``Nova'' begins its season with
``Fall of the Leaning Tower of Pisa'' (Tuesday at 9 p.m.), and
``Nature'' returns with a two-parter on ``Antarctica'' (Oct. 24 and
31).
</P>
<P>
   The title sounds like a made-for-TV movie on USA cable network,
but ``Intimate Strangers'' actually is a four-part science
documentary about microbes, the ``dazzlingly beautiful unseen life
on earth'' (Tuesday nights, Nov. 9-30).
</P>
<P>
   Is anybody out there? That's the question posed in ``Life Beyond
Earth'' (Nov. 10), a provocative two-hour special on the search for
extraterrestrial life. Host Timothy Ferris, the best-selling
science writer who created the program, believes there is life in
the universe and that the discovery of a signal from aliens could
drastically change the course of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobil Masterpiece Theatre,'' the only series that's been on
the air almost as long as PBS itself, begins its 29th season
tonight at 9 with ``A Rather English Marriage,'' a bittersweet tale
about two widowers played by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. Next
up on ``Masterpiece'' is ``The Aristocrats'' (Oct. 10-24), a
three-parter based on Stella Tillyard's novel about four well-bred
women in 18th-century England.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Mystery!'' continues its 20th season with Part 2 of
``Second Sight,'' a psychological thriller starring Clive Owen that
debuted Sept. 30 and concludes this Thursday. Next up will be the
sequel to ``An Unsuitable Job for a Woman'' (Oct. 14-Nov. 4),
starring Helen Baxendale as young private detective Cordelia Gray,
followed by ``Mrs. Bradley'' (Nov. 11), a stylish thriller that
allows ``Mystery!'' host Diana Rigg to exercise her acting chops as
an amateur sleuth in 1920s England.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be any exciting cliffhanger resolutions on PBS's
fall shows, but there's plenty of high-quality entertainment.

 &HT;    Stitches in time
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It can blanket you and keep you cozy, bring back
fond memories and create a decorative focal point.
</P>
<P>
   A handmade quilt is a wondrous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Quilt lovers _ whether they collect them or create them _ are
delighted to share their passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great combination of function and form,'' says
Sharon Weltner, who fell in love with quilts as a child. Today they
cover the walls of her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Aunt Minnie was a resourceful old lady who came through the
Depression and saved everything,'' Weltner explains. ``She would
cut up any piece of clothing that wasn't wearable and save it. We
would visit her in her log cabin each summer in Arkansas, and when
I came home at the age of 12, I made a quilt for my bed.''
</P>
<P>
   She's been quilting ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original purpose was to keep people warm, as a blanket,''
she says. ``As human beings, we need to decorate, and that's
evident in the time-honored patterns passed on from mothers to
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody can relate to fabric because we all choose clothing
based on color, texture, fabric,'' Weltner says. ``And almost all
of us have memories of sleeping under Grandma's quilts or watching
our mothers make quilts.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fascination with Amish culture and quilts that led
Aullwood Audubon Farm's Executive Director Charity Krueger to come
up with the organization's annual fund-raiser _ an Amish quilt
auction that will be next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quilts are beautiful statements about art and nature
together,'' Krueger says. Amish patterns incorporate stars and
birds, flowers and plants. Amish quilts are characterized by
intricate piecing designs, quality fabrics and superb quilting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an African Violet Quilt this year and each flower is
raised off the fabric,'' says Krueger. ``It took two years for this
young mother to make it for me. In that time she had two babies.''
</P>
<P>
   When you have a quilt in your house, observes Krueger, you
instinctively slow down. ``It's a great feeling of comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   When Aullwood is filled with quilts in the weeks before the
auction, she notes, the atmosphere becomes more peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had kids who are hyperactive and adults who come for
meetings with hostile agendas,'' she says. ``As soon as they walk
in and see the quilts, they slow down and become more tranquil.''

   You can learn more about quilts by attending one of these
upcoming quilting events.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ABOUT QUILTS
</P>
<P>
   _ What exactly is a quilt? It's a decorative bed cover or wall
hanging that consists of a top, batting and backing. Think of it as
a fabric sandwich, with the three layers held together with
quilting _ a series of tight stitches done in a decorative pattern
that connects all three layers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quilting can be done by an individual or at a quilting bee,
where several women work together.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many quilts have more than 470 yards of fabric.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Fantastic Irish Chain Quilt that will be auctioned at
Aullwood has more than 5,600 pieces of fabric. An Antique Log Cabin
Quilt, stitched in 1890, is made of 2,548 pieces of fabric.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect to pay between $400 to $1,500 for a quality bed-sized
quilt at a quilt auction like Aullwood's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for quilts in antique stores and flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some people buy the quilt tops and have them quilted later.
</P>
<P>
   USES FOR QUILTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Quilts can be hung on a wall, used to cover a bed or displayed
on a blanket rack. Some people use them as tablecloths or stack
them in baskets or trunks.
</P>
<P>
   CARING FOR QUILTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Direct light can cause fading.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you keep your quilt folded, refold it regularly in
different patterns to avoid damage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not hang a quilt on a wall without adding a sleeve to its
back.
</P>
<P>
   _ To clean, use mild soap and wash in a washing machine. Place
it flat on a clean sheet to dry, preferably outdoors.

GORE CAMPAIGN IS BUOYED BY SUPPORT OF A HEALTH CARE UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first good news for his campaign in some
time, Vice President Al Gore on Saturday received the support of a
major health care workers union local.
</P>
<P>
   In a head-to-head straw poll, Gore beat former Sen. Bill
Bradley, 55 percent to 38 percent, for the endorsement of Local 250
of the Health Care Workers Union of the Service Employees
International Union.
</P>
<P>
   With 46,000 members in Northern California, it is the
second-largest health care workers local in the country, after
Local 1199 in New York, and provides a potent army of field
workers, precinct walkers and volunteers for its endorsed
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The vote could signal support for Gore at the Oct. 12 meeting in
Los Angeles of the AFL-CIO, of which the service employees union is
a significant member. Gore had been the presumed favorite for the
endorsement, but the recent rise of Bradley, and his appeal to
minorities and labor unions, have threatened to put organized
labor's endorsement on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is welcome,'' said Chris Lahane, a spokesman for
Gore. ``It's a sign we're talking about the right issues. But while
we did well with the Northern California service employees, we're
still going to work for every single vote we can within the AFL and
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Sal Rosselli, president of the local, said the vote would help
put the union's issues ``on the front-burner, and we'll be
organized for the March primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was held after Gore and Bradley made direct appeals to
the local's membership, with Gore addressing the members live in
Oakland, Calif., by satellite from Washington, and Bradley by
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley had actually showed up in Oakland on Thursday
and was interviewed by a few members of the local, some union
members said that the video shown to the group at large on Friday
came across as less personal than Gore's interactive appearance.
</P>
<P>
   If the vote was a harbinger of things to come with labor, it may
also be a sign of how future debates may play out between the two
candidates. In their presentations, they directly attacked each
other for the first time in a shared venue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who promised recently to re-invigorate his flagging
campaign, presented Bradley to the heavily Democratic group as
disloyal to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been tempted to turn my back on the Democratic
Party,'' Gore said, referring to Bradley's brief flirtation with an
independent presidential candidacy in 1996. ``I've never been
tempted to run as an independent and divide the progressive
coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley presented his independence as a virtue, saying it would
help attract independent voters and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective of nominating somebody is to win in the fall,''
Bradley told the union. ``Since January, people have come up to me,
in hotels and restaurants, and said, `I'm an independent or a
Republican and I would vote for you, and I would never vote for
him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates said they wanted to make it easier for unions to
organize workers. And both laid claim to a longtime commitment to
organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former basketball star, said he had been the shop
steward for nine of his 10 years with the New York Knicks. Gore
noted that his father had been the first labor commissioner in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also noted that he had a better performance rating from
organized labor than Bradley had, even though Tennessee has an
anti-union right-to-work law and only a small percentage of its
workers are unionized. Achieving a strong rating from a state like
Tennessee ``is a little bit harder than in a state that is
unionized wall-to-wall,'' Gore said of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he had a broader, more realistic life experience
than Gore, whom he branded a Washington insider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a life before I got into politics,'' Bradley said,
referring to his basketball days and travels with ``a multiracial
group.'' He said this gave the two candidates ``a different idea of
who the American people are and what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two agreed on most basic union issues, they drew
contrasts on several other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that he was for stronger gun-control measures than
Gore, that his health care proposal would offer broader coverage
sooner than Gore's ``incremental'' approach and that when he spoke
in support of overhauling the campaign finance system, the Gore
campaign ``attacked me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wanted to improve public schools and did not
support vouchers, as Bradley briefly did. Gore said vouchers
``drain the money away from public schools at a time when we need
to do more for public schools.''

FRENCH PREMIER, UNDER ATTACK BY HIS LEFTISTS, OFFERS AN EMBRACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A political cartoon here last week showed France's
Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, getting ready to meet a
roomful of reporters. Behind a closed door, Jospin _ sweating with
effort _ was repeating to himself: ``I am from the Left. I am from
the Left. I am from the Left.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he declared two weeks ago that the government ``could not
be expected to control the economy,'' Jospin has been under heavy
pressure to take back his words.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister owes his position to a coalition of Greens,
Communists and Socialists, who do not take kindly to that kind of
talk. Members of the coalition tagged the remark ``pro-business''
and suggested that Jospin might lose their support.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin did not disappoint. Last week he soothed his restive
coalition with a bevy of new measures aimed at making the
government's weight felt. With unemployment still over 11 percent
here, he proposed penalizing companies that use too many temporary
employees and denying state aid to profitable firms that cut their
work force, among other measures.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement, to a special meeting of Socialist lawmakers
from all over Europe, marked an apparent U-turn for the prime
minister, who despite his left-wing roots has generally taken a
pragmatic approach, quietly going forward, for instance, with
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market economy does not spontaneously work in harmony,''
Jospin told a cheering crowd at the lawmakers' meeting. ``It needs
ground rules to function effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   His new proposals appeared to be a return to the use of greater
government regulations to try to solve the problems of the economy
_ and, some say, the opening efforts of his eventual run for the
presidency in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin first got in trouble responding to questions about what
has become known here as the ``Michelin affair.'' The French tire
company, which employs virtually the whole city of
Clermont-Ferrand, recently announced a 10 percent cut in its work
force at the same time as it announced nearly 20 percent growth in
its profits.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement sent the company's stock soaring but infuriated
much of France, whose economy is beginning to climb out of years of
lifelessness but still has not managed to create many jobs. Asked
about Michelin's announcements, Jospin encouraged workers to
demonstrate but said there was little the government could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy can not run by legislation and official texts,''
he said then. ``People must stop expecting the government and the
state to take charge of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Communist Party leader Robert Hue responded that
Jospin risked losing his government majority with such pro-business
views.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's speech to the lawmakers appears to have appeased Hue
though. Soon after, he was quoted in the Communist daily L'Humanite
as having said that the prime minister appeared to have learned his
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the measures Jospin proposed will ever materialize
is unclear. He offered few details and many analysts suggested that
he was simply playing a good game of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin has not been alone in trying to shore up his support base
in advance of a run for the presidency. President Jacques Chirac,
who began his current seven-year term in 1995, recently took steps
to shore up his sagging Gaullist party, the Rally for the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The move seems to have backfired, with the party appearing only
more divided than before. Rather than rallying around Chirac's
choice to head the party, more and more members are trying to get
the job for themselves. The list of candidates grows longer by the
day. Already more than half a dozen aspirants have stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac's party has never fully recovered from the debacle of
1997 when Chirac called an early parliamentary election expecting
to win easily. Instead, his party lost control of the legislature,
leaving Chirac to work with a Socialist prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But Chirac remains enormously popular. The latest political
poll, published in Le Figaro Magazine on Friday, gave him a 56
percent approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, more the cool intellectual, is also well liked. In the
Figaro poll, he beat Chirac with a 64 percent approval rating.

Stephens Road, transformed into a parking lot of cruisers and
emergency vehicles. As she drew closer she realized the yellow
police tape circled her yard. Sheila jumped out of her car, but
Sidney officers blocked her from entering the house. ``You can't go
in,'' they told her. ``I want to see my husband,'' she pleaded.
``You can't go in,'' the officers repeated. ``Did you know a Matt
Hensley?'' they asked. ``I know a Mike Hensley,'' she said. ``He's
someone who attends our church, someone the church was trying to
help.'' Once again, the officers barred her way: ``This is a crime
scene,'' they said. Minutes later, after she learned the truth,
that Mike Hensley had murdered four people, including her husband,
Sheila Wildermuth lost her ability to speak. For weeks she could
only mutter a few words. She has traveled an unfathomable distance
since that day. This is her story. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News).

   FORFEIT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the war on drugs, one of
the big guns is the state's forfeiture law, which gives police the
power to seize any property _ cars, boats, planes, computers, guns,
or cash _ they believe has been used in a crime. The police need
not charge anyone with a crime to take their property; in fact,
because such seizures are treated as civil matters rather than
criminal, they need even less evidence than they would to arrest
someone. Thanks to this law police in PBC have collected more than
$7 million since 1996, money they can spend on equipment, drug
treatment programs, and complex investigations. After reviewing
more than 600 forfeiture cases, we will examine how this law works.

   FOSTERCARE-PART1 _ This is the first of four parts on foster
care. This is the overview: Specialized Alternatives for Family and
Youth is an agency that finds, trains and administers a network of
foster parents willing to take in some of the nation's most
troubled youth. But it also operates with little oversight and has
little financial incentive to run quality homes.
</P>
<P>
   FOSTERCARE-LANDDEALS _ Sidebar to Part 1 of foster care. Running
a multimillion-dollar private foster care agency has brought its
president, Bruce Maag, recognition among his peers. It's also
brought him money. Land deals seem to have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   FOSTERCARE-MAAG _ Sidebar with Part 1 of Foster Care's Castoff
Children, a Dayton Daily News four-part series. Bruce Maag, the
founder and president of a private foster-care agency, surrendered
his license to take kids into his own home just before he pleaded
guilty in 1987 to contributing to the delinquency of a minor. (Eds:
This story originally moved last weekend.)

Children series. An independent-living program administered by one
foster-care agency ended up becoming a party house. Teens had
little supervision.

   FOSTERCARE-PART4 _ Part 4 of the Foster Care's Castoff Children
series. U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, says governmental financial
incentives pose a ``major, major problem'' for the foster-care
system, and an overhaul is needed. But DeWine and others are
skeptical that Congress and the Health and Human Services
Department, which administers the multibillion foster-care program,
will ever bring about reform.

NEWS ANALYSIS: OPPOSITION TO EXHIBIT IS DEFENSE OF MARY AS ICON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Ohio, Ind.)  (With NY-MUSEUM.) 
(nk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's battle with the Brooklyn
Museum over a painting combining an image of the Virgin Mary with
elephant dung and pornographic photographs is being waged on the
emotionally charged terrain of cherished symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The directors of the museum, while citing the ideal of artistic
free expression and their rights under the First Amendment, have
been denounced as ``anti-Catholic'' for including in the exhibition
``Sensation'' a painting called ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' an object
striking (shocking to some) in its juxtaposition of the sacred and
the profane.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of anti-Catholicism is one that would cast the museum
into a dark stream of American cultural history. In its rudest
form, anti-Catholicism meant riots against Irish immigrants in the
1840s, a pledge not to hire Roman Catholics by members of the
American Protective Association a century ago and a voter backlash
against the Democratic presidential candidate Alfred E. Smith, a
Catholic, in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   R. Scott Appleby, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of
American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame, said
``anti-Catholicism in the United States has been a reaction to an
immigrant faith that is heavily devotional'' and perceived as
authoritarian and undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, he said, as recognition of American
pluralism has replaced the old ideal of a melting pot, those like
the Catholics aggrieved by the exhibit can appeal to a new ``rules
of the game,'' in which a group can demand respect for the
essential symbols of its identity.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby said, ``They're saying, `Look, Jewish people have
successfully appealed to the integrity and the experience of their
culture to avoid defamation of their culture _ why can't Catholics
do the same?'''
</P>
<P>
   He added he did not feel offended by the painting, which he had
seen in news reports, having read that its creator, Chris Ofili,
who was born in Britain of Nigerian parents, used elephant dung in
his work as an African fertility symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the painting has continued to stir interest, others
are speaking up to criticize the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, officials of several New York religious
organizations _ representing Protestants, Catholics, Eastern
Orthodox Christians, Jews and Muslims _ released a statement saying
that while they supported the right to freedom of speech, they
objected ``to the desecration of religious symbols.''
</P>
<P>
   The key word there was symbol. Although the world's major
religions rely on sacred texts to explain their belief systems, it
is their familiar images _ the cross, the Star of David, the
crescent moon, the Hindu god Shiva dancing in a circle of fire _
that most readily convey the elements of faith.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Mark Massa, a Jesuit priest and theology professor at
Fordham University, said that for believers, such symbols actually
share in the holiness they represent. ``There is nothing,
religiously speaking, more powerful than a symbol,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Massa, director of Fordham's American studies program, said he
did not feel shocked or offended by the portrait of Mary in the
museum's show. But he made clear that he understood how people
might perceive the painting, given the context in which the museum
placed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If indeed the image didn't shock, what would it be doing in an
exhibition called `Sensation'?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Mary, the impact would be felt considerably
beyond the Catholic world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember,'' the Episcopal Church's
presiding bishop, Frank T. Griswold III, said, ``that Mary is not
the exclusive property of the Roman Catholic Church, or any part of
the Christian community.'' Mary, he noted, is also revered by
Orthodox Christians and many Anglicans, including Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   So she is, too, by Muslims, who respect her as mother of Jesus,
a great prophet in Islam.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the Brooklyn exhibition spread, the Council on
American-Islam Relations in Washington began receiving calls. The
council had been considering a statement criticizing the
exhibition, said Ibrahim Hooper, its communications director. ``To
portray Mary in this way is just obscene,'' he said. ``Mary is
highly regarded in Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   In Orthodox Christianity, Mary is called the ``theotokos,'' a
Greek title that means the one who gives birth to God. She is
portrayed in icons closely holding the Christ child.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, a priest in the Orthodox Church in
America, and a former president of the National Council of
Churches, said Orthodox Christians would ``feel some kinship to
those Roman Catholics'' upset about the exhibition. ``It would
certainly be seen as inappropriate and offensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Popular devotion to Mary has been on the rise during the last
two decades, emphasized by Pope John Paul II and also by trends
outside official church circles. Since 1981, tens of thousands of
people have journeyed to the Bosnian village of Medjugorje, where
several young people have claimed to see a daily vision of Mary.
</P>
<P>
   One place with insight into popular perceptions of Mary is
Dayton University in Ohio, a Catholic institution with a library
housing the world's largest collection of texts and other items
related to Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The Marian Library is home to postage stamps, prayer cards and
wine bottle labels that depict Mary. Among its small statues is one
of Mary dressed in an elaborate Japanese kimono, another in the
garb of a Dutch housewife and a third carved from ebony showing her
in African robes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas A. Thompson, the library's director, said there
has been a freedom among Catholic artists around the world in
``appropriating Mary to certain cultures and local scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, he could think of nothing to compare with
the painting of Mary on display in Brooklyn. ``I've never seen
anything like that,'' he said. ``There's always been a reverence
and a respect.''

ANALYSIS: QUESTIONS FOR JAPAN AFTER NUCLEAR ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A string of embarrassingly unanswered questions
stretched long in the wake of Japan's worst nuclear accident, one
day after the crisis was officially declared over.
</P>
<P>
   Why were workers mixing vastly excessive amounts of enriched
uranium manually rather than with the plant's sophisticated
machines that were meant to ensure precise measurements? Why was no
alarm sounded at the fuel enrichment plant after an accident that
produced 10,000 to 20,000 times normal radiation levels in the
immediate area?
</P>
<P>
   Why was the plant itself not clearly marked as a nuclear
production site and equipped with a battery of anti-radiation and
security measures, even though it is situated in the midst of a
residential area? And finally, why did the government take nearly
12 hours to declare a major emergency in the area and to take
charge of the situation at the highest levels?
</P>
<P>
   But what is even more perplexing is a question underpinning
these and many other of the accident's puzzles: Why did Japan, a
nation that has long played the role of the world's only martyr of
an atomic bomb attack and has ever since made its sensitivity to
nuclear issues a cornerstone of its foreign and domestic policies,
become so lackadaisical in its own use of nuclear energy?
</P>
<P>
   For all of Japan's militant pacifism where nuclear issues are
concerned, the Tokaimura plant _ which has produced hundreds of
tons of highly enriched uranium powder over the years, more than
enough for a large arsenal of crude nuclear weapons _ was not
protected by so much as a high wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have insufficient awareness that they are handling
nuclear energy,'' said Masaru Hashimoto, governor of Ibaraki
prefecture, who likened the scant precautions against accidents to
contempt for human life.
</P>
<P>
   At a bare minimum, Thursday's accident at Tokaimura seems likely
to bring about what critics say is a badly needed, sweeping
overhaul of safety standards for a nuclear power industry that
supplies one-third of Japan's electricity. Already, however, many
here are wondering if a wariness over nuclear hazards born of this
accident will, indeed should, lead to an eventual phasing out of
the industry altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Japan's nuclear power plants were built in the late
1960s and 1970s, and within a decade or so, many of them will be
reaching the end of their useful lives. Few new plants have been
built in recent years, in large part because of growing public
concerns about their safety after a spate of other recent serious
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokaimura disaster, in which three workers were critically
injured by radiation exposure, dozens of others were exposed to
smaller amounts of radiation, and more than 300,000 people were
temporarily confined to their houses will undoubtedly strengthen
this aversion.
</P>
<P>
   If a new generation of plants is not started soon, experts say,
the de facto result will be a steady decline in the nuclear power
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Already there has been a sense of shock in much of the Japanese
news coverage of the incident, as it has become clear that
government regulators have established few safeguards and almost no
protection of the population from dangerous nuclear sites.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the Tokaimura uranium-refining plant not clearly
marked as a dangerous site but its staff lacked proper protective
shields, it had no alarm system, and it had never even been
equipped with a safety manual, according to several Japanese press
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Masajo Ujihara, a board member of JCO, the subsidiary of
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., was quoted by the Japan Times as saying
that an emergency manual had been written for critical events, but
that no one had ever expected to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Other press accounts on Saturday focused on serious flaws in the
regulatory approval process for nuclear plants like the uranium
fuel processing unit at Tokaimura. The newspaper Mainichi Shimbun
said, for example, that the neighbors of the accident site realized
only belatedly that there were ``no legal regulations'' preventing
the construction of nuclear sites in residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Yomiuri Daily, meanwhile, said that regulatory papers filed
for the plant during construction did not include contingency plans
or a discussion of the possible dangers of a fission reaction. ``A
critical nuclear fission reaction is not feasible under our safety
precautions,'' the quoted documents stated.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance of this kind of pre-emptive assurance now seems
certain to end. But the fact that Japanese people have tolerated
having nuclear plants in residential areas _ and have so long
believed official pledges of the industry's safety even as
accidents have increased _ reflects national realities both
geographic and cultural.
</P>
<P>
   With 126 million people, Japan's territory is only about as
large as California. In a nation so mountainous and crowded,
citizens realize that finding less troublesome sites for
potentially dangerous industries is difficult, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Japanese are overwhelmingly trustful of their
government, and of authority generally. Although anger was
abundant, voices could also be heard on Friday among the residents
of Tokaimura making allowances for the accident and refusing to
point fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that people were working very hard to fix the problem
throughout the night, so I cannot criticize anybody,'' said Shingo
Otani, a high school student who was interviewed in the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly but surely, people's reactions to things like this are
getting stronger,'' said Osamu Yatabe, a former legislator and
lawyer who has represented citizens in nuclear-related damage
suits. ``But the Japanese notion of rights is not as strong as it
is in some countries, and the national character still makes us
strongly averse to disputes.''

 &HT;    A good week: McCain, maverick and straight arrow
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATESBURG, S.C. _ The posters decorating the open-air stage
behind chicken magnate Bill Amick's house Tuesday night could have
been for a movie as easily as for a presidential campaign. They
display a photo of a brash young Navy pilot decked out in flight
gear, staring at the camera with a bit of the devil in his eye and
a hint that he he'll have quite a story to tell someday.
</P>
<P>
   The same photo appears on the cover of Sen. John McCain's new
book, ``Faith of My Fathers.'' McCain still owes Random House a
third week on the book tour trail this year, which he must wedge
into his race for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It will be time well spent away from the normal requirements of
a campaign. The story of a son and grandson of admirals, a
rebellious midshipman and hard-living pilot whose character is
forged during 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam is
No. 2 this weekend on the New York Times best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator's positions on campaign finance reform and
military spending are as sharply etched as any in this year's
presidential race. But more than for anyone else in the race,
McCain's rationale for candidacy is entwined in his biography,
apart from his political record or the issues over which he differs
with his party's establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to talk about issues, but you've got to start with
the story,'' said media consultant Greg Stevens, describing the
campaign's upcoming ad strategy as some 2,000 South Carolinians
lined up for barbecue and politics.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case at McCain's campaign kickoff rally in Nashua,
N.H., the day before, a good sprinkling of VFW hats were spotted
among those in attendance. Veterans are a vital component of his
support, which also includes younger Republicans such as South
Carolina House Speaker pro tem Terry Haskins, attracted to his
independent style.
</P>
<P>
   This was the week for McCain to hop around the country on the
announcement tour he postponed in April because of the U.S.
military action in Yugoslavia. He had an entourage of family
members, supporters and reporters aboard a 727 dubbed Maverick 1.
Crowds were good at most stops, and events had fallen his way
before the tour kicked off.
</P>
<P>
   As if they were secretly in his employ, a group of Washington
lobbyists flew to South Carolina the week before McCain arrived to
attack him for supporting campaign finance reform. His book was
doing well. And he'd kicked up a lot of dust by publicly inviting
Pat Buchanan out of the Republican Party after reading his views
about World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The senator who inherited Barry Goldwater's mantle as the GOP's
Arizona maverick needs a lot of such media leverage. Contributions
have picked up since publication of the book, but McCain won't have
anything like the money Gov. George W. Bush and Steve Forbes will
spend in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign has focused its resources on two early-voting
states, New Hampshire and South Carolina, in hopes they can give
him enough of a boost to overtake Bush in the brief primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running for president in South Carolina like he's running
for governor,'' said Trey Walker, his campaign manager in the
Palmetto State. Tuesday, he spoke at a breakfast in Greenville,
flew to Charleston to make another kickoff speech in front of the
USS Yorktown, and on by plane and bus to Saluda County for the
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, McCain has a strong organization headed by
popular former Sen. Warren Rudman, co-chairman of the Concord
Coalition, which shares many of his views on pork barrel spending
and ``soft money.'' In recent weeks he has placed a distant second
to Bush, with numbers in the low teens, in two of three New
Hampshire polls, but his campaign hopes it can expand his support.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting last week with reporters aboard the campaign plane,
cussing about how hard it is to get through the Atlanta airport or
joking about Marines, McCain, 63, seemed easily the most
free-wheeling candidate in a field of often stiff contenders.
</P>
<P>
   He was good off the cuff, fielding several probing questions
from voters at the Greenville breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Republicans do not have the self-discipline necessary to do
what's right, and we've got to eliminate the influence of special
interests,'' he told the GOP faithful. Asked directly about his
``relationship with Jesus Christ,'' he said a person's relationship
with God was ``between that person and God,'' but he joked that he
was the only candidate who had actually served as a preacher,
having filled that role in religious services as a POW.
</P>
<P>
   But the big announcement speech, which he delivered with slight
variations in Nashua and Charleston, was delivered word-for-word
with the text, a token of the military discipline that plays tug of
war with an independent streak in both his biography and his
political profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have passed from a young man to an old one in the service of
my country,'' he says in the closing paragraphs of his stump
speech, ``When my time is over, I want only the satisfaction of
knowing I was true to the faith of our fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   He began the week with a breakfast speech to 4,000 midshipmen at
the U.S. Naval Academy, an institution to which he remains fiercely
loyal while he expresses distaste for the hazing he went through
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whenever you have young men who have too much power
over other young men, there are going to be excesses,'' McCain said
as Maverick 1 headed for another South Carolina stop. He thinks
women have improved the tone of the place.
</P>
<P>
   The joshing, self-deprecating tone in which he talks about his
military service and ordeal as a POW keep the frequent references
to his record from seeming bombastic, and the maverick streak
allows him to come off as staunchly, but not rigidly, conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The independence that sometimes got him in trouble at the
academy has caused McCain to play a contrarian role in issues
ranging from his advocacy of campaign finance reform, on which he
differs sharply with his party's leadership, to his opposition to
ethanol subsidies, a popular expenditure in Iowa _ which, not
coincidentally, doesn't figure heavily in his campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on board with the candidate last week was Federal
Trade Commissioner Orson Swindle, a Georgia native who shared a
cell with McCain in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of McCain's supporters, Swindle argues that McCain,
with his honorable service record and support for campaign finance
reform, has the perfect combination of qualities to be the next
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has every attribute we so desperately need right now,''
Swindle said Monday night at a New York City fund-raiser hosted by
Georgette Mosbacher, McCain's national co-chairwoman, and his
finance chairman, Herb Allison. Some political scenarios have
McCain emerging as the primary challenger to Bush, the
front-runner, in large part because of his broad potential appeal.
But the attributes that cause many independents and Democrats to
say they could vote for McCain don't necessarily serve him well in
states such as South Carolina, where the Republican establishment
traditionally dominates primaries and has already gone largely to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Those attributes also make him a less likely running mate, said
Republican pollster Whit Ayres.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a vice presidential candidate, McCain gives new meaning to
the words `off the reservation,''' Ayres said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Greenville breakfast, McCain referred to the campaign as
``this brief skirmish in the battle of life that we are now engaged
in.'' In a week in which he exuded a happy confidence, it was the
one wistful note, a reminder to himself that there are things
larger than a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He has a long way to go, but last week, at least, things were
going his way.

BIRD FOOD IS A CASUALTY OF THE U.S. WAR ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do 40,000 pounds of birdseed have in common with America's
war on drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, says Jean Laprise, an Ontario farmer who shipped the
birdseed to his American customers only to have it seized when it
crossed the U.S.-Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, say the U.S. government and its critics, but for
altogether different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The birdseed, nearly 20 tons of it, has been locked in a Detroit
warehouse since Aug. 9, when it was impounded by the United States
Customs Service. The reason: the seed consists of sterilized seeds
processed from industrial hemp.
</P>
<P>
   Laprise has found himself mired in one of the more bizarre
episodes of Washington's campaign to curb illicit drug use. Hemp
and marijuana are different varieties of the same plant species,
Cannabis sativa, though the government rarely distinguishes between
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's a tractor trailer full of drugs,'' Laprise said.
``We say it's a tractor trailer full of birdseed.''
</P>
<P>
   But while smoking marijuana delivers a psychoactive high,
smoking hemp gives only a headache. Tetrahydrocannabinol, known as
THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, usually varies
between 4 and 20 percent of a leaf. Industrial hemp has a THC below
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The birdseed seized in Detroit had a THC content of barely .0014
percent, which wouldn't give a bird a buzz.
</P>
<P>
   John Roulac, the president of Nutiva, a company in Sebastapol,
Calif., that buys hemp seeds from Laprise's operation for food
products, said that seeds themselves have no THC, and whatever gets
detected comes from contact with leaves of the hemp plant.
</P>
<P>
   Roulac said the amount of THC was ``like an olive pit in a
railroad boxcar.''
</P>
<P>
   Laprise, whose company, Kenex Ltd., grows and processes hemp
with the approval of the Canadian government, said that ``all of
our other products have no detectable level of THC. The only
shipment with any detectable amount was the birdseed, and it was
really nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the U.S. government today views hemp with suspicion, it
was historically an agricultural staple used in everything from
ropes and sails to clothing and the first American flag supposedly
sewn by Betsy Ross. It has been virtually illegal since 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Canada declared hemp a legitimate crop and has
granted growers' licenses for 35,000 acres. Britain, France and
Germany also have commercial hemp industries. Hawaii, North Dakota
and Minnesota passed laws approving hemp this year as a crop for
hard-pressed farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Kenex's customers, who snap up Laprise's hemp seeds and fibers
for everything from food for animals and people to beauty products
and horse bedding, have been outraged by the seizure in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the heck are they doing arresting birdseed?'' said
Anita Roddick, the British founder of the Body Shop, whose organic
hair- and skin-care products have used hemp oil produced by
Laprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so Monty Pythonesque,'' Ms. Roddick said, alluding to the
antic comedians who mocked life's absurdities. ``They're chasing
around bloody birdseed. It's making the DEA look stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials defended the seizure. DEA
spokesman Terry Parham said, ``Our understanding is there is no
legal way for hemp seed to have come in that contains any quantity
of THC.'' He explained that no product containing THC could be
imported except by a company registered with the DEA, and that no
companies are registered.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-policy critics like Ethan Nadelmann, the president of the
Lindesmith Center, a New York group that advocates a more liberal
drug policy, reacted to the birdseed seizure with glee, contending
that it shows how dumb the war on drugs can get.
</P>
<P>
   Laprise said the Customs Service also ordered him to recall his
earlier exports to the United States of hemp oil, horse bedding,
animal feed and granola bars, or face more than $500,000 in fines.
He cannot comply, he said, because the products have been used or
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
assessing the potential of hemp growing has made the rounds of the
federal government. The report's beige cover is stamped
``Classified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't figure out why they classified this,'' said a
government official who let a reporter take a peek. The study said
there was a limited niche market for hemp products, like Laprise's
birdseed.

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the last quarter-century, only one senator, Bob
Dole in 1996, has won his party's nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   But this has not been for lack of trying. Some of the most
prominent senators in both parties have tried for the nomination
and lost badly, among them the Democrats Edward M. Kennedy, John
Glenn and Henry Jackson and the Republicans Howard Baker, Phil
Gramm and Richard Lugar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina was running
a campaign for the Democratic nomination that went nowhere, a
reporter in New Hampshire asked him whether all senators dreamed of
becoming president. ``Every damn one, every damn day,'' Hollings
replied, an observation that he says holds true today.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the prominent senator running seemingly quixotically
for president is Orrin Hatch of Utah, a 65-year-old Republican, the
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a fixture on the Sunday
television interview programs and a masterly deal-maker with a wide
range of legislative accomplishments over 22 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Hatch finished last among nine contestants in the
Iowa straw poll. He was second to Alan Keyes, the radio talk-show
host, in the Alabama straw poll. They were the only two competing.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has raised barely $1 million, less than 2 percent of the
$56 million collected by the front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas. Tied to Washington by his legislative responsibilities, he
spent only a few days campaigning last month.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Republican circles outside his own campaign staff
believes he stands a chance to win the nomination. Hatch concedes
that his candidacy is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   So why is he running? Here is how he answered that question in
an interview in his Senate office last week:
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most important issue is who's going to appoint the
up to five Supreme Court justices and the 50 percent of the rest of
the judiciary. I'm very concerned about having Al Gore or Bill
Bradley do that. In fact, I'm concerned about having any of the
other Republican candidates do that because none of them have any
experience in this area. I have more experience than all the rest
put together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, it's going to take a conservative with guts to
handle the nation's problems, to solve Social Security and
Medicare, and I'm the conservative with the most guts.''
</P>
<P>
   He is way behind, he said, because he started late, not
announcing his candidacy until July 1. ``Let's face it,'' he went
on, ``most people don't even know I'm in the race. I found that
some of my closest friends in California didn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes heart, Hatch said, from his experience in his first
race for the Senate in 1976. When he started running, he was a
lawyer in private practice hardly known around his state. ``All of
a sudden, the dust cleared,'' he said, ``and I was the United
States senator.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, ``He's way ahead in the polls, but he's a mile wide
and an inch deep,'' said Hatch, who tends to talk about himself in
the third person. ``Orrin Hatch is 40 miles deep and 10 inches
wide.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch continued on Bush: ``He's a very fine person. I love his
parents. But I'm concerned because you have a man here who has four
years of experience in a constitutionally weak governorship. Does
that qualify him to go up against an Al Gore or a Bill Bradley?''
</P>
<P>
   Here is Hatch's take on some of his other competitors:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona: ``Can you name very many pieces of
legislation he's done? Has he been able to bring all sides
together? He's the author of the McCain-Feingold bill. That bill
would wreck the Republican party.'' (The bill, which McCain is
sponsoring with Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., would eliminate
unrestricted donations to political parties.)
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole: ``I wish her well. I don't think there are very
many people who believe she's going to be our nominee for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes: ``I don't think money is a qualification for being
president of the United States. A lot of us have worked very hard
to make sure this party sheds the image that it's the party of the
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's chief strategist, Sal Russo, a veteran of Republican
political wars who is based in California, said front-runners in
their first campaigns for president generally faltered. Hatch's
intention, Russo said, is to be around to pick up the pieces if
Bush founders.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hatch said, ``it's going to come down to George
Bush, John McCain and myself,'' and the party will turn to him
because of his experience.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Hatch's experience is entirely legislative, and when he
talks, he sounds more like a legislator than a presidential
candidate. This is how he described his ability to work with
Democrats:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a fellow that put together the Drug Price Competition
and Patent Term Restoration Act, the Hatch-Waxman bill. Here's a
fellow that put together the child care development block grant,
the Hatch-Dodd bill. Here's a fellow that put together the capital
gains rate reduction, the Hatch-Lieberman bill. Here's a fellow
that put together the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act
with Tom Harkin. Here's a fellow that put together countless
legislative enactments with none other than the bugaboo of all
conservatives, Ted Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The other senator from Utah, Robert Bennett, who is also a
Republican, said legislative experience did not always prepare
politicians well for presidential campaigns. ``A campaign is an
executive-oriented exercise,'' Bennett explained. ``If you've spent
years working out deals behind the scenes, it is not the same as
making an executive decision at high noon.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why so many senators have failed to win their
party's nominations for president. Technically, even Dole was not a
senator when he was nominated. With the nomination sewed up, he
resigned from the Senate in June 1996, a month before the
Republican nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   But it should not be surprising, Bennett said, that so many
senators try to become president. ``In the Senate,'' he said, ``you
have access to people who have great power. And the closer you get
to people who have great power, the easier it is to convince
yourself that you're as smart as he is, and you say to yourself, `I
can see these issues as clearly as he can, maybe clearer, and if he
can do the job, certainly I can.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hatch, he is hedging his bet. In addition to his
presidential campaign, he is running, as Utah law permits, for
re-election to a fifth term in the Senate.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mild air will linger another day near the northeast coast as a
front marking the leading edge of a very cool air mass slows down
over the interior Northeast. Sunshine will mix with increasing
clouds east of the northern Appalachians where afternoon
temperatures will be above seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the front, cooler air will be accompanied by
scattered light showers near the eastern Great Lakes. Steadier rain
will fall to the north of a low pressure center as it moves east
from the central Mississippi Valley early Sunday. The rain will
spread into the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States overnight and
on Monday as the low travels along the slow-moving frontal zone.
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather will persist over the Southeast. Most areas will
have ample sun, but a few afternoon showers will develop near the
southern Appalachians as well as in central and southern Florida as
more humid air spreads into these regions.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably cool air will cover the central and northern Plains
and the Great Lakes states. Plenty of clouds, patchy showers and
cool breezes from the northeast will add to the chill of the day
across much of the Middle West. Some high-elevation snow showers
will occur where moist winds ascend the sloping terrain in parts of
the western Plains. Meanwhile, central and southern Texas will stay
sunny and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Mild, dry air will prevail in most areas west of the crest of
the Rocky Mountains. The day will begin with low clouds near the
California coast. Otherwise, sunshine will be plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: A Change of Pace
</P>
<P>
   Autumn weather is a marked change of pace. Snow fell around
Denver on Tuesday, but temperatures rebounded to near 80 on Friday.
On Saturday, another chilly air mass was poised north of the Denver
area. Weather moves about twice as fast at this time of year
compared with the summer. During the autumn, the deepening arctic
chill advances southward from Canada as tropical warmth clings to
the southernmost United States. This temperature contrast is the
fuel for the jet-stream winds that steer the parade of weather
systems marching to an ever-quickening drum beat.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ On the night 35 years ago before the Astrodome was
unveiled to the world, Tal Smith walked onto the field and stared
at the lights twinkling beneath the great curved roof of steel and
glass. He stood inside the huge air conditioned bowl, surrounded by
nearly 50,000 empty seats, and beheld the artificial wonder of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Astrodome would later be compared to the
``working end of a gigantic roll-on deodorant.'' Never mind that
baseball purists would later blame the Dome for many of the modern
ills of the game. In an opening night exhibition with the Yankees
on April 9, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson watched Mickey Mantle
hit the first home run, and the nation, like Smith, seemed
astonished at the world's first indoor coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was truly a revolutionary venture,'' said Smith, now the
president of the Houston Astros. ``It wasn't just a new ballpark.
There were people who would line up to tour the building even
without an event. They would marvel at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once promoted as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the Astrodome
is now a relic, as outdated as a polyester leisure suit. On Sunday,
the Astros will play their last regular season game at the
Astrodome before moving next season to a new, state-of-the-art
downtown ballpark. Mammoth enough to contain an 18-story building,
the Dome was a monument to the Texan appetite for big things and an
emblem of a colorful era when men like the stadium's eccentric
creator, Judge Roy Hofheinz, reshaped Houston and Texas through
will and money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Astrodome will stand all but abandoned, a monstrous,
climate-controlled white elephant that has succumbed not only to
the changing economics of sports but to the changing expectations
of what a building must do to hold our attention.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the NASA Space Center, the Astrodome transformed
Houston in the 1960s from a big city backwater; the Dome became the
world's biggest stage. When Bobby Riggs challenged Billie Jean King
to the ``Battle of the Sexes'' in tennis, in 1973, only the sheer
mass of the Astrodome could do justice to the comic magnitude of
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of a sense of loss as we abandon this
thing we were so proud of,'' said Stephen Klineberg, a sociologist
at the University of Houston. ``It was the most exciting thing that
had ever happened to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   The new stadium, the $250 million Enron Field, says as much
about Houston today as the Astrodome did a generation ago.
Fashioned with a retractable roof, it has real grass, and it joins
many new ballparks in evoking baseball's past.
</P>
<P>
   Named for a gas company, Enron Field bespeaks a more generic,
corporate face of Houston, the nation's fourth largest city. If the
Astrodome attracted world attention (and a sniff of scorn), Enron
Field's ambitions seem more prosaic: It will make a lot of money
for the Astros, provide a more intimate setting for baseball and,
city officials hope, spur redevelopment of the east side of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the sports industry,'' Smith conceded, ``the economics
dictate. Buildings become obsolete because they can't generate the
same revenues as in other facilities.'' He added, ``It's
regrettable, but it has been 35 years. It had a great run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome will not be demolished, the fate reserved next
year for one of its imitators, the Kingdome in Seattle. But its
future is muddled at best. The Astrodome has only one big tenant
left, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, which is held each
February. But even the rodeo has hinted that it, too, might leave
if Houston attracts a new professional football team and with it, a
new football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The same Astrodome where Elvis sang and Billy Graham preached
could wind up as a bloated hall for trade shows. ``I don't think
that any Hofheinz ever stood in the way of progress in the name of
nostalgia,'' reflected Fred Hofheinz, a two-term mayor in the 1970s
who was his father's chief aide during the construction of the
Astrodome. But, he added, ``I do want to see it survive.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   With its serrated skyline and knot of interstate highways,
Houston today is a vast sprawl that seems far removed from the city
that Roy Hofheinz dominated in the 1950s and 1960s. A cocksure
impresario who fancied cigars and any other totem of opulence,
Hofheinz was reputed to sleep only when bored: He was a lawyer at
19, a state legislator at 22, the Harris County judge at 24, a
millionaire in business by his 30s, and at 40 he was elected mayor,
serving two terms.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, the judge, as he was always known, took control of
Houston's efforts to attract a major league baseball team. He was
fascinated by the notion of building a cooled, domed shopping mall
and surmised that air conditioning could be the salvation for
baseball in heat-choked Houston as well. It was a toss-up as to
which local endeavor was considered more incredible: NASA's efforts
to put a man on the moon or Hofheinz's plan to build a coliseum
where men would play baseball indoors.
</P>
<P>
   He did it, adopting the futuristic glint of the space program by
renaming the three-year-old Colt 45s the Astros (the other choice
was Stars). Members of the grounds crew wore orange space suits. A
scoreboard flashing electronic lights (and advertising) dominated
the outfield. A buzzing capacity crowd watched the Astros beat the
Yankees 2-1 in extra innings as a 6,600-ton air conditioning system
chilled the arena to 72 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can ever see this,'' the judge had said the day before
the game, ``and go back to Kalamazoo, Chicago, New York, you name
it, and still think this town is bush league, that this town is
Indian territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of the Astrodome, the judge realized, was part of
the sell. He built his own five-story apartment/playhouse above
right field, complete with a two-story presidential suite, a circus
room, a medieval chapel, a barber shop and a bowling alley. He
built smaller suites, the forebears of today's luxury suites, for
rental to corporations or wealthy individuals. On opening night,
Fred Hofheinz fetched bowl after bowl of chocolate ice cream for
Johnson, a Texan, as he admired the presidential suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the quintessential salesman,'' Hofheinz said of his
father. The Astrodome ``was made up like Disneyland in order to
make it something people talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball traditionalists would come to despise the Astrodome and
the artifice it brought to the game. The field itself, initially
made of grass and later sawdust, eventually was replaced by a
carpet patented as Astroturf. To the judge, the turf was one of the
Dome's many wonders; his ground crew jauntily vacuumed it in their
space suits. But artificial turf was derided as a hazard to players
and a blaspheme against the pastoral history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Stephen Fox, an architectural historian who teaches at Rice
University and the University of Houston, said the Astrodome was an
``immensely important'' building in the mid-20th century, if mostly
as a triumph of engineering rather than architecture. ``It is one
of the great monuments of American hubris in the 1960s in this kind
of sense of no limits,'' he said, adding graciously, ``It is not a
tremendously refined work of architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox noted that the Dome played an unexpected role in the
evolution of Houston. When construction costs ran over budget, the
judge and city officials called a second bond referendum. With
opposition growing, the judge lobbied the city's growing, if
largely disenfranchised, block of black voters, promising that
blacks could attend all events at the Dome and also could work
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It played a key role in the desegregation of public facilities
in Houston,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the city's population divided fairly equally among
blacks, whites and Latinos, Houston has a black mayor, Lee Brown.
Klineberg, the sociologist, noted that as Houston has matured, the
business and political climate dominated by Roy Hofheinz and a
small number of other white leaders has changed markedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a radically different kind of economy and a new kind
of business leadership and a multicultural environment where
political discussions involve a much wider range of people,'' he
said.
</P>

<P>
   Charles Savino, an executive with the Greater Houston
Partnership, said that the judge's can-do spirit lived on in local
leaders like Bob McNair, who is trying to lure a new professional
football team and build a new stadium. But, Savino said, Houston is
a different place now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of becoming more like the rest of the country,''
Savino said, which might make an apt epitaph for the Astrodome.
Over the years similar stadiums, some larger, were built in other
cities. The awe and wonder wore off: In 1966, more than 550,000
people paid to tour the Astrodome. By 1998, the number had fallen
to 112,000.
</P>
<P>
   The judge lived in the Dome for five years after his first wife
died, but he suffered a stroke, moved out and eventually sold the
team.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after the Astros and the Dodgers finish the game, a
ceremony is planned to honor the judge's stadium. The Astros might
make the playoffs, meaning at least one more game, but Sunday is
being treated as the farewell. Older players will congregate, and
Willie Nelson will sing ``Turn Out the Lights.'' Fred Hofheinz will
stand on the field he helped build and say goodbye as a living link
to his father. ``He was very proud of that building,'' he said.
``It was the pinnacle of his life.''

IN PEDIATRICS, A LESSON IN MAKING USE OF EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCI-CLINICAL-TESTS) 
(nk) 
 By GINA KOLATA and KURT EICHENWALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is a model for an effective way to handle experimental
procedures, it is the world of pediatric cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In that arena, most doctors refuse to offer such treatments
outside clinical trials, insurance companies usually pick up the
tab and experimental procedures are tested quickly, before they
reach the marketplace. The result is that the procedures that work
are adopted widely; those that do not are quickly abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Why the difference from adult medicine? The credit, in large
part, goes to pediatric oncologists. They have organized themselves
into two major consortiums that enroll virtually every child in a
clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups agreed to sponsor only credible studies that
truly advanced knowledge of the field _ quashing the ``me-too''
phase 2 research that proliferates in other medical specialties.
With such quality control in place, the pediatricians were able to
successfully lobby health insurance companies to pay for medical
care in clinical trials. The companies generally refuse to pay for
experimental procedures offered outside trials.
</P>
<P>
   The pediatricians have good reason to unite behind clinical
trials. With comparatively few children getting cancer, the number
of available test subjects was already severely limited. Doctors
convinced each other that it was better for the children to test
treatments promptly than to provide them, untested, to every comer.
</P>
<P>
   The results are heartening. While just 1 percent of adult cancer
patients enroll in clinical trials, 60 percent of pediatric cancer
patients do. Cancer specialists maintain that the consequences are
clear: Progress is much faster in pediatric cancer than it is in
cancer that strikes adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine why adult oncologists don't follow the same
route,'' said Dr. Kenneth Lazarus, a pediatric cancer specialist in
San Antonio. ``If you take all the cancers that were incurable in
the late 1960s, nearly all are curable now. It's dramatic what's
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pediatric world, even bone marrow transplants were tested
promptly. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, at the very time the
procedure was being widely sold for adult cancer patients,
pediatric oncologists began giving it to children with
neuroblastoma, a cancer of the nervous system. The cancer appears
in just 500 children each year. But its effects can be devastating,
striking toddlers from 2{ to 4 years old and often spreading to the
bones, where it can cause excruciating pain before killing the
child.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as transplants appeared as a possibility, the Children's
Cancer Group, one of the national consortiums of pediatric cancer
specialists, began a randomized clinical trial. The group began the
trial in January 1991; within five years, it had reached the
enrollment goal of 545 children. And even though there was a belief
among some pediatric cancer specialists that bone marrow
transplants would be more effective than standard chemotherapy for
these children, there was virtually no market for the procedure
outside the clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have trouble finding children to enroll,'' said Dr.
Archie Bleyer, the chairman of the Children's Cancer Group. In
fact, he said, ``the trial was actually completed ahead of
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now finished, and the results show what the doctors had
hoped _ that bone marrow transplants do improve survival for
children with neuroblastoma.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary success of clinical trials in pediatric cancer
would not have been possible without the cooperation of health
insurance companies, cancer specialists say. Unlike the situation
in adult cancer, where companies have refused to pay for patients
receiving experimental procedures in clinical trials, the same
companies routinely pay for children in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Radtky, stem cell transplant coordinator at Riley Hospital
for Children in Indianapolis, said that the insurance companies
were usually cooperative. ``In five years and 200 patients, by and
large, I have had 5 percent really problem cases, with insurance
companies denying it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance companies even go as far as to use the
reimbursement structure to push children into studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen contracts that said that if it is not a qualified
trial being offered at a qualified center, then it is not
covered,'' said Dr. Andrew Kelahan, the chief operating officer of
the Coalition of National Cancer Cooperative Groups, which
represents the major groups of medical institutions that conduct
cancer clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   One way to encourage the testing of experimental procedures for
adults might be for insurance companies to institute a similar
system, some academic doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   But insurance companies alone are unlikely to change the system
of marketing untested procedures to adults.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, working with the Coalition of National Cooperative
Groups, United Healthcare, which provides health insurance for 13
million Americans, worked out an arrangement to nudge adults into
clinical trials. Dr. Lee Newcomer, a senior vice president for
health policy at United Healthcare, explained: ``If there was a new
treatment out, we would pay for it under the trial scenario. But if
someone said they wanted to give it off of the trial we would say
no.''
</P>
<P>
   But by a year later, nothing had changed. ``It's not working,''
Newcomer said. So far, only a dozen patients have entered clinical
trials. Moreover, he added, most of those patients were never even
told by their doctors that a clinical trial was an option. They
found out about the trials and enrolled despite, not because of,
their doctor's advice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Newcomer said, ``the onus is on the physician community.''
Doctors, he said, may say they believe in putting patients in
trials, but when offered an incentive and an opportunity, ``it
doesn't happen.''

SPORTS COLUMN: IN DESPERATE DAYS, METS KNOW THE SCORE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Say this about the New York Mets: They are not a
bunch of couch potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   With their fate partly out of their control, they did not
unilaterally hunker down on the clubhouse sofas, biting their nails
and rooting for colleagues on the Brewers and the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   After 160 games of a 162-game season, the Mets woke up Saturday
depending on the kindness of fellow union members. They seemed
vaguely embarrassed about their plight, and did not want to indulge
too openly in cheering for other professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so slim,'' said Robin Ventura, Friday night's hero, about
the Mets' chances. ``You don't know what's going to happen. You
just play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could not do anything about games Saturday afternoon.
The Reds would play outdoors in Milwaukee's County Stadium at 1
p.m., Eastern time, and the Astros would play host to the Dodgers
at 4 p.m. in the cavern of the Astrodome, soon to be abandoned for
a real ballpark. Then the Mets would play the Pirates in Shea
Stadium shortly after 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, once again, baseball had lucked out with genuine
old-fashioned excitement in the final weekend _ a three-way
scramble, in three vastly disparate corners of North America, with
two teams going to the postseason and one skulking home.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mets have squandered a four-game lead for the
wild-card spot, which they enjoyed only two weeks ago, they do not
display any swaggering sense of entitlement. Everything must be a
struggle. They act as if they deserve this torture _ which they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun at times,'' Bobby Valentine said after Friday's 3-2
victory in the 11th inning. ``Nerve-racking at other times.''
</P>
<P>
   It was particularly nerve-racking Friday when Valentine could
not communicate with his bullpen because of electronic failures.
Valentine, who is constantly wired into the Internet, could not get
the telephone line or two sets of walky-talkies to operate, so he
sent bench players or staff members scurrying through the catacombs
to keep in touch. Maybe he should have sent e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard provided updates, every half-inning, from the two
vital games out of town. While Pittsburgh sent out left-handed
Scott Sauerbeck for his third inning of relief in the 11th, the
lights flickered from Milwaukee, indicating the Brewers had scored
two runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the players maintain the fiction that they do not
watch the scoreboard. Of course they do. They are a captive
audience in the dugout or the bullpen. It is their livelihood. How
could they not?
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Franco said it was all tied up,'' Valentine conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Shawon Dunston saw the two runs go up as he loosened up to
pinch-hit. He decided the best way to enjoy the gift would be to
get a hit, which he did, soon scoring the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Mets calmed down from their celebration, they did not
necessarily hang on every pitch as the Reds-Brewers game lurched
onward. The game, shown on several televisions in the Mets'
spacious clubhouse, had a tenuous edge, because of the sight of
umbrellas in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Mets went about their business, seemingly oblivious
to the game that would decide if they were temporarily one or two
games behind the Reds. They already were down to one game behind
the Astros, courtesy of the Dodgers' 5-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Without glancing at the television, Ventura talked to reporters.
Ventura, who has been playing with a gimpy knee, but will not
discuss it, was in demand because of his home run early and then
his game-winning single off a left-handed pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to win all your games,'' he said simply. ``You have
to show up. We've had some tough games. It's nice to win one like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Mets, who had family and friends waiting, dressed
and strolled out into the parking lot. John Franco, who had one of
his nightmare relief appearances, stood around in his skivvies,
watching the action from drizzly Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tag up, baby,'' shouted Darryl Hamilton after a Brewer flied
out with a runner on second. The runner did advance, but the
Brewers did not score in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the 10th, Marquis Grissom of Milwaukee made a
lovely acrobatic catch in center with two runners on base to end
the inning. To let off steam, Edgardo Alfonzo let out a highly
appropriate English vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the 10th, Ron Belliard smacked a single to give
the Brewers a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh,'' Hamilton shouted across the clubhouse, where no more
than 10 Mets were watching.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were on their way home or to a late snack. They had
put themselves in this needy position, and did not want to look
like supplicants. But they knew the score. Ballplayers always know
the score.

IS GOD ROOTING FOR DEION TO DANCE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, TEXAS - In ``USA Today,'' No. 21 of the Dallas Cowboys
is pictured standing with feet together, arms spread, eyes turned
to Heaven. He looks like he might ascend at any moment. ``DEION'S
BACK!'' the caption reads.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer shot a glance at the FOX/NFL ad promoting today's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Jake, I asked, can you say ``Hallelujah!''?
</P>
<P>
   Plummer looked unamused.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders is back. His toe healed, the minister of the First
United Every Pa$$ Is Mine Holy Punt Return Gospel Church rejoins
the Cowboys today and says he is praying that Plummer will throw
him the football.
</P>
<P>
   If Deion's prayer is answered, and he scores, the Cowboys
cornerback will perform his new ``Holy Ghost dance.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what a ``Holy Ghost dance`` looks like, as it's
never been attempted in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is the flamboyant star will delight Cowboys fans with
some kind of celebratory seizure that would shame Jerry Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dallas Morning News'' will have 14 photographers on hand
to record the moment, should it happen.
</P>
<P>
   My advice to Jake (who has thrown nine interceptions) was for
him to pray that he ``doesn't'' throw the ball to Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, maybe Jake's prayer will offset Deion's, assuming his
prayer carries equal weight. Jake shook his head. ``Like `Who does
God like better, him or me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders is born again. He found religion a couple years
ago, about the same time his wife filed for divorce. A new man, he
turned his life around. Sanders told the world, ``Fornication is no
longer my drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But what are we to think of an athlete who prays for
interceptions? Is Deion _ Prime Time _ truly giving all the glory
to God? Or is Deion primarily promoting Deion?
</P>
<P>
   Has religiosity become his shtick?
</P>
<P>
   Sanders loves the limelight as few athletes will admit. Remember
when Deion played for the Atlanta Falcons ``and'' the Braves? One
Sunday he flew to Miami and played in an NFL game. Afterward, he
jetted back to Pittsburgh for Game 5 of the National League
playoffs. No athlete had done anything like that. Who would
``want'' to, given the inconvenience, and quality of airline food.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he pulled double duty out of his commitment and
loyalty to the Falcons and Braves. But skeptics suggested his
whirlwind stadium-to-helicopter-to-plane-to-limo-to-ballpark
odyssey was a self serving publicity stunt designed to make
national news and to satisfy his giant ego, which it did.
</P>
<P>
   Many NFL players walk the straight and narrow, witnesses for
God. After Friday's practice, about 20 Cardinals knelt in a circle
and joined hands in prayer. But no one prayed for an interception,
or 100 yards rushing. No one jumped up and danced for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   If Deion picks off a Plummer pass and scores a touchdown what
does the event mean? How do we interpret it? Was it God's Will? I
don't think so. Does God influence the outcome of games? Does he
play favorites?
</P>
<P>
   Trey Junkin, the Cardinals veteran long snapper, has a favorite
cartoon. It depicts a football player, head bowed, kneeling beneath
a goalpost. From above, a voice says, `Gee, Timmy, I'd like to help
but my money is on the ``other'' team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything in The Book about `Thou shalt kick thy
neighbor's (behind),'' Junkin said. ``The God I pray to doesn't
care about football.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's an important game. A division game. But surely
Almighty God has more important things to do this Sabbath than
watch the Cowboys and Cardinals. As Dave McGinnis said, in
agreement, ``He ain't dialed into FOX.'' &QL;

VALENTINE DID NOT CHANGE, BUT PLAYERS' EXECUTION DID 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Hurricane Floyd raged through eastern states last month, Jack
McKeon sat in the comfort of his office at Cinergy Field in
Cincinnati and made a bold prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a gut feeling,'' the Reds' manager said, ``that we're
either going to win our division or we're going to beat out the
Mets for the wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Mets, the Reds and the Houston Astros prepared Friday for
their final series of the regular season, McKeon denied that he had
made that declaration as a way of needling the Mets and their
manager, Bobby Valentine. The 68-year-old McKeon, the major
leagues' oldest manager, has been known to do things to annoy
Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you looked at the schedule,'' McKeon related, ``who did
you figure that you could beat? They had to play the Braves six
times. I was just doing some math, figuring the Braves would cool
them off. It was no disrespect for the Mets. Houston was four games
ahead of you. The best shot for you is the Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day McKeon offered his view of the races, Sept. 16, his
team was three games behind the Astros in the National League
Central and two and one-half games behind the Mets in the wild-card
race. The Mets subsequently lengthened their lead over the Reds to
four games with only 12 games to play, but then they encountered
the Braves, as McKeon was counting on.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves beat the Mets three times in Atlanta, then two more
times in three games at Shea Stadium, all in the space of 10 days.
In between, the Mets lost three games in Philadelphia to a team
that had lost 23 of its previous 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is there was some carry-over effect from the Braves
series,'' Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said of the
Philadelphia disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Their seven successive losses and eight defeats in nine games
sent the Mets plummeting out of the wild-card lead and placed them
on the precipice of extinction from the playoffs they had seemed so
certain to make.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves. They are the common denominator of the Mets'
end-of-season failures this season and last. Last season, the Mets
had a one-game wild-card lead with five games to play, then lost
two games to the Montreal Expos and three to the Braves. Last
season, the Braves beat the Mets nine times in 12 games; this
season, the Braves beat the Mets nine times in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I thought we just weren't quite good enough, but
this year I don't think that's the case,'' Phillips said.
``Everybody can come up with their own version about why it is. My
version about why it happened is guys started trying too much. Then
the question is why did that happen. I don't know the answer to
that one.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking an explanation for the Mets' reprise of their 1998
demise, which this time also cost them a chance to unseat the
Braves as division champions, some people inside baseball and out
look for dark, hidden reasons, motivated in no small part by the
widespread dislike of Valentine. But no one was citing managerial
deficiencies in Valentine as the Mets were gaining their first 92
victories and compiling the best won-lost record in the league for
the previous three and one-half months.
</P>
<P>
   Two club officials said that in assessing the job a manager has
done, they look for signs that he changed his modus operandi during
a losing streak. In Valentine's case, they said, they found he had
not. A manager's strategy can always be questioned, but Valentine
didn't make any outrageously different moves in trying to beat the
Braves and the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can argue forever about a manager's moves,'' Mike Piazza
said. ``But whenever a manager makes a move, the guy he puts in
that place has to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   From June 6, when three of the team's coaches were fired and the
Mets ended an eight-game losing streak, to the start of the series
in Atlanta on Sept. 21, they had a 65-30 record, a .684 winning
percentage that would compute to 111 victories for an entire
season. During that long stretch, the team's regulars and part-time
players executed.
</P>
<P>
   Late in that impressive period were two series with Houston, the
Central Division leader. The Mets won four of the six games. At the
same time, the Reds played the Braves and lost five of six. The
Reds dropped only one additional game behind the Astros but tumbled
from one and one-half to four games behind the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves giveth and the Braves taketh. Three weeks later,
the Mets arrived in Atlanta only one game behind the Braves, and
they then lost seven straight with the lineup's seven .300 hitters
batting a collective .211. The Mets scored 15 runs in those games.
In the two games they played before the losing streak began, they
had scored 19 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a team whose offensive style is working the count and
taking pitches, waiting to get into a hitter's count and getting a
pitch to hit,'' Phillips said. ``The Braves don't give you the
luxury to work the count that way. They throw strikes. Because we
didn't score and didn't hit, I think we changed our approach a
little bit and got overaggressive. Even in Philadelphia, we were in
pitchers' counts all the time. We were swinging early in the
count.''
</P>
<P>
   A National League scout who has shadowed the Mets closely in
recent weeks did not agree with the general manager's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My charts don't show that,'' the scout said of the early
swings. ``I'm always looking for that. I look for patterns, and I
didn't see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the explanation, as the Mets struggled to score runs,
they began pressing more. That's a natural reaction in baseball
slumps, but it's the opposite of what players should do. ``It's
unfortunate when it happens at the end because it becomes your
legacy,'' Phillips said of the losing streak. ``Because it's the
end, it makes you feel that much more desperate to stop it. It
causes you to try harder, relax less, be more aggressive and chase
pitches. It's one of those cyclical things that feed on a club.''

</P>
<P>
   As the Mets struggled and staggered, the Reds reeled off six
consecutive victories, including one in Houston in the first game
of a two-game series last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody would have thought we'd be sitting here
with three days to go with 95 wins,'' said McKeon, whose team's $33
million payroll is half the size of the Mets'.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected the Reds to be in any race, and McKeon has
played down their presence in both races. ``We haven't discussed
the playoffs or anything the last month,'' he said. ``We just play
day to day. All we preach is have fun, relax, go out and enjoy
yourself. We haven't mentioned the Astros and the Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' plight became so grave last weekend in Philadelphia
that after their second loss there Valentine made a strange
proclamation for a manager. ``If we don't go to the playoffs,'' he
told reporters, ``I shouldn't come back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was trying to be a lightning rod for his players,
deflecting attention from them and piercing the mushrooming
pressure; maybe he was doing what he often does, making the
development about himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also tried meetings, one run by Valentine, another by
the players. Nothing worked, including most of Valentine's in-game
moves.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game in Philadelphia, the Mets led, 2-1, in the
eighth inning when Valentine summoned Armando Benitez, the team's
often unhittable closer, with two out and one runner on base.
Benitez gave up two hits, and the Mets were on their way to a 3-2
loss. Valentine critics questioned his choice of Benitez instead of
John Franco to pitch to a left-handed batter.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his selection of Benitez, the manager said Friday
night: ``Every single time the rest of my life in that situation,
Armando pitches. It's the most ridiculous thought in the world that
anyone else should pitch in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he made only one move during the streak that he
might like to have taken back. It was when he had Bobby Bonilla bat
for Rey Ordonez in the eighth inning with the bases loaded, one out
and Atlanta ahead, 3-2. Terry Mulholland, a left-hander against
whom Bonilla had batted .351 in their careers, struck him out. The
Mets did not score in the inning and lost, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been the one building Rey's RBI thing the whole time, and
I just let my head take over from my gut,'' Valentine said. ``Most
of the rest of the time I've allowed my gut to rule. It was just my
eyes saying I'm not sure if this is right, but these are really
good statistics. I have to go with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-3 game against the Braves last Thursday night, the Mets
had a runner at first and two out in the 10th inning. Valentine
needed a pinch-hitter when Mulholland came into the game, and this
time he used Jay Payton, a right-hand-hitting rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had a better chance of getting a hit,'' Valentine
said. ``That was my gut.'' But Payton grounded to second base for
the third out, and the Braves won the game in the next inning.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours earlier, the Mets had halted their losing
streak, emerging from their two-runs-a-game rut and crushing the
Braves, 9-2, behind Al Leiter. Afterward, it was noted that there
was a remarkable similarity to a Leiter victory over the Yankees in
June that started the three-and-one-half-month spree. Did Leiter
see a sign in the outcome?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, ``the sign that it started a four-game
winning streak last time, and we have four games to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets didn't duplicate the June winning streak. The loss
to the Braves dropped the Mets two games behind the Reds and the
Astros, who were tied for the wild-card spot as well as the Central
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The loss also shoved the Mets to the brink of elimination. If
they lost Friday night and the other two teams won, the Mets would
be excused from any additional October games. But the exact
opposite occurred, and the Mets, now only one game back after play
ended Friday, had life for another day.

GUNS ON IDLE, SOLDIERS STALK PREY BY NIGHT; DILI IS THEIRS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ The objective was the Hotel Dili.
</P>
<P>
   Crouching in double file, halting on whispered commands, the
military patrol, part of the Australian-led international
peacekeeping force now cautiously gaining a grip in East Timor,
moved cautiously through the night, its weapons at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees lounging in looted chairs watched curiously from their
lean-tos across the street. Three youths played a tambourine in the
orange light of a street lamp. A child rode by on a tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, mister,'' called the child. ``How are you?'' The patrol
halted and took defensive positions outside the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a seafront cluster of single-story rooms, it
was packed with refugees and humming with the late-evening babble
of small children.
</P>
<P>
   Two armored vehicles armed with .50-caliber machine guns waited
at a short distance, their motors idling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the sites we like to keep an eye on,'' said
Cpl. Andrew Becker, the commander of the patrol. ``As you know, the
militia don't fare that well in the hills. They like to come back
to town to places like this.''
</P>
<P>
   All across Dili _ and now in an increasing number of towns
around East Timor _ patrols like this are constantly on the move as
they attempt to intimidate and flush out the irregular militias
that have wreaked havoc here.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-trained militias with their grab bag of odd weaponry
terrorized the unarmed population with little difficulty. But in
the last two weeks, they have not challenged the firepower of these
disciplined foreign soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers' commander, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, said his
troops had moved at a careful pace to secure Dili before beginning
to fan out through the rest of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we go, we stay,'' he said. ``Where we seek to control,
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker's patrol moved into the grounds of the Hotel Dili, in
battle-ready groups of three, ducking under lines of washing,
peering into sheds and bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny, overcrowded rooms, stripped of furniture and doors by
looters, were filled with blinding light from uncontrolled electric
power. Their ceiling fans whirred endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, situated beside a former militia headquarters, had
been the site of two brief attacks when it was filled with foreign
journalists in the week before the Aug. 30 referendum in which East
Timorese voted to become independent of Indonesia, which invaded
this territory in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A room was inspected. Young women giggled and a small child
burst into tears at the sight of giant men with their strange,
protruding night-vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the seafront road, the soldiers proceeded toward the
port, turning their heads slowly from left to right in silent
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The goggles, the soldiers said, have transformed the art of
night patrols, turning a mere man into an omniscient Cyclops.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these streets we crossed,'' said Becker. ``I could see
right down to the end of them. For example, if some guys approached
us, we could see them at 150 meters quite plainly. And they
wouldn't even know we were there until they were 20 meters away.''
</P>
<P>
   Another soldier said, ``People say the next war will be won by
the side that carries the most batteries'' for their goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Armored carriers drove up with a grunt and the soldiers
clambered aboard, nine to a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, the patrol was in the outskirts of Dili, the
long antennae of the vehicles slapping and banging against
overhanging tree branches.
</P>
<P>
   Now the night was dark and silent, the air cooling as the patrol
headed into the hills, the clamor of refugees and the ugly smell of
a burned and filthy city fading behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The objective here was a prominent statue of Jesus Christ,
dedicated in this heavily Roman Catholic territory in 1996 by
former President Suharto in what many East Timorese saw as a
calculated insult.
</P>
<P>
   The statue is 89 feet high, symbolizing Indonesia's insistence
that East Timor was its 27th province. And its arms are raised not
toward the town below but toward largely Muslim Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The area around the statue provided a base for some of the most
feared of Indonesia's soldiers, a unit that liked to dress in black
and strike terror in Dili in the guise of what locals call ``black
ninjas.'' But now the hillsides seemed empty. The two armored
vehicles sped up the winding road in darkness and near silence,
their drivers guided by infrared sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Through the goggles the shimmering hillsides seemed covered in
frost. The port, now miles away, glittered invitingly, giving no
visible hint of the recent terror.

 &HT;    Miller slams Boston's Martinez
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   AL EAST
</P>
<P>
   A gratifying aspect of mound maestro Pedro Martinez's
development has been his shedding his reputation as a head-hunter.
That news apparently never got to Orioles manager Ray Miller, who
went on a tirade after Martinez hit Brady Anderson in the back
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching him do it for 10 years,'' Miller ranted.
``He doesn't have the guts to walk up to anybody's face. All he
does is run behind everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Anderson became the eighth man Martinez hit all
year. And Boston franchise Nomar Garciaparra was out of uniform
that day, after being drilled the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shortstop couldn't play, that's my only response,'' Boston
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``Selective memory.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   For the all the talk that Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss
might be leaving the club to become the Brewers' manager, there
also is talk within the New York front office that he might be
fired after the season.
</P>
<P>
   AL CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   HARGROVE IN AWE OF RAMIREZ
</P>
<P>
   When Manny Ramirez reached 161 RBIs, the scoreboard at
Cleveland's Jacobs Field didn't look right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at it the other day when they put it on the
board,'' said manager Mike Hargrove. ``And I was thinking that when
I played I used to have around 70 RBI every year, which wasn't bad.
But golly, then I realized that Manny has 90 RBI more than I had in
my best year. Geez!''...
</P>
<P>
   Chicago left-hander Jim Parque was 9-6 the first half and 0-9
the second.... The Royals, who entered the weekend eight runs shy
of setting a franchise scoring record, were also two blown saves
shy of breaking the majors blown saves mark of 31.... After making
three errors in a 14-3 loss to the White Sox on Fan Appreciation
Night, Twins players handed out their game jerseys to selected
lucky fans. Said infielder Danny Hocking, ``The way we played
tonight, we should have given our jerseys away before the game. I
was embarrassed.''

   JACKSON EYES ANGELS BID
</P>
<P>
   People close to the Angels say it won't be long before the
franchise and the Mighty Ducks hockey club will be bought by Henry
T. Nicholas III and partners at Orange County based Broadcom Corp.
And Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson is working his way into the Angels
group, which does not excite Andy Dolich.
</P>
<P>
   Dolich, a former A's executive, heads a group that includes
Jackson whose $120 million bid to purchase the Oakland team was
tabled at the last owners meeting. That was enough for Jackson, who
headed south to have preliminary talks with Nicholas about his
Angels bid. The new Angels owners seek a high-profile baseball
presence in front office management, not to mention an
African-American presence. Although Pat Gillick was an early
front-runner for the vacant Seattle GM job, Bob Watson is the only
candidate to have a follow-up interview. Gillick's name has since
also come up in Los Angeles, after the firing of Dodgers president
Bob Graziano.

 &HT;    Umpire earns Mets' ire
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   NL EAST
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves left New York Thursday night, the Mets seemed more
concerned with rookie plate umpire Phil Cuzzi than their own fate.
The club was primarily angry over Cuzzi's refusal to appeal checked
swing calls to base umpires, but manager Bobby Valentine was
incensed that Cuzzi had the plate at all, with veteran Jerry
Crawford calling bases all series.
</P>
<P>
   A critical checked swing call against Mike Piazza in the ninth
prompted Mets GM Steve Phillips to say, ``I was wondering if there
were political issues involved.'' Cuzzi is one of the 25 minor
league umps hired to replace the 22 veterans who were let go.
Crawford, who was at first, is president of the umpires union....
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia catcher Mike Lieberthal has this message for his
front office: ``Pitching-wise, we can't match up. I think we're
maybe only one starter away in the rotation. Relief-wise, we need
something different. A lot of teams can say they're one or two
pitchers away, but I think we need more than that. It stinks to
lose every day.''
</P>
<P>
   NL CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   RIGGLEMAN SAFE IN CHICAGO
</P>
<P>
   Chicago manager Jim Riggleman shouldn't have to wait any longer
than Monday to see if he still has a job. He could stay if he
dismisses some of his coaching staff, but his biggest strong point
is a continued positive working relationship with GM Ed Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict for so many other Cubs won't be so certain.
Essentially, the only veteran position players expected back are
Sammy Sosa, Mark Grace and Henry Rodriguez. With a weak crop of
free agents available this winter, Lynch must be ready to deal....
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati GM Jim Bowden will have to see his payroll bumped
some $22 million to assume raises, bonuses and four free agent
contracts (including outfielder Greg Vaughn) to maintain his
roster. ``If we get to the World Series, I might be able to talk
our new majority owner (Carl Lindner) into a $55 million payroll to
keep the team together,'' Bowden said.

<P>
   NL WEST
</P>
<P>
   SEASON FRUSTRATING FOR ROCKIES
</P>
<P>
   The weekend can't end fast enough in Denver, where a sour season
has festered for weeks. Jim Leyland's burnout, Larry Walker backing
out for knee surgery and the first losing September in franchise
history has made for the darkest days in Rockies history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole year has been a disappointment,'' said outfielder
Dante Bichette. ``And then we pretty much went into the tank. We've
never done that before.''
</P>
<P>
   After hiring a new manager _ and Buddy Bell remains the
frontrunner _ this roster is going to be scrutinized. Even though
Bichette has a no-trade clause, the club would like to move his
contract ($6.5 million coming over the next two years). Neither
Darryl Kile nor Vinny Castilla is safe....
</P>
<P>
   Andy Benes opened the season as Arizona's third starter but is
in danger of falling from the postseason rotation behind Omar Daal
and Brian Anderson. Don't expect the Diamondbacks to pick up his $6
million option next year.... With two saves this weekend, the
Padres' Trevor Hoffman can break Dennis Eckersley's record of 94
saves in back-to-back seasons.

 &HT;    Travis still a standard
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ted Williams batted .406 in 1941, and Joe DiMaggio had
a record 56-game hitting streak. But neither led the American
League in hits that season, baseball's last before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Travis did.
</P>
<P>
   Travis, a soft-spoken Georgian who grew up as the youngest of 12
children on a Fayette County farm, had 218 hits. His .359 average
beat out DiMaggio (.357) for second place behind Williams in the
batting race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost a dream year,'' said Travis, now 86 and still
living in the Riverdale area. ``But I knew all season I was on
borrowed time.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis, then 28 and unmarried, already had heard from his draft
board and was deferred from service only through the end of the
season. He received his induction notice on Christmas Eve _ 17 days
after hearing about the bombing of Pearl Harbor while on a hunting
trip with Washington teammate Buddy Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   He reported to duty in early January and was not discharged
until the end of World War II. Travis made it back to the Senators
for the last few weeks of the 1945 season. By then he had suffered
frostbite on two toes while in special services with the 76th
Infantry in France, and his baseball skills had waned. By 1947, his
career was over at age 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people say the war cost me a chance at the Hall of
Fame,'' said Travis, a left-handed batter whose .314 career average
for 12 seasons remains the best for an American League shortstop.
``But I don't think about that at all. Who knows what would have
happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, there is already too many people in (the Hall of
Fame). I've always thought it should just be for great players. I
was a good player, but I wasn't a great one.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many baseball people, think that his career _ although
shortened _ was too good to be forgotten. That's why Travis still
regularly gets autograph requests in the mail, 52 years after he
played his last game. Many letters come with old photos and
newspaper clippings. He even received a scrapbook of his career
that a fan had kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't do any of those autograph shows, but I'll sign
anything I get in the mail,'' Travis said. ``I suppose people know
old players like me don't have many more years left, so they try to
get us to sign while we can.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Travis can read the mail for himself now, thanks to
cataract surgery on his left eye this spring. Glaucoma has cost
Travis most of the sight in his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had great sight when I played, a real good batting eye,''
Travis said. ``That's what makes not seeing well so hard now. I
used to go to Braves games all the time, but now I just watch on
TV. I couldn't see if I tried to go to Turner Field, and I don't
drive anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis still lives on the land where he grew up, his 85 acres a
sanctuary from the suburban sprawl that has overtaken the area.
Evander Holyfield's estate is about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just used to be dirt roads out here,'' said Travis' wife of
57 years, Helen. ``Things sure have changed. Thank goodness we are
so far off the road. That gives us a little privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis and a son still take care of a herd of 10 cattle. ``That
gives me a little something to do each day,'' said Travis, who had
quadruple-bypass surgery about 17 years ago. ``I'm doing pretty
good for my age.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis was only 19 and had never seen a major-league game when
he made his debut with Washington in 1933 as an emergency fill-in
for an injured Ossie Bluege. Called up from Chattanooga, Tenn., he
had hits in his first five at-bats _ still a major-league record.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to top that the rest of my career,'' Travis
said. ``I thought they just called me up to sit on the bench, and
then I get five straight hits. It's still hard to believe. I guess
I was too scared to know what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis hit more than .300 in seven of his first eight full
seasons, making the All-Star Game 1938, '40 and '41, despite having
to compete with American League rivals Joe Cronin, Luke Appling and
Lou Boudreau. ``Shortstops were expected to hit in those days,''
Travis said.
</P>
<P>
   Travis saw Babe Ruth hit his last homer as a Yankee in 1934, and
he had wet eyes like everyone else in Yankee Stadium when a dying
Lou Gehrig made his farewell speech in 1939 and Babe Ruth Day was
held in 1947. But he says his most memorable baseball meeting was
with a fellow Georgian, Ty Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Travis played in the dedication game for the Baseball Hall of
Fame in 1939 and rode on the train from Detroit to Cooperstown,
N.Y., with the legendary Georgia Peach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that he gave me one bit of advice,'' Travis said.
``He told me, `Save your money.' Of course, you didn't make much in
the days when I played. But I guess I did OK. It didn't cost much
to live back in those days, either. That was a long, long time
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   CECIL TRAVIS FILE
</P>
<P>
   Age: 86.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown: Riverdale.
</P>
<P>
   Family: Married to Helen for 57 years. Sons Tony, Mike and Rick.
</P>
<P>
   Career: Had average of .314 _ best for an American League
shortstop _ in 12 seasons with the Washington Senators. Led
American League in hits with 218 in 1941 while batting. 359 with 19
triples and 101 RBIs. Missed nearly four full seasons during World
War II. Suffered frostbite on two toes in Europe. Retired after
hitting only .216 in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Debut: Had a record five hits in his first five at-bats for
Washington on May 16, 1933, during a 11-10 win over Cleveland in 12
innings, finishing 5-for-7. The Senators won the pennant, and
Travis received $500 as part of a losing World Series share,
despite spending most of the season in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star appearances: Played for the American League in 1938,
'40 and '41, when Ted Williams gave the AL a dramatic 7-5 win with
a three-run homer in the ninth inning at Detroit.

   ATLANTA _ Although the Baseball Writers' Association of America
stipulates only that all ballots be in ``prior to the start of
postseason play,'' some of these choices could have been made by
the Fourth of July. Then again, others are so knotted, not another
six months of play could make them any easier to cast.
</P>
<P>
   That said, here follows one man's 1999 awards:
</P>
<P>
   MVP
</P>
<P>
   NL: 1. Chipper Jones, Atlanta. 2. Jeff Bagwell, Houston. 3. Matt
Williams, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two months, Jones made the Braves the best team in
the league. Plus, he reserved his best play for the contenders. The
two Mets series _ four homers, eight RBIs in six games _ swayed the
vote
</P>
<P>
   AL: 1. Ivan Rodriguez, Texas. 2. Robbie Alomar, Cleveland. 3.
Pedro Martinez, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   No one was as dominant both in the field and at the plate as
Rodriguez. Alomar started everything that RBI king Manny Ramirez
finished. Martinez's dominance alone got the Red Sox into October.
</P>
<P>
   Cy Young Award
</P>
<P>
   NL: 1. Mike Hampton, Houston. 2. Randy Johnson, Arizona. 3.
Kevin Millwood, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Diamonbacks scored two or fewer runs for Johnson 10
times and winning half of those would make this a runaway. But he
won just one of them. Hampton went 19 starts with just one loss.
</P>
<P>
   AL: 1. Pedro Martinez, Boston. 2. Mariano Rivera, New York. 3.
Mike Mussina, Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If this isn't unanimous, someone's BBWAA card needs revoking.
Rivera made the ninth inning a moot point _ 43 saves in 47 chances.
The only pitcher perhaps better than Mussina was Bartolo Colon, who
worked with the Tribe run machine behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year
</P>
<P>
   NL: 1. Warren Morris, Pittsburgh. 2. Preston Wilson, Florida. 3.
Scott Williamson, Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a flat September, Morris hit .292 with 15 homers and
72 RBIs, and while Wilson might emerge as one of the game's new
power hitters, Morris' RBI production is comparable while hitting
lower in the order.
</P>
<P>
   AL: 1. Carlos Beltran, Kansas City. 2. Tim Hudson, Oakland. 3.
Billy Koch, Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, the Auburn product who came out of nowhere in June,
might have won it with a full season. But Beltran had a 20-20 first
year and anchors the future of the franchise from center field.
</P>
<P>
   Manager of the Year
</P>
<P>
   NL: 1. Jack McKeon, Cincinnati. 2. Bobby Cox, Atlanta. 3. Larry
Dierker, Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Cox had this one sewn up until the Reds were ignited under
McKeon at midseason and exceeded everyone's expectation. Cox had
more players out for the year; McKeon had less talent to work with.
</P>
<P>
   AL: 1. Jimy Williams, Boston. 2. Art Howe, Oakland. 3. Joe
Torre, New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox hadn't made the playoffs in consecutive seasons
since 1915-16. Williams also lost Mo Vaughn. The A's had their
first winning record in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Comeback Player NL: Hideo Nomo, Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Rejected by three clubs before camp broke, out of the majors for
the first five weeks, Nomo wound up going 12-8 for a team that will
finish 15 games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   AL: John Jaha, Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   A bad foot and a horrible 1998 left Jaha unsigned as spring
training began. Oakland's faith was rewarded with a career-high
35-homer season. Honorable mention: Jermaine Dye, Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise Player NL: Brian Giles, Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland couldn't find a place for him and dealt him for
reliever Ricky Rincon. Giles missed the last three weeks and is
still among NL leaders in homers (39) and RBIs (115) in just 141
games.
</P>
<P>
   AL: Shawn Green, Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Green gave Toronto its first 30-30 season, a nice
summer from a kid who never seemed to be able to keep a starting
job. In 1999, he went for 41 homers and 121 RBIs and leads the
league with 86 extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   Flop of the Year
</P>
<P>
   NL: Raul Mondesi, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, the majors' only 30-30 player when the weekend began,
was compelled to apologize for being a jerk around a very
freaked-out team. Somehow, his behavior has managed to make a
statesman of Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   AL: Frank Thomas, Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a fit about not wanting to play first. He threw a fit
over the decline of the White Sox. He threw a fit when asked about
his declining power numbers. Then he needed foot surgery. The Big
Hurt became the Big Pain.

 &HT;    EXPENSIVE PAIR OF MARINERS
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't make too much out of Nintendo CEO Howard
Lincoln's making those definitive offers ``to both Ken Griffey and
Alex Rodriguez that would make them the highest-paid players in the
130-year history of major-league baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras, said that the pair ``are not
mere players, they must be considered capital assets like, for
instance, a ballpark.'' Before this is all done, last winter's
Kevin Brown talks will look like a bake sale.
</P>
<P>
   Initial offers to both players _ $140 million over eight years
to Griffey; $70 million over seven years to Rodriguez _ were only
opening position statements.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR-MADE
</P>
<P>
   When he started putting together a front-office in Tampa Bay,
general manager (and ex-Brave player development chief) Chuck LaMar
took some heat for populating his staff with a legion of ex-Atlanta
staffers. Dean Taylor, just hired away from the Braves as
Milwaukee's new GM, did the same, using his first hire for Dave
Wilder as his vice president for player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The two first worked together under John Schuerholz for five
seasons in Atlanta, Wilder in scouting and development through
1995. Wilder becomes one of the highest ranking minority executives
in the game. He had been an assistant GM with the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the leading candidate in my mind from the day I
accepted the job,'' said Taylor.

 &HT;    Billick shaking up the Ravens
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Baltimore Ravens coach Brian Billick can sympathize
with the Falcons' injury woes.
</P>
<P>
   With running back Jamal Anderson and quarterback Chris Chandler
sidelined with injuries, and defensive tackle Travis Hall's thumb
throbbing, the Falcons will be less than full strength today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard a great deal about where they're at
injury-wise,'' Billick said. ``We're talking about (playing) a
backup quarterback, a running back that didn't play much last year
and (losing) one of their key defensive linemen in the front seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm talking about us,'' Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens, who got their first win under Billick last week,
17-10 over Cleveland, are battling injuries of their own. Starting
running back Priest Holmes has missed two games with a sprained
right knee, and defensive tackle Tony Siragusa missed last week's
win after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Billick found capable reserves in Errict Rhett, who has rushed
for at least 100 yards two games in a row, and tackle Lional
Dalton. Even without Siragusa, Baltimore held Cleveland to a
club-record 189 yards in Week 3.
</P>
<P>
   Billick, the architect of Minnesota's record-setting offense
last season, signed a six-year, $9million contract in January. He
quickly took control of the franchise, which won just 16 games the
past three seasons. In a team meeting last spring, he challenged
Siragusa to lose weight and offered him a reward. Siragusa lost 25
pounds in less than six weeks. In May, safety Ralph Staten walked
into a team meeting 20 minutes late. Billick cut him the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But his most drastic change was introducing computers to the
franchise. Every assistant coach has one now, and so do some
players. Billick uses it to dissect his West Coach offense and
break down opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything basically comes from his computer _ different
figures and stats, breakdowns of defenses we play, everything,''
quarterback Stoney Case said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an Air Force test pilot, Billick enrolled in the Air
Force Academy out of high school, but later transferred to Brigham
Young. He played in the NFL for only two seasons, and returned to
BYU as a graduate assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he joined the San Francisco 49ers as the team's
assistant public relations director. He caught the attention of
head coach Bill Walsh, but wanted to return to coaching. Billick
left the 49ers in 1981, eventually joining coach Dennis Green's
staff at Stanford in 1989, where he coached future NFL wide
receivers Ed McCaffrey and Chris Walsh, then jumped to the NFL with
Green three years later.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Billick's offenses ranked among the top eight in
four of his final five seasons and set an NFL record with 556
points in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the reasons I came here in the first place,''
Case said. ``This is the first time I've ever had an offense-minded
head coach, somebody that can relate to the quarterback a little
bit. That's definitely a factor I like about this team.''

 &HT;    Graziani unafraid thrust in spotlight
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First things first. When Tony Graziani goes under
center today, the man suddenly thrust into the role of co-savior
for the Falcons wants fans to know something.
</P>
<P>
   They shouldn't interpret his bug-eyed gaze as evidence of fear.
</P>
<P>
   When he started Sept. 20 in a Monday night game at Dallas, TV
exaggerated his normal gaze, and he looked, well, like somebody had
startled him awake from a deep snooze.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent letters to the editor, and calls to sports talk radio
were consistent in one regard. Fans figured the third-year pro was
scared witless in his third NFL start.
</P>
<P>
   He said it just wasn't so, and it won't be today when the takes
over for Chris Chandler as the Falcons (0-3) play the Ravens (1-2)
at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 215-pounder just happens to have giant eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident and ready that night,'' he said. ``Maybe I was
a little more intense at first, and that's what the whole `Deer in
the headlights' thing was. I was really comfortable; we just
couldn't get anything going.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani has struggled to get something going since he was a
seventh-round pick out of the University of Oregon in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before his first training camp, the person most dear
to him, his mother Debbie, died of lung cancer. She had spent his
senior season driving with Tony's stepfather from Modesto, Calif.,
to see him play.
</P>
<P>
   Tony's mom was everybody's mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team kind of rallied around me and her,'' he said. ``It
was like a family deal. It was kind of therapeutic for her. I was
numb (when she died). I still think about her every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys say this, but she really was my best friend.'''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani's only start that season was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   With Chandler hurt, Graziani got the nod Oct. 26 at Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   He completed 4 of 18 passes for 24 yards and two interceptions
in the rain, and was replaced in the second half by Billy Joe
Tolliver. Atlanta lost 21-12.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander played better, but only a little, last year,
when his passer rating was 42.4, up from 3.7 as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's played better still, completing 22 of 39 passes
for 274 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He has a
respectable 76.2 passer rating.
</P>
<P>
   That's gone largely unnoticed, however, because the team is
winless. Fan and media reaction has been unkind.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism doesn't grate like last year.
</P>
<P>
   College sweethearts who were engaged after the '97 NFL draft,
and married little more than a year ago, the Grazianis are parents
now.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Frederic entered the world Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor the dog, Daisy the cat, Jack the cat, a Valentine's Day
gift to Sarah back at Oregon, and Ben keep the quarterback
centered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben has made it easier. I can come home and not do anything
except be with him, and that makes things better,'' Graziani said.
``I think it's made me a better quarterback, too. It brings a
little calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani doesn't read defenses as well as Chandler, his arm
isn't as strong, and he tends to flee the pocket quickly.
</P>
<P>
   He's trying all the time, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only played in a handful of games... so I'm learning on
the run,'' he said two days before his fourth start. ``The more I
play, the better I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   An avowed rebel in his college days, when former Oregon coach
and current Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, ``cut me a
few breaks,'' Graziani has mellowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's grown up a lot,'' said Sarah, who met Tony when she was a
junior and he a sophomore. ``He's become a lot more confident, too.
He was confident in college, but the transition to the NFL is huge.
He seems to be a lot more sure of his abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case last year, when Graziani was pulled at
halftime of his only start, Nov. 29 at St. Louis, an eventual 21-10
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were still in that syndrome, you know, `Chris is
hurt; we're never going to win,' and there was this cloud of
depression over everything,'' he said. ``But now, everybody is
acting normal around me. I think they have confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can win with Tony; we have to,'' wide receiver
Terance Mathis said a couple weeks ago. ``He's making better
decisions. He's a better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's strained right hamstring might mean Graziani has to
play a lot more. That and the season-ending knee injury of running
back Jamal Anderson leave Graziani and running back Byron Hanspard
in new roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as high-powered as last year, obviously,'' he said.
``We can't pound 'em 30 times a game with Jamal. We got to run
play-action a little more, roll out of the pocket, change things
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani knows changes may keep coming. The team signed
quarterback Danny Kanell in the offseason, expecting him to be the
backup, before Graziani beat him out.
</P>
<P>
   Does he sense that ``cloud of depression'' coming again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not, but I think we're close,'' he said. ``There's
definitely a sense of urgency. We need to win.... and quickly, or
we're heading for some bad stuff.''

<P>
   NAJAF, Iraq _ In the dusty streets and alleyways of Najaf and
other southern Iraqi cities, inquiries about recent troubles
produce pursed lips and averted eyes, even when the questions are
asked in the most guarded of ways.
</P>
<P>
   This holy city and its shrines were badly scarred when a Shiite
Muslim rebellion swept through southern Iraq at the end of the
Persian Gulf war eight years ago, and even now the Iraqi
authorities are still tarring those they say were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Ali Mosque, the most revered in Shiite Islam, angry
captions on photographs that document the 1991 rebellion condemn
the ``mob gangs'' who ``did not spare even the house of God'' _ a
damning charge in an Islamic land.
</P>
<P>
   In Karbala, another Shiite holy city, nooses dangle from the
ceiling of one mosque. The authorities say the ropes are grotesque
proof that those who challenged the government of Saddam Hussein
had turned the holy place into a lynching ground; Shiite opposition
figures say the hangings were carried out by government loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   With the memories of that violent period still fresh, this year
tensions are again running high in southern Iraq, whose
overwhelmingly Shiite population has long harbored deep resentment
against a central government dominated by minority Sunni Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Though few people here dare to speak openly, and though
competing reports from the government, its opponents and the United
States are impossible to verify, it is clear that the region's
already explosive climate has been charged anew by recent events.
These include the killing of a leading clergyman, an attempt to
kill a top government official, and Shiite rioting and a subsequent
crackdown that may have involved bulldozing scores of homes and
turning tanks on two towns.
</P>
<P>
   Even recent public statements at high levels of the Iraqi
government have hinted that all is not well _ a veiled but rare
admission of the sectarian unrest that challenges Saddam's
stranglehold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Tariq Aziz, the deputy foreign minister, said in late September
that his government had ``not denied'' that ``security attacks''
against the government had been carried out in recent months. But
he said they were the work of ``pro-Iranian agents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And some of them are Iranians,'' he added, ``not just
agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has offered a very different characterization.
In a report in September, the State Department pointed to what it
called a steady increase in the ``scale and severity'' of attacks
by the Sunni-dominated government against Shiite civilians. (The
vast majority of the world's Muslims are Sunnis; Shiites, who broke
away in the early days of Islam, live mainly in Iran, Iraq, Lebanon
and some Persian Gulf countries.)
</P>
<P>
   The civilians, the report said, had nevertheless ``continuously
resisted'' Iraqi attempts at repression _ at least since February,
when the assassination in Najaf of Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadeq
al-Sadr, Iraq's most prominent Shiite clergyman, appears to have
ignited long-simmering tensions.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, say several independent Baghdad-based analysts,
the assassination kindled protests by Shiite civilians, which then
led to clashes between them and security forces. The demonstrations
stretched even to Al-Thawra, an impoverished Shiite-dominated
suburb of the capital, and dozens of people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are fomenting,'' said Hans von Sponek, the U.N. aid
coordinator, who is the top U.N. official in Baghdad. He added,
however, ``We have very little opportunity to see things
firsthand.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been denials of any trouble from most local Iraqi
officials. Since the 1991 uprising, said Sayed Fadhil al-Gorabi,
chief cleric of the Abbas Mosque in Karbala, ``all Iraq has been
one and everyone is standing together.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the point, a banner in the courtyard of the
mosque _ whose structure was badly damaged in the 1991 rebellion _
proclaims simply, ``We pray every Friday for Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   But as early as November 1998, the government confirmed that
there had been an assassination attempt in Karbala against Izzat
Ibrahim, the vice president of the Revolutionary Command Council,
who is in theory the country's No. 2 official.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring, it announced a shake-up in its security lineup in
the region. And throughout the year Iraq has become increasingly
vocal in its claims that any unrest is the work of Iranian
provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are actually dogs from beyond the borders who are given
dollars to influence the people,'' said Sheik Abdel Amir Abd Juwad,
the deputy prayer leader at the Ali Mosque, dismissing as nonsense
any talk of a real Shiite rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   In both the attempt against Ibrahim and the killing of Sadr,
whose two sons were also killed, the government has announced the
arrests of suspects said to be Iranians or their agents.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, that kind of finger-pointing carries almost as much
propagandistic weight as accusing Shiite rebels of defiling a
mosque. Most Iraqis, even in the Shiite south, still revile Iran
and its Shiite Muslim government, a bitter legacy of the bloody and
protracted 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   And because Iran does provide sanctuary for Shiite rebels,
including a group known as the Supreme Council for Islamic
Revolution, the accusation of an Iranian hand in Iraqi unrest rings
true to some.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past, the Iraqi government has often proved less than
candid in casting blame. In 1991 it was not Shiite rebels but Iraqi
government forces who were judged by most experts to have inflicted
most of the damage to holy sites in Najaf and Karbala, despite
government claims since to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   In both cities, evidence suggested that much of the damage was
caused by heavy weapons used by Iraqi forces to drive Shiite rebels
from their hideouts.
</P>
<P>
   After the rebellion was put down, Iraqi forces for a time used
the Ali Mosque as headquarters, parking a squadron of motorcycle
troops in the courtyard, which is not far from the tomb of Ali, the
fourth and most revered of Shiite Islam's 12 imams.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the United States has said, Iraqi forces have
acted with a similar brutality. The State Department said in its
most recent report that the Iraqis bulldozed or gutted about 160
homes in Al-Masha village after a protest early this summer, and
that tank columns attacked Rumaitha and Khudur after similar
protests.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government disputed several charges in that report,
but it was notably silent on those points. Still, Aziz, the deputy
prime minister, mocked what he called feigned U.S. concern over
developments in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the United States and Britain have enforced a
no-flight zone over southern Iraq, ostensibly to protect the Shiite
Muslim population there from Iraqi repression. There is another
such zone in the north to protect the Kurdish minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans have decided to have an obsession with the
Shiites in Iraq,'' Aziz said in a two-hour conversation in Baghdad.
``They have decided to have a love affair. But isn't it a funny
thing that they have not shown the same feeling for the Shiites in
Lebanon or Iran?''
</P>
<P>
   Government regulations prohibit foreign journalists from
traveling unescorted in Iraq beyond the Baghdad city limits, and
official interviews must be arranged by the Ministry of
Information.
</P>
<P>
   Even foreign diplomats and international officials who are based
in Baghdad operate under restrictions that have made it impossible
to confirm specific details of any recent clash. The diplomats and
international officials spoke about the unrest on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, some contended in interviews that the State
Department had greatly exaggerated the case against Iraq and seemed
to rely on claims of Iraqi opposition groups with uneven
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Most clashes, they said, involve hit-and-run attacks by Shiite
guerrillas. But, they added, it was clear that the response from
the government had been harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Those skeptical about the Iraqi claim that Iranian forces were
behind the assassination of Sadr have noted that he was merely the
latest Shiite clergyman to be killed or to die in mysterious
circumstances. Grand Ayatollah Abu al-Qasim al-Khui, Sadr's
predecessor as Iraq's highest-ranking Shiite clergyman, died in
government custody in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Max van der Stoel, the special rapporteur for Iraq of
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, issued a report expressing
fear that the killings might have been carried out by Iraqi
officials as part of a systematic attack on the independent
leadership of Shiite Muslims in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before his death, Sadr was said to have encouraged
Muslims to attend Friday prayers at their local mosques rather than
watch them on television _ a message thought not to be appreciated
by the authorities, who tend to discourage large gatherings.

U.N. TROOPS HAVE SHIFTING ROLE IN ENFORCING PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. strategy for dealing with regional
conflicts has undergone a significant shift, as shown by its new
involvement in Kosovo and East Timor, and a third mission under
consideration in Sierra Leone, U.N. officials and other diplomats
say.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the United Nations deployed its own blue-helmeted
force, drawing on troops contributed by countries like Sweden,
Canada and Fiji that had no geographical interests at stake and
were usually placed in situations where peace had already been
established and merely had to be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, however, the world organization has
been faced with a more dangerous job _ peace enforcement, or
stopping fighting _ and has begun leaving that task to regional
military groups, like NATO in Kosovo, an Australian-led force in
East Timor and a West African force of mostly Nigerian troops in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo, East Timor and Sierra Leone are good examples of how
peace enforcement missions are undertaken by regional forces,'' a
U.S diplomat said. ``It's very much the trend that the U.N. is not
in position to do peace enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo and East Timor, the United Nations, besides creating a
civilian administration and aid operation, provides a political
framework and peacekeeping legitimacy for the troops already there.
It would assume a similar role in Sierra Leone under a British
draft resolution circulating among Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official familiar with peacekeeping said that a robust,
well-equipped military intervention must exist on the ground before
peacekeeping can work. The regional forces fill this role.
</P>
<P>
   The change in strategy dates back to the strained credibility
that the United Nations suffered trying to bring peace to Bosnia.
By 1994, an official said, the United Nations had nearly 80,000
blue-helmeted troops deployed on missions around the world. Once
the peace accord was reached in late 1995, thousands of European
troops there moved under NATO command. By contrast, there are no
plans so far to put the NATO troops in Kosovo under U.N. authority.
</P>
<P>
   Finances also became a consideration in relying on regional
forces. Joseph E. Connor, the under secretary for management, said
in an interview that there are no reserve funds for peacekeeping,
because the United States, which is assessed 31 percent of
peacekeeping costs, owes more than $1.5 billion in unpaid dues and
other arrears. This means that before any new peacekeeping
operation can begin, the funds to pay for it must be raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans look at every new operations through one lens,
the budgeting lens,'' another U.N. official said. ``Can they get
the money through Congress? If not, they'll resist it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some U.N. officials admit being uncomfortable with relying too
much on regional military forces. One official said the United
Nations was conferring its authority on countries with a vested
interest in influencing the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But the costs of failing to intervene can run much higher,
another official said. He referred to the genocide that paralyzed
Rwanda in 1994, when the United Nations could not persuade
countries to contribute troops. ``The world failed to respond to
genocide in Rwanda, so we had a million refugees in Zaire,'' the
official said. He estimated that the costs of caring for the
refugees exceeded $1 billion.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a museum director's fantasy: hundreds of
people waiting on a clear, crisp morning for the doors to open on a
new exhibition. Enough reporters buzzing about to cover a small
war. A line of art patrons that grew longer and longer, even after
the doors opened and the cash registers began to rattle and hum.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the vomit bags passed out by angry Catholics, or the
gruesome posters of severed cow heads brandished by angry animal
lovers, or even the grim-faced man who stood there alone with a
sign that read, ``Hitler Was Right When He Got Rid of `Degenerate
Art.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art began to harvest the benefits of
controversy Saturday as it opened ``Sensation,'' an exhibition of
contemporary British art that has spun New York City into a
political, cultural and religious uproar.
</P>
<P>
   In the museum's recent history, the largest opening-day turnout
was recorded during last winter's Monet exhibition. Gazing in
wonderment at a line that stretched all the way up the museum's
long cobblestone driveway, museum officials said Saturday's crowds
made Monet seem like some second-rate Left Bank artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had lines like this, but then we've never had
metal detectors either,'' said Lynne De Rienzo, an official in the
museum's education division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Giuliani did us a favor,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has mounted an unrelenting
campaign against the museum, accusing its board of recklessly
staging an exhibition of art he views as repulsive and offensive to
religion. He has withheld the museum's monthly city subsidy and has
started eviction proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, some visitors to the museum reacted with skepticism
upon discovering that the three subway stops closest to the museum
were closed to Manhattan-bound riders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances from transportation officials that the
closings had been scheduled in advance to make track repairs, some
wondered whether it was a ploy to make it harder for New Yorkers to
see the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a big lie,'' said Irwin Greenberg, 67, a retired
lawyer from the Upper West Side. ``First of all, it's Saturday.
They're going to start track work at noon? Somebody is faking
somebody out.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it was unclear which side in the dispute was hurt the
most. Some groups that had scheduled protests blamed the subway
closures for a light turnout. They were far outnumbered by those
who came to see the exhibition, and filled only a small portion of
the area penned off by police barricades that had been set up in
front of the museum to contain the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   And with polls showing a solid majority of the public in
disagreement with Giuliani's crusade against the museum, it was
clear that many who showed up for the exhibition did so as much to
demonstrate opposition to Giuliani as to show appreciation for the
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to see the art, but it's more to stand up for the
principle,'' said the first person in line Saturday, Paul D.
Warren, a social worker and amateur artist from the Park Slope
section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who came for the art formed a diverse crowd, from the
young and hip with torn jeans and nose rings to middle-aged men
wearing tweed jackets and ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live right around the corner, and I'm here with my wife and
my granddaughter,'' said Donald Correa, a school custodian. ``We're
just here to see the art. I'm not protesting anything. A museum is
a museum for art. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest groups were equally diverse in their makeup and
viewpoints. A dozen or so protesters from People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals came to single out the artist Damien Hirst,
whose work features dead animals sliced into sections and suspended
in tanks of formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there is no creativity or beauty or imagination in
exploiting animals,'' said Martin Rowe, a spokesman for the group.
``We feel they're taking the animals out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic protest groups took aim at Chris Ofili, a British
artist of Nigerian descent whose painting ``The Holy Virgin Mary''
has stirred so much controversy that it had to be shielded by
Plexiglas in one of the exhibition halls. The painting shows a
black Madonna with a breast fashioned out of elephant dung,
surrounded by small cutouts from pornographic magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Although some art experts say the painting actually venerates
the Virgin Mary, noting that dung is a symbol of growth in the
African culture, many Catholics view it as blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   A busload of women from St. John Vianney, a Catholic church in
the Bronx, held up drawings of the Virgin Mary outside the museum
Saturday. ``Our Lady, the most beautiful Lady,'' they called out,
over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the soldiers of Mary,'' explained Hilda Hernandez, a
social worker and church member.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of another Catholic protest group, speaking over a
loudspeaker, repeated some of the most familiar words in Roman
Catholicism: ``Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee,''
he said. ``Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come to her defense,'' said Elba Griffin of the
Forest Hills section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Catholic protesters framed their opposition in terms
of the First Amendment, which, in addition to guaranteeing free
speech, guarantees freedom of religion. In their view, the city
government, by financing the museum, is indirectly supporting a
painting that attacks Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is the funding,'' said Jane Dempsey of Westchester
County. ``This painting should be shown in a private gallery. If
someone wants to use their money to show this art, well then, be
our guest.''
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters did not represent the only Catholic viewpoint
Saturday. In line for the exhibition, Stella Wilson, a retired
nurse from College Point, Queens, held the hand of her squirming
granddaughter, 5-year-old Nina Lopez. ``I believe as a Catholic,''
Mrs. Wilson said, ``that God said, `Render unto Caesar things that
are Caesar's, and render unto God things that are God's.' And I
believe that this is a secular event.''

IN A NEW HOUSTON, SPACE-AGE ASTRODOME BECAME ANTIQUATED
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating to eliminate photo note) 
(With ASTRODOME-FAREWELL, filed in ``s'' category) 
(rk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ On the night 35 years ago before the Astrodome was
unveiled to the world, Tal Smith walked onto the field and stared
at the lights twinkling beneath the great curved roof of steel and
glass. He stood inside the huge air conditioned bowl, surrounded by
nearly 50,000 empty seats, and beheld the artificial wonder of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Astrodome would later be compared to the
``working end of a gigantic roll-on deodorant.'' Never mind that
baseball purists would later blame the Dome for many of the modern
ills of the game. In an opening night exhibition with the Yankees
on April 9, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson watched Mickey Mantle
hit the first home run, and the nation, like Smith, seemed
astonished at the world's first indoor coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was truly a revolutionary venture,'' said Smith, now the
president of the Houston Astros. ``It wasn't just a new ballpark.
There were people who would line up to tour the building even
without an event. They would marvel at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once promoted as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the Astrodome
is now a relic, as outdated as a polyester leisure suit. On Sunday,
the Astros will play their last regular season game at the
Astrodome before moving next season to a new, state-of-the-art
downtown ballpark. Mammoth enough to contain an 18-story building,
the Dome was a monument to the Texan appetite for big things and an
emblem of a colorful era when men like the stadium's eccentric
creator, Judge Roy Hofheinz, reshaped Houston and Texas through
will and money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Astrodome will stand all but abandoned, a monstrous,
climate-controlled white elephant that has succumbed not only to
the changing economics of sports but to the changing expectations
of what a building must do to hold our attention.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the NASA Space Center, the Astrodome transformed
Houston in the 1960s from a big city backwater; the Dome became the
world's biggest stage. When Bobby Riggs challenged Billie Jean King
to the ``Battle of the Sexes'' in tennis, in 1973, only the sheer
mass of the Astrodome could do justice to the comic magnitude of
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of a sense of loss as we abandon this
thing we were so proud of,'' said Stephen Klineberg, a sociologist
at the University of Houston. ``It was the most exciting thing that
had ever happened to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   The new stadium, the $250 million Enron Field, says as much
about Houston today as the Astrodome did a generation ago.
Fashioned with a retractable roof, it has real grass, and it joins
many new ballparks in evoking baseball's past.
</P>
<P>
   Named for a gas company, Enron Field bespeaks a more generic,
corporate face of Houston, the nation's fourth largest city. If the
Astrodome attracted world attention (and a sniff of scorn), Enron
Field's ambitions seem more prosaic: It will make a lot of money
for the Astros, provide a more intimate setting for baseball and,
city officials hope, spur redevelopment of the east side of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the sports industry,'' Smith conceded, ``the economics
dictate. Buildings become obsolete because they can't generate the
same revenues as in other facilities.'' He added, ``It's
regrettable, but it has been 35 years. It had a great run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome will not be demolished, the fate reserved next
year for one of its imitators, the Kingdome in Seattle. But its
future is muddled at best. The Astrodome has only one big tenant
left, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, which is held each
February. But even the rodeo has hinted that it, too, might leave
if Houston attracts a new professional football team and with it, a
new football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The same Astrodome where Elvis sang and Billy Graham preached
could wind up as a bloated hall for trade shows. ``I don't think
that any Hofheinz ever stood in the way of progress in the name of
nostalgia,'' reflected Fred Hofheinz, a two-term mayor in the 1970s
who was his father's chief aide during the construction of the
Astrodome. But, he added, ``I do want to see it survive.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   With its serrated skyline and knot of interstate highways,
Houston today is a vast sprawl that seems far removed from the city
that Roy Hofheinz dominated in the 1950s and 1960s. A cocksure
impresario who fancied cigars and any other totem of opulence,
Hofheinz was reputed to sleep only when bored: He was a lawyer at
19, a state legislator at 22, the Harris County judge at 24, a
millionaire in business by his 30s, and at 40 he was elected mayor,
serving two terms.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, the judge, as he was always known, took control of
Houston's efforts to attract a major league baseball team. He was
fascinated by the notion of building a cooled, domed shopping mall
and surmised that air conditioning could be the salvation for
baseball in heat-choked Houston as well. It was a toss-up as to
which local endeavor was considered more incredible: NASA's efforts
to put a man on the moon or Hofheinz's plan to build a coliseum
where men would play baseball indoors.
</P>
<P>
   He did it, adopting the futuristic glint of the space program by
renaming the three-year-old Colt 45s the Astros (the other choice
was Stars). Members of the grounds crew wore orange space suits. A
scoreboard flashing electronic lights (and advertising) dominated
the outfield. A buzzing capacity crowd watched the Astros beat the
Yankees 2-1 in extra innings as a 6,600-ton air conditioning system
chilled the arena to 72 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can ever see this,'' the judge had said the day before
the game, ``and go back to Kalamazoo, Chicago, New York, you name
it, and still think this town is bush league, that this town is
Indian territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of the Astrodome, the judge realized, was part of
the sell. He built his own five-story apartment/playhouse above
right field, complete with a two-story presidential suite, a circus
room, a medieval chapel, a barber shop and a bowling alley. He
built smaller suites, the forebears of today's luxury suites, for
rental to corporations or wealthy individuals. On opening night,
Fred Hofheinz fetched bowl after bowl of chocolate ice cream for
Johnson, a Texan, as he admired the presidential suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the quintessential salesman,'' Hofheinz said of his
father. The Astrodome ``was made up like Disneyland in order to
make it something people talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball traditionalists would come to despise the Astrodome and
the artifice it brought to the game. The field itself, initially
made of grass and later sawdust, eventually was replaced by a
carpet patented as Astroturf. To the judge, the turf was one of the
Dome's many wonders; his ground crew jauntily vacuumed it in their
space suits. But artificial turf was derided as a hazard to players
and a blaspheme against the pastoral history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Fox, an architectural historian who teaches at Rice
University and the University of Houston, said the Astrodome was an
``immensely important'' building in the mid-20th century, if mostly
as a triumph of engineering rather than architecture. ``It is one
of the great monuments of American hubris in the 1960s in this kind
of sense of no limits,'' he said, adding graciously, ``It is not a
tremendously refined work of architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox noted that the Dome played an unexpected role in the
evolution of Houston. When construction costs ran over budget, the
judge and city officials called a second bond referendum. With
opposition growing, the judge lobbied the city's growing, if
largely disenfranchised, block of black voters, promising that
blacks could attend all events at the Dome and also could work
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It played a key role in the desegregation of public facilities
in Houston,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the city's population divided fairly equally among
blacks, whites and Latinos, Houston has a black mayor, Lee Brown.
Klineberg, the sociologist, noted that as Houston has matured, the
business and political climate dominated by Roy Hofheinz and a
small number of other white leaders has changed markedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a radically different kind of economy and a new kind
of business leadership and a multicultural environment where
political discussions involve a much wider range of people,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles Savino, an executive with the Greater Houston
Partnership, said that the judge's can-do spirit lived on in local
leaders like Bob McNair, who is trying to lure a new professional
football team and build a new stadium. But, Savino said, Houston is
a different place now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of becoming more like the rest of the country,''
Savino said, which might make an apt epitaph for the Astrodome.
Over the years similar stadiums, some larger, were built in other
cities. The awe and wonder wore off: In 1966, more than 550,000
people paid to tour the Astrodome. By 1998, the number had fallen
to 112,000.
</P>
<P>
   The judge lived in the Dome for five years after his first wife
died, but he suffered a stroke, moved out and eventually sold the
team.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after the Astros and the Dodgers finish the game, a
ceremony is planned to honor the judge's stadium. The Astros might
make the playoffs, meaning at least one more game, but Sunday is
being treated as the farewell. Older players will congregate, and
Willie Nelson will sing ``Turn Out the Lights.'' Fred Hofheinz will
stand on the field he helped build and say goodbye as a living link
to his father. ``He was very proud of that building,'' he said.
``It was the pinnacle of his life.''

REPORT CRITICAL OF TOP GORE AIDE ON SPENDING IN GOVERNMENT ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Portugal)  (bl) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A report soon to be issued by State Department
investigators is critical of management and spending at the 1998
World Exposition in Lisbon, an event whose U.S. participation was
overseen by Tony Coelho, now Vice President Al Gore's presidential
campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The department's Office of Inspector General reviewed the U.S.
Information Agency's planning and management of the exposition,
known as Expo 98, which ran from May 22 through Sept. 30, 1998.
Investigators working for Inspector General Jacquelyn
Williams-Bridgers said they uncovered several problems.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said planning for Expo 98 had started too
late, leading to needlessly high construction and operating costs.
They said the poor planning and execution by the Information Agency
had exposed the U.S. government unnecessarily to possible financial
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also said the U.S. pavilion at Expo 98 had
been poorly managed. For example, the pavilion's restaurant was
shut down before the end of Expo 98, at least partly because of
lawsuits filed by a subcontractor against the primary construction
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The report specifically criticized the commissioner general of
the exposition, a title held by Coelho, a former Democratic
congressman from California who is of Portuguese descent. He did
not return a telephone call on Friday night seeking comment on the
report, but he did rebut some of the criticisms in a letter to U.S.
Information Agency officials last April, after seeing a draft of
the document.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of the criticism was useful and some was based on
misunderstandings that might not have arisen if investigators had
talked to him, ``which they never did.'' Coelho said there was a
surplus of $100,000 when Expo 98 closed, and he suggested that some
of the possible financial liabilities for the United States existed
mainly on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The report was obtained by the Center for Public Integrity,
which made it available to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   While planning for Expo 98 was going on, many members of
Congress were becoming reluctant to finance such international
events.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of Expo 98, with Coelho at the helm, hoped for
significant private contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But when it became clear that private money would be
insufficient, Coelho used his old connections on Capitol Hill and
in the Clinton administration to get taxpayers' money to finance
much of the U.S. participation in Expo 98, the Center for Public
Integrity asserted.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimates that 80 percent of the cost of U.S.
participation in Expo 98 came from government money. The total cost
may exceed $10 million, it says.

EUROPE SEES ITS PARLIAMENT PUSH FOR ROLE OF INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The European Union has been investing
heavily in democracy of late, with the European Parliament now able
to boast two ritzy new glass-and-steel homes, one in Brussels and
the other in Strasbourg, France. Still, many Europeans have
wondered whether they are getting their money's worth. The
buildings may be real enough, but democracy in the super-state has
until now been something of a fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the European Parliament was created in 1957, it has
been the weakest leg of the tripod that governs the union. Real
power has been held by the European Commission, the union's
executive branch, and the European Council, made up of government
leaders. As a result, the construct of Europe has been far less
democratic than any of its current 15 member nations.
</P>
<P>
   But change may at last be in the air. Last March, the Parliament
jolted European capitals and the cozy bureaucracy in Brussels by
forcing the incumbent Commission to resign after reports of
widespread cronyism and mismanagement. In May, a treaty went into
effect that nearly doubled the Parliament's areas of influence.
This fall, given the chance to cross-examine a newly appointed
20-member commission, the Parliament again showed its teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the public eye, the Commission is overpaid, arrogant and
incompetent to do the work for which it has no mandate,'' a
legislator from Britain said during one of the hearings. ``What do
you say to that?''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Kinnock, the former leader of Britain's Labor Party and one
of the candidates for reappointment to the Commission, was in the
dock. Accustomed to the thrust-and-parry of London's Westminster,
he nonetheless lost his customary aplomb, complaining that the
questioner was ``hideously unfair.'' Kinnock was not used to being
challenged by this Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Still, legislators of various political persuasions plan to keep
pressing for more power. ``We want more accountability from the
ministers, more access to internal documents, more say over the
conduct of the European Central Bank,'' said Kathalijne Buitenweg,
a Dutch Green and a member of the budget commission.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, believe too much energy now goes into fighting
for more clout. ``We already have enough power to be taken
seriously,'' said Gunilla Carson, a Swedish conservative. ``We just
have to use it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to its new feistiness, though, the Parliament can take
some credit for the fact that the Commission's new president,
Romano Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, has pledged to shake
up both the Commission and the bureaucracy and has promised more
openness.
</P>
<P>
   There are other shifts as well. After elections for a new
626-member Parliament in June, one in every three legislators is
now a woman, up from one in four. And Green parties, which seem set
on promoting both the environment and irreverence, have 48 members,
their highest number ever.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the assembly has far to go before it resembles
parliaments in any of the member states. Until now, its principal
function has been watchdog over the enormous Brussels-based
bureaucracy. It has no say over security or foreign policy issues
and only a small voice in the agriculture policy that devours
almost half of the union's budget.
</P>
<P>
   It still cannot initiate legislation, but since May it has been
authorized to rework or veto about two-thirds of all proposed laws
and regulations _ effectively increasing its say over consumer
protection, transportation, labor rights, the environment and
health and safety hazards. The retinue of lobbyists following
Parliament's sessions has increased fivefold in the past five
years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But opinion polls show that most Europeans have only vague ideas
about the lawmakers' role, and they are routinely lampooned in
British, German and Dutch media. And almost no one understands why
the entire Parliament decamps once a month from Brussels to hold a
week of sessions in Strasbourg, while its administration is based
in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlike any other legislature on earth. Its members
represent 370 million constituents from 15 countries. Organized
into nine main political groups, ranging from communism to
neo-fascism, some legislators are even there to fight against the
very existence of the union. Members work in 11 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during the recent public examination of Kinnock, the
German politician leading the meeting was slow to respond and
apologized, saying that translating into German took longer than
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the nice differences,'' responded Kinnock. ``When
I was young, I once had a German girlfriend. And I was very happy
then that `ja' was shorter than `yes' and `nein' was longer than
`no.'''

<P>
   BREMERTON, Wash. _ Both fighters are brashly predicting a
knockout, which is nothing new in boxing. But some of the other
pre-bout banter is certainly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if this guy feels at all hesitant to get out in the ring
and hit a girl, well, I'll belt him enough to get him upset and get
him going,'' explained 36-year-old Margaret MacGregor, who will
take on a man, Loi Chow, in a fight in Seattle that is sending
waves of discomfort through the boxing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get in there and start going toe to toe,'' Ms.
MacGregor said, ``Loi Chow is going to realize something. He's
going to have to go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   After the state of Washington declared that its gender-equity
laws give it no authority and indeed no reason to prevent the
match, what is billed by its promoters as the nation's first
officially sanctioned bout between a man and a woman was scheduled
for Oct. 9 at Seattle's Mercer Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The four-round fight between Ms. MacGregor and Chow, both
expected to weigh in at around 125 pounds, is on the undercard to a
longer fight between two men. But it has stolen all the attention,
generating considerable publicity and talk-show fodder here in the
Seattle area and prompting sharp criticism from boxing officials in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is very simple in the state of Nevada,'' said Marc
Ratner, executive director of the state's Athletic Commission,
which regulates fights. ``We feel that men should fight men, and
women should fight women.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Sugar, editor of Fight Game magazine and one of the sport's
most respected historians, was one of several boxing experts who
concurred that indeed, the Seattle bout was the first official
intergender match-up. But, he quickly added, that hardly makes it
momentous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a circus, it's a sideshow,'' said Sugar, echoing what
seems to be the prevailing view among boxing officials. ``It's an
old carnival act, updated for the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. MacGregor says she is angered by the suggestion that she
does not belong in a ring with Chow, of Vancouver, British
Columbia. She is 3-0 fighting other women in the ring and 8-0-1 as
a professional kick boxer, including four victories by knockout,
two in which her female opponents were out on a 10-count and two
more in which the referee stopped the fight. Chow is 0-2 in fights
against men.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody could come up with a really good reason why this
fight shouldn't happen, that would be nice,'' said Ms. MacGregor, a
part-time landscaper in this blue-collar shipbuilding city an
hour's ferry ride from Seattle, who was drawn to study martial arts
in part, she said, because of the ``helpless'' way she felt when
her husband at the time hit her during an argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just vowed, `No man will ever do that to me again unless I
let him,''' said Ms. MacGregor, who has a new boyfriend, Mike
Hopkins, a truck driver with whom she hopes to have children some
day. As for her boxing, ``he's very supportive,'' and will work her
corner of the ring in the upcoming fight, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, most men are stronger than most women, but there
are exceptions,'' added Ms. MacGregor, after a workout at Twin
Tigers Gym here. At 5 feet 5 inches, she enjoys a three-inch height
advantage over Chow, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   War between the sexes is, of course, nothing new, and the United
States crossed some sort of sports rubicon in 1973, when Billie
Jean King, the women's tennis star, defeated an older male player,
Bobby Riggs, in a much-publicized contest.
</P>
<P>
   But an official match inside the ring is clearly breaking new
ground. Even as some state boxing commissions insisted that they
would never allow it, Washington officials said they ignored gender
altogether as a factor in sanctioning fights here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't discriminate against anybody on the basis of
gender,'' said Suzanne Taylor, a spokeswoman for the state's
Department of Licensing. Her agency, which also oversees drivers'
licenses, took over boxing regulation when the state's boxing
commission was disbanded three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at height, weight, prior experience,'' Ms. Taylor
said. ``What we're concerned about is the safety of the fighters,
and we wouldn't approve the fight if it was not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's approval was described as ``absolute madness''
by a former head of the boxing commission, Dale Ashley, in a recent
letter to The Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department of licensing will not stop until they kill
someone,'' Ashley wrote. ``They have program managers with no
boxing experience, who don't know a left hook from a jab.''
</P>
<P>
   Even officials with the International Female Boxers Association,
based in California, have objected to the MacGregor-Chow bout, for
which each fighter will receive $1,500, saying it could detract
from the big strides that all-female boxing has made. The Seattle
fight will occur one night after Muhammad Ali's 21-year-old
daughter, Laila, is scheduled to make her professional debut in a
fight against another woman at the Turning Stone Casino in Verona,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 percent of the fights sanctioned in Nevada each year
feature two women in the ring, said Ratner. Rounds are two minutes
long, rather than three as in men's fights, but otherwise the rules
are pretty much the same, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there are knockouts, women get cut, certainly their
eyes do get swollen,'' Ratner said. ``It's all a part of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The promoter of the Washington fight, Bob Jarvis, said the idea
of the man-woman match-up really arose by accident, when he could
not find a woman for Ms. MacGregor to fight and jokingly brought up
the idea with Ms. MacGregor's trainer, Vern Miller, who also
teaches kung fu and tai chi here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women don't want to fight guys,'' Jarvis said. ``But this
one, she really, really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. MacGregor was originally to fight another Vancouver boxer,
Hector Morales, but he pulled out after becoming uncomfortable with
the idea, promoters said, and Chow stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Jarvis professed dismay at all the attention the
fight is getting, even if it does sell tickets, because it has
detracted from the focus on his fighter, Martin O'Malley, whom he
described as a 10-0 phenom with huge star potential in the
lightweight division. The fighter is scheduled for a 10-round fight
with Tito Tovar of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious,'' Jarvis said. ``No one is even talking about
Martin O'Malley anymore. And he's not real happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chow, a jockey and a weightlifter, has predicted that the fight
will be over in less than a minute, with Ms. MacGregor succumbing
to the first left-right combination he lands. A call to his cell
phone in Vancouver was answered by a friend who said he was too
busy training to do any more interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. MacGregor, who sported a yin and yang earring as she
sparred in the ring Friday with a male friend, Juan Rodriguez,
warned her opponent not to underestimate her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thinks he's getting a cream puff, he's in for a real
jolt,'' she said. ``I'm going to rock his world.''

TRACK WORK ON SUBWAYS NEAR MUSEUM DELAYS SOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-MUSEUM-OPENING and NY-MUSEUM-RELIG) 
(bl) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Could the timing have been worse?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not for thousands of Manhattan residents who boarded
subways Saturday for the Brooklyn Museum of Art, only to learn that
their return trip would be complicated by suspended service at
subway stations close to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that getting to ``Sensation,'' the year's most
passionately debated art show, was easy, at least for those coming
from Manhattan, but that for many, getting home was not.
</P>
<P>
   Signs said the stations were closed to Manhattan-bound traffic.
Transit officials said the suspension was necessary for track work
in three stations on the 2 and 3 lines that had been planned for
months. A spokeswoman for New York City Transit, which operates the
city's subways and buses, said signs announcing the suspension were
posted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency did offer an alternative, free bus shuttle service
from the museum to the Atlantic Avenue Terminal, 12 blocks away, as
a last-minute concession to the large crowds expected to attend the
exhibit. Signs announcing that service were still being put up soon
after noon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The transit spokeswoman, Melissa Farley, insisted that Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's opposition to the exhibition was unrelated to
the maintenance schedule, an assertion that some museumgoers
greeted with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously an effort to torpedo the exhibition,'' said
Irwin Greenberg, 67, a retired lawyer who lives on Manhattan's
Upper West Side and traveled by subway Saturday morning to see the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like starving people when they want to eat,'' said
Chrissy Sereno, 22, of East Meadow on Long Island, who was also
waiting to get into the show.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has no direct control over the transit agency, which
is a subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. While
the authority is influenced most directly by Gov. George Pataki,
who appoints the chairman of its board, it has made political
concessions to Giuliani in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farley said the Brooklyn track work had been planned for
months and was dictated mainly by things like the weather and how
long it takes concrete to dry. ``This is not a fly-by-night
operation, and it has nothing to do with the museum,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Service was suspended for Manhattan-bound trains at the Eastern
Parkway Station, with an entrance directly in front of the museum's
main entrance, and at two of the closest stations for
Manhattan-bound riders, the Grand Army Plaza Station and the Bergen
Street Station.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farley said that track work at the stations began in June,
and that schedules for the most disruptive parts of the project _
including this weekend's closings _ had been determined months
before that. Beginning Friday night and ending before the stations
were to reopen for Manhattan-bound riders early Monday morning, she
said, crews were pouring concrete and laying new track in the three
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really weren't expecting this big thing at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art,'' Ms. Farley said. ``If we don't get this job done
now, it might have to be put off until after the first of the year,
and that could create a safety problem.''

EX-STATE POLICE CHIEF SAYS HIS DISMISSAL WAS REVERSE
DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. _ The man who was fired as superintendent of
the New Jersey State Police after making public comments linking
minority groups to drug crimes said Saturday that his removal was
an example of reverse discrimination and that Gov. Christie Whitman
had planned all along to replace him with a minority-group member.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public remarks since his dismissal, former
Superintendent Carl Williams, 59, said he had been used as a
political scapegoat and unfairly branded a racist simply because he
made comments about racial profiling that ``were the truth'' in a
newspaper interview with The Star-Ledger of Newark in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reputation was blackened,'' he said Saturday in his
lawyer's office here, with his wife, Eloise, beside him. ``I want
my reputation back because I didn't do anything wrong. I am the
victim in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks came one day after his lawyer, Clifford Van Syoc,
filed a civil lawsuit in Superior Court in Camden, asserting that
Williams had been wrongfully dismissed for his comments and
discriminated against for being a white man.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses Whitman and former state Attorney General
Peter Verniero of firing him ``in order to replace him with a black
superintendent'' to further their political goals. Williams'
successor, Carson Dunbar, a former FBI agent, is black. His
appointment was confirmed by the state Senate in September.
</P>
<P>
   Pete McDonough, a spokesman for the governor, said he would not
comment on pending litigation, ``no matter how baseless or
boneheaded it is,'' and that he had not seen the lawsuit. Verniero,
who is now a judge on the state Supreme Court, could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Williams touched off a storm of criticism last February by
telling the Star-Ledger in an interview that certain crimes were
more routinely committed by certain racial and ethic groups.
Williams was quoted as saying: ``Two weeks ago, the president of
the United States went to Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico
about drugs. He didn't go to Ireland. He didn't go to England.
Today, with this drug problem, the drug problem is cocaine or
marijuana. It is most likely a minority group that's involved with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, the same day that his remarks were published,
Whitman dismissed him, saying that the state needed to enhance
public confidence in the police. Williams had been under fire for
weeks over charges that state troopers unfairly singled out black
drivers on state highways, a practice known as racial profiling,
and that he had refused to acknowledge what critics called a long
history of racist procedures by his force.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams called profiling a ``time-honored tool'' of
police work in the interview, he condemned it and said it was
unacceptable. But he also was quoted as saying, ``It would be naive
to think race is not an issue in drug trafficking.'' Minority-group
leaders reacted swiftly and furiously to his printed remarks and
called for his dismissal hours before the governor announced it.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Leroy Jones, D-Essex County, said at the time: ``His
views are dastardly, his thoughts are ill and sickened, and he's
unfit to hold such a critical and important office. He's a racist
of the worst kind, because he doesn't even know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Saturday, however, that his remarks had been
honest, not racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``My remarks in the Newark Star-Ledger were the truth,'' he
said. ``That's the way it is.'' When asked whether he thought they
had been insensitive, he responded: ``I suppose we could play
semantics. What is insensitive?''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says Williams ``was required on occasion to answer
questions from the media, and did so truthfully in accordance with
his nickname, Carl ``The Truth'' Williams. Williams said that state
troopers had given him the nickname years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think back and you're brought up throughout life to
tell the truth, and you always tell the truth, and then you get
your life taken away from you for telling the truth, it's quite a
shock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says, ``There was nothing whatsoever `racially
insensitive' about the statements plaintiff made, which were
truthful and accurate, such that plaintiff was entitled, under the
New Jersey constitution, to make those statements without fear of
adverse consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages, does
not specify an amount. His lawyer, Van Syoc, said that the
Williamses might sue some of the minority-group leaders for
comments they regarded as defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was often praised for his devotion to the state police,
which he joined in 1963. He cruised the highways as a trooper for
years, then, rising through the ranks, worked in the criminal
investigation, organized crime, intelligence, internal affairs and
narcotic units. He was appointed by Whitman early in 1994 to the
$89,963-a-year job of supervising 2,600 troopers and 1,000
civilians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said Saturday that the ``equity'' he had built up over the
years had been destroyed by his dismissal, and that while he had
sent out five resumes seeking other jobs, he had received no
responses. That did not surprise him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being called a racist by some black individuals,'' he
said. ``I'm being called insensitive by the governor and the
attorney general of New Jersey. It gives the impression that
there's something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But most painful, he said, was the damage to his reputation, one
he had built through 35 years of service. ``It, more or less,
submarined my integrity,'' he said in a quavering voice as his wife
wept silently. ``It put an emotional hurt on myself and on my
family, and, most of all, it hurt the state troopers who are out
there protecting the public.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his burden would have been unbearable if not for
the show of support from his family and from the state troopers,
who often dropped by, called, and sent cards and letters. ``I just
think I should be treated fair, and I wasn't treated fair,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Sanctions Unlikely in Atlanta Olympic Probe
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Athens, Greece - The International Olympic Committee official
who directed the committee's bidding scandal investigations said
Saturday that he doubted revelations about the Atlanta campaign
will lead to disciplinary action of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who led the investigation of
the Salt Lake City bidding scandal, also said apparent abuses in
the campaign for the 1996 Games fall short of the violations
committed in the Utah city's bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Six IOC members were expelled and four resigned in the Salt Lake
vote buying scandal. IOC members and their relatives were paid $1.2
million in cash, college scholarships and other inducements.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said his reading of the Atlanta report contained no
suggestion that IOC members accepted such large gifts. ``I don't
believe there is anything in that report that would lead to any
further action,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that there was an awful lot of offers pushed
upon IOC members (by the Atlanta committee) and were not
accepted,'' he said. ``Even the Bell report said these were
excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   A new report prepared by former attorney general Griffin Bell
details the expensive gifts, personal favors and travel offered by
Atlanta lobbyists to IOC members in the two years leading up to
Atlanta's surprise selection in 1990. The report includes accounts
of Atlanta bidders' offering college scholarships, job assistance
and other perks to IOC members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there is anything in that report that would
lead to any further action,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   The report has been handed over to the IOC's ethics commission,
which is expected to make a final determination within the next few
weeks. The Bell report was prepared for Congressional hearings into
the Atlanta bid scheduled for later this month.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a year of enduring the embarrassment and abuse
produced by the Salt Lake City scandal, the IOC is eager to close
this lamentable chapter in the 105-year-old organization's history.
Despite sporadic allegations about the behavior of former bidding
teams and IOC members, the committee has shown little appetite for
following leads beyond Salt Lake City. Additionally, the IOC has
concerned itself only with the conduct of its members and not
bidding committees. Many of the IOC members implicated in the
Atlanta report have already been either removed or disciplined for
their actions in the Salt Lake City affair.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the IOC will hold a special session to enact
sweeping reforms intended to clean up the process for selecting
host cities. Also, the committee is looking forward to the 2000
Sydney Games, which seem to be shaping up to be a success.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of claims by former Atlanta lobbyists that the
campaign for the 1996 Games was free of improper gift giving and
inordinately lavish entertaining, the report suggests that the
Atlanta bidders employed methods that were similar to those used by
the Salt Lake bid. Indeed, Salt Lake City officials have often said
they were only emulating what had worked for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee for Oversight
and Investigations, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan, has invited IOC
President Juan Antonio to testify. Upton, who has been critical of
the Olympic bidding process, has threatened to subpoena Samaranch
if he does not agree to appear voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old president is wrestling with whether he should
appear but is expected to make his decision known as early as
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members are deeply worried about the prospect of being
compelled by U.S. authorities to testify as well as separate
concerns about being questioned by FBI agents investigating the
Salt Lake City scandal. These concerns are leading to an awkward
situation in which IOC members are reluctant to travel to the
United States, the biggest and most powerful member of the Olympic
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're nervous,'' Pound said. ``They don't really understand
this. It's as if they were going to Brazil and worrying that the
Brazilian police might grab them.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC executive board, which is chaired by Samaranch, may drop
plans to go the United States in February to meet with Salt Lake
and U.S. Olympic Committee officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, an IOC spokesman has attributed this to scheduling
conflicts rather than members fears that they may be greeted at the
airport by officials bearing subpoenas.

HOORAY FOR RYDER CUP CELEBRATION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a platform near the 15th green on Saturday during last
weekend's Ryder Cup matches at The Country Club in Brookline,
Mass., a young British voice was heard saying, ``Stay out, Davis,
stay out,'' as he listened to a radio description of Davis Love
III's birdie putt on the 18th green. Suddenly he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stayed out,'' he said happily.
</P>
<P>
   Two middle-aged men nearby were not smiling. One of them turned,
glared at the young Briton and growled: ``So what are you laughing
about? You're in Boston. We'll throw you over the railing.'' They
didn't, but that's what the Ryder Cup is now: a nationalistic event
that stokes emotions that can burst into flame and incinerate some
of golf's genteel traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the traditions of the Ryder Cup golfers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Golf has always wanted to be as popular as baseball, football,
basketball and hockey in America, and now that it is as popular on
the Ryder Cup weekend every two years, golf has to learn to accept
that, for better or worse, it's going to attract the same sometimes
indelicate devotion of those who attend other sports, just as it
turned the U.S. Ryder Cup team into the 1980 Olympic hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   When Justin Leonard's 45-foot birdie putt disappeared into the
hole on the 17th green last Sunday for what the American Ryder
Cuppers considered the clinching one-half point in a comeback
14{-13{ victory, several golfers (as well as wives and officials)
celebrated with Leonard on the side of the green.
</P>
<P>
   In golf, you're not supposed to do that when another golfer
still has to putt, as Jose Maria Olazabal did. After composing
himself, the two-time Masters champion missed his 20-footer for a
halve and the Americans had clinched.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ryder Cup is not golf so much now as it's a crusade to
prove whether American or European golfers are better; the
Europeans had held the cup after five of the previous seven
matches. So when Leonard's putt fell, the American Ryder Cup
contingent celebrated. It was not proper golf etiquette, but it was
understandable. It was simply human spontaneous combustion.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans use the words ``sad'' and ``ugly'' to describe the
celebration, but can the Europeans honestly say they would not do
the same thing in the same situation: one of their golfers holing
an improbable 45-foot putt for the likely winning half-point at The
Belfry near London, where the 2001 matches will be played, or at
Valderrama in Spain, the site of the 1997 matches?
</P>
<P>
   ``Valderrama wasn't exactly a cakewalk for us over there,'' Tom
Lehman said. ``Their fans were pretty interesting, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As Tom said, memories are short,'' Love said. ``There's been a
lot of celebrating on a lot of holes in a lot of Ryder Cups.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro golfers are not accustomed to being part of a team. When a
golfer wins the U.S. Open or the Masters, he's the only one who
celebrates. But in the Ryder Cup, the golfers are no longer
individuals; they're a team. And when the American team won, they
celebrated just as the 1980 Olympic hockey team did. And because it
was the U.S. team, most of the spectators in Brookline were rooting
for the Americans as devotedly as they do for the Red Sox or the
Celtics or the Patriots or the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, too, that the Americans were about to win it all,
which is more than the Red Sox have done since 1918, more than the
Patriots have ever done.
</P>
<P>
   That does not excuse the improper Bostonian who, according to
the wife of Mark James, the European captain, spat at her. But it
does explain the rude remarks that hecklers directed at Europe's
best golfer, Colin Montgomerie, throughout the three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the Americans root for the Americans,'' said
Jesper Parnevik, the Swede who lives in Florida but was on the
European team. ``But it should never get personal. Not in golf.''
</P>
<P>
   As if it never had until last weekend, as if there was never a
discouraging word anywhere else for any other golfer. As if the
word ``choker'' has never been heard in a gallery. As if nobody
yelled ``Fat Jack'' or ``Ohio Fats'' at Jack Nicklaus in the years
when he was dethroning Arnold Palmer. As if nobody at Valderrama
tossed racial epithets at Tiger Woods two years ago. But the Golden
Bear just ignored the taunts. So did Tiger. They let their clubs
answer.
</P>
<P>
   That's usually what Montgomerie does too, or at least has tried
to do, not only last weekend but whenever he has played the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it now as a motivating factor,'' said Montgomerie, the
world's No. 3-ranked golfer behind Woods and David Duval. ``I treat
it as a compliment because I must be good at this game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Montgomerie's body language sometimes betrays his annoyance,
provoking his hecklers even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, too, was disgusted with some of the actions and some of the
name-calling and the heckling that goes on with Colin,'' said Payne
Stewart, who played him in Sunday's singles. ``That's not what this
event is about. I appreciate the gallery we had here, but it's a
golf event. I don't know how many of these fans have been to golf
events before.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely the point. Now that the Ryder Cup is so much more than
a golf event and now that Tiger Woods has spread the gospel of golf
to so many others, all golf events will be attracting more and more
spectators unaccustomed to what is considered, perhaps too
reverently, to be golf etiquette. Let the gallery yell more. Not in
a golfer's backswing or when someone is about to putt. That's
unfair. But in general let the gallery yell more and, yes, even let
the gallery heckle.
</P>
<P>
   Golf and golfers need to adjust to it, and golf and golfers will
be better for it.

ASTRODOME IS BOWING OUT AFTER A STORIED 35 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
   (With HOUSTON-ASTRODOME) 
 (Eds: Sam Blair was a writer and columnist for The Dallas Morning
News for 41 years.) 
 (rk) 
 By SAM BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mickey Mantle set the mood for everything to come in
the Astrodome in the first baseball game played there, an
exhibition on April 9, 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees superstar smashed the first home run far beyond the
center-field fence, then described the strange sensation of playing
in sport's first major indoor stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it reminds me of is being in a flying saucer off
somewhere,'' Mantle said.
</P>
<P>
   But time also flies. Now the Astros are closing out their 35th
and final season in this storied stadium, battling to make the
playoffs before record crowds filled with stretch-run anxiety and
Astrodome nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   The regular season ends Sunday afternoon against the Los Angeles
Dodgers, but two all-time Astros hope that their team will still be
lighting up the Astrodome in late October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to win the World Series here, then dig up home plate
and take it with me,'' manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, 53, would be entitled. Signed as a rangy 17-year-old
pitcher by the old Houston Colt 45s in 1964, Dierker has spent much
of his life in the Astrodome as athlete, broadcaster and manager.
And when he collapsed in the Astros' dugout with a grand mal
seizure in the eighth inning against San Diego on June 13, it was
feared he also might die there.
</P>
<P>
   But Dierker underwent a 5 1/2 hour brain operation and returned
to the same dugout July 16 after missing 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   If this Astros season ends as happily as Dierker hopes, his
first-base coach, Jose Cruz, would gladly help him carry home plate
out to his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some thrilling memories, but after all these years we
never have played in the World Series,'' said Cruz, 52, whose
heroics as an outfielder earned his No. 25 a place high in the
Astrodome along with the numbers of pitchers Jim Umbricht (32), Don
Wilson (40), Mike Scott (33) and Nolan Ryan (34). ``It's time we
bring a championship here.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a grand way for the prime tenants to say goodbye
to their old showcase. But whatever happens, the Astros will head
downtown in April 2000 to a new ballpark that will offer a lot that
the Astrodome does not: a much cozier stadium designed purely for
baseball, with games played on natural grass outdoors. Or indoors,
when Houston's notorious heat and humidity or an occasional
cloudburst dictates use of a retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to change downtown Houston like nothing has in the
last 50 years,'' said Drayton McLane, the Astros' owner since '93.
``On summer nights the roof will be closed when the game starts,
but by 9 p.m. the roof will roll back and the fans will have the
stars and downtown Houston around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Hofheinz, the first Astros owner and the godfather of the
Astrodome, called his pleasure palace ``the Eighth Wonder of the
World,'' but its glass-paneled roof hasn't moved in all these
years. The Astrodome, named in tribute to the fledgling space
program at neighboring NASA, has been host to football, basketball,
track, championship fights, rodeos, revivals and such memorable
events as the Billie Jean King-Bobby Riggs ``Battle of the Sexes''
tennis match.
</P>
<P>
   King won on Sept. 20, 1973. Houston resident George Bush won the
Republican presidential nomination there on Aug. 20, 1992. And Feb.
4-6, 1966, one of the most bizarre events in Astrodome history _
bloodless bullfights _ drew 107,257. The popular logic at the time
was that the bulls had no-cut contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Over these last 35 years, the Astrodome has left its imprint on
the world, helping change Houston from a sprawling oil boomtown to
a city renowned for high-tech industry and heart transplants. Its
marquee names have ranged from Billy Graham to Evel Knievel, from
Elvin Hayes to Elvis Presley, and, getting back to Astros managers,
from Leo Durocher to Larry Dierker. But now the 54,370-seat
Astrodome is too big, too drab and simply wrong for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   So it's farewell to the Big Bubble on the Bayou, built by Harris
County for $31.6 million, and on to $250 million Enron Field with
42,000 seats and 162 lucrative luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to play there,'' said Jeff Bagwell, the All-Star
first baseman and a veteran of nine Astro seasons. ``I was born in
Boston and I still like those old, traditional ballparks where the
players are close to the crowd, like Fenway Park and Wrigley Field.
Our new park will be like that and that closeness will help us and
our fans. They're just too far away from us in the Astrodome.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane, a folksy, good ol' Texas boy, put it another way: ``The
Astrodome doesn't have any personality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' president, Tal Smith, remembers when it was livelier
_ and louder. ``The Astrodome lost its personality when the county
pulled out the exploding scoreboard and put in 10,000 upholstered
seats to accommodate Bud Adams,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, the Houston Oilers' owner, had threatened to move his
National Football League team to Jacksonville, Fla., if the dome's
football capacity wasn't greatly expanded. So, down came the
celebrated 474-foot scoreboard, which saluted home team home runs,
touchdowns and victories with an animated display combining Fourth
of July fireworks and the thunderous roar of a Wild West show.
</P>
<P>
   Up went 10,000 seats in 1989 in that strange gaping space
stretching from above the center-field wall around to right field.
And then Adams ultimately did move his club _ to Tennessee three
seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were more fans,'' Smith said of those who stayed for
baseball, ``but their reaction to things was just polite applause
instead of the raucous cheering that was typical of Astrodome
crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Harris County owns the Astrodome, but the Astros' owner always
has operated the stadium for all events under a long-term lease
agreement. Hofheinz frequently seemed to function like an emperor,
however. A former Houston mayor and Harris County judge, Hofheinz
liked to operate in a grand style. For a while he made any visit to
the Astrodome rare and exciting entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A latter-day P.T. Barnum,'' Tal Smith said of his old boss.
But Hofheinz enjoyed being the Big Cigar. And this sometimes caused
conflicts, disputes and bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Astrodome opened in '65, Hofheinz and oil
billionaire R.E. ``Bob'' Smith, his longtime friend and business
partner, parted company. Smith wanted to concentrate first on
building a strong baseball franchise and consider peripheral
projects later. Hofheinz wanted to move quickly to build Astrohall
and Astroarena adjacent to the dome, plus the Astroworld amusement
park and a group of hotels across the road.
</P>
<P>
   Hofheinz hustled hard to buy Bob Smith out and helped to raise
the needed $9 million by selling his home and moving into a large,
luxurious suite in the Astrodome. But as years passed, the Astros
struggled competitively and Hofheinz struggled financially. In May
1970, he was felled by a stroke. By 1979, the Ford Motor Credit
Corp. controlled the club and the Astrodome and was delighted to
sell everything to John McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen didn't know baseball and often ran the club by long
distance, but he made Nolan Ryan of nearby Alvin the sport's first
$1 million player as a free agent. The Astros came frustratingly
close to bringing the World Series here in 1980, losing the final
game of the National League Championship Series to the Phillies in
10 innings; and in 1986, losing Game 6 to the Mets in 16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But today McMullen is remembered mainly for firing Tal Smith in
1980 after Smith was voted baseball executive of the year and for
running off Ryan in 1989 after trying to cut his salary 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Ryan to join those upstate upstarts, the American
League Texas Rangers. Ryan's arrival led the Rangers to unexpected
riches and respectability and eventually into a new
state-of-the-art stadium.
</P>
<P>
   McLane, who brought Tal Smith back as club president in 1994,
will sell the remaining 23 years of his Astrodome lease back to
Harris County in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Astrodome can't be the type of stadium we need for the
21st century,'' he said.

ONE-RING RAP SOUNDS HOLLOW TO THE BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is one thing the Atlanta Braves don't want to hear as
they head into the playoffs once more, it is that they have to win
the World Series to validate their status as the team of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves clearly have been the best team in this decade,
winning eight consecutive division championships and compiling a
record of 859 victories and 531 losses beginning in 1991 and
running through Friday night. No other team in any decade or parts
of two decades has made eight post-season appearances in a row
(none has made more than five straight), and the Yankees are a
distant second in won-lost record, 75{ games behind at 783-606.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves have won only one World Series in the '90s. The
Yankees have won two, the Toronto Blue Jays two, each in only two
tries. One is not enough, the Braves' critics say, for a team that
has finished first in seven previous seasons. It is not even
enough, they argue, that the Braves have played in only four World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd all love to win another one simply because that's
why you play,'' said Tom Glavine, a member of every one of the
team's division champions and a 20-game winner for four of them.
``If you went around and asked everybody, yeah, we're disappointed
we've only won one. Beyond that, I don't think we think a whole lot
about it. I don't think we worry about whether we're the team of
the '90s or having to win this year to validate anything we have or
haven't done. I think we're extremely proud of what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine's partner in pitching victories and Cy Young awards,
Greg Maddux, said he did not care if the Braves were viewed as the
team of the '90s. ``What I care about is the accomplishments that
this team has had and will have,'' he said. ``We've had another
great year this year, and we're going to try to add a little more
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not having won more World Series does not detract from what the
Braves have done, added Maddux, who has played for six of the
winners. ``Who'd have thought it?'' he said. ``I thought I'd be
dealing blackjack in Las Vegas.'' Obviously, you can take a
resident out of Las Vegas, but you can't take Las Vegas out of the
resident.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth title team for Chipper Jones, the Braves'
strong candidate for the National League's most valuable player
award, an honor the Braves haven't had since Terry Pendleton, also
a third baseman, gained it in 1991, the year the championship run
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens at the end of the '90s,'' Jones said,
``we're still going to hold our heads high and know for 10 years we
played better baseball than anyone else. We won more games than
anyone else. It just happened that a couple teams beat us around
October time to deny us these championships. We're not going to
slit our wrists because people say we have only one. Everybody
knows at the very least that if you want to be the National League
representative in the World Series, eventually you're going to have
to come through us.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz acknowledged that he once let the negative view of
the Braves' success creep into his thinking. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take has totally changed,'' the pitcher said. ``We have
been sucked in to thinking that for the longest time that I finally
refuse to think that way. I really don't care what happens. I don't
care what people think. All I know is I've had a blast the last
eight years. People would trade anything to be in my position. Take
a poll; see how many guys would want what I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, Smoltz said, want to win the World Series this year
because they want to win every year. That, after all, is the
ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be absolutely easy to be the Florida Marlins, to win
one year and not show up again,'' he added. ``Look at peoples'
perception. Don't disappoint me. If you're going to go, win. If you
win, it's tremendous and if you never show up again, we had our one
year. But if you go nine straight years and win only one, there's
something wrong there. You see how warped that view is?''
</P>
<P>
   Any team that has been in the playoffs in recent years talks
about how difficult a task it faces in even getting through the
first two series to the World Series, let alone winning the World
Series. The three-of-five-game division series especially poses
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to sit back and second-guess and criticize when
you've never been in that situation,'' Smoltz said. ``When we're
done and it's over, I guarantee you every view will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who like Glavine has played for every one of the winning
'90s teams, said he even preferred his experience to that of some
players who had enjoyed more frequent World Series success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to be the guy who jumps around from team to
team late, gets into the playoffs and gets lucky enough to win
three or four rings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves this season have added another distinction to their
record. They have become only the fourth team in history to win 100
games or more three successive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' Smoltz said. ``People aren't going to
hang a star over us because we've done it. All it is is another
accomplishment that people don't care about unless you ultimately
finish it off.''

PEPSICO GAVE TO SPONSOR OF PATAKI TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pepsico, which regularly lobbies in Albany on tax and
other issues, says it donated $5,000 to a nonprofit trade group in
1995 just before the group paid for a trip to Hungary by Gov.
George Pataki, his family members and aides.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico is the third major New York-based corporation with
business before the state to detail its ties to the nonprofit
group, the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce USA, which
sponsored Pataki's visits in 1995 and 1996 to Hungary, the homeland
of his paternal grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brown, a spokesman for Pepsico, said Friday that the
company contributed the $5,000 just before the September 1995 trip,
adding that he did not know who had solicited it. Asked whether the
company gave specifically to finance the visit, Brown said, ``I
would guess that it had something to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on information from the governor's staff, the state Ethics
Commission ruled before the trips took place that they were legal
because the chamber did not have business before the state. Under
state law, the governor and members of his administration are
barred from accepting gifts of $75 or more from companies with
business before the state, even through third parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethics Commission has said it did not know about the
donations to the chamber made around the time of the trips. It is
now considering whether to open an inquiry into the trips to
determine whether the donations violated the gift rules.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the governor have said he and his aides were not
aware of any donations to the chamber and played no role in its
fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber was established in 1992. Brown said Pepsico, which
has operations in Eastern Europe, had donated to the chamber before
1995, but never more than $1,000 annually. Since 1995, the company
has not contributed in some years and has given $1,000 or less in
others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pepsico executive, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the company's decision to increase its donation in
1995 was directly related to the governor's trip. The executive
said that shortly before the trip, it appeared that the chamber was
having money problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like they could barely afford the cost of the
trip,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported last week that Philip Morris, the
cigarette giant, had sent $10,000 to the chamber a week before the
first trip, $10,000 a few weeks before the second trip and another
$10,000 a year later. Philip Morris had not donated to the group
before 1995. It has said its donations were not linked to the
trips. The chamber has also cited Bristol-Myers Squibb, the
pharmaceuticals conglomerate, as a big contributor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the chamber's tax records, which summarize its
finances without giving details, the donations from Philip Morris
and Pepsico shortly before the 1995 trip made up nearly 40 percent
of the chamber's total revenues for its fiscal year. It is unclear
how much Bristol-Myers Squibb donated, and when.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Philip Morris and Bristol-Myers, both headquartered in New York
City, also sent senior lobbyists to Hungary to take part in some of
the events on one of the trips. Brown said Pepsico arranged for the
governor to tour a company bottling plant in Hungary on the 1995
visit; it did not have a lobbyist accompany him.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies have significant interests before the state
government and were among the few to donate $25,000, the maximum,
to the private corporation that Pataki established to pay for his
first inauguration in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's trips to Hungary were a mix of family vacation
and trade mission. On the 1995 trip, he was accompanied by three
relatives, four aides and two security officers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Pepsico donation, Charles Deister, a spokesman
for Pataki, read a statement that said: ``Pepsico is a New
York-based company that employs 3,490 New Yorkers. It's in the
governor's interests to promote New York companies worldwide. We
were proud to tour Pepsico's Hungarian plant, and would gladly do
so again.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the governor have said he and his aides did not
ask the chamber about its backers and were not required to do so
under state ethics rules. The governor has declined to release
information about how much the chamber paid for the trips. He has
said he will not ask the chamber to make details of its finances
public.
</P>
<P>
   Monika Szarka-Elling, the chamber's president, did not respond
to two phone messages left at her office on Friday. She said last
month that she would not discuss the trips or the chamber's
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico, which is headquartered in Purchase, N.Y., has
maintained warm relations with Pataki since he was a state
legislator representing Westchester County. A few months before the
1995 donation, Pataki and the Legislature approved a cut in soda
and beer taxes in response to a lengthy lobbying campaign by the
company and others in the beverage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Pepsico spokesman, played down the $5,000 donation.
``If a Hungarian official were to use the Hungarian-American
Chamber of Commerce for a trip to the United States,'' Brown said,
``then we would very readily might have contributed and would most
certainly have looked to providing a tour of a factory here.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of the rules on gifts to administration officials, he said,
``There is absolutely no nexus between our participation in the
Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce and any issue which may have
impacted our business in Albany.'' He called back later to say that
with respect to the $5,000 donation, ``it is our understanding that
those funds went to the general operating budget of that
organization and there was no specific earmark on any of that money
having to do with any specific project.''

A MARTINEZ DOUBLE; HISTORY REPEATS; COLOR THEM BROWN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his league-leading 23-4 record, 2.08 ERA, 312 strikeouts
and .206 opponents' batting average, Pedro Martinez of Boston will
be the unanimous winner of the American League Cy Young award. But
will he be voted most valuable player as well by the 28-member
panel of the Baseball Writers Association?
</P>
<P>
   He will have competition from a gang of position players: Nomar
Garciaparra, his teammate; Ivan Rodriguez and Rafael Palmeiro of
Texas; Roberto Alomar and Manny Ramirez of Cleveland; Derek Jeter
of the Yankees. Before anyone proclaims Martinez the favorite
because of his spectacular pitching performance and what it has
meant for the wild-card Red Sox, a history lesson is in order.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Ron Guidry of the Yankees had a 25-3 record, a 1.74
ERA, nine shutouts and a .193 opponents' batting average. He led
the league with all of those numbers. His 248 strikeouts were
second to Nolan Ryan's 260. Guidry's ERA was 46 percent of the
leaguewide 3.76. Martinez's ERA is 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Martinez's pitching has been instrumental in the Red Sox
advance to the post-season, Guidry was greatly responsible for the
Yankees' division championship that season. But Guidry was not
named the AL MVP. Jim Rice of Boston was. Rice received 352 points
in the balloting, Guidry 291; Rice was named first on 20 ballots,
Guidry eight.
</P>
<P>
   Rice played for the team that the Yankees overtook and beat in a
playoff for the AL East title. He led the league with 46 home runs,
139 runs batted in, a .600 slugging percentage, 406 total bases,
213 hits and 15 triples. He was second in runs scored with 121 and
third in batting average with .315.
</P>
<P>
   Of this season's AL hitters who are among the leading
candidates, Ramirez most closely resembles Rice among the league
leaders, though he leads only in runs batted in and slugging
percentage. He also ranks high in home runs, batting average, total
bases, runs scored and on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   History Repeats
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine is apparently consistent, if nothing else. When
the Mets' manager used five pinch-hitters in an inning in a recent
game against Atlanta, the second of the Mets' disastrous seven-game
losing streak, he was merely repeating a pinch-hit strategy he
employed in a game against Montreal last September. That game, too,
was the second of a Mets collapse. Last year the date was Sept. 23,
this year Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning last year, the Mets were losing, 2-0, and
had runners at first and second with no one out. Jay Payton batted
for Lenny Harris and walked, loading the bases. Butch Huskey was
announced as batting for Carlos Baerga, but when reliever Mike
Maddux replaced Tim Young, Matt Franco batted for Huskey and popped
out. Todd Hundley then batted for Rey Ordonez and struck out. Luis
Lopez did the same when he hit for Bobby Jones. The Mets didn't
score, and they lost, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Braves this month, it was the eighth inning and the
Braves were leading, 3-2. Again the Mets had runners at first and
second with no one out. Melvin Mora batted for Benny Agbayani and
sacrificed the runners to third and second. Shawon Dunston was
announced as batting for Darryl Hamilton, but Russ Springer
relieved Mike Remlinger so Franco was sent up to hit for Dunston
and was walked intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Payton got into this inning, too, but as a runner for Franco.
Then Bonilla batted for Ordonez and struck out, and Todd Pratt hit
for Orel Hershiser and knocked an inning-ending grounder to second
base. The Mets again didn't score, and again they lost, this time
5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bizarre, no doubt about that,'' Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   Color them Brown
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hot it might get in Pittsburgh during the baseball
season, the Pirates won't have to worry about a brownout if they
maintain their current roster. For one game last week, in fact, the
Pirates had a Brown in, or more precisely three Browns in. Gene
Lamont's batting order had Browns in the first three spots _
Adrian, the center fielder; Emil, the left fielder; and Brant, the
first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   That game was not against Los Angeles, so Kevin Brown did not
pitch against the Brown trio.

IN   FLORIDA, A NEW CAMPAIGN BUT THE SAME REFRAIN;   REPUBLICAN
WOES IN CALIFORNIA;   AN IDAHO WEDDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Fla., Calif., Idaho) (js) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., announced last March that he
would not seek re-election, it seemed for a while that just about
every politician in the state would jump into the contest to
replace him. But the race began to take some shape as the political
dance by candidates and would-be candidates subsided, and by
midsummer Bill Nelson, the insurance commissioner, had emerged as
the leading Democrat and Rep. Bill McCollum Springs as the leading
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   There was a possibility that McCollum might have to fend off a
primary challenge by Tom Gallagher, the education commissioner. But
by fall the general expectation was that the election to replace
Mack would be a knock-down, drag-out Nelson vs. McCollum fight,
with both national parties dumping gobs of money into the battle as
part of a larger war to control the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Logan, a man with a long memory, foresees a knock-down,
drag-out Nelson vs. McCollum vs. Logan battle. Logan is a black
state representative who is also a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his 16th in the House, his Democratic colleagues made
racial history in Florida by electing him minority leader, only to
make more history shortly thereafter by ousting him on the grounds
that he was not spending enough time raising money for the party.
He vowed to get even.
</P>
<P>
   And he did, in a way.
</P>
<P>
   During last fall's governor's race, he sided with the Republican
candidate, Jeb Bush, and urged the state's many black voters, most
of them Democrats, to do likewise or, at the least to stay away
from the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won, though it is difficult to quantify just how much Logan
contributed to the victory.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Logan have in mind for Election 2000?
</P>
<P>
   When he jumped into the Senate race, last week, he jumped in as
an independent, not as a Republican. Political parties have become
``irrelevant to the average voter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What he did not say was that no matter which party label he
wears, he has little chance of succeeding Mack. But as a black
independent, he stands to pull more votes from the Democratic
candidate than the Republican, meaning that in a close race, which
this one bids to be, he could end up handing the Republican the
winning edge.
</P>
<P>
   Same song as in the 1998 governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Different words.
</P>
<P>
   California: Republican Tremors
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party of California, once the mightiest in the
land, has been in a free fall since the last election, which saw
Democrats capture not only the governor's office and just about
every other top state job but also control of both houses of the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State Republicans remain in a black mood, demoralized, in
debt and divided by issues like abortion and gun control. A
gathering of top party members in Anaheim last weekend was by all
reports almost as much a civil war as a convention.
</P>
<P>
   And here's some more bad news, straight from the heart:
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, that sprawling, sun-splashed suburb south of
Los Angeles that once was considered the most Republican of all
Republican strongholds in the country (Anaheim is there),
Republican registration has fallen below 50 percent for the first
time in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Orange County Registrar of Voters, it slipped
to 49.98 percent just before the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican percentage has been going down in the county for
some time, as more and more Hispanic voters, who tend to lean
Democratic, have moved in and as more and more voters in general
have begun to register as independents, in Orange County as in the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year twice as many Democrats as Republicans have
registered in the county, and Democratic registration now stands at
32 percent. The county now has a Democratic congresswoman and a
number of Democratic state legislators, and the mayor of Anaheim is
a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   As for the independent vote, it has almost doubled over the past
decade, to around 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even at just under 50 percent, Republicans still hold a
reasonably comfortable registration edge over Orange Democrats. But
big trouble looms in elections in which the independent vote swings
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a wake-up call,'' John McGraw, the chairman of the
California Republican Party, said of the new registration figures.
``Orange County is very important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   How important?
</P>
<P>
   A decade and more ago, the Republican vote in the county was
almost twice as big as the Democratic vote, so heavy that
Republican candidates running for statewide office depended upon it
to help give them the edge needed to overcome Democratic domination
elsewhere. But in the 1998 governor's race, the Democratic
candidate, Gray Davis, carried the county, thanks to the growing
Democratic vote and to an independent vote that swung Democratic,
and that victory in turn helped him carry the entire state and
become the first Democratic governor in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho: A Wedding on a Political Scale
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Helen Chenoweth of Idaho doesn't do things in a small way.
</P>
<P>
   She is about as conservative as Republicans come in Congress.
And as outspoken as any legislator on Capitol Hill, Republican or
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it should come as no great surprise that she invited
11,000 people to her marriage Saturday in Meridian, Idaho, to Wayne
Hage, a rancher.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, love.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it should come as a surprise since only 1,200 people
could fit into the church.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, politics.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation list, it turns out, contained the names of not
only friends of the bride and groom but also the names of any and
all who have contributed time, money and effort to the Chenoweth
cause over the past five years, including the Chenoweth PAC,
Helen's List.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chenoweth _ make that Ms. Chenoweth-Hage, she now asks _
will be leaving the House next year, because she took a term-limits
pledge to serve no more than three two-year terms. But she hasn't
taken any pledge not to run for the Senate in 2002, given all the
talk in Idaho that the incumbent who will then be up, Larry Craig,
a fellow Republican, is pondering whether to retire.
</P>
<P>
   About the Chenoweth-Hage wedding cake ...
</P>
<P>
   It was a four-layer job, made of cream cheese, buttermilk
batter, pecans and coconut by Richard Langston.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the Richard Langston whom The Idaho Statesman
calls ``cakemaker to the stars,'' the Richard Langston who when
J.R. Simplot, the potato king, turned 90 came forth with one cake
shaped like a sack of fertilizer and another that looked like a
spud.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Idaho.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 1980s, her imperious attitude, outspokenness
and stable of talented artists carried her to the top of the
ultra-competitive and ultra-lucrative world of New York art
dealing. But in a matter of hours Wednesday night, Mary Boone says,
she was reduced to a meek, frightened prisoner who spoke only when
spoken to, feared beatings by prostitutes and drug addicts, and
dutifully asked for permission to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   In an extensive interview Saturday that followed her arrest
Wednesday on charges of distributing live ammunition and displaying
two working guns at an art show in her Fifth Avenue gallery, Ms.
Boone described her 26 hours among what she said were sneering
detectives, belligerent prisoners and urine-soaked jail cells.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone said detectives grabbed her by the hair and threw her
against a wall when she was arrested, crudely insulted her and
handcuffed her to a chair for six hours in the station house of the
Midtown North Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   She said she spent the night in a rancid precinct jail cell with
a broken toilet and a narrow bench, and the entire next day in a
group holding cell with ``prostitutes, drug addicts and alcoholics
getting the DTs'' in the infamous Manhattan Detention Complex,
which she now knows is nicknamed ``The Tombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone said she was held for 26 hours _ two hours more than
the 24-hour deadline imposed by law for arraigning accused
criminals before a judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock, terrified, terrified,'' Ms. Boone said. ``It's
a police state. It's the closest I can imagine to being in a
concentration camp. The whole idea is that you're guilty because
they say you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone, long known for her flamboyance and her voluble
nature, said her arrest had been orchestrated by the Giuliani
administration to bolster its position in its battle with the
Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more than a coincidence that I was arrested 24
hours before the `Sensation' show was to open,'' she said,
referring to the art show at the center of the Brooklyn
controversy. ``It's clear that they're trying to make a statement.
It's a Giuliani witch hunt. They're trying to protect New York from
its art.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, Giuliani's chief spokeswoman, referred the matter
to the Police Department. Sgt. Rafael Andalia, a department
spokesman, said officials had no comment on Ms. Boone's
allegations. Police officials said last week that it was standard
policy to take anyone accused of possessing an illegal weapon into
custody.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Police officials repeatedly delayed the arraignment and release
of the art dealer on Thursday because they said they were having
difficulty taking Ms. Boone's fingerprints. She said the police
took her prints dozens of times. In the end, prosecutors released
the art dealer without a fingerprint check, a procedure intended to
catch repeat criminals using aliases.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone, who was charged with possessing an exposed rifle and
possessing and disposing of ammunition, faces up to a year in jail
and $2,000 in fines if convicted. She said she would fight the
charges. Her arrest, she said, is an attack on artists' First
Amendment right to express themselves. Ms. Boone added that she had
not known that the bullets offered as souvenirs from the show by
the sculptor, Tom Sachs, were real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an art dealer, not an arms dealer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone dismissed as ``lies'' statements from the Police
Department's chief spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, that she kept
detectives waiting for 45 minutes in the gallery and pushed them
when they tried to arrest her.
</P>
<P>
   She also dismissed the notion that the bullets and guns were a
safety hazard. ``In 1982 I showed a Basquiat painting with a
baseball bat in it. Someone could've taken it off the painting and
gone and bludgeoned someone,'' she said. ``There are all kinds of
ramifications from this kind of thinking.''

NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN PIPPEN AND BARKLEY 
SPREWELL IN COURT 
RETURN OF THE DUNK CONTEST 
OUT OF RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Barkley once called a future Hall of Fame player a
``big, old crybaby,'' a comment that stung his teammate and seemed
to ensure that the two would never play together again. But two
years later, Barkley and that teammate, Hakeem Olajuwon, were
coexisting on the same frontline, trying to summon their strength
for one more playoff run with the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen never had that kind of tolerance or patience for
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's words helped force his trade to the Portland Trail
Blazers on Friday night, a wild seven-player deal that brought the
Rockets six players, not one of them a starter: Kelvin Cato, Stacey
Augmon, Walt Williams, Ed Gray, Brian Shaw and Carlos Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Houston's Frontline for the Ages had become worthy of
a Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau sequel. Who would have thought?
Pippen and Barkley, Grumpy Old Ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley and Pippen have spent the last few years critiquing the
kids in the league who apparently don't respect the game or their
teammates, talking about Michael, Larry and Magic and the good old
days _ as if Charles and Scottie belonged in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there was a genuine clash of personalities: two egos and
talents unable to play together. Maybe Pippen saw the Rockets for
what they are: Olajuwon, Barkley and a young malcontent named Steve
Francis, trying to resurrect some lost glory from 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you would think two of the greatest players of their
era would bow out gracefully. Instead, they have become more
petulant than some of their teen-age peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to want to leave after one year, it disappointed me
greatly,'' Barkley said last week, responding to Pippen's hint that
he wanted to play for former Bulls coach Phil Jackson in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen went on the offensive, and then some. ``I probably
should've listened to Michael a year ago when he said that Charles
will never win a championship because he doesn't show any
dedication,'' Pippen said in an ESPN interview. ``He's a very
selfish guy. He doesn't show the desire to want to win. That's my
reason for wanting to get away from playing with him, because he
just doesn't show the dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would apologize to Barkley for asking out of
Houston, Pippen said: ``I wouldn't give Charles Barkley an apology
at gunpoint. He can never expect an apology from me. If anything,
he owes me an apology for coming to play with his sorry fat butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan knock both Barkley
and Pippen out of the playoffs with the desire and passion those
two used to show before they became so sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   SPREWELL MAY BE DELAYED
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how soon his civil trial over an auto accident ends
in the Bay Area, Latrell Sprewell may or may not make the first day
of Knicks training camp in Charleston, S.C., tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks guard is being sued by Arnulfo Perlas, 55, and Irma
Feliciano, 54, two Antioch, Calif., residents who were injured when
Sprewell's car struck theirs in March 1998, causing it to flip.
During his testimony in Contra Costa County Superior Court,
Sprewell admitted he caused the accident when he tried to get back
on the freeway from an exit-only lane.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he made a mistake, he answered, ``Without a
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it comes to Sprewell, it is all about perception, as
The Contra Costa Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprewell said that he was going as fast as 90 mph on the
bridge and then between 75 mph and 80 mph just before the
accident,'' the paper said. ``During the eight to 10 miles from the
bridge to where the accident occurred, Sprewell testified that he
changed lanes between five and 15 times, that he was driving faster
than the flow of traffic and that he passed every car he came upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprewell said he believed he was driving in a safe and
cautious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   DUNK CONTEST SET TO RETURN
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year hiatus, the slam dunk contest is returning to
All-Star Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   According to a league official, the National Basketball
Association has decided to add the event to the 2000 All-Star
Saturday festivities in Oakland, Calif., next February. Kobe
Bryant, who won the last contest during the 1997 weekend in
Cleveland, is expected to defend his title against six of the
game's most prominent skywalkers, including Toronto's Vince Carter
and Tracy McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   The competition was discontinued because league officials felt
it had deteriorated into a stunt show and because several
high-profile players backed out of it, reducing fan appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A REASON TO CARRY ON
</P>
<P>
   In less-rewarding times, a player with old legs and limited
skills retired because, frankly, he could not play anymore. With a
minimum salary of less than $300,000, it made sense to go out and
get a television analyst job and save your body. But with the
10-year minimum salary at $1.1 million, it apparently pays to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers last week signed John Salley and Benoit Benjamin,
neither of whom played in the league last season. Salley, 35, has
not played for three seasons. Benjamin, 34, has played for eight
teams in 14 seasons.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trouble with being St. Vincents Hospital was best
illuminated last month, when Cardinal John O'Connor found out he
had a brain tumor. The cardinal did not seek care at St. Vincents
but rather at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   While it was perhaps surprising that the cardinal _ who
technically oversaw St. Vincents as archbishop until recently _
chose to get care elsewhere, the choice underscored the basic
reality that high-profile patients have never been the hospital's
bread and butter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the central mission of all the region's Roman Catholic
hospitals has historically been quite unambiguous: to serve their
neighborhoods and to treat the very poor. Competition from the
city's prestigious medical centers was hardly a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, the
jewel among the city's Catholic hospitals, has found itself facing
the same problems that public hospitals face: lower reimbursement
rates from government programs and managed care companies, shorter
hospital visits by patients, and increased competition from the
city's most renowned hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The choice became clear: merge with others and become more
cost-efficient, or perish. So last summer, the hospital, along with
Sisters of Charity Healthcare on Staten Island, agreed to merge
with the Catholic Medical Centers of Brooklyn and Queens.
Overnight, the region's largest Catholic health-care system was
born, with eight hospitals and scores of other services under its
wing.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will be the first of many acquisitions, the
executives involved in it said. When the city is left with a
half-dozen or so consolidated systems, as most health experts
expect, these executives want to make sure that one of them is
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of merger reflects what has been happening in health
care generally,'' said Robert Field, the director of the graduate
program on health policy at the University of the Sciences in
Philadelphia. ``Only religious institutions thought they could hold
out longer. But in the past four to five years, it has been more
and more difficult for them to resist the pressures of operating
like businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   While the new entity will face many of the challenges inherent
in any hospital merger, like ironing out who gets to run various
clinical departments and trying to haggle with managed care
companies, it will also face its own curious conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the merger was arranged ostensibly to help each
hospital continue to serve the city's poorest and sickest
residents. On the other, to compete as a behemoth among prestigious
academic medical centers, the new system will have to attract many
more higher-paying patients. As Adler said, ``You can't serve the
poor without a margin.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives of the merged entity, to be known as St. Vincents
Catholic Medical Centers of New York, are grabbing high-priced
talent left and right. (Non-Catholics are welcome to apply.)
</P>
<P>
   They hope to draw wealthier patients by continuing to build
clinical centers, like the spanking new cancer center at St.
Vincents, and a cardiac care unit that is already making inroads,
the executives said. The idea is that the smaller hospitals will
still serve as primary care centers, referring patients with more
complex problems to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic hospital consortiums have been formed in other parts of
the country for the same economic reasons that secular hospitals
have merged: to consolidate management of payrolls and to gain more
negotiating power with suppliers, laboratories and, most notably,
managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic medical executives have also decided that to protect
their values, especially regarding opposition to abortion and
assisted suicide, they are better off sticking together when
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no choice to be in health care; it is part of who we
are,'' said the Rev. Michael Place, president and chief executive
of the Catholic Health Association of the United States. ``And we
will continue to adapt while preserving our traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The church is no stranger to changes in health care; in many
ways, it was ahead of the consolidation curve. Its role in American
health care began 272 years ago when nuns and religious laywomen
took it on as part of their mission to help immigrants, and
church-sponsored hospitals resulted. Over the years, different
religious orders built large health-care systems, often stretching
across broad swaths of territory.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's largest groups, Catholic Healthcare West,
based in San Francisco, has been rapidly acquiring hospitals. The
consortium, which has 37 hospitals, has met with some success. Last
summer, for example, it was able for the first time to persuade
Blue Cross of California to increase its reimbursement rates for
all of the group's hospitals, after threatening to drop the
insurer.
</P>
<P>
   But attempts to merge hospitals from far and wide have also had
problems. Some have not performed as well as had been hoped, and
when the distances between a consortium's parts are great, one
hospital may have trouble referring patients to another. What is
more, cost savings, which at first can be substantial, tend to
dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental problem of operating such a large organization
is continuing to achieve the economies of scale and economic
benefits,'' said Laura Jacobs, a vice president of the Camden
Group, a health care consulting firm in El Segundo, Calif. She
added: ``Catholic systems by and large are financially strapped to
begin with. They have less wiggle room.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Cantu, the spokeswoman for Catholic Healthcare West,
said it ran into speed bumps in its rapid growth. ``We doubled in
size between '95 and '99; that kind of expansion really takes its
toll on individuals,'' she said. Many employees had no idea whom
they were working for, for instance. ``You tend to let things go
because you are too busy working on the next big deal,'' Ms. Cantu
said. ``We need to pay attention at each instance of what happens
after the merger.''

MTA'S CAPITAL PLAN GOES BEYOND SECOND AVENUE SUBWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The plan for a new Second Avenue subway got most of
the attention, but the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's
$17.5 billion, five-year capital plan includes a host of other
improvements stretching across the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, adopted on Thursday by the authority's board, would
provide the first major investment in decades _ $3 billion _ in new
tunnels, tracks and trains that would expand the region's subway
and commuter rail network.
</P>
<P>
   And while the plan immediately provoked protest over the $700
million that would be provided for the Second Avenue subway, an
amount many riders and Manhattan officials say is too little, the
ensuing debate may have diverted attention from the plan's breadth.
It calls for large investments in subway platforms and train
stations, and would lay the groundwork for the construction of
other new lines far afield from Second Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do things that would improve the economy as well as
improving the ride for our customers,'' Christopher P. Boylan, the
MTA's deputy executive director, said on Thursday as he described
what may have been one of the plan's biggest surprises _ $20
million for a new Metro-North station at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That station would only be built ``once lease discussion between
the city of New York and the Yankees is complete,'' according to
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Another project is a new tunnel extending the No. 7 subway line
from Times Square to the far West Side, providing access to what
some Manhattan officials envision as an expanded Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center. If such an expansion takes place, ``we stand
ready to move,'' said E. Virgil Conway, the MTA chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 7 subway project is presented as one of the most
tentative on the authority's wish list, with money provided only
for preliminary engineering and environmental studies. The plan
allocates $75 million for it and two other long-range expansion
projects: One would reconfigure tracks to give Metro-North trains
access to Penn Station, the other would provide new express service
by subway or Metro-North from Grand Central Terminal to lower
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Second Avenue subway isn't getting built until 2015, I
wouldn't expect these others until 2050,'' said Gene Russianoff,
staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a riders' advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   Another major subway construction project was given higher
priority, and more financial backing, than many transit experts
outside the MTA had expected. That is the plan to provide direct
subway access to La Guardia Airport, probably through an extension
of the N line in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The plan provides $645 million for the project, including $500
million widely believed to have been added at the insistence of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Queens Borough President Claire Shulman,
both of whom have advocated the La Guardia subway link. It
stipulates that the new line would be completed, at least to the
boundary of La Guardia, by 2004. Connecting the line to airport
terminals would take longer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Obviously the mayor and borough president have been pushing,
but nobody is quite sure what the project will be,'' said Jeff
Zupan, a transportation analyst for the Regional Plan Association,
a nongovernmental planning group. There are several open questions,
including whether to build a new underground branch of the N train
or an elevated line through densely populated sections of Queens,
where residents have already voiced opposition to an elevated
structure.
</P>
<P>
   With such a broad assortment of projects, the MTA for now faces
its biggest test in Albany, where proponents of a larger Second
Avenue subway project have a powerful ally in Sheldon Silver, the
speaker of the Assembly, who represents the Lower East Side of
Manhattan. As one of four members of an oversight committee with
veto power over the capital plan, Silver has promised to block any
version that does not provide far more money for a Second Avenue
project.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, reflecting criticisms by many on the East Side, said
last week that a Second Avenue subway from the Bronx to the Battery
was needed to relieve crowding on the Lexington Avenue line,
something that would grow worse because of the largest project
provided for in the MTA plan. That project, budgeted at $1.6
billion, would provide access to Grand Central Terminal by the Long
Island Rail Road, in turn drawing new riders to the Lexington
Avenue line.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes several other projects that seemed likely last
week to survive any compromise forged in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The largest are improvements to existing rail and subway
stations, including a $225 million renovation of the Jamaica
Station, which serves the subway and the LIRR. That project, to be
completed by 2004, has been designed to upgrade the station as a
transfer point serving the new shuttle trains to Kennedy
International Airport that are planned by the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Another project, budgeted at $75 million, would be at the
Atlantic Avenue station in Brooklyn, another hub for subway lines
and the LIRR. Throughout the subway system, the plan calls for
improvements ranging from new elevators and platforms to cosmetic
repairs at 64 stations in all five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also provides $140 million to maintain and expand fare
collection systems of New York City buses and subways, in which the
Metrocard has overtaken tokens as the preferred method of payment.
While upgrading the electronics of the Metrocard system, Boylan
said the authority will explore other technologies like a ``Smart
Card'' that could be used like the ``E-ZPass'' at highway toll
booths, enabling customers to charge their fares to a credit card
account.

POLICE BEWILDERED BY SHOOTING NEAR RAP STAR'S MIDTOWN STUDIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police said Saturday that they remained puzzled
by a shooting outside a building in midtown Manhattan that contains
a recording studio owned by Sean Combs, the rap star better known
as Puff Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting, which occurred shortly after 1:30 a.m. on Friday,
left the lobby door of the building at 321 West 44th St &UR; . &LR; 
shattered, the police said, and a trail of blood was found leading
to Combs' second-floor studio, Daddy's House.
</P>
<P>
   While they originally thought that the intended target had fled
there, the police said Saturday that it now appears the blood came
from a young woman who had been standing near the doors when the
bullets pierced them and who was injured by flying shards of glass.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose name and age were not released by the police,
received 35 stitches at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center before
being discharged, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   A man, Stan Johnson, 24, of Welch Street in the Bronx, was
arrested nearby after the shooting, but the police did not charge
him in connection with it.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, Johnson was sitting in a red Mercedes
with two other men when officers arrived to investigate the reports
of shots being fired. The officers approached the car when they
noticed Johnson was driving away without turning on his headlights,
they said, adding that he was arrested after he allegedly tried to
run over the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson faces charges of attempted assault, assault on a police
officer and reckless endangerment, the police said. Two passengers
in the car fled into a nearby building and have not been found,
they said. Although a 9-millimeter handgun was discovered in the
building, the police said they have not yet been able to link it to
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Slovis, a lawyer who represents Lil' Cease, one of the
rap performers in the studio at the time of the shooting, said the
gunfire apparently followed a fight between two men at a nearby
bar, but he added that neither man was associated with Combs'
recording studio or with the people who were there that night.
</P>
<P>
   Slovis said the only reason the police went to Combs' studio was
because the woman cut by shards of glass had fled there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They detained Lil' Kim, Lil' Cease and Junior Mafia thinking
that a shooting victim was in the studio,'' Slovis said. ``But the
police eventually let them go, because the police know nobody was
shot in the building and that the tape they took from the entrance
of the studio shows nobody but the girl going inside.''

A CHALLENGE TO YACHTING'S TRANS-ATLANTIC SPEED RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Fossett sets sailing records the way Mark McGwire crushes
home runs _ with startling regularity. In 1978, Fossett, buoyed by
a growing fortune in the securities market, began to make up for an
idle boyhood with forays into mountain climbing, marathon swimming
and triathalons. But it was not until 1991 that Fossett got truly
serious about his fun.
</P>
<P>
   That year, looking ``to find some interesting things to do,''
Fossett decided to take up long-distance ballooning and offshore
sailing. And the records in those endeavors soon began to fall.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the 55-year-old Fossett is planning to steer his
latest, wildest toy _ the grand, powerful 105-foot catamaran
PlayStation _ into New York Harbor in advance of his attempt to
topple one of yachting's most elusive marks: the 6-day-13-hour
trans-Atlantic speed record from New York to the English Channel,
set by the French cat Jet Services in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a window here where, for the next year, we'll
certainly have the fastest sailboat in the world,'' Fossett said in
a telephone interview. ``We want to take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fossett's trans-Atlantic trip is just the opening scene
in a three-act play. In February, PlayStation is scheduled for an
all-out assault on the 71-day, nonstop round-the-world record. And
on Dec. 31, 2000, the boat will again try to conquer the planet in
an epic contest for unlimited sailboats called, simply, The Race.
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation claimed the title of world's fastest sailboat in New
Zealand last March when Fossett and crew nailed a 24-hour run of
580 miles, the quickest ever under sail. ``Our top speed was 36.5
knots,'' Fossett said. ``But we can go faster. We hope to top 600
miles in a day. We're just beginning to explore the boat's
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   That potential was nearly dashed forever several weeks later
when the vessel's bank of experimental electric automobile
batteries caught fire and torched the resin-rich carbon-fiber hull.
The fire was soon under control, Fossett said, ``but we actually
had to cut the boat in half and build a whole new 26-foot section
of hull and splice that back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossett's resilience has been tested countless times. In 1999
alone, hopping from one vessel to another in his three-boat fleet,
Fossett added course-record victories in the Chicago-Mackinac and
Montego Bay races and a new record for the Newport-Bermuda passage
to his list of 10 speed sailing records and 8 race records.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his 40-hour singlehanded dash to Bermuda aboard his
60-foot trimaran Lakota, Fossett said, ``As a matter of personal
pride and self-esteem, I like to do one solo event each year so I
can do all the sailing and people can see that I can sail without
my crew.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the trans-Atlantic voyage on PlayStation, Fossett will
be just one of 11 seasoned crew members. In addition to the
co-skipper Ben Wright and his longtime allies Brian Thompson and
David Scully, the stellar cast includes the prominent West Coast
ocean racers Peter Hogg and Stan Honey; the boat's designers, Gino
Morelli and Pete Melvin, and one of Fossett's buddies from his
ballooning circles, Richard Branson, the Virgin Airlines chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard's had a long association with trans-Atlantic
endeavors,'' Fossett said. ``He had the powerboat record at one
time, and he still has the ballooning record. So I thought he'd
very much enjoy it if I invited him on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   From their base at Chelsea Piers, the PlayStation crew will
spend about two weeks in Manhattan on final preparations. They plan
to set out as soon after Oct. 25 as possible. First, they will need
the perfect forecast. Perfectly miserable, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to latch on to the spiraling low-pressure systems
that truck off the coast and across the North Atlantic and to ride
their westerlies for all they're worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The favorable wind must be from angles which produce the
fastest speeds and persist for as much of the crossing as
possible,'' said the meteorologist Chris Bedford, who will provide
shoreside routing assistance. ``We actually will be looking for
moderate, rather than strong winds, for the fastest crossing. We
want to make sure that the favorable pattern will hold for the
entire trip and not disappear at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   If PlayStation gets and holds the right breeze, the record will
be in serious jeopardy. Fossett would have it no other way. ``I
keep the book with all the world records for sailing right with
me,'' he said. ``I'm very aware of them all. And I'm looking for
opportunities to break them.''

DOREEN VALIENTE, 77, DIES; ADVOCATED POSITIVE WITCHCRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England)  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doreen Valiente, a self-proclaimed witch who in the mid-1950s
wrote part of the liturgy now used by witches around the world,
died in Brighton, England, on Sept. 1. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Through lectures and her many books, Ms. Valiente became the
chief proselytizer of the white witch movement, which espouses the
use of magic, defined as Divine energy, for beneficial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   She was held by many to be the ``mother of modern paganism,''
according to The Times of London, which reported her death on
Monday. As a coven of today's witches gather in a circle, it is her
version of the Charge of the Goddess, a witches' liturgical text,
that the priestess recites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of her life she witnessed _ and helped
generate _ a sustained revival of witchcraft and paganism in
Britain, despite repeated protestations by evangelical
Christians,'' The Times said in its obituary.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis W. Curott, president emeritus of Covenant of the
Goddess, a New York-based umbrella organization for witches, said
that in recent years millions of people had been drawn to
witchcraft but that the words written by Ms. Valiente remain
central in virtually every ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``A common chord, uniting all, is a real love and appreciation
for the Charge of the Goddess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Valiente, witchcraft became ever more inclusive,
ultimately embracing feminism, environmentalism and a host of New
Age concepts, including native American spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an idea whose time had come,'' Ms. Valiente said in a
1991 interview, ``and these other things are also things whose time
has come.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valiente became a guiding force in the wicca movement, which
derives its name from an old Anglo-Saxon word for witch, or the
wise one.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Ms. Curott said, the number of wicca
devotees now numbers 3 million to 5 million, making it one of the
country's fastest growing beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valiente was born Doreen Dominy in London in 1922. She was
brought up as a Christian and sent to a convent school, which she
walked out of at 15, refusing to return.
</P>
<P>
   Biographers say that she experienced psychic episodes in her
youth, and that by her late teens she was a practicing clairvoyant.
She worked as a secretary by day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, she married Casimiro Valiente, a refugee from the
Spanish Civil War who went on to fight with the Free French.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, shortly after Britain had repealed its Witchcraft Act,
which had outlawed witchery, she approached Cecil Williamson, then
owner of the Museum of Witchcraft on the Isle of Man.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson put her in touch with Gerald Gardner, who headed a
group of witches called the New Forest Coven. Gardner initiated her
as a witch in 1953. Ms. Valiente became the coven's high priestess
and collaborated with Gardner in putting an up-to-date spin on what
was billed as the witches' ancient liturgy, ``Book of Shadows,''
written in segments during the 1950s
</P>
<P>
   The book was actually an eclectic mix, based principally on
Charles Leland's ``Gospel of the Witches,'' published in 1899, but
drawing also on Freemasonry, theosophy and the works of the Golden
Dawn, a magical tradition of England and Ireland embraced by George
Bernard Shaw and William Butler Yeats.
</P>
<P>
   Wicca began to be practiced with its new ritual and with Ms.
Valiente in a prominent position. ``She became a high priestess
during an era when witchcraft was still very much in the broom
closet,'' Ms. Currott said.
</P>
<P>
   She was tapping into a rich and quixotic tradition. Witchcraft
had persisted and sometimes been tolerated, despite laws against it
going back to the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of witchcraft in Britain is unique, in both its form
and mildness, when compared with the rest of Europe,'' wrote Ronald
Holmes in his book, ``Witchcraft in British History'' in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valiente broke with Gardner in 1957 when he ignored the
coven's vows of secrecy by aggressively seeking publicity. After
the deaths of her mother in 1964 and husband in 1972 (neither of
whom had approved of her career choice) she began to take a much
more personal and active role in what witches simply call the
craft.
</P>
<P>
   Her most important contribution to the movement was a stream of
books, including ``An A B C of Witchcraft,'' published in 1973;
``Witchcraft for Tomorrow'' (1978), and ``The Rebirth of
Witchcraft,'' (1989).
</P>
<P>
   A gauge of the growth of her movement is that in 1964, when she
gave the opening speech at the inaugural dinner at the Witchcraft
Research Association, it was attended by 50 subscribers. In
November 1977, she addressed an audience of 1,500 at the Pagan
Federation Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cooke, a fellow believer who was her companion for most of
the last two decades of her life, died in 1997. She left no close
relatives, but made the Center for Pagan Studies in Surrey,
England, principal beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a wise and wild woman, who definitely ran with the
British equivalent of wolves,'' said Ms. Curott, who in 1985 won
the case allowing witch clergy to perform weddings in New York
City.

AL DAVIS RESTYLES THE RAIDERS;  
 LEWIS EXCELS 
ANOTHER CHANCE 
SPANISH INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   As difficult as it may be for some people in the National
Football League to hear, there is a man who may deserve an apology.
You know who he is. He wears those horrific white suits and
funny-looking glasses. He hates the league office _ and the people
in it hate him. He is Al Davis, owner of the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have flopped in recent years, and along the way
Davis has been called many things, including wacky, out of touch,
even a loser. There were some in the league who believed Davis
would never again be a winner. Harsh words for a man of such pride.
</P>
<P>
   So, as hard as this may be ... well, sorry for the unkind words,
Mr. Davis. You may finally have your act together. Your team is
good again. There. Was that so hard?
</P>
<P>
   Oakland is 2-1, and though that is not a reason to celebrate _
the Raiders still have plenty of time to self-destruct _ Davis has
recently made a number of astute moves to get his team back on
track.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Raiders' becoming one of the league's up-and-coming
teams is that Davis may have taken a hard look at himself. In some
ways he has not changed. He is still heavily involved in every part
of the organization. He still sues everyone except the local
grocer. But Davis, once wedded to the vertical passing game, has
finally entered into the modern football world. No team survives on
deep routes alone. The Raiders have drafted better, emphasized the
running game and focused on upgrading their defense.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a talented team now and a strong foundation for
the future. If it were not for a miraculous, last-minute victory by
the Green Bay Packers in the season opener against them, the
Raiders would be 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have made several smart decisions in recent years.
Davis hired  &UR; c &LR; oach Jon Gruden, a move criticized by some in the
news media because he was unproven. But he has grown into a solid
leader, and Gruden hired one of the top coordinators in Willie
Shaw, who has turned the Raiders' defense into a solid group.
</P>
<P>
   While the Raiders have rushed for 424 yards and five touchdowns
on 91 attempts, their opponents have only 159 yards rushing and no
touchdowns. The Raiders also have six interceptions to one for
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland has built its impressive defense around two solid draft
picks: Darrell Russell, a first-round selection from Southern
California in 1997, and Charles Woodson, their top pick in 1998 who
won the Heisman Trophy while at Michigan. Russell has one and a
half sacks, and Woodson inspires the same kind of fear that Deion
Sanders once did. Teams rarely challenge Woodson, which is why he
has no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have even been able to get something out of running
back Tyrone Wheatley. After failing with the Giants and being cut
by the Miami Dolphins, Wheatley has found a home on the West Coast.
He leads the team in rushing with 176 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   And quarterback Rich Gannon has demonstrated an accurate arm
along with his good feet. Gannon has completed 63.6 percent of his
passes and has a quarterback rating of 93.4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At last, the pieces seem to be falling in place for the
Raiders. Because they have the league's toughest schedule, there
will be times this season when they stumble. But the Raiders
definitely have a playoff-caliber team.
</P>
<P>
   So, Mr. Davis, more apologies may be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   LEWIS EXCELS WITH PACKERS
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Based on the Packers' first three games, in which they have
shown an offensive explosion, the league owners no longer have any
excuses. If there is a head-coaching opening at the end of this
season and Green Bay's offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis does not
get it, then the people who claim that the league is racist will
have more ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis arrived with Mike Holmgren when he became the coach in
1992 and presided over the Packers' offense. But Holmgren called
the plays.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last season, Holmgren left for the Seattle
Seahawks, and now Lewis exclusively runs the offense. In Green
Bay's first three games the Packers have averaged 402 yards
compared with 352.3 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has also put his stamp on the offense. Holmgren tended to
be more conservative; Lewis likes to throw deep more.
</P>
<P>
   There could be five or more head-coaching openings at the end of
this season, and again the focus will be on the lack of black head
coaches, as it has been for years. But this year the situation is
different. If the Packers make the playoffs _ almost a guarantee _
and Lewis improves the offense after Holmgren's departure, then
every possible excuse not to hire him is gone.
</P>
<P>
   EMPATHY FOR UNDERWOOD
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins are prepared to give defensive lineman
Dimitrius Underwood, who recently attempted suicide, a chance to
play next season, assuming he undergoes successful counseling.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Underwood, a rookie, was arrested on a warrant
accusing him of nonpayment of child support, he was treated in a
Lansing, Mich., hospital. The police say he cut his neck with a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood's problems do not seem to shake Miami Coach Jimmy
Johnson, whose plan was to have Underwood receive extensive
therapy. But can Johnson, known for his ability to get the most out
of his players, salvage the career of the troubled Underwood?
</P>
<P>
   A SPANISH INFLUENCE
</P>
<P>
   Eight NFL teams have games broadcast on Spanish radio stations
in their markets. Professional football has become so popular in
the Latino community that the NFL has launched pro sports' first
Spanish-language Web site for news media covering games. ... The
struggles of Minnesota wide receiver Randy Moss continue. He has
only nine catches for 123 yards in his first three games. ... A
Tennessee victory against San Francisco Sunday would make the
Titans 4-0 for the first time in the franchise's history, including
as the Oilers. ... San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh has
ordered the team's office staff to wear 49er jerseys, bearing No.
99, on Fridays before home games.

 &HT;    Scent of victory lures Christian Coalition
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes told
Christian Coalition members Saturday that he, not Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, should be their choice for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In a ballroom filled with his supporters, Forbes recited a
litany of positions that makes him a better fit for the coalition
than Bush, whose address on Friday was well received.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Forbes' list was his commitment to choose federal
judges and a vice presidential running mate who oppose abortion
rights. ``The front-runner won't promise to appoint pro-life
judges,'' or a pro-life running mate, Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   His direct attack on Bush also included a warning that
Republicans should not let Bush avoid debates with his rivals until
just before caucus and primary voting begin in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party deserves to know its nominee,'' Forbes
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest applause lines came when he noted that, ``in
477 days, Bill Clinton will no longer be president.''
</P>
<P>
   But that statement also called attention to what makes Bush so
attractive as a candidate, even among voters who are more
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to elect a Republican president in 2000, after eights
years of Clinton, seems to have triumphed over ideological purity
in the minds of many conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer Forbes. I think he's a great guy,'' said John
McBride of Richmond, Va. ``But I guess I think Bush is the most
electable.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Anita Chase of Lugoff, S.C., sported Forbes stickers
and also spoke highly of GOP candidate Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   But Anita Chase said, ``We feel like Bush will be the
front-runner, and we'll vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband chimed in, ``We won't have any choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson voiced a similar
sentiment during the coalition's two-day political convention when
he said, ``If we aren't in the field in this coming election, then
the Republicans are going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   He identified five states, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio
and Pennsylvania, in which a strong turnout by coalition members
could swing the election, in a close contest, to the Republican
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The 2 million-member organization has slipped in its
fund-raising and lost many of its most experienced hands during the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson exclaimed, ``We're back!'' when he spoke on
Friday, and predicted the group would raise enough money to
distribute 75 million voter guides in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Watson, a professor of religion at Florida State
University and author of a book on the coalition, doubted that
Robertson could restore the organization's luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger sense of dissatisfaction with the direction of
American culture is still there,'' said Watson, who listened to the
weekend's speeches. ``But this particular vehicle has run out of
gas, and I don't see anything that will really galvanize these
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the program included seven candidates for president and
the top Republicans in Congress, evidence that religious
conservatives remain a significant Republican constituency.

EASING THE RULES FOR MORTGAGE APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sisters Arlene Jones and Judith George are close.
They grew up together in the Virgin Islands, and after they arrived
in Brooklyn in 1978, when they were in their early 20s, they lived
in apartments two blocks apart.
</P>
<P>
   They long hoped to own homes near each other, and this year they
achieved that goal. They moved into side-by-side two-family houses
on Elton Street in the East New York section of Brooklyn, each
paying $175,000 for a house newly built through the New York City
Housing Partnership program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to find it,'' said Ms. Jones, who is an
executive assistant at Keyspan Energy, the parent company of
Brooklyn Union Gas. When they were house-hunting the builder still
had adjoining houses available in a development of 40 houses that
were in construction.
</P>
<P>
   They were lucky for a less obvious reason as well. In
considering them for a mortgage, Chase Manhattan Bank let them
count most of their prospective rental income in a way that
qualified them for the loan they needed. They would not have
qualified for their loans if the bank had used traditional
underwriting standards.
</P>
<P>
   The less restrictive standards have come into wider use in
recent years in the sales of homes that have at least one rental
apartment. They have had the effect of allowing creditworthy
borrowers with somewhat lower incomes _ usually close to the median
family income in New York City of $50,000 a year _ to buy houses.
Ms. Jones and Ms. George have incomes in the $40,000-a-year range.
</P>
<P>
   The basic change is that in determining the borrower's ability
to afford the loan, a large portion of the rent that will be
collected is applied as an offset to the monthly costs the borrower
will bear. Buyers for years have thought that they were doing that
by getting a rental tenant or two.
</P>
<P>
   But the principle had not been generally embraced by mortgage
lenders in loan underwriting. Instead, a portion of rental income
was merely added to the buyer's gross income to determine
eligibility. This creates a higher ratio of housing costs to income
than the new method does.
</P>
<P>
   For buyers who can afford a 5 percent down payment, the new
method makes it more likely they will qualify for a loan of 95
percent of the purchase price of a two-family house.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant number of two- to four-family home buyers have
benefited from this approach,'' said Wesley Wainwright, senior vice
president of Chase Manhattan Bank in charge of residential lending
in the Community Development Group.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, the major banks supporting the New York City Housing
Partnership's program of new-home construction for moderate-income
buyers have used this approach in qualifying purchasers. But it got
greater impetus in 1994 when Fannie Mae, the nation's largest
purchaser of mortgages from banks and other home-mortgage
originators, introduced pilot programs to stimulate the home sales
market in New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae packages these loans with other mortgages as
securities for sale to investors. Creating a market to which
mortgage originators can sell their loans encourages them to lend
more.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Fannie Mae pilot program, the houses may be either
newly built or previously occupied. The purchasers do not have to
be first-time buyers, although most have been. The buyers must live
in the house they buy, and if they formerly owned a home, they have
to have sold it before they close on the new one. There are no
income restrictions on buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical situation, a creditworthy buyer with an income of
about $45,000 in wages and the ability to make a 5 percent down
payment would qualify for a 95 percent mortgage on a two-family
house costing about $200,000, Fannie Mae said. This assumes that
the apartment would rent for about $800 a month. Previously the
same buyer would probably have needed $55,000 a year in income to
qualify for the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Since the pilot program began, it has been used in about 10
percent of all the loans for two-family to four-family houses in
New York City that Fannie Mae has purchased, the company said. Last
year, Fannie Mae's total purchases of New York City two- to
four-family loans was 4,200 _ with an aggregate value of $788
million _ and 11 percent used the pilot underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be having its greatest effect in Brooklyn and
Queens, and especially for two-family homes,'' said Naomi Bayer,
director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, which was
established in Manhattan four years ago. She also said that most
buyers may not need such financing, because they have higher
incomes or can make a higher down payment. They also may not know
about it, she said, so they may not ask their lender about it.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly payment that a home buyer makes to a lender covers
not only the principal and interest due on the mortgage loan but
also contributions to escrow accounts for real-estate taxes and
insurance, and, in many cases, private mortgage insurance on that
portion of the debt that exceeds 80 percent of the value of the
house. Bankers refer to the monthly payment they receive for these
obligations as the ``PITI'' payment, an acronym for principal,
interest, taxes and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pilot program, the bank, in calculating how large a
loan it will offer to the purchaser of a two-family house, uses 75
percent of the buyer's anticipated rental income as an offset to
this monthly payment. The minimum down payment is 5 percent, and
the buyer must have at least $1,000 a month in additional income
after the monthly payment is made.
</P>
<P>
   The standards are slightly different for three- and four-family
houses, but the principle is the same. These buyers must put down
at least 10 percent, and the income they have left after their
monthly payment must be higher _ at least $1,250 for a three-family
loan and $1,350 for a four-family.
</P>
<P>
   In standard underwriting of residential mortgages, rental income
is considered too. But it is added to the buyer's gross income
rather than deducted from monthly costs for purposes of calculating
how large a loan the borrower can afford. The standard approach
leads to a more conservative loan.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program has been been used by buyers spending over
$300,000 for a two-family house, bankers say. The national 1999
limits on loans that Fannie Mae will buy _ $240,000 for a
one-family house, $307,100 for a two-family, $371,200 for a
three-family and $461,350 for a four-family _ apply to the pilot
program as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae requires that first-time buyers get counseling both
in home ownership and in acting as a landlord, before it will buy
these loans. In resale housing only landlord counseling is
required.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McEnerney, president of Bank of New York Mortgage Co &UR; .,
 &LR;  said that it is only in the last year or year and a half that the
new Fannie Mae standards have become widely available in
three-family and four-family sales, although in two-family sales
they have generally been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always take a little time for the lending community to get
comfortable with new standards,'' McEnerney said, ``and we're only
beginning to get enough data on the performance of these loans to
the threes and fours.''

<P>
   One older house was bought recently by Dimitriy Bobkov, 23, an
information specialist with IBM, who arrived in the United States
from Ukraine five years ago, and his brother Vitaliy, 31, who is a
self-employed computer technician. Their combined income is about
$80,000 a year, Dimitriy Bobkov said.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers bought a three-family house for $194,000 in the Sea
Gate section of Brooklyn a year ago with a Bank of New York
mortgage, and also spent about $25,000 to improve it, doing much of
the work themselves. They are getting $500 a month in rent from a
tenant, a friend who agreed to rent the apartment before the
brothers bought the house. They received a $174,600 mortgage at
conventional rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Possibly we could have gotten another loan but it would have
been much more trouble,'' Dimitriy Bobkov said. ``We would have had
to put 20 percent down instead of 10 percent.'' And the rent
calculation would have been less favorable.
</P>
<P>
   More liberal underwriting also carries risks, for both the
lender and the borrower. Nowadays many lenders are offering
subprime loans, for example, which go to less creditworthy
borrowers and carry higher-than-normal interest rates. Presumably,
during a period of prosperity and high employment borrowers in
general will be successful in carrying this debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   But many lenders and housing specialists caution buyers about
becoming too dependent on rent. What happens in a recession, and a
weakened housing market, when both buyers and renters may face a
loss of income? If the tenant cannot afford the rent, will he leave
quickly and be replaced by another tenant at the same rent? If the
owner has to seek an eviction in housing court, will he get quick
action or have to go for months with no rent collections?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fannie Mae program is a fabulous thing if it's used
correctly and not abused,'' said Keith Kantrowitz, president of
Power Express, a mortgage company in Great Neck. He said that about
20 percent of the resales of two- to four-family houses that Power
Express finances in the city use the Fannie Mae pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the program were not there, many buyers would be forced to
use subprime loans to buy their house, if they could buy at all,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some buyers overlook potential problems that mortgage
underwriting does not take into account, he said, and then they
lack the resources to deal with them. There can be overoptimism on
the rents that can be obtained and unanticipated problems with
basic housing systems. Heating costs and water and sewer charges
may turn out to be beyond expectations, and the cost of gardening
and cable service may have been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Kantrowitz said he had already seen evidence of negative
effects. Over the last five years, there have been seven
foreclosures in loans Power Express financed, more than would be
expected in an upward market, he said, because buyers facing
foreclosure might be expected to sell and move. In one case, a
borrower of $211,000 made 40 payments on time and then abruptly
stopped paying for a full year, Kantrowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenant simply stopped paying the rent, and the owner can't
get him out,'' he said. ``And the house isn't salable. Who would
buy a house when the tenant's not paying?''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a 1996 buyer of a three-family house in the
Canarsie section of Brooklyn with two tenants in place made only
three payments on a $221,000 loan. ``She moved into an area where
the cost of child care was much higher than she expected,'' he
said, ``and then the cost of heating buried her.'' It was winter
and she was getting heating bills of $600 a month. She had budgeted
$150 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go into a house in December on a budget that uses
average year-round heating costs,'' Kantrowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   In new housing, some of these problems are minimized. The owner
gets to select the tenant _ many times a family member _ and
operating costs are more clearly foreseeable. Tax abatements for
new home construction, which are passed on to buyers, also are a
big help. ``For a novice in home ownership, the new house has great
advantages,'' Kantrowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage for any owner is a healthy rental market.
Rising rents may help the home buyer even in the early years of
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   In the Highbridge section of the Bronx, Isabel Santos has had a
positive experience with tenants. She said she was well aware of
the risks she was taking on when she bought a new three-family
house on Woodycrest Avenue through the Partnership program for
$322,000 five years ago. ``I was worried about my ability to find
responsible tenants,'' said Ms. Santos, who is in her 50s and is a
field worker for a union, earning in the high $40,000-a-year range.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out out, not only has she had regular rent
collections, but also the rents have risen _ from a total of $1,640
for the two apartments to $1,725, which fully covers her monthly
housing costs. ``I didn't even have to advertise for tenants,'' Ms.
Santos said. ``They're both friends of mine, and one is a colleague
at work.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Housing Partnership program, nonprofit organizations
working with lenders provide budgeting and landlord counseling. The
Partnership itself, in collaboration with developers, provides
instruction on home maintenance, and it expects in the future to
take on both aspects of owner education.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 14,000 Partnership home buyers since 1986, and
more and more of the newer houses are three-families. Nowadays the
loans are normally sold to Fannie Mae, and the underwriting for
them follows Fannie Mae's standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't be developing two- and three-family houses without
the Fannie Mae underwriting,'' said Gale Kaufman, vice president of
the Housing Partnership. Rental income is a secure form of income,
she said, and the renters are often the owner's relatives. Loans
made under the Partnership program have a default rate of less than
1 percent, Ms. Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   But as in any home purchase _ whether a new house or a resale _
buyers are responsible for their own decisions. The obvious
precaution they are advised to take before they buy the house is to
have it inspected. This is often done in a cursory way, however, by
buyers eager to save money or lock in the purchase with a contract
so as not to lose out to another buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays there's pressure being put on buyers to go into
contract within 10 days,'' said Donald Siracusa, whose
home-inspection business, Absolute Building Inspections Ltd., is
based in Bay Terrace. Buyers are often not willing to take the time
or pay the price for a proper inspection by a professional
certified by the American Society of Home Inspectors, in Des
Plaines, Ill., said Siracusa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a lack of knowledge.'' he said. ``Many buyers
don't even read the report when they get one. Or they hire people
unqualified to make them, who are too close to the sales broker.''
The cost of a proper inspection for a two-family house on Staten
Island has been about $350, Siracusa said. The reports that he
gives to customers, with photographs, are in narrative form.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae made the following comparison to explain how the
pilot program would make a two-family home purchase affordable
while conventional underwriting would not.
</P>
<P>
   In Fannie Mae's conventional underwriting for two-family home
loans nationally, buyers must make at least a 10 percent down
payment (but only 5 percent in New York City, and 3 percent for
single-family houses). In addition, 75 percent of the owner's
rental income from the rental apartment would added to the buyer's
annual income to calculate eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   So if the house costs $200,000 and the buyer earns $44,000 and
can collect $850 a month in rent, the buyer's income would be
considered $51,644 a year. Three-quarters of the rent _ $637 a
month, or $7,644 a year _ would be added to annual income.
</P>
<P>
   Although this buyer might be able to make a 5 percent down
payment, his application to borrow $190,000 would probably be
denied. A 30-year loan at 7.5 percent interest, plus payments to
escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, would bring the
applicant's monthly payments to about $1,660, or $19,920 a year.
This is 38 percent of the buyer's gross annual income of $51,650.
The normal limit in affordable-housing programs is 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot program, no more than a 28 percent ratio of housing
costs to income is allowed (but 33 percent for new houses in the
Partnership program). The $44,000-a-year buyer would find the
$190,000 loan affordable. His monthly obligation would be only
$1,023 after deducting 75 percent of the rental income ($1,660
minus $637). On an annual basis, net housing payments would be
$12,276 ($19,920 minus $7,644), or 27.9 percent of his income.
</P>
<P>
   After all the calculations are made, the lender would take into
account the buyer's residual income after his monthly payments, to
ensure that the borrower is not overly dependent on rental income.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Jones, who bought the house in East New York next door to
her sister Judith, a Board of Education employee in downtown
Brooklyn, said that they had advertised in the Amsterdam News for a
renter and received about 60 phone responses.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the Brooklyn Neighborhood Improvement
Association, which assists moderate-income home buyers, interviewed
three of these respondents. Only that number were willing to risk
$50 for an interview and credit check.
</P>
<P>
   One tenant was selected by Ms. George. Ms. Jones readvertised
and then found one. The rent levels turned out to be higher than
those used in the underwriting, by $50 a month in one case and $80
in the other, Ms. Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters have been in their homes for two months. Ms. Jones,
who has four daughters ranging in age from 7 to 22, said her family
had lived for 20 years in an apartment that had only one bathroom.
Now she has two. She also has her own parking place, on her own
property right next to her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' she said.

as she headed home from an afternoon of shopping for a family
vacation. The kids had been with their grandmother all afternoon.
Sheila heard the whoosh of the cruiser and thought absently,
'They're really after somebody.'' She turned into her street,
Stephens Road, transformed into a parking lot of cruisers and
emergency vehicles. As she drew closer she realized the yellow
police tape circled her yard. Sheila jumped out of her car, but
Sidney officers blocked her from entering the house. ``You can't go
in,'' they told her. ``I want to see my husband,'' she pleaded.
``You can't go in,'' the officers repeated. ``Did you know a Matt
Hensley?'' they asked. ``I know a Mike Hensley,'' she said. ``He's
someone who attends our church, someone the church was trying to
help.'' Once again, the officers barred her way: ``This is a crime
scene,'' they said. Minutes later, after she learned the truth,
that Mike Hensley had murdered four people, including her husband,
Sheila Wildermuth lost her ability to speak. For weeks she could

   FORFEIT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the war on drugs, one of
the big guns is the state's forfeiture law, which gives police the
power to seize any property _ cars, boats, planes, computers, guns,
or cash _ they believe has been used in a crime. The police need
not charge anyone with a crime to take their property; in fact,
because such seizures are treated as civil matters rather than
criminal, they need even less evidence than they would to arrest
someone. Thanks to this law police in PBC have collected more than
$7 million since 1996, money they can spend on equipment, drug
treatment programs, and complex investigations. After reviewing
more than 600 forfeiture cases, we will examine how this law works.

COX'S TWO WORLDS UNITE SENSITIVITY WITH PLAYER RAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ If you thought the Jets were getting an undisciplined,
angry man when they plucked Bryan Cox out of oblivion 14 months
ago, talk to the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a different opinion, talk to his children.
</P>
<P>
   Why, just last Sunday night he practically cried when he took
his wife, La Tonia, and their three children to the airport and
sent them home to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But this Sunday, he will revert to the intense linebacker who
nearly went into the stands after a fan the last time he played in
Denver's Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cox loves both worlds, and coexists in remarkable harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Broncos, the competitive _ some might say angry _
side of Cox is sure to surface. This is a clutch game, as important
as any he has played with the Jets. They are 0-3 and the Broncos
are 0-3 in this first meeting since the championship game matching
them last January. In that game, the biggest one the Jets have
played since 1982, Cox led the team in tackles.
</P>
<P>
   In big games, Cox has been superb, especially since becoming a
Jet. He has taken on the role of leader with his actions in
pressure situations. He is the one who grabbed the rookie Jason
Wiltz by the face mask in the season opener when Wiltz failed to
get onto the field in time. And he scolds teammates on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mo Lewis and Marvin Jones are more veteran linebackers,
Cox is the one who gets the players' attention, not only with his
demands, but also with his signal-calling. He makes sure the
defense is lined up correctly. And he is the one whom the news
media lines up for when the locker room is opened before practice.
Reporters stand three-deep waiting for him to say something.
</P>
<P>
   Cox has more than backed up his mouth. He is the only Jet to
intercept a pass this year _ he returned it for a touchdown in the
opener against the Patriots, giving the Jets a fourth-quarter lead.
In this demoralizing start, he has knocked down three passes _ the
same number as the Pro Bowl cornerback Aaron Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   In the game at Miami last year that the Jets needed to win to
clinch a playoff berth, Cox led in tackles, returning to the city
where he had starred and gone to the Pro Bowl three times. A week
later he led the defense against the Bills in Orchard Park, N.Y.,
where he had once fought with an opponent and jawed at fans whom he
said were racist. The Jets clinched their first division title
since the American Football League days with a 17-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the 31-year-old Cox why he performs so well in the clutch,
and he does not hesitate in offering a reason. It has to do with
being raised in a tough town, East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to grow up in a place like that,'' he said,
``having to work, go through the struggle. If you grow up in a
rich, white neighborhood, and preppy, your father's head of a
company _ when something bad happens, you fold.''
</P>
<P>
   So, adversity had honed him?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. He grew up in a private home with a two-parent
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I had four parents,'' Cox said, ``a stepmother and a
stepfather. I spent weekends with my father. My stepfather was
college-educated as a sociologist. My father was a hard-working man
until he was stricken with arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was strong, I was protected. I had everything _
maybe I couldn't get a pair of Jordan's.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the streets attracted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live in a concrete jungle,'' he explained. ``I never hurt
people. I did some things. When I go back to East St. Louis, I see
the same guys. Some of them tell me, `You shouldn't be seen around
us.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Cox said he would never desert the friends he had when he
was young. ``There are times on the football field I feel the same
way about my teammates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And his family, he might have added. He brings them to New York
when the Jets have a 1 p.m. Sunday game. And he sees them off to
Atlanta on Sunday night. On Saturday nights, the Cox clan stays in
the hotel with him. He and La Tonia have two children. A third
child is hers from a previous marriage, and he also has a teen-age
daughter in East St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   There have been moments on the field when Cox has looked more
like the East St. Louis street fighter of his youth than a model
football player, let alone father. There was his tirade in Orchard
Park, another one in Chicago against officials. There was, to a
lesser degree, his actions as a Jet last year at Tennessee, when in
one quarter he clubbed running back Eddie George and quarterback
Steve McNair. He was fined $10,000 a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   His children _ Lavonda, 15, Brittani, 7, and Bryan Jr., 5 _ are
aware of his wild side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they laugh,'' he said. ``Sometimes they tell me I'm
an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't believe that is so strange because, he said: ``My
kids are my friends. But you know, they're just like all kids.
They're sort of embarrassed to be with me. We'll go to the mall,
and they say, `Dad, can you just walk ahead?'''

<P>
   Part idiot, part friend, this is the Bryan Cox the Jets rescued
from oblivion in August 1998, the day after the team learned Jones
would be lost for the year with a knee injury. The Bears had
dropped Cox following an acrimonious two seasons in which he
complained about management and, on occasion, teammates. But from
1991 to 1995 he had starred for the Dolphins, before becoming a
free agent upon the arrival of Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Cox had known Bill Parcells for years. Both own thoroughbred
horses. When Cox was in high school he worked in the kitchen of
Fairmount Park racetrack in Collinsville, Ill. He always loved
horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is it eases my mind,'' he said. ``If I can't hook
up with my kids, I go to the track or watch horses train in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   When he became a Dolphin, he played a round of golf with someone
who had a partial interest in a horse. Cox bought a piece of the
horse _ and it won the first race for him.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Cox owned several, calling his stable Freakman Stables. A
mutual friend introduced him to another man who owned horses:
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had known Cox for years before Jones was injured. It
was an eye-raising move, however. The volatile Cox coming to the
overscrutinized Jets? Parcells never wavered. Within a few weeks,
Cox was a starting outside linebacker in the Jets' 4-3 scheme. This
year he has moved to the inside in a shift to the 3-4.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells recently reflected on some of the top players he has
coached and mentioned the Giants' Lawrence Taylor, the Patriots'
Sam Gash _ and Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a very determined, honest player,'' Parcells
said. ``I've got a lot of respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronco fans don't have the same opinion of Cox, but despite last
January's incident Cox is cheerful about his return to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going back to the place where I got hit in the face with a
beer can,'' Cox said, adding good-naturedly: ``But the police did
such a wonderful job. They beat him up. I didn't have to take it in
my hands.''

BEATTY MIRRORING BULWORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

   LOS ANGELES -- You got presidential candidates
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Bush and Bradley
</P>
<P>
   but when they start to rappin',
</P>
<P>
   they all do it badly
</P>
<P>
   We need Beatty, Beatty as in Warren
</P>
<P>
   to make the campaign fun
</P>
<P>
   and not so borin'
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we can't rap any better that Beatty's character Bulworth
in the 1998 political satire of the same name, but if the Hollywood
superstar is serious about running for president, he may just want
to get down with it.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in Beatty's closely watched speech at the Beverly
Hilton on Wednesday, the 62-year-old actor sounded downright
presidential. For a man who has played Dick Tracy, Clyde Barrow,
John Reed, an L.A. Rams quarterback, a failed songwriter and a
hairdresser, why not the role of chief executive? (Are
entertainment and reality morphing into each other, or what?)
</P>
<P>
   If Beatty really wants to shake up the 2000 campaign _ like he
has indicated _ then he might take some lessons from his own
critically acclaimed movie, which he wrote and directed. While
``Bulworth'' failed at the box office, adding some rhythm and
shooting from the hip is what Beatty needs to do to be a hit as a
politician.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Beatty sounded ironically more like the
politicians he tries to lampoon in his movie. ``I believe in the
value of social programs,'' he told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium,''
California Sen. Jay Bulworth intones over and over in the film.
It's the opening of his campaign speech, which Beatty wrote as a
parody of every boring stump speech you've heard. (But don't be
surprised if you hear it from some politico next year.)
</P>
<P>
   And indeed Bulworth is bored by the system _ so bored he wants
to kill himself. So he hires a hitman to do it so that his daughter
_ the only person he cares about _ can get the insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   Free from the chains of running for re-election and raising
money, Bulworth finds he's free to tell people the truth as he sees
it. Suddenly he's like Howard Beal from ``Network,'' a mad prophet,
and his honesty shocks the special-interest groups who've greased
his campaign wheels. Even crazier, he takes up rapping (though he's
got no rhythm) his message that the poor, particularly minorities,
have been left out of the rest of the country's economic
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the rich is gettin' richer and richer and richer
</P>
<P>
   While the middle class is just gettin' more more
</P>
<P>
   Just makin' billions and billions and billions
</P>
<P>
   and billions and billions of bucks
</P>
<P>
   Well, my friend, if you weren't already rich at the start
</P>
<P>
   That situation sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Beatty's contention that America's problems of health
care, poverty, homelessness and the widening gulf between the rich
and the poor cannot be solved until the political system is
overhauled is central to the film. Only in ``Bulworth,'' he's much
more entertaining about it.
</P>
<P>
   In addresssing the Southern California Chapter of Americans for
Democratic Action, Beatty said: ``We don't need a third party, we
need a second party,'' and then accused Democrats of joining
Republicans in a ``slow-motion coup d'etat of big-money interests
over the public interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Daily News about the film:``The truth
is . . . the same people are pretty much funding both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Bulworth tells it like it is: ``Republicans,
Democrats _ wat's the difference? We're a club,''
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering why the Hollywood superstar _ who already
has plenty of money, fame and power _ would even hint at the idea
of running for president, the film offers another clue when a
homeless man tells Bulworth, ``You got to be a spirit; you can't be
a ghost.'' And it's clear that Beatty wants to be a ``spirit'' in
next year's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Beatty making a run for office is perfectly in
character. For decades, he has been involved in liberal politics,
from supporting the campaigns of Robert Kennedy and George McGovern
to backing the ill-fated candidacy of Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES:candidacy of Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   He is known as smart, thoughtful _ and yes, narcissistic and
charming, which would seem ideal qualities for a politician today.
And in these post-Reagan days, when publications such as George
magazine blend politics and entertainment, when we have a former
pro wrestler as governor of Minnesota and Arnold Schwarzenegger
hinting he'll run for office _ why not?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the views Bulworth expresses _ that we might assume
Beatty shares _ are a bit ironic given the actor's highly paid
movie star status. In the movie, Bulworth tells three reporters,
``Our campaigns are being financed by the same guys that pay you
guys,'' saying that big politics and big media are all part of the
same machine today. But Beatty himself has taken advantage of the
celebrity this system has afforded him.
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth Century Fox, controlled by politically conservative
billionaire Rupert Murdoch, spent more than $30 million to produce
``Bulworth,'' which was a box office flop. And what exactly made
the media hordes flock to Beatty's speech? He's a star, created and
fed by the Big Entertainment machine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some 150 reporters got in Wednesday night while more
were turned away by fire marshals. Meanwhile, real presidential
candidate Bill Bradley, who was in L.A. that afternoon, drew a
tenth of the attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience of 700-plus there were such disparate liberal
types as Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway and Hustler magazine
publisher Larry Flynt. Also in the audience: Arianna Huffington,
the Republican columnist and unlikely ``cheerleader-in-chief'' for
a Beatty candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Beatty isn't Bulworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie,'' Beatty said, ``simplifies things. But that's the
beauty of being a filmmaker. You get to be particular as in a
painting. You get to point things out; something you could never do
as a political candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Beatty best are guessing that he'll back away
from an actual run for office, settling instead for the opportunity
to influence the political debate. Beatty himself has hinted this
may be the case. But if he does run there are probably some things
we won't hear Beatty parroting from Bulworth, like his solution to
race issues. ``Everybody just got to be ... (making love) until
we're all the same color.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the top. Yes. But a rappin' Warren would make certainly
give us something to talk about next year.

same machine today. But Beatty himself has taken advantage of the
celebrity this system has afforded him.
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth Century Fox, controlled by politically conservative
billionaire Rupert Murdoch, spent more than $30 million to produce
``Bulworth,'' which was a box office flop. And what exactly made
the media hordes flock to Beatty's speech? He's a star, created and
fed by the Big Entertainment machine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some 150 reporters got in Wednesday night while more
were turned away by fire marshals. Meanwhile, real presidential
candidate Bill Bradley, who was in L.A. that afternoon, drew a
tenth of the attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience of 700-plus there were such disparate liberal
types as Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway and Hustler magazine
publisher Larry Flynt. Also in the audience: Arianna Huffington,
the Republican columnist and unlikely ``cheerleader-in-chief'' for
a Beatty candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Beatty isn't Bulworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie,'' Beatty said, ``simplifies things. But that's the
beauty of being a filmmaker. You get to be particular as in a
painting. You get to point things out; something you could never do
as a political candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Beatty best are guessing that he'll back away
from an actual run for office, settling instead for the opportunity
to influence the political debate. Beatty himself has hinted this
may be the case. But if he does run there are probably some things
we won't hear Beatty parroting from Bulworth, like his solution to
race issues. ``Everybody just got to be ... (making love) until
we're all the same color.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the top. Yes. But a rappin' Warren would make certainly
give us something to talk about next year.

L.A. MAN CELEBRATES 100TH BIRTHDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DENNIS MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- You sit down and talk to Henry Rabow on his 100th
birthday Friday, and you don't know whether to congratulate him or
console him.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he's glad to still be around, he says _
considering the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   As Henry looks around him these days, he doesn't see many faces
he recognizes anymore. All his pals and older relatives are long
gone, and it gets a little lonely not having anybody to talk to
who'd been with you back in the old days, Henry says.
</P>
<P>
   But just when you start feeling a little sorry for him, one of
the 61 women living over at the Wedgewood, an upscale retirement
home in the Tarzana community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley,
comes walking by with a wink and a birthday card.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when Henry Rabow _ one of only a handful of men
living there _ gets this smile on his face that says, OK, so maybe
I'm not all that lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, if he could do, he would do,'' says Evelyn Morton,
administrator of the Wedgewood. ``He's the most popular guy
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too bad for 100.
</P>
<P>
   Funny the things you remember when you look back over a century
of life, Henry says.
</P>
<P>
   Like the times when he and his buddies would stand on the
sidewalk in Toronto, his hometown, waiting for one of those new
contraptions called the horseless carriage to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd take off our caps and throw them in the middle of the
street so we'd get the gas fumes on the caps after the carriage
went by,'' he said. ``That was a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the time his mother _ a widow raising five children by
herself _ took him to his first day of kindergarten and sat him
down on one of the three-legged stools all the kids were sitting
on.
</P>
<P>
   He fell off and started crying, Henry said. Not because he was
hurt, but because he didn't want his mother to leave him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how she managed to raise us all by herself,'' he
says. ``I still don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knew he'd have to get a job, like his brothers, and help
out. So he did _ working in the grocery business in Toronto before
coming to New York in 1928 to learn the retail clothing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my brothers and I worked for the same company for 35
years, and we wound up buying it, but we went bankrupt in 1963,''
Henry says.
</P>
<P>
   It was pretty traumatic at the time, going belly up in business,
but when you've had 37 years to reflect on it, it becomes just
another little milestone along the way you remember on your 100th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the biggest men in this country have failed at times,
including Henry Ford,'' Henry Rabow says. So there.
</P>
<P>
   If he had his way, he'd still be living on his own _ still be
back in the home he shared with his wife, Dolly, before she died in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   They were happy together there, and even after she died, he
didn't mope around for very long, Henry says. His niece Lola Rabow
wouldn't allow it.
</P>
<P>
   She got him volunteering at the place she worked, the
Organization for the Needs of the Elderly, and before long, Henry
was one of the busiest, most popular volunteers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of years ago, his family thought it would be best
for him to move into the Wedgewood because they didn't want him to
be living alone at 98, even though his health and faculties were
good.
</P>
<P>
   So, that's where Henry is now, celebrating his 100th birthday _
only a few months shy of living in three centuries. The most
popular guy there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy Birthday, Henry,'' says another female resident of the
Wedgewood on Friday, stopping by to give Henry a birthday card and
a wink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' he says to the woman, putting the card with the
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was in the millinery business so I'm comfortable
around women,'' he says, looking around to make sure none of the
women are within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to tell you the truth, I'd rather be sitting around with a
bunch of men. Trouble is, there are none my age around anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you just don't know whether to congratulate or console
Henry Rabow on his 100th birthday.
</P>

TRANSFERRING A HOME TO CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J., N.Y.)  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawyers who specialize in estate planning say that one of the
more effective methods of passing real estate to the next
generation _ while keeping a home of one's own for as long as one
needs it and perhaps avoiding probate _ is the life estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A life estate usually works nicely,'' said Linnea Levine, a
lawyer who specializes in elder law in Purchase, N.Y., and
Stamford, Conn. ``And it usually works nicely on several levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levine explained that a life estate _ or ``life use'' in
Connecticut _ is a legal arrangement whereby title to real estate
is held by two entities, a ``life tenant,'' who has the right to
use the property for life, and a ``remainderman'' who obtains full
ownership of the property upon the death of the life tenant.
</P>
<P>
   With a life estate, she said, the life tenant can live in the
property, leave it vacant, or rent it to others, but cannot sell
the life tenancy without the consent of the remainderman. Moreover,
Ms. Levine said, the life tenant is responsible for paying the
costs of owning the property _ including mortgage payments,
property taxes, and hazard insurance premiums _ as well as for
maintaining the property by doing things like shoveling the walk
and keeping the heat on in winter so the pipes don't freeze.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, Ms. Levine said, most life estates occur
in the context of a parent or parents conveying title to a property
to a child or children while retaining a life tenancy in the
property for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, you put the property in the names of the
children before you die, but you've set things up so they can't
sell the property out from under you while you're still alive,''
Ms. Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that if a life estate is not used, and title to a
house is transferred from parents to children using the more common
form of ownership, called ``fee simple,'' it is conceivable that
the children could evict the parents from the house if there is a
falling-out between the parties at a later time.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Siev Belson, an elder-law lawyer in Stamford, said that
another advantage of using a life estate as opposed to a fee simple
transfer when putting a house in the names of one's children is
that with a life estate, the life tenant can remain in the house
for life even if creditors obtain judgments against the children.
</P>
<P>
   If the house is put in the names of the children without using a
life estate, Ms. Belson said, it is possible that a creditor who
obtained a judgment against a child who is the fee-simple owner
could force the sale of the property and the eviction of the parent
if the child did not satisfy the judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of using a life estate to transfer property to
children, Ms. Belson said, is that doing so makes it unnecessary
for the property to be transferred through probate when the last
surviving parent dies. She explained that probate is the process
whereby title to certain property of a deceased person passes to
that person's heirs or beneficiaries _ either by will or by
operation of law _ subject to court supervision.
</P>
<P>
   With a life estate, she said, title to the property is deemed to
have passed to the children while the parent was still alive,
thereby eliminating the necessity for probate _ at least with
respect to that property.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another reason for using a life estate rather than a fee
simple transfer is that with the former form of ownership, the life
tenant remains the owner for purposes of qualifying for tax
benefits available to the property owner.
</P>
<P>
   Among those benefits are property-tax exemptions and credits
that are available to certain individuals _ such as veterans and
homeowners 65 years or older who qualify for the STAR (School Tax
Relief program) tax exemption in New York by having annual incomes
of $60,000 or less. The program gives varied exemptions, depending
on location of the property, on the assessed value of a house, the
basis of reckoning taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Belson pointed out that the fact that a life estate transfer
of property is not subject to probate does not shield it from
federal gift and estate taxes. Generally speaking, she added,
roughly the same amount of taxes will ultimately be paid whether or
not a life estate is used.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, under current law, the first $650,000 of an
individual's estate _ or of gifts made during the individual's
lifetime _ is exempt from such taxes. The exemption amount
gradually increases to $1 million in 2006.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The use of a life estate, however, could result in a reduction
of capital gains taxes that may be due upon the ultimate sale of
the property.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Treacy, a Rutherford, N.J., lawyer who specializes in
estate planning, said that if a homeowner transfers title to the
property to a child without payment, the transfer is considered a
gift for tax purposes. In such a case, he said, the original
owner's tax basis _ typically the cost of the property plus amounts
spent in purchasing, selling and improving it _ becomes the tax
basis of the new owner.
</P>
<P>
   That means that when the new owner _ in this case, the child _
sells the property, the entire difference between the original tax
basis and the ultimate sale price is likely to be considered the
child's taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Treacy said, when a life estate is used, the
transfer is considered an ``incomplete gift'' for tax purposes
because the passage of title doesn't become ``complete'' until the
death of the life tenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that the child receives the same tax benefit as if
the property had passed to him or her upon the death of the last
surviving parent,'' Treacy said, explaining that in such a case,
the beneficiary receives a ``step-up'' in basis to the market value
of the property at the time of the life tenant's death.
Accordingly, he said, when the property is sold, only the
difference between the sale price and the value of the property at
the time of the life tenant's death is considered taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   Another somewhat controversial benefit of transferring property
using a life estate is that doing so makes it possible to shield
the house from creditors _ including those who are seeking payment
for medical services, nursing-home care and reimbursement for
Medicaid payments that have been provided.
</P>
<P>
   Treacy explained that under current law, it is possible for a
homeowner who has received Medicaid benefits _ or who has run up
significant medical bills or who requires nursing-home care _ to be
forced to sell a home to reimburse Medicaid or cover those other
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible _ and allowable under current law _ for such
a person to transfer a house to a child or children using a life
estate and thereby avoid the possibility of having to sell the
house, or lose it to creditors, to cover later medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you follow the rules and do everything the right
way, it's a perfectly legal estate-planning strategy,'' Treacy
said. For such a transfer to successfully survive the scrutiny of
Medicaid officials, he explained, it must have been made a
sufficient amount of time before Medicaid benefits were applied
for. As a general rule, he said, three years or more between the
date of the transfer and the application for benefits will always
be considered sufficient. Less than three years may also be
considered sufficient, depending on the individual circumstances
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of folks, the only thing they have to leave to their
children is their house,'' Treacy said. ``So for a lot of older
people, the most important issue for them is protecting their only
real asset _ their home.''

GOLF COURSES INCREASE MAINE HOME SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Maine _ Taking a cue from Southern states, developers
in Maine have begun to emphasize the availability of new golf
courses and the expansion of existing ones in their sales of new
homes to a market made up increasingly of vacationers or retirees.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen new or expanded golf courses have recently been
completed or are being built, bringing the state's total to about
130. The new or improved ones have had a major effect in increasing
housing starts, especially in vacation destinations like Belgrade
Lakes, York and Old Orchard Beach, said James Plumer, president of
Construction Data of New England, which tracks industry activity.
</P>
<P>
   These houses are typically traditional Colonials and Cape Cods,
with clapboard siding, peaked roofs and enclosed porches with wood
paneling and stone fireplaces inside. The prices vary with the
local real estate market; most houses do not abut golf links, but
sales have benefited from the development of courses nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, a secluded, picket-fence town about 20 miles north
of Augusta with 15,000 acres of waterfront property stretching
along a chain of six north-south lakes, a new year-round house near
the water costs $130,000 to $350,000. In the woods away from the
water the cost is about half as much.
</P>
<P>
   But in bustling York, 150 miles to the south on the ocean, new
waterfront estates sell for $1 million to $4 million, while houses
inland start at around $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to vacationers and out-of-state buyers have accounted for
a large part of the resales of existing housing, said Valarie
Lamont, director of the Institute for Real Estate Research at the
University of Southern Maine in Portland. Last year, 10,080
existing homes were sold statewide, a rise of about 30 percent from
a year earlier. The activity was stoked by people looking for a
resort lifestyle in which golf plays a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the buyers were out-of-staters over 45 who are moving
into houses for vacations now and retirement later,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Mainers build such homes near, but not on, the links.
However, with demand for vacation-style houses growing, houses are
going up along the fairways at a few courses, among them the
Dunegrass golf course in Old Orchard Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The activity in Belgrade Lakes, one of the three villages in the
town of Belgrade, is a leading example of the use of a golf course
as an amenity for vacationers and potential home buyers. Lake
fishing has been the main attraction that has drawn generations of
families to its whitewashed cottages and rustic lakeside cabins.
Now the new $12 million Belgrade Lakes Golf Club in the center of
town is another draw for buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Just completing its first full year of operation, the public
18-hole course sits 200 feet above a chain of crystalline ponds.
Its presence has extended the local vacation season from the
traditional three summer months to six months or more, brokers say.
</P>
<P>
   It's also helping to increase sales and raise prices, according
to Gail Rizzo, owner of DeWolfe Belgrade Lakes Region Real Estate.
Last year, when the course opened in stages, her agency sold 82
single-family vacation homes, up 33 percent from a year earlier.
Throughout Kennebec County, almost 900 existing homes were sold, a
47 percent increase from 1997, according to the Maine State Housing
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The average sale price last year for Ms. Rizzo's agency was
$155,000, up 10 percent from 1997. ``We think that having the
course here adds about 10 percent to property values,'' said Ms.
Rizzo, who has also developed 54 houses on three lakeside sites
here in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Kelly, 44, a cabinetmaker who was raised in this
region but now lives in Marblehead, Mass., last year completed
renovations on an 1,800-square-foot, year-round lakeside cabin for
family vacations. This summer he bought another cabin to convert
into a rental property. ``I did it because the golf course makes
Belgrade Lakes a more attractive place to buy and invest,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The housing investment builds on the growing popularity of golf.
Last year the Maine State Golf Association handicapped 24,000
golfers, up from 17,000 in 1994. And young people are increasingly
being drawn to the links. Last year, 1,000 people under 17 competed
in tournaments, compared with 400 four years earlier, said Nancy
DeFrancesco, director of the state golf association.
</P>
<P>
   For construction, 1998 was a record year, with 2,388 housing
starts, up from 1,959 a year earlier in Maine's busy southern
region, from Lewiston to the Massachusetts border. So far this year
there have been 1,140 starts and the average selling price is
$133,404, up from $125,544 in the first half of 1998, according to
Plumer of Construction Data.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   One of the fastest-growing southern Maine communities is York,
where two new privately owned courses opened last year, the Ledges
Golf Club and the Highland Farm Golf Club. The Ledges is open to
both members and the public, but Highland Farm is for members only.
Since development on the courses began a few years ago, the pace of
home construction doubled to about 130 houses a year, said Stephen
Burns, the town planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we're seeing people buy old cottages, tear
them down and build new dream houses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles L. McKenzie, a 41-year-old member of the Ledges, did
exactly that. This summer he paid $850,000 for a 20-year-old house
overlooking York Harbor. It was demolished by burning and in its
place will rise a 4,000-square-foot, four-bedroom house that will
be the primary residence for his family of three.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McKenzie moved to York from the Boston suburb of
Lexington, where golf opportunities are fewer and house prices are
double or triple those in York. Now, his daily commute to
Harborview Asset Management in Boston is 15 minutes longer, but he
is minutes away from three 18-hole golf courses. In his decision to
move, he said, ``I must admit, golf was a big appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   On Old Orchard Beach's Dunegrass Golf Course, about 40 minutes
farther north, Carolyn and Stephen St. Pierre, native Mainers in
their 40s, are building an 1,800-square-foot house on a half-acre
site, together valued at about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that being on the course adds 20 percent to our
property value,'' said Mrs. St. Pierre, who expects to spend
summers there and winters in Florida when she and her husband
retire.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-square-mile Town of Belgrade became a popular resort area
in the 1890s, with hotels for families from Boston and New York,
rustic two-bedroom cottages in the woods called ``camps'' and
several children's summer camps, said Robert Early, the town
manager of Belgrade. Its year-round population of 3,000 rises to
7,000 in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, its only golf course closed and the two hotels
went out of business, one because of fire. While many tourists went
elsewhere, some families kept coming back, and some were ready to
invest in a replacement golf course.
</P>
<P>
   One benefactor was Harold Alfond, the founder of Dexter Shoe
Corp., who has long summered here. Recently he bought land for a
town recreation area and invested in the new 240-acre golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is part of our campaign to bring back Belgrade
Lakes,'' said Ms. Rizzo, the developer and broker, who also
invested in the golf course, which is almost hidden on a wooded
glacial ridge off Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   The course was one lure for James and Anne Rooney, both 75. They
have a winter home in Naples, Fla., and a summer place in Cape May,
N.J., which became too crowded for them.
</P>
<P>
   They had vacationed here before and last June they paid $150,000
for a new 1,400-square-foot, three-bedroom house at Ms. Rizzo's
development called Snug Harbor, on Great Pond. The two-acre site
was once a fishing camp.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are six vacation homes on the site, built in a
semicircle facing the pond. But though the houses are close, the
setting is serene enough to induce Rooney to rent out his Cape May
cottage in the summer and come to Belgrade, where golf has been one
of the attractions for him. ``The course has spectacular views, so
you can really appreciate it, even if you don't play that well,''
he said.

COMMENTARY: STORM TEACHES COMMUNITY ABOUT INVISIBLE RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOUND BROOK, N.J. _ On the day after Floyd stormed by, the Rev.
Lou Kilgore woke early and experienced a kind of secular epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the sky was churning with the thrum of Coast Guard
helicopters stabbing their spotlights through the predawn gloom at
hundreds of people who were clinging to rooftops as the Raritan
River ran 14 feet deep down Main Street. And Kilgore, the pastor of
Bound Brook Presbyterian Church, suddenly had a thought: ``The
invisible have become visible.''
</P>
<P>
   On the rooftops was the bulk of the Hispanic immigrant
community, most of them Costa Rican and most of them in the country
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The last census does not even mention Costa Ricans in Bound
Brook, but as the suburbanization of immigration, both legal and
covert, continues, it has brought this community of strangers into
the heart of Somerset County, one of New Jersey's most prosperous.
Into the cheap housing down where the river overruns its banks.
</P>
<P>
   And for a few days after the flood, Kilgore held out the hope
that the light that the flood shone on Bound Brook's immigrant
community would help the wider community see and meet and help
their Central American neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Local churches quickly began hustling the flood victims into
members' houses and onto mats laid in fellowship halls and Sunday
school classrooms. More than 700 camped on exercise mats in the
high school gym, and a network of volunteer cooks was set up to
provide meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped that while the white-hot spotlight from the federal
emergency people and the Red Cross and the news media was on them
that we as a community would get to know who these people are,''
Kilgore said. ``We wanted to make sure the lights were not just
shining on a flood, but on the shortage of affordable housing and
access to medical care and social services after the water's gone
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the flood is two weeks past and Kilgore has discovered
that the forces that kept the Costa Ricans invisible in good times
are conspiring to keep them invisible in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Many used false names to get jobs, so emergency relief workers
cannot check employment records, a necessary step in assigning
benefits. Church groups that help disaster victims rebuild will not
work on rental properties, and most of the immigrants are renters.
Registering with the Red Cross means revealing an identity that
many would just as soon keep hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Steadily, even stealthily, the flood victims have drifted away
from the shelters into a new invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are human beings, they live here, but their status as
illegal immigrants means that in the broad sense they are not
recognized and identified as our neighbors,'' Kilgore said. ``And
now that their homes are ruined, it means they are going to remain
invisible, because their losses are not going to be listed in the
federal emergency assessments, and when the Red Cross goes through,
well, quite frankly, most of this population is afraid of any
agency that works with the government, and they will make
themselves invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in the flood plain, where Main Street becomes Vosseller
Street, Elias Manguel and his wife, Melody, were stepping around
the piles of soaked and stinking carpet to measure the damage to
the apartments they own over a small grocery store. Part of their
flood losses, they concede, will be that many of their tenants have
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two young guys in back _ what was their name? Was
one of them Eric?'' Mrs. Manguel asked her husband. ``Anyway, they
said they would come back if they could be on the second floor. But
the young couple on the ground floor, they were just married, they
were both working two jobs, they're not coming back, and the others
_ I don't know.'' Manguel stopped for a moment. ``I think all this
has scared them away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Talmage Street a woman sat in the back of a muddy Toyota,
trying to dress a little girl. She said her name was Miriam, just
Miriam, and that she cleaned houses.
</P>
<P>
   Where was she living now? ``With a friend,'' she said in heavily
accented English. How long could she stay? ``I don't know,'' she
said, not liking the questions. Where would she go? ``I don't
know,'' she said. ``Someplace, you know?''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Oct. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Although former Speaker Newt Gingrich has left the House of
Representatives, a nasty private lawsuit involving two members of
Congress, and arising out of the House ethics investigation of
Gingrich, churns on.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court panel, by a 2-1 vote, recently decided
to revive a suit filed by Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, against Rep.
Jim McDermott, D-Wash., under the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act. The panel's ruling poses a serious threat to press freedoms,
and if upheld could make it harder for anyone to bring to light
truthful information of public importance.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy act bars the interception of cellular calls, and
prohibits anyone from intentionally disclosing the contents of
intercepted calls.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, a Florida couple, John and Alice Martin,
illegally taped the contents of a cellular phone conversation in
which Gingrich, Boehner and other Republican leaders were heard
discussing matters related to Gingrich's ethics case. The Martins
gave their tape to McDermott, who passed it on to the House ethics
committee. News organizations, including The New York Times, also
published transcripts. McDermott has not said how the press
obtained the tape.
</P>
<P>
   The Martins were prosecuted under the federal statute and fined
$500 each. Boehner sued McDermott under the same law for $10,000
and punitive damages. A U.S. district judge dismissed the case on
grounds that the statute violated McDermott's free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott was not a party to the taping, and did not acquire the
tape illegally. Prior Supreme Court rulings have established the
clear principle that government may not punish the disclosure of
truthful, lawfully obtained information of public significance
absent a showing of a state interest of the highest order.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court fails to follow those principles. The
implications for press freedoms are grave. As Judge David Sentelle
argued in dissent, if McDermott can be punished for disclosing
information based on how his source obtained that information, then
the news media that published the information could well be found
liable too.
</P>
<P>
   This lawsuit began as a grudge match between two bitter
political opponents. But if allowed to go forward, it may restrict
the right of the press to publish truthful information even about
official wrongdoing.

HOLLYWOOD GOES GLOBAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``Bond. James Bond.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase voted the single-most memorable movie line will again
greet moviegoers this winter when the 19th Bond movie _ ``The World
Is Not Enough'' _ opens in November. It will also greet moviegoers
across the globe, albeit slightly differently: ``Mi nombre es Bond.
James Bond.''
</P>
<P>
   What's at stake is not just Bond saving the world once more
despite deadly explosions, fast cars and women with names like
Christmas Jones. The larger battle is much more significant:
Hollywood's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Because as the Bond franchise proves more than any other set of
movies, Hollywood's livelihood increasingly depends on selling
films not so much in Burbank but in Bolivia and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Hollywood, studios continue to benefit from
being reliable suppliers of entertainment that can be understood
anywhere on the planet. The clearest example came last year when
``Titanic'' grossed a record-setting $600 million domestically and
then took in a stunning $1.23 billion overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, foreign customers last year accounted for better than
three of every five dollars of total worldwide grosses. That's an
astounding reversal from only a decade ago when the rule-of-thumb
was the United States generated 60 percent of total box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign film executives feel their audiences now consider
American movies as accessible as native films,'' said Robert
Marich, senior editor with industry tracker Baskerville
Communications. ``They've become used to seeing Tom Hanks and
Venice Beach and hearing our idioms. And between the Internet and
TV, we're seeing more overseas business keyed off American hype and
publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend, quite simply, is that the rest of the world is
starting to copy the United States in both culture and in how it
shows movies. Analysts believe the drive to build new multiscreen
theaters _ showing mostly American movies _ will accelerate into
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Baskerville Communications' 1998 survey estimated global box
office would grow 34 percent by 2007 from $18 billion to $24.2
billion by the year 2007. The U.S. market share will fall from 39.2
percent ($7.06 billion) to 36.4 percent ($8.74 billion); Europe's
share will rise to 29.5 percent from 25.1 percent and Latin
America's market will increase to 7.2 percent from 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bond can thank that foreign audience for his very existence.
Without the foreign market, owner Kirk Kerkorian would have
undoubtedly pulled the plug on Santa Monica-based
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer years ago. Only two Bond films have topped $100
million domestically; nine have crossed that milestone
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``What male on Earth wouldn't want to be a dashing, debonair
secret agent, even if you're living in Calcutta?'' asked
entertainment analyst Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners.
``Bond has a very basic appeal that cuts across all geographic
groups that every male can identify with. And it's very engaging
for women _ the romantic notion that her path would cross with
James Bond's.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after a six-year absence, MGM revived the Bond
franchise with ``GoldenEye'' and grossed an acceptable $106.6
million domestically. The foreign gross, however, was more than
double that at $244.3 million and ranks as the 23rd highest ever.
Just to show it was no fluke, two years later, ``Tomorrow Never
Dies'' grossed $125 million domestically and $211 million overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bond is the quintessential Englishman, ownership of
the right to make and distribute Bond movies resides in Santa
Monica. Bond's value is such that MGM sued Sony Corp. over plans to
start up its own series and reached a favorable settlement earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt ``The World Is Not Enough,'' which has an
estimated $110 million price tag, will succeed. Key elements
include the trademark explosions, fast cars, femme fatales and
gadgets; Pierce Brosnan, star of the last two films; and an opening
sequence that is, at $5 million, the most costly ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a further reflection of the power of foreign markets, the
19th Bond movie will open in many key markets within a few weeks of
the Nov. 19 U.S. opening, rather than three or four months later,
which used to be the norm. UIP, a joint venture which handles MGM,
Paramount and Universal films overseas, will open it six days later
in Australia, followed by the United Kingdom on Nov. 26, France on
Dec. 1 and Spain on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the quicker roll-outs have to do with the world
becoming more homogeneous,'' said Phil Garfinkle, an analyst with
ACNielsen EDI. ``When something does well at the box office here,
everyone in the rest of the world knows about it instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has relied on its so-called ancillary markets _
foreign, TV, video and merchandising _ for decades but their
importance has been growing significantly in recent years as costs
escalate, analyst Chris Lanier of the Motion Picture Intelligencer
noted. ``If the studios had to survive on U.S. rentals alone, the
average movie would have lost over $40 million,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: over $40 million,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To put it bluntly, the customers in Cordoba, Spain, count as
much those in Chatsworth. Major theater chains, facing cut-throat
competition domestically as megaplexes gain popularity, have
started shifting their construction focus toward less-crowded
overseas markets and those customers have responded, Garfinkle
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as in the United States, when you give people a better
place to go see movies, you see significant gains particularly in
markets that have been stagnant with older theaters,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Marich said many foreign markets are a long way from being built
out. ``The upgrading of the international infrastructure is going
to continue with modern-style megaplexes replacing older large
single-screen inner-city theaters with no parking that were built
in the 1920s and 1930s,'' he added. ``We're about halfway through a
30-year process of rebuilding overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious beneficiaries are the action-adventures that don't
need a lot of translation. Even though neither is anywhere near the
end of its foreign run, ``Star Wars: Episode 1'' has already
grossed $351 million overseas, ``The Mummy'' has topped $221
million and ``The Matrix'' is well over $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the slam-bangers that travel beyond American
borders. If a comedy or drama succeeds in America, it's a
springboard for success overseas such as ``Notting Hill'' ($184
million), ``There's Something About Mary'' ($183 million overseas),
``Dr. Dolittle'' ($146 million), ``You've Got Mail'' ($128 million)
and ``City of Angels'' ($105 million).
</P>
<P>
   ``Taste has been shifting in foreign markets, where it used to
be only action films,'' Garfinkle said. ``Now, everything from the
United States has a chance. And comedy, in particular, travels much
better than it used to.''
</P>
<P>
   That trend is fueling optimism over MGM's offbeat
religious-horror film ``Stigmata.'' It's expected to top $50
million domestically, and will probably hit $100 million overseas
after going into foreign release in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys at UIP have been very hot for `Stigmata' since Day
One,'' said director Rupert Wainwright. ``The old perception is
that the international marketplace is full of strange people who
only like car crashes. But the truth is that there's a very
enthusiastic market for thought-provoking films. The reception so
far indicates that the market is primed for it, particularly
Catholic countries.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the growing influence of foreign markets,
Wainwright decided to tweak the Brazilian release by changing the
references of the prologue's events from Brazil to Mexico, where
the scenes were actually shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil's a huge marketplace so we want to respect that and not
have them feel insulted by an element in the film that they might
know isn't from Brazil,'' he explained. ``The point is that, these
days, people care very much about what goes on in each individual
market. In the old days, it might have been more like, What the
hell, why bother changing it if it's only Brazil.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen has now ordered a ``complete and
thorough review'' of fresh allegations that U.S. soldiers
machine-gunned hundreds of helpless South Korean civilians under a
railroad bridge nearly 50 years ago during the first desperate
weeks of the Korean War. A description of the massacre, complete
with eyewitness reports from retired U.S. servicemen, appeared in a
startling report by The Associated Press that landed on the front
pages of many newspapers Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has two important obligations. One, of course, is
to get to the bottom of what actually happened. The other is to
find out why the U.S. and South Korean governments have never made
a serious effort to investigate the matter, despite repeated pleas
from South Koreans who describe themselves as survivors of the
massacre and who have asked for compensation. Time and again, these
survivors have been rebuffed by their own government and by the
Pentagon, which as recently as last March asserted that there was
no information in military archives to substantiate their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen now concedes that the Pentagon failed to give these claims
proper attention. Unlike the AP, Army investigators made no effort
to locate and interview former GIs who were at or near the scene.
The investigators limited themselves to Army records at the
National Archives in Maryland, but even there they appear to have
done a miserable job. Though there is no single document describing
a massacre, the AP found copies of orders authorizing U.S.
commanders to fire on South Korean civilians, as well as other
clues pointing to the possibility of a massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Though their stories differ on certain details, the GIs
interviewed by the AP corroborate, in most respects, the narrative
provided over the years by the South Korean survivors. According to
this narrative, the trouble began when U.S. soldiers, anticipating
a North Korean attack, ordered hundreds of villagers to leave their
homes. At some later point, while they were resting in a clearing,
the villagers were strafed by U.S. planes _ whether deliberately or
accidentally is not clear _ and took refuge in culverts under a
railroad bridge near the village of No Gun Ri. There they were
mowed down by U.S. machine gunners over a three-day period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wholesale slaughter,'' a former rifleman, Herman
Patterson, told the AP. ``We just annihilated them,'' recalled
Norman Tinkler, a former machine gunner. Another American veteran,
Eugene Hesselman, remembered his commanding officer as saying:
``The hell with all those people. Let's get rid of all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the veterans gave the same justification. U.S.
soldiers, they said, had been instructed from the beginning of
America's involvement to regard all South Korean civilians with
suspicion. The fear was that North Korean troops would try to
penetrate American lines disguised as refugees. Indeed, according
to one document unearthed by the AP, the American troops had been
told shortly before the firing erupted that ``no _ repeat no _
refugees will be permitted to cross battle lines at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   A full inquiry will take time and money, but it is vital to see
whether an injustice has been done and whether its victims are due
reparations or compensation of some kind. With relatively limited
resources, the AP has been able to raise some important questions.
With its much greater resources, the Pentagon ought to be able to
answer them.

   (NYT14) NEW YORK -- Oct. 2, 1999 -- NY-MUSEUM-OPENING-3, 10-2 --
Protesters at the Brooklyn Museum of Art object to a painting of
``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' which was created by Chris Ofili, a
British artist of Nigerian descent, using elephant dung. The
painting is part of an exhibit entitled ``Sensation'' which opened
Saturday. Although some art experts say the painting actually
venerates the Virgin Mary, noting that dung is a symbol of growth
in the African culture, many Catholics view it as blasphemous.

with his wife and two grown sons in Swanton, figures that changes
in the milk pricing system could cost him $16,000 to $18,000 a

are at stake, the issue has provoked a civil war between lawmakers
from the East and those from the Midwest. ``When I started farming
here 17 years ago, there were seven farms on my road. Now there are
only two left. This could make the difference to lots of people up

CARDINALS DID COWBOYS A FAVOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All that silly talk about revenge _ it was heard everywhere last
week at Valley Ranch. The playoff embarrassment of nine months ago
hit home again because Arizona returns today to Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't count owner Jerry Jones among the still angry.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was steaming last January after a feeble performance by
the Cowboys in a 20-7 loss to the Cardinals. ``But all my heat was
aimed at myself,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a useless exercise of getting mad and then plotting
to get even, ``I was thinking about us getting better as a team,''
said Jones. ``I blamed myself that day for having allowed things to
slide at certain positions, creating deficiencies that eventually
caught up with us. I vowed then it wouldn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality now says it was a local blessing when Arizona beat up on
a Cowboys team that was supposed to win that particular game. But
what if the Cowboys had won, then gone to Atlanta in the second
round of the playoffs, only to be ousted by a better club?
</P>
<P>
   Would receiver Rocket Ismail be on the field today? Would center
Mark Stepnoski? Without the humiliation dealt by the Cardinals,
would the free-agency urgency from Jones have been the same in the
off-season?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, answered Jones. But what Arizona did was remove the
``maybe.'' It became a Jerry crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of that loss being a personal kick in the butt for
Jones, it was more like a swift shove from behind. That meant he
was moving forward, and as it turned out, moving in the direction
of, say, Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   It is far too early to get carried away about Rocketman, one
reason being Ismail's seven-year NFL resume, which has B-U-S-T
stamped all over it. But ...
</P>
<P>
   Based on the limited exposure of two games, that B-U-S-T can
also be viewed another way. As in, here's a speedball who is on the
verge of becoming a bust-out kind of talent.
</P>
<P>
   Think hard. When was the last time the Cowboys owned such a
potential game-breaker? Do you have to go all the way-way-way back
to Bullet Bob?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are ecstatic over the return of Stepnoski and how he
has provided an anchor for the offensive line. But that's no
surprise. That was expected.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail, however, was considered an iffy acquisition by a
majority of NFL talent scouts. There was no long line to bid for
his free-agency services, certainly not for what Jones eventually
paid _ $21 million over seven years with a $5 million bonus. Ismail
became, by far, the Cowboys' highest paid receiver ever. Only
Carolina, where Rocket played last season, challenged the Cowboys
for his services.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the Arizona game nine months ago. ``I walked off the
field that day thinking first about what we had to do at center,''
said Jones. ``It was obvious we had to zero in on getting back
Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   But the second free-agency priority became a speed receiver, and
Ismail was coming off a better-than-expected season for a bad
Carolina club.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cardinals winning the playoff game in Irving was
certainly an upset, it wasn't exactly a shock. The Cowboys' offense
had slumped badly throughout December. Top receiver Ernie Mills had
been lost in November due to injury. Tight end David LaFleur went
down in early December, eliminating another air-game option.
</P>
<P>
   The offense lined up against Arizona with a struggling Michael
Irvin, who later admitted he didn't even know the playbook, plus
Billy Davis, Patrick Jeffers and Jeff Ogden. Davis would be
released after the season, and Jeffers signed with Carolina as a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting back Mills and LaFleur for this season was going to
help,'' said Jones. ``But we also needed that additional weapon.
The speed weapon. Our homework on Rocket became as intense as any
we've ever done around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones heard first from the club's longtime film-graders, Bill
Hitt and Jim Dodson, both former high school head coaches in the
area. Those two recommended Ismail based on film study. So did
Larry Lacewell and the pro personnel department. Jones also had
former NFL receiving great Paul Warfield study the Rocket.
Warfield, who is a paid adviser for Jones, gave the thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   ``From there, it was a matter of Chan liking Ismail,'' said
Jones. ``And he did. Very much so. Then it became the same as
college recruiting, but, fortunately, Rocket liked the idea of
playing here as much as we liked the idea of him being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's defensive secondary will hardly recognize the
receivers it faces today, when compared with January. And the
Cardinals have only themselves to blame for making the Cowboys much
better.

   (NYT13) SWANTON, Vt.. -- Oct. 2, 1999 -- CONGRESS-MILK-FEUD,
10-2 -- Paul Bourbeau, 40, who has about 300 cows on a farm he runs
with his wife and two grown sons in Swanton, figures that changes
in the milk pricing system could cost him $16,000 to $18,000 a
year. With the livelihoods of tens of thousands of dairy farmers
are at stake, the issue has provoked a civil war between lawmakers
from the East and those from the Midwest. ``When I started farming
here 17 years ago, there were seven farms on my road. Now there are
only two left. This could make the difference to lots of people up
here whether they stay in business,'' says Bourbeau. (Paul O.

Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah concedes that his candidacy for the
Republican nomination is a long shot, but says his plan is to pick
up the pieces if Gov. George W. Bush of Texas falters in his bid
for the Presidency. Hatch has raised barely $1 million, less than 2
percent of the $56 million collected by the front-runner, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. ``Let's face it,'' he says, ``most people
don't even know I'm in the race. I found that some of my closest
friends in California didn't know it.'' (Stephen Crowley/New York

MICHIGAN SNAPS PURDUE'S STREAK AND ITS SPIRIT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ It was the final indignity Drew Brees
suffered on an afternoon brimming with them: an interception early
in the fourth quarter. Brees, the Purdue quarterback, had already
been sacked twice, hurried and buried in the wet sod another
half-dozen times, and his receivers were frightened into dropping
10 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Brees shuffled nervously in the pocket and popped the ball to
the left side of the field, where Michigan linebacker Larry Foote
easily stepped in front of it and caught it at the Wolverine's 22.
</P>
<P>
   Brees was not back on the sideline long when his counterpart,
Tom Brady, made the Boilermakers pay once more for sloppy play.
Brady, a senior co-captain, rifled a bomb 44 yards in the air that
Marcus Knight corralled and took 10 more yards to the 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Wolverines were confident enough to let a
third-string fullback have some fun. And B.J. Askew did, pinballing
into the end zone to give No. 4 Michigan a 35-12 lead en route to a
38-12 victory over an outclassed and humbled Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second week in a row, haughty talk about a Heisman
Trophy was shoved down the hopeful's throat by a savage Michigan
defense.
</P>
<P>
   From the first series, the Wolverines punished the Boilermakers
with hard, clean hits that were met with empathetic winces from the
111,468 at Michigan Stadium. They could feel the Boilermakers'
pain.
</P>
<P>
   But not as much as Brees, who finished 20 of 49 passing for 293
yards and one touchdown to go with the interception. He was
thoroughly outplayed by Brady, who was 15 of 25 for 250 yards and
two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Boilermakers briefly demonstrated that
the Wolverines had not totally kicked the life out of them. On
Michigan's 34-yard line, facing second down-and-eight, Brees
dropped back, moved left and uncorked a bomb down the left sideline
that Vinny Sutherland, behind cornerback James Whitley, raced under
down the sideline for a 66-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   When Michigan was penalized for offsides on Travis Dorsch's
extra point, coach Joe Tiller decided to take the point off the
board and attempt a 2-point conversion to narrow the score to
21-14. But once more Brees' receivers failed him. His pass to an
open Randall Lane in the end zone bounced off the wide out's
stomach and left the score at 21-12.
</P>
<P>
   Brady and Anthony Thomas (23 carries for 116 yards) answered the
threat again. This time on a 10-play, 75-yard drive that was capped
by Thomas' second touchdown of the day, a 5-yard squirt through the
middle to put the Wolverines ahead, 28-12. A 24-yard Jeff Del Verne
field goal with less than five minutes left gave the Wolverines
their final margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 11 Boilermakers came to Michigan Stadium ready to topple
all sorts of history in their football program. A victory over
Michigan would mean Purdue would have matched an 11-game winning
streak set from 1928 to 1930. It would mean a 5-0 record for the
first time since 1945. It would mean a spot in the top 10 of the
Associated Press poll for the first time since finishing No. 10 at
the end of the 1979 season.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, beating Michigan would serve notice that the
Boilermakers were Big Ten title contenders not to be taken lightly
by such upcoming opponents as No. 12 Ohio State, No. 14 Michigan
State and No. 2 Penn State. It was clear early, however, that
Purdue's ancient history would stay intact and that in its coming
big games the team must settle for being a spoiler rather than a
champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines ran up a 21-6 first-half lead, showing they were
a better and more efficient passing team than Purdue. Michigan did
not need Tiller's spread offense; it just needed a modest running
game to set up some play-action passing. The Wolverines didn't need
the gaudy numbers of Brees, a Heisman hopeful; they just needed a
pair of quarterbacks _ Brady and Drew Henson _ who took what was
given to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers started well enough when, on the second play of
the game, tackle Matt Mitrione stripped Thomas of the ball and
Purdue's Adrian Beasley recovered it at the Michigan 36-yard line.
Brees quickly moved the Boilermakers to the 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wolverines' secondary _ which began the day allowing 168
yards a game passing _ valiantly thwarted three of Brees' attempts
to get into the end zone. First, DeWayne Patmon got to the ball
before tight end Tim Stratton. Then, Brandon Williams smothered
Chris Daniels on a corner route. Finally, cornerback Todd Howard
nailed Daniels, separating him from the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers settled for a 28-yard field goal from Travish
Dorsch and a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-hitting stand set just the right tone of intimidation.
Three more times the Boilermakers were deep in Michigan's
territory, but could not make it into the end zone during the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   On first-and-10 at the 16-yard line, Brees mishandled a low snap
in the shotgun formation that Michigan's James Hall recovered on
the 31. On another drive, to the Wolverines' 24, Dorsch missed a
42-yard field goal. Finally, with 1 minute 5 seconds left in the
half, Michigan's Thomas fumbled again and Purdue linebacker Mike
Rose snapped it up at Michigan's 16-yard line. But a penalty and
more tough play from the Wolverine secondary stranded the
Boilermakers there for a 31-yard field goal by Dorsch.
</P>
<P>
   That concluded an awful half statistically for Brees: 11 of 27
passing for 131 yards.

ANOTHER PROTEST IS HELD IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Serbian police in riot gear blocked a
march of anti-regime demonstrators on Saturday evening, but both
sides avoided confrontation and the protesters returned to the
central Belgrade square from which they started.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 people showed up _ a disappointing turnout for a
Saturday night _ for a walk intended to reach a city hospital where
some of the wounded remain from police baton charges Wednesday and
Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The police were determined to keep the marchers in the central
city, where they have a permit to rally. However, the police did
not charge the demonstrators but walked slowly toward them, and
they retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic insisted that the retreat
was a victory. He said in an interview that the idea was to force
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``to show the violent face of
the regime,'' but at the same time ``to avoid violence if we can.''
</P>
<P>
   In another variant of the opposition's changing strategies,
Djindjic said that these rallies would continue until mid-October,
``and after that, maybe we can organize a large final rally and
maybe after that ask for early elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The stated position of the Alliance for Change is that no fair
elections are possible with Milosevic still in power. But on
Saturday again, Djindjic appeared to be moving closer to his rival,
Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement, who has scorned the
past 12 days of rallies and called instead for early elections to
undermine and then oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   State-controlled media continued to scorn the rallies as
unsuccessful and their organizers as dupes of NATO. The official
newspaper Politika, ominously perhaps, contained a large section
explaining the details of the legal requirements for holding
rallies and marches. Besides outright police violence or arrests,
Milosevic's government has often used selective application of
Serbia's communist-style laws to curb opposition efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics enhance the fear that many Serbs have of losing
their jobs or forfeiting other benefits if they join opposition
groups, or marches.
</P>
<P>
   The police have been using such requirements to justify their
use of force to block demonstrations from moving outside the
central Belgrade Square of the Republic where the rallies begin and
end.
</P>
<P>
   The police have used harsh tactics, clubbing unarmed protesters
to drive them back. But the Interior Ministry accused demonstrators
of provoking police ``performing their regular duties of directing
traffic and monitoring public law and order.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A police investigation into the ``perpetrators and ringleaders''
of Wednesday's violence continues, and Djindjic said the government
would have to develop its own strategy and decide whether to seek
the arrest of himself and other opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in another ominous note, the Serbian Radical Party of
ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj, the Serbian deputy prime
minister, issued a statement that was read on state television,
accusing ``hooligans'' of the Alliance for Change of setting fire
to the Radical Party headquarters in the Belgrade suburb of Zemun.
</P>
<P>
   The party said that if such an incident happened ``just one more
time,'' then the Alliance for Change would find that it no longer
had any offices of its own anywhere in Serbia.

 &HT;    India enacts dry days for voting
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India _ A sign outside the Chowringhee Bar of the posh
Grand Hotel turns disappointed customers away: ``Dry Days, Oct.
1-3. We regret the inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. Friday, alcohol stopped flowing all over Calcutta and
in every other Indian city, town or village participating in
today's balloting, the last of a five-phase election process that
began Sept. 5. The temporary prohibition is designed to keep voters
sober and guard against any unnecessary raucousness.
</P>
<P>
   But elections in India often erupt in violence, and this year is
no exception. So far, more than 55 people have been killed in
election-related violence. There also has been evidence of ballot
box stuffing and rigging in earlier phases of the five-stage
general election. The independent Election Commission has had to
order hundreds of ballot centers to repeat earlier votes.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing more violence and corruption in the last phase of
India's elections, authorities have ordered police to shoot on
sight anyone who attempts to disrupt the polls, the Times of India
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the tranquillity of the Grand Hotel, flag-draped
three-wheelers equipped with megaphones blast deafening campaign
slogans as they parade through Calcutta streets, often disrupting
the already chaotic traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even God doesn't buy the argument that Sonia Gandhi is a
videshi (foreigner),'' blares a Congress Party slogan, referring to
the Italian-born widow of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and
the party's candidate for prime minister. Gandhi's dual citizenship
and heavily accented Hindi have been made a major campaign issue by
the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Hindu nationalist BJP's election campaign has
failed to address the country's most pressing issues of poverty and
economic reform. Instead, it has focused on whether the
foreign-born Gandhi has the right to take up India's highest office
and also on the war this summer in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The mudslinging between political parties comes to an end 24
hours before the polling begins.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of privately owned buses and minibuses lined
Calcutta's streets and will carry personnel and material to and
from polling stations across the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Saurav Ain, 43, who has been a presiding elections officer since
1980, has an important job in a country where millions of voters
cast ballots by placing a rubber stamp on a paper ballot carrying
symbols of the different parties: a lotus, a cow, hammer and
sickle. Several districts experimented this year with a handful of
electronic push-button voting machines, but most Indians _
illiterate and unused to gadgets _ will exercise their most
fundamental right the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Automation will eliminate mistakes that often occur in manual
voting,'' Ain said. ``In the manual system, voters may stamp the
ballot paper in the wrong place or fold it incorrectly. Automation
will eliminate such errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the benefit of voting machines, polling officers mark
the index finger of the voter's left hand with indelible ink to
avoid duplicate voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless someone tries to chemically remove it immediately after
application, it usually stays for two to three days,'' Ain said.

CHECHEN LEADERS VOW TO RESIST RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ Chechnya's president vowed on Saturday to
repulse a Russian invasion that he said had already been launched,
saying the fighting forces of his republic were united and far
stronger than in the two-year war that ended in 1996 and dealt a
humiliating blow to Russia's once-proud army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has begun,'' Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov declared
to foreign journalists. Dressed in camouflage fatigues, he called
for international pressure to end what he said was daily Russian
bombing of villages and towns throughout his breakaway republic,
and pleaded for just 30 minutes alone with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to avert full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have pounded civilian areas for a month, hitting
some 40 villages, three hospitals, factories and bridges, Maskhadov
said. ``They are blocking humanitarian aid, they have cut the
electricity and gas supplies, and every minute continue rocket
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces had moved into two villages just inside
Chechnya's northern border Friday but were quickly repulsed by
Chechen forces, he said. Chechen commanders reported that they had
destroyed two tanks in fighting overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, in an open radio conversation with
Maskhadov's headquarters, a field commander reported that Russian
forces were continuing to shell their positions, making it
impossible to estimate casualties. ``But there are wounded, we know
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny, a city still in ruins from the 1994-96 war, was quiet
Saturday, with civilians leaving, joining thousands who have
already fled.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov ordered a full mobilization of Chechen fighters after
fighting broke out in neighboring Dagestan last month, and Russian
forces engaged Chechens for the first time since the end of the war
in 1996. He said Saturday that his forces stood at five times their
previous strength and did not lack weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Militarily speaking, we are stronger than before,'' he said.
``More men want to fight. They have experience, a fighting spirit,
and the last war showed people what would happen if Russian troops
come into our land and people get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Chechen fighters were also solidly behind their
president, accepting his orders, after commanders and community
leaders met Saturday and agreed to set aside any differences.
</P>
<P>
   Even the renegade field commander Shamil Basayev, who led the
Chechen incursion into Dagestan last month against Maskhadov's
wishes, and so sparked Russia's sharp retaliation, would fight
under him, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that any Chechens, including Basayev and his comrade
in arms, the Arab fighter known as Khattab, were involved in the
bomb blasts that rocked Moscow and other Russian towns and killed
some 300 people last month.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb blasts he blamed on Russian secret services who he said
were playing a dark and sinister game to retain power in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than wait for Russian troops to storm Grozny, as happened
in 1994, he said the Chechen leadership had decided to resist at
the borders. ``If they break through,'' he said of the Russian
forces, ``which I do not rule out, and reach the city, then we will
fight in the city; if in the woods, then the woods; if in the
mountains, then the mountains.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His speech echoed the style of the late president Dzhokhar
Dudayev, the former Soviet general who was killed in 1996 during
the last war. Dudayev had frequently insisted that he could have
averted the war in 1994 if he had just had 30 minutes together with
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was heading for trouble if it tried to annex a northern
part of Chechnya and install a loyal puppet government, he said.
That policy would spark a conflagration across the North Caucasus,
where the polices of Soviet leaders left many outstanding
territorial claims cutting through ethnic communities in
neighboring Ingushetia and Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia tried to annex northern Chechnya as far as the Terek
river, once the Russian frontier, then Chechnya had the right to
reclaim land from Dagestan that was once part of a greater
Chechnya, he said.

U.S. TEAM OFF TO ROUGH START IN RUGBY WORLD CUP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ ``You're going to get hammered,'' said an
elderly Irish gentleman standing outside Lansdowne Road stadium
with a ticket in his hand and an impish look on his weathered face.
``You know that don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   If the subject had been football, or basketball, or even the
once-exotic sport of soccer, it would have been difficult for an
American visitor to agree with this confident Dubliner. But this
was a rugby match the Americans were about to play against the
Irish: a World Cup rugby match, to be precise, which made it all
the more meaningful to the home team and all the more potentially
painful for a team whose country does not often get to play the
role of underdog internationally.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans most decidedly were underdogs as the opening
round of the World Cup got under way Friday and Saturday in Great
Britain, France and Ireland. There are 20 teams in this five-week
competition, a quadrennial event that was first contested in 1987.
And according to Rugby World, one of the leading publications that
covers the sport, the Americans had the least chance of winning of
any team: 2,500 to 1. Those odds put them slightly below Uruguay
and Namibia in a pecking order that was topped by New Zealand and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're expecting to kill us, and they're probably right,''
said Jimmy Whited, a 30-year-old from Dallas with an American flag
tied round his waist and a tartan cap with red wig atop his head.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no surprises on the field, as the Irish won
convincingly and predictably, 53-8, in the opening match in Group
E. The Irish, one of the five perennial powers in European rugby,
scored seven tries to the Americans' one; they dominated play in
the scrums and line-outs that are so critical to rugby success, and
they handled the ball with a great deal more assurance than their
skittish, occasionally frantic opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it could have been worse, as it was last month at
Twickenham in London, when in an international test match the
Americans were beaten by the English, 106-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of places you can go to get your confidence
inflated,'' said the American coach, Jack Clark. ``But the fact is,
if you want to be international rugby players, you need every
experience you can get, including some that are bad. England was an
embarrassing experience. Tonight was not.''
</P>
<P>
   What made it a big improvement for Clark was the constant effort
his overmatched team demonstrated against a team that is, along
with Australia, is one of the two favorites to advance to the
quarterfinals from this four-team group that also includes Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get into one of those David and Goliath things and
decide that effort is a variable, and then it can really get away
from you,'' he said. ``And I can remember a night in Twickenham
when that happened, but tonight it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish led, 3-0, after three minutes and by 10-0 after seven
minutes and would probably have built on that lead in a hurry if
not for a very unexpected bounce. Irish fullback Conor O'Shea was
running hard with the ball near midfield when he was sandwiched by
two American players. The ball popped loose, straight into the
hands of an American, scrum half Kevin Dalzell, who scooted left
around the surprised Irish for the lone American try of this chilly
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Fly half Mark Williams then missed the conversion, but it would
not stay 10-5 for long. The Irish would lead by 24-8 by halftime
and by 31-8 after the first three minutes of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the Americans are in the World Cup again. After
competing in 1991, they failed to qualify for the emotional and
symbolic competition in 1995 won by the South Africans in South
Africa. Much has changed in the Americans' absence. Rugby union _
the 15-man version of rugby played in the World Cup _ is now
professional throughout much of Europe and in the Southern
Hemisphere. As a result, the standard of training and play
worldwide is rising, and the beer consumption of the teams is
dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of the 15 Americans who started Saturday night play
professionally, including the captain, Dan Lyle, who is a star in
the English premier league. The others are amateurs who juggle
rugby and part-time or full-time jobs as mortgage brokers or
software salesmen or graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the game went open, it's hard for U.S amateur rugby to
stay in touch,'' Clark said. ``It won't get easier in the short
term, but in the long term we think it will be good for American
rugby.''

 &HT;    Slain father's spirit lives on through family, friends

   DAYTON, Ohio _ A sheriff's cruiser zoomed past Sheila
Wildermuth's car as she headed home from an afternoon of shopping
for a long-overdue family vaca-
</P>
<P>
   tion.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila heard the whoosh of the cruiser and thought absently,
'They're really after somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned onto her street, transformed into a parking lot of
cruisers and emergency vehicles. As she drew closer she realized
the yellow police tape circled her yard, and a red paramedic truck
was parked in her driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila jumped out of her car, but sheriff's deputies blocked her
from entering the house where she lived with her husband Brett and
their three children. ``You can't go in,'' they told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see my husband,'' she pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go in,'' the officers repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know a Matt Hensley?'' a deputy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a Mike Hensley,'' Sheila said. ``He's someone who
attends our church, someone the church was trying to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the officers barred her way: ``This is a crime
scene,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Dazed, Sheila noticed Julie Hensley _ Mike Hensley's wife _
leaning against Brett's red Geo Prism, staring into space. Sheila
approached Julie, whom she knew from church, but gleaned only one
fact: Mike had shot Brett.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing if Brett was alive or dead, Sheila turned back to
the house only to see paramedics leaving. ``That's not a good
sign,'' she told herself. She felt shock, dread, an eerie sense of
unreality, all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff told me to go over and sit down; he didn't take me
off by myself,'' Sheila said. Then, matter-of-factly, ``he told me
on the front lawn in front of some of my neighbors that my husband
was no longer with us.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, said Sheila, ``I lost my speech in front of
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks following the murder of her husband, on Thursday, July
8, 1999, Sheila Wildermuth could speak only a few simple words at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors rallied round with their cell phones, asking, ``Who do
you want us to call?'' Her brother was the only person Sheila
called directly, because her fingers remembered the number when her
mind could not.
</P>
<P>
   It was another two hours before she was allowed in the house to
see her husband. But she couldn't do what she really needed to do:
to touch him, to hold him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why,'' she said softly. This was one more thing
Brett's killer had robbed from her: She could not say goodbye to
her husband because the body of the man she loved had become
``evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crime scene,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   It was 9 p.m. by the time Sheila reached her mother-in-law's
house. About an hour later, she faced her most painful task:
telling the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gathered them around and of course we were all bawling,''
she said. ``They couldn't understand what was going on with my
speech; I couldn't put a lot of words together like I'm doing now.
I didn't lie to them; I told them what I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, surrounded by grandparents, ministers and close friends,
the children said a prayer for their lost father.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Mike Hensley stands charged with the murders
of Brett Wildermuth and three teen-agers murdered earlier that day
at Hensley's home: Tosha Barrett, Sherry Kimbler and Amy Mikesell.
</P>
<P>
   How could it have happened? Why was Brett Wildermuth shot by the
very man to whom he had opened his home and his heart? Why did it
happen just as he turned his back to Hensley, to prepare a place to
pray?
</P>
<P>
   If the tragedy of Brett Wildermuth's death raises an agonizing,
unanswerable Why?, the example of his life raises a question even
more fundamental: ``Am I my brother's keeper?''
</P>
<P>
   You are your brother's keeper. It is a truism so familiar, so
worn, we gloss over it as reflexively as we pass a panhandler on
the street, without making eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   We don't often think how radical it is to live a life of faith _
until something happens to remind us.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Wildermuth's death _ but most of all his life _ can remind
us.
</P>
<P>
   At Brett's funeral, mourners pieced together this account of the
tragedy:
</P>
<P>
   Brett was the only one home that day when a call came from a
friend, telling him there had been ``trouble on Queen Street,'' and
asking him to pray for Mike and Julie. ``I'm on my knees,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Mike and Julie pulled up. Julie told Brett
they were running from an occult group. ``Come in; let's pray,''
Brett said. Hensley shot Wildermuth after he turned his back to him
to prepare a place to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Julie refused to flee with her husband. She called for help and
held Brett's hand, praying, ``God, please don't let him die.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Brett lay dying, he reassured Julie, ``Don't worry, it
will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be OK. It is important that those words came from Brett,
not a minister, said Pastor Ben Davis of the First Church of God in
Sidney, where both the Wildermuths and Hensleys worshiped. ``Brett
was praying for them before they got there, and he continued to
pray,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   After the tragedy, a detective pulled Davis aside and said this
about Brett Wildermuth: ``I've seen a lot of crime scenes and they
are ugly, hard things, but there was something different about this
young man. I had never seen so much peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The observation comes as no surprise to close friend Tom Looker.
Brett never forgot _ or even questioned _ that he was his brother's
keeper, Looker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One example is the way he reached out to Mike. Brett knew God
could change anybody, and that's the truth of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While some members of the congregation knew Hensley had a
``rough past,'' Looker said, no one was afraid of him. Hensley
attended a world religions course Brett and Looker taught together.
``He talked about the draw of the enemy and of Satan, but there
were holds on his life he wasn't telling us about,'' Looker said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila didn't worry about Hensley, either; Brett had taken
greater risks while living in New Jersey in the early '80s,
volunteering with homeless men.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildermuths didn't really know the Hensleys outside of
church, nor did they belong to the same small prayer group that met
every week at various families' homes. When Brett opened the door
to the Hensleys that day, Mike and Julie Hensley entered the
Wildermuth home for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildermuths were far more closely involved with another
woman in the congregation, a single mother trying to get back on
her feet, who lived with them for six weeks. Brett and two of his
friends _ ``The Three Skinny Guys Moving Company,'' they dubbed
themselves _ helped her move into her new home.
</P>
<P>
   The church's involvement with Hensley began late last October,
when Pastor Davis received an urgent, early-morning call from Mike
and Julie Hensley. Julie was a congregation member who had married
Mike in April 1998. ``Mike said he wanted to walk a new life in
faith,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   At the First Church of God, people call each other ``brother''
and ``sister'' without a trace of irony. When Mike Hensley came to
the church seeking a new life, they opened their arms to him.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley was active in the church, attending marriage counseling,
Sunday school, and small prayer groups in the home. ``I've met a
lot of people trying to scam me and go through the motions, but
Mike was sincere,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the killings that Davis learned of Hensley's
previous arrests for public indecency, or of the reports of Cheryl
Kai, mother of 16-year-old victim Sherry Kimbler, that Hensley was
luring girls to his house with offers of cash to watch him
masturbate.
</P>
<P>
   Davis knew nothing of Hensley's apparent double life. But after
his years as a pastor, he knows something about human nature: ``I
believe in spiritual warfare. It's within every individual; we all
have to live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those forces,'' he added, ``were great in Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensley told Davis and the congregation of past involvement with
an occult group. Davis isn't sure now if that was the truth, but he
believed it then.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation paid a high price for its open-heartedness. As
Hensley fled, a suspect in the murders of Wildermuth and the three
teen-agers, some in the congregation were told to go into hiding,
including Davis and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of fear in the congregation,'' Davis said.
``We stayed away from the house for several nights. It took three
weeks before I could sleep at night without listening for
footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hensley returned to Sidney for a final wild rampage, he
terrorized another family in the congregation, John and Kathy
Bruce. At 2:30 a.m. July 13 _ the morning after Brett Wildermuth's
funeral _ Hensley pounded on the Bruces' door, firing a shot
through the door when Bruce refused to open it.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley surrendered two hours and 15 minutes later after taking
three people as hostages at the Sidney Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Has Davis second-guessed himself? Should he have protected his
congregation by refusing to minister to the likes of Mike Hensley?
</P>
<P>
   That might be the way a corporation looks at things, but not a
church. ``Our job is not to investigate,'' Davis said. ``When
Christ forgives a past, we begin to work on a future. You believe
in what a person is becoming, and treat them as if they're already
there. We did the same for Mike as we would have done for anybody
else. If someone has been divorced and remarried five times, we
just look at them as being in a new life and a new start. That is
the gospel; that is what Brett believed, and what we still
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Wildermuth tries not to spend too much time rewriting the
past. What if she had come upon the scene 20 minutes earlier? What
if the children hadn't been with their grandmother that day? These
are the thoughts she banishes from her mind. ``There are all kinds
of things that I think, `If this or if that happened,''' Sheila
said.
</P>
<P>
   She does't allow herself to stay despondent. She misses her
husband desperately and she has days _ after a church family
picnic, where Brett's absence is palpable _ when she feels as if
she's back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend stayed with her the first month after the murder,
and she despaired when it came time for her to leave. ``I realized
we were going to be here just the four of us, without him here to
help with things or do the things we normally did, and it all just
came back _ the fear, the feeling, `How am I going to do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   With her sky-blue eyes and direct, honest gaze, Sheila has the
serene, natural beauty of a woman in a Vermeer painting. Like her
husband, she is sustained and transformed by her faith: ``I feel
tremendous peace; people expect me to be lying in bed all day or
bawling at the drop of a hat,'' she said. ``God doesn't want us to
stay there. He gives me strength to get through each day. I have
responsibility for the children. Brett would not want me lounging
around being depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would call that denial. Davis calls it faith.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila has traveled an unfathomable distance since the day she
lost her ability to speak, on her front lawn, in front of her
family and neighbors. Today, she is the one encouraging people to
talk _ the children especially. ``We were all just such a family,''
she said. ``How could anybody not talk about that? Half of us is
gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila battles against any attempts, however well-meaning, to
transform her husband into Saint Brett, an icon, instead of a man
of flesh and blood, a man who loved fast motorcycles and fast cars
(though he drove a sensible Prism). At church gatherings he was
known for his goofy Elvis impersonations, complete with wig and
sequined jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he could see all this, he'd say, `What are you guys doing?
Don't put me on that pedestal,''' Sheila said. ``He was a great
guy, but he was a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Brett, July 8 started as every Thursday did: with orange
juice, cereal and 5 a.m. fellowship with Tom Looker. It was a
weekly event in which the friends met before work to pray, discuss
Scripture, to share what they had written in their journals or in
the margins of their Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   They picked the red-eye hour because it was least likely to
interfere with family time, and to skip it altogether would be
unfathomable. ``If there were a struggle or tension in his life, I
noticed a change in perspective after they were together,'' Sheila
said. ``They had such a neat and deep relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The friendship began in 1991, when Looker was seeking a weekday
Bible study class. Brett was seven years older, married, already a
father, ``and initially it was more of a mentoring relationship,''
Looker recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the friendship evolved into what Looker described at
Brett's funeral, quoting a verse from Proverbs 27: ``As iron
sharpens iron, so does one man sharpen each other.''
</P>
<P>
   They consulted each other not only about spiritual issues but
also about major decisions such as job changes. ``Tom used to bring
girlfriends to meet us for approval,'' Sheila joked. ``Pam's the
only one who passed the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Looker believes it was no accident that he and Brett met that
morning. ``It was meant to prepare Brett, to prepare both of us,''
Looker said. ``We were meant to have a meaningful time that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was also a special day for the Wildermuth children_
Joel, 9, Hannah, 7, and Naomi, 5 _ the day they normally spend with
their grandmother, Jean Wildermuth, a librarian. Sheila decided to
use that Thursday to do some ``serious shopping'' for an upcoming
family trip to Pigeon Forge, Tenn. _ the first family vacation for
the extended Wildermuth family since the death of Brett's father,
Jake Wildermuth, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a rough few years for the family, and the vacation
was to have been a step toward healing. ``Last Christmas, we agreed
we'd have no Christmas gifts, and we'd call this trip our
Christmas,'' Jean recalled. ``It was time to go out and have fun
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of Jake and Jean Wildermuth's three sons, Brett was
born with a sunny, tenderhearted disposition and a daredevil
streak. ``He must have had a guardian angel,'' Jean said, laughing.
``When he was a boy, he built a ramp and made like Evel Knievel. He
was just fearless when it came to doing things with his bicycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett also showed an early musical talent that would later
become the core of his lay ministry. As a child he fashioned a toy
guitar out of string and cardboard and rubber bands, ``and he made
it sound just like a guitar,'' his mother said. As a teen-ager he
starred in musicals at Anna High School.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildermuth boys _ Kevin, Gregg and Brett _ reveled in
growing up next to their grandparents' farm in Anna. They shared
their father's passion for cars and motorcycles, and were
constantly working on restoring cars. ``I was always walking over
car parts in the basement, but I didn't dare move a thing out of
place,'' Jean recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't complain, since it brought father and sons closer.
``Brett was a good father,'' Jean said. ``He had a good example;
his dad was a good dad, too. He spent a lot of time with his
sons.''
</P>
<P>
   On Father's Day 1995, Brett wrote a long letter to his father,
recalling an incident in which Brett, while trying to lay a roof,
lost his temper and quit the job: ``You came after me that day to
tell me you were sorry. You'll never know how important it was to
me to know I mattered more to you than that roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett had grown up in a religious home, but it was during his
years in the Coast Guard, which he entered at 18, that his faith
caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   He met Sheila several years later, in July 1985, the summer
between her sophomore and junior years at Wright State University.
``There's a new guy in Bible study,'' Sheila's friends announced.
It was Brett, and in short order, he asked her out, inviting her to
go water skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been on water skis in my life,'' Sheila said.
``And I said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple were married Aug. 2, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila endured two miscarriages before Joel was born in 1990.
Her difficulty in carrying children brought her closer not only to
Brett but also to the First Church of God congregation. ``I had
never prayed so hard for anything,'' Sheila recalled. It helped to
know that her church was praying with her.
</P>
<P>
   After Joel was born, Sheila stayed home as they had always
planned: ``We had him at last, and I wanted to see him in all the
stages.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah was born in 1992 and Naomi in 1994. Brett continued to
reach out to couples who suffered miscarriages, making special
musical tapes for them and mailing away for books. ``It was healing
for them,'' Sheila said. Brett loved to make musical tapes for
people, to mark special occasions or console them in times of
trouble. He wrote love songs to Sheila, songs honoring the births
of each child.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before his death, Brett told his mother he enjoyed his
work as a computer programmer, ``but ministry is my life.'' He
dreamed of a career in ministry.
</P>
<P>
   His family was his other top priority. Last spring, Brett
accepted a new job, taking a nearly 10 percent cut in pay, so he
could devote more time to family and church. His office was so
close he usually came home for lunch, helping the children _ who
are home-schooled _ with their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the little things I miss,'' Sheila said. ``His manner.
The way he would sit in his rocking chair. The way he would play
hide-and-seek or wrestle on the floor with the kids, acting as if
he were a slightly bigger kid.''
</P>
<P>
   She misses the big things, too _ shared parenting decisions and
joys, dreams for the future. ``I loved him very much, and we were
going to grow old together and watch our kids get married,'' Sheila
said. ``Brett would have written a song for each of their weddings.
We talked and prayed about our kids' future spouses. He was looking
forward to being a grandpa.''
</P>
<P>
   The children are all heartbroken about the loss of their father,
Sheila said, but Joel _ the oldest _ has been the most reluctant to
talk about what he is feeling. During their nightly devotions, she
asks the children to remember things they did with their father.
She tells them, ``Daddy's safe in heaven and there's no more pain
and he's not sorrowful any more.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent family evening, the kids shyly shared their
favorite memories. Joel, 9, says he loved it ``when we worked on
the car. He taught me how to rotate the tires and change oil and
check fluid.'' Hannah, 7, a born performer, misses ``singing songs
together at church.'' And Naomi, 5, remembers fondly, ``He took us
for ice cream. Once he blindfolded us and took us for ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel also enjoyed the family singalongs, particularly when his
father and great-aunt Sally would perform a duet of ``The Railroad
Song.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel thinks he understands the lyrics: ``When you go through a
storm or darkness, just follow through and keep your eyes on the
rails.''
</P>
<P>
   Has Joel ever needed to follow that advice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Joel said, his eyes thoughtful behind his Harry Potter
glasses, ``when my grandfather passed away. And when my father
passed away.''
</P>
<P>
   One of hardest things for the kids to understand, Sheila noted,
is how ``one of daddy's friends could have done this.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before the shooting, the Wildermuth family had gone to
a gathering at the Hensleys', where the children played with
Hensley's son Devin. ``It was a nice social time,'' Sheila
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi asked her mother recently, ``Mommy why would he do this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, honey,'' Sheila answered. ``Only God and Mike
know why he did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Brett's death, Sheila hasn't missed a service at the First
Church of God. Members of the Hensley family also continue to
worship there, including Julie Hensley and her mother. It is hard
on both families, Davis acknowledges: ``People here are close to
Mike, and some find it hard to believe he had done this,'' he said.
``There is the guilt and hurt and pain of Mike's family, knowing
Brett's gone and will never be back.''
</P>
<P>
   How has his congregation managed to do that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Graciously,'' Davis says, ``and that means literally with the
grace of God. There is real love and acceptance. No one blames any
of Mike's family members for what has happened. We know they had
nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sheila, ``Their church family is the same church family as
mine. If they feel comfortable, I feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of the world, the situation may seem extraordinary.
In Sheila's eyes, it isn't. ``It's possible because of who Jesus
Christ was,'' she said simply.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is proud of his congregation, but his feelings go beyond
pride. ``It's not natural, it's not of man, that this could
happen,'' Davis said. ``This love for one another is the ultimate
in Christian faith. The apostle Paul says love never fails. This is
living proof that love is able to bear troubles even as great as
these.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila visited Julie Hensley once when she was in protective
custody, because Sheila needed to know what happened in the house
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the things Sheila knows she cannot tell, because of the
pending trial. Many things she will never know, until it no longer
matters. ``By the time I am there with Jesus, I won't need to try
to make sense of what is senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila knows she has friends to whom she can turn for support,
advice, help with the kids. Friends who pray for her every day.
``This has changed our lives,'' Pam Looker said. ``We are committed
to this family, and life will never be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila is consoled by letters she has received from all over the
country, some from people who never knew Brett, but felt compelled
to write. She pores over a letter from a woman who had known Brett
only briefly, during his Coast Guard years, but who had always
cherished the tape he made for her. ``Here's this person he only
met briefly, yet he had an impact on her life,'' Sheila marveled.
</P>
<P>
   The woman wrote, ``He truly had a life that mattered, which is
all most of us want in this life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila knows Brett's spirit lives on in his friends, his family,
his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of good already is coming from this,'' Looker said.
``People are looking at how they're handling their families,
parents are having better discussions with their kids, couples are
taking their relationships with each other more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before he died, Brett promised the children he would
build a treehouse from the dying elm in the back yard. He and
Looker planned to put their talents together to finish the project
after the Wildermuths returned from their Pigeon Forge vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Tom and Pam Looker and several other friends _ Lee and
Sandi Trisler, Dave and Noelle Schwieterman, and Chris and Tonia
Butler and Michael Clayton _ came together to finish the treehouse.
</P>
<P>
   For two Saturday afternoons and one weeknight they labored,
fulfilling Brett's promise to his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a part of each other,'' Looker said. ``You don't leave a
legacy in a house or a car. It's an eternal legacy. Seeds are
planted in people, and now it's continuing. That's the neat part.''
</P>
<P>
   After construction was finished, Sheila brought out a cake to
celebrate Hannah's first tooth coming out and the treehouse going
up.
</P>
<P>
   In her thank-you notes, Sheila described her feelings as she
watched their friends build a treehouse:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like I could see Brett out there working with
them.''

VIDEO VERSION OF HOT LINE LETS COLD WAR FOES EXPAND JOINT NUCLEAR
SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS 3rd and 4th grafs with agreements) (rk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The United States and Russia, updating the ``hot line''
concept between leaders of the world's most heavily armed nuclear
powers, opened a new state-of-the-art video-conferencing center
Saturday that will enable Russian and American nuclear officials to
see, as well as talk, to each other during a nuclear-related
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   At a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday afternoon, Bill
Richardson, the American secretary of energy, and Yevgeny Adamov,
Russia's minister of atomic energy, said that the nuclear accident
in Japan last week showed the need for such real-time lines of
communication in the event of a nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and Adamov signed an agreement that expands uniform
procedures for a Department of Energy project in Russia to protect
nuclear weapons and fissile material against theft or diversion.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the two energy agencies had also agreed to
conduct joint tests on potential year 2000 computer software
problems. The tests will start in November, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the accident in Japan ``unsettling,'' Richardson said
that the opening of a joint crisis center showed that if a nuclear
incident takes place, leaders will be prepared to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the accident at the reprocessing plant near Tokyo, in
which 35 people were exposed to high levels of radiation,
Richardson and Adamov made an unprecedented offer of joint
technical assistance to Japan. Adamov said Saturday that Japan had
not accepted the offer so far and had informed his ministry that
``the situation is under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that had he been in Washington during the
accident and if the crisis center had been open, he and Adamov
undoubtedly would have used it to work out the details of their
offer to help Japan deal with the accident, the worst in Tokyo's
troubled history with nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
   But paradoxically, Richardson was in Russia when the accident
occurred and visiting Sarov, a closed nuclear-weapons city an
hour's flight away from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the sleek center on the second floor of the
Minatom building in the heart of Moscow is another indication of
the growing cooperation in critical nuclear matters between Russia
and the United States. The new system links Russia's atomic agency
with the Energy Department's Emergency Operations Center in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson toured once-closed nuclear weapons and energy sites
throughout Russia last week. He said Saturday that he was ``very
encouraged'' by the tangible evidence he had seen of what he called
the ``growing partnership'' in nuclear affairs between Moscow and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The center, with its spare gun-metal steel support beams, its
glass partitions, oversized black leather chairs around an oval
conference table, resembles a set from the ``Star Trek'' television
serial.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's contribution was a giant video-screen that covers
one of the room's walls and $500,000 worth of video conferencing
equipment. The Russian federation spent roughly an equal amount
designing and constructing the sound-proof facility.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the secure telephone line that links the White House and
the Kremlin, over which the Russian and American leaders can
discuss the most secret information, the crisis center linking
Minatom and the Energy Department is not equipped to provide for
such secrecy. But Russian officials hope to eventually be able to
link the center with all its key civilian and military nuclear
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The center will allow real-time communication between the two
energy agencies in times of nuclear or environmental emergencies
such as accidents at nuclear power or fuel facilities, the
accidental release of radioactive materials, or the theft or
diversion of nuclear weapons or other nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
   The center's first order of business Saturday, however, involved
not a nuclear crisis, but a humanitarian one. At the early morning
ceremony Saturday, Richardson announced that his agency and the
American-based Children of the World Foundation were sending two
Russian children to New York's Westchester Medical Center for
life-saving heart surgery. American technical experts learned of
the children's plight while working on projects monitoring nuclear
sites in Siberia, and worked out the arrangements with the
foundation.

AUSTRIA VOTE MAY PUT FAR-RIGHT PARTY IN THICK OF THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS spelling of Rauscher in graf beginning: ``It's
fatigue...) (js) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Can a politician so tanned that he's known as
the Hero of the Solarium, so narcissistic that he's posed in
everything from lederhosen to silver togas to near nudity, and so
controversial that his opponents openly call him a crypto-Nazi
actually beat this conservative country's red-and-black coalition
government until it's black-and-blue?
</P>
<P>
   That question will be answered Sunday, when Austria's voters
choose between the Social Democrats (the reds), the conservative
business-and-church-oriented People's Party (black), and the newly
powerful right-wing Freedom Party (color code: blue) led by Joerg
Haider. (The Green Party and the ``yellow'' Liberal Forum are not
expected to do well enough to tempt pundits with a ``traffic-light
government.'')
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters predict that the reds will hang on to their No. 1 spot
with about 35 percent of the vote, but that Haider's blues are
expected for the first time to outstrip the black column, 27
percent to 25 percent. If the People's Party slips to third place
for the first time since 1945, its leader says he will drop out of
the longstanding red-black coalition to rebuild his demoralized
forces. Color schemes aside, that leaves Haider _ whose party had a
mere 5 percent when he took it over in 1986 _ as a potential
kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The idea horrifies the Austrian political establishment. After
all, the reds and blacks only got together in their highly unusual
left-right coalition in 1986 in order to keep Haider from power.
And their partnership has lasted mostly on the shared perception
that it was necessary to keep things that way. Vienna's liberals,
who are prominent in the press and academia, also shudder at the
prospect of Haider gaining even more influence in Austrian
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The vision reverberates, too, beyond Austria's borders: Guenter
Grass, Germany's new Nobel laureate for literature, celebrated the
honor on Friday morning by giving the early morning weather
forecast on German state television. He predicted sunshine in the
south Sunday, and then directly urged Austrians _ many of whom
watch German television _ to vote against Haider, widely
characterized as the head of Europe's largest far-right party.
</P>
<P>
   The terms used to describe Haider would barely be utterable in
Germany: his parents' time in the Hitler Youth is repeatedly
brought up; his takeover of the Freedom Party and ousting of its
liberal wing is called a putsch, the corps of handsome young men
around him is likened to a Praetorian Guard or 1930s street thugs.
Dozens of protesters at a Haider rally Friday night chanted
``Nazis, out!''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Haider has not helped. In 1991, he snapped at a Socialist rival
in his home province of Carinthia: ``They had a sound employment
policy in the Third Reich, which is more than your government in
Vienna has managed,'' and was immediately accused of endorsing
slave labor and forced to resign as the province's governor, an
office he regained after a comeback in provincial elections last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Haider spoke to a reunion that included former Waffen
SS men, calling them ``decent people with character who stuck to
their belief through the strongest headwinds.'' The Museum of
Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles displays
Haider's picture in its Contemporary Demagogues section, alongside
the former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, Louisiana's David Duke and
the French rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But a Haider party leader, Peter Sichrovsky, who is Jewish,
bristles at Nazi cracks. ``It's a stupid comparison, and I don't
accept it,'' he said. ``I will accept any criticism of our
immigration policy, but I refuse dialogue with anyone comparing us
to mass murderers. The Green Party in Rome has an anti-Gypsy policy
and no one compares them to Mussolini.'' Haider, he said, has
visited Israel and took his daughters through Washington's
Holocaust Museum shortly after it opened.
</P>
<P>
   The party does want all immigration halted, but insists that
jobs, not skin color, is the issue. ``Our strongest supporter is
the Turkish guy who's been here 10 years cleaning floors and is
scared a guy from the ex-Yugoslavia will take his job for half the
money,'' Sichrovsky said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The party also has ideas for which Americans know the roots: it
wants a 23 percent flat tax and calls its platform Contract With
Austria. But other platform planks are, in American terms, classic
tax-and-spend liberalism: Haider promises $400 a month to every
Austrian mother so she can stay home with her children. Workers
like him because he defends costly cradle-to-grave benefits against
cuts made by the current government in order to qualify for
Europe's single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's opponents say his books do not balance _ tax receipts
would sink to $30 billion from $40 billion while expenses soared, a
Social Democrat spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What is baffling is why a far-right party is having such success
now.
</P>
<P>
   Austria is not remotely in crisis; economically, it approaches
paradise. It has only 8 million people _ about as many as desperate
Zimbabwe _ but they produce enough to have a higher standard of
living than the Germans. Unemployment is 4.3 percent; inflation is
negligible. No one ever strikes. The spotless streets of Vienna and
Salzburg brim with culture, and women walk them safely at night.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, 10 percent of the population consists of
immigrants. Without them, the economy would fibrillate: Polish
carpenters build housing, Filipino nurses staff hospitals,
Hungarian nannies tend babies.
</P>
<P>
   So why do a quarter of all Austrians believe Haider's assertions
that the country is going to the dogs?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly in a nation that has Sigmund Freud, a native
son, on its equivalent of the $5 bill, there is no shortage of
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fatigue _ Austrians are complainers,'' said Hans
Rauscher, a political columnist for the newspaper Der Standard.
After 13 years of the same government, and almost 30 years under
Socialist chancellors, ``People are really fed up with the same
faces in power.''
</P>
<P>
   The reds have dominated Parliament for three decades, and Haider
plays on old resentment over the careful red/black control of daily
life. For decades, anyone seeking a civil service job, even as a
teacher, bank teller, postman, railway porter or street sweeper
usually had to first join one of the two governing parties.
</P>
<P>
   Austrians are also apprehensive. During the Cold War, this was a
neutral island in the Alps. Now, hard by the crisis in the
countries that were part of the larger Yugoslavia, it is debating
joining NATO and would be the doorsill for eastern European
countries if the European Union's door opens to them.
</P>
<P>
   Haider takes these jitters and weaves an earthquake, saying
child molesters are buying their way out of jail and foreigners
have turned the country into ``a center for international crime _
drug dealers, car thieves, pimps and bandits.'' His crime slogan:
``No mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole, even inflated to absurdity, does not backfire on him
as Hitlerism does. Opposing the entry into the European Union four
years ago, he said Austrians would be forced to pump their bracing
water to Spain and import lice-infested yogurt. The yogurt is still
good; and he still draws crowds. His railing against immigration
actually changed policy. The government slowed it to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as he fans xenophobia, the ruling parties bicker and
run dull ads.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first black campaign blitz was a folk song book. ``This is
not still the country of the von Trapp singers,'' sneered a red
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Viktor Klima of the reds has said he will ``never,
never'' form a coalition with Haider, so his party is hoping the
black leader, Wolfgang Schuessel, will either change his mind or
even be ousted by someone less willing to give up ruling for
soul-searching. But Haider is still the one who makes every other
politician angry or nervous.

   ``The only guy who speaks out, who wants to change anything, is
Haider,'' said Georg Hoffman-Ostenhof, a columnist for the Profil
weekly. ``And since he's so eclectic and voters are generally not
rational, they find him attractive.''

GROUND FIGHTING RESUMES   AMID CHECHEN THREATS 
</HEADLINE>

   GROZNY, Russia _ Sounding defiant as his tiny republic plunged
into a new war Saturday with Russia, Chechnya's president
threatened to kill any Russian soldier who sets foot in the
breakaway land.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment the battle is under way. This is war,''
President Aslam Maskhadov, dressed in combat fatigues, said from a
heavily guarded compound in his bombed-out capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to journalists as Russian troops, backed by tanks and
artillery, fiercely clashed with rebel fighters inside the
breakaway republic and seized one Chechen village. The ground
fighting occurred after 10 days of devastating airstrikes and just
three years after the end of a conflict here that claimed the lives
of tens of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   What Russia calls a campaign to crack down on terrorists,
Chechens see as a continuation of Moscow's centuries-long attempt
to dominate the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Russian occupant steps on a centimeter of Chechnya
territory, he will be destroyed,'' said Maskhadov, a former Russian
army colonel who commanded the rebels to victory during Moscow's
disastrous 1994-1996 campaign to end Chechnya's independence bid.
``If it's in the city, we will fight in the city; in the woods, we
will fight in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov also appealed for talks with President Boris N.
Yeltsin, saying that ``We can resolve all our differences in 30
minutes.'' There was no immediate Russian response.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen leader said Russian troops and tanks had moved
several miles into Chechnya, where they were met by Chechen troops
in two districts close to the Russian border 60 miles north of
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fierce battle in the Naursky and the Shelkovsky
regions,'' said Maskhadov's chief of staff, Apti Batalov. ``Sunday
they came in with a full-scale operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian General Valery Manilov, one of the planners of the
Russian military operation, confirmed that Russian troops had
clashed with insurgents in several areas in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov said the Russian forces in and around Chechnya,
estimated at 50,000, would set up a security ring around the
separatist republic to prevent infiltration by Islamic rebels into
neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that Russia was planning a major ground operation, but
the mayor of Naursky, one of the towns near the fighting, described
in a conversation by walkie-talkie a battle involving many Russian
tanks and troops. He said the fighting was too heavy to count
wounded, but said two Russian tanks had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   After a heavy artillery bombardment, Russian troops occupied the
village of Borozdinovka, just over the Chechen border and 60 miles
north of Grozny, according to Abdul Magomedov, a spokesman for the
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Russian warplanes again bombed Grozny Saturday, the 10th day of
airstrikes Moscow says are aimed at crushing the Islamic rebels,
whom Moscow blames for recent fighting in the neighboring region of
Dagestan and a series of bomb blasts in which nearly 300 people
died.
</P>
<P>
   But video footage shown to reporters in Grozny Saturday that the
Chechens say was shot last month and accounts from numerous
refugees from the violence indicate that the bombing is
indiscriminate and aimed at civilians. In one village, a woman
sitting in bombed-out ruins wails ``mama''; other footage shows
torn and burned bodies laid out in a street.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov said 40 villages had been flattened and said over 400
people had died in the air raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to understand the Russians,'' Maskhadov said.
</P>
<P>
   While Maskhadov has called for talks, Yeltsin has remained in
the shadows, and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has dismissed the
need for negotiations. On Thursday, Putin said leaders of a former
puppet government set up by Moscow during the last war were the
only legitimate authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have forgotten that Yeltsin sent me a telegram
congratulating me when I was elected,'' said Maskhadov, who won
over 60 percent of the vote in a 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the ground fighting forced more refugees to flee the
capital for Ingushetia, the mainly Muslim Russian region west of
Chechnya that has allowed more than 80,000 Chechens into its
territory since the fighting began.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who have not left have been forced to live without
electricity and gas. But outside of the widespread damage, most of
it left over from the last war, there was little sign of
preparation for a new war. In Grozny, street markets operated under
the bombed-out hulls of apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better in paradise than in Ingushetia,'' read graffiti
on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens are nothing if not confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more experience this time,'' said Mogamed Khambiyev,
Maskhadov's defense minister. ``Everyone knows how to fight. We
know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Khambiyev said he had 50 diversionary squads that were ready to
attack Russian troops on Russian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Russian generals' assurances that they had learned
from the mistakes of the last war, he said: ``They have no new
tactics _ for 500 years they have had the same tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian armor continued to move along Chechnya's
western border with Ingushetia. But some of the tanks looked old
and battered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians intend to fight with that?'' said Azamat
Nalgiyev, a member of the Ingush parliament, as he watched a tank
tow an armored personel carrier. ``God help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian politicians favor a tough line against Chechnya,
where hundreds of Russians and foreigners are believed to be held
hostage by ransom-taking abduction rings. Journalists have also
been victims; Saturday a busload of reporters brought into the
capital were under constant guard by commandos toting machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin offered Saturday to be a
hostage in Chechnya if 180 people held by kidnappers there were
released, Interfax reported in Moscow. Stepashin was chief of
Russia's security agency during the Chechen war and played a large
part in planning the disastrous campaign. This time, he has come
out against the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have said they intend to occupy the area north of
Grozny, set up a pro-Moscow government, and isolate the rest of
Chechnya. But the resistance of the Chechens at the first Russian
incursions indicates that they are not ready to let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov was asked if Chechnya would accept a partition of
their territory, letting the Russians have the northern part.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because this is where I was born,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov has been struggling to maintain control over other
Chechen commanders, including the mastermind of the Dagestan
operation, Shamil Basayev. Some Russian observers have questioned
whether Maskhadov can count on Basayev's support now.
</P>
<P>
   But Maskhadov said he had won a vote of support at a congress of
key political and public leaders Saturday in Grozny. He said
Basayev would also obey. While he said he did not agree with
Basayev's tactics, he denied that the invasion of Dagestan amounted
to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian volunteers fought in Kosovo, but no one called that
international terrorism then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov appealed to the West to speak out against the Russian
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The United States urged Russia on Friday to use ``restraint and
wisdom'' in its drive against the rebels. It denied any similarity
between Russia's offensive and NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time, the West practically gave the Russians the right to
destroy Chechnya,'' Maskhadov said, referring to incidents like the
1996 press conference where President Clinton compared Yeltsin to
Abraham Lincoln. ``Hopefully this time the West will realize they
cannot allow this.''

MUSEUM FUSS DRAWS CURIOUS TO BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Mayor Rudolph Giuliani were a paid publicist for
the Brooklyn Museum of Art, he couldn't have done much more to turn
out the crowds for opening day of its controversial exhibit called
``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Crimi, a truck dispatcher from Queens, was one of the first
in line Saturday morning. ``I absolutely would not have come had
the mayor not attacked it,'' she said. ``I came only to show my
support for the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   D.J. Samuelson, a railroad worker who took the 6:43 train from
the Hamptons said, ``I'm here to see what the fuss is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Young, a college instructor who drove in from Long Island
mused, ``I see my presence here as a form of meaningful voting.
It's a vote for freedom of expression and maximum tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks now, they and hundreds more who stood waiting in
line had been savoring the moment when this show _ which has
attracted more fear, loathing, and lawsuits than any art show the
past decade _ finally opened.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidewalk, cordoned off by police, a group of Catholics _
200 at most _ had been waiting with equal eagerness to protest the
exhibit. They railed against the museum's directors, chanted
prayers, and held signs reading ``Bigotry Is Not Art,'' ``Evil
Trash,'' and ``Shame!''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen animal-rights activists were on hand to protest the use
of dead mammals in some of the show's installations. ``We think
there's nothing creative about animals suffering,'' said Mia
MacDonald, one of the activists.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, nearly 1,000 had gathered outside the museum
for a free-speech rally to denounce Giuliani, cheer the museum, and
hold such signs as ``Censorship Is an Obscenity,'' ``Next: Burning
at the Brooklyn Public Library?'' and ``Don't Pooh-Pooh Our Pooh
Pooh.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, featuring works by young British artists, includes
such provocations as a dead shark floating in formaldehyde, a
sliced-up pig, and _ most notoriously _ a painting of the Virgin
Mary with clumps of elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, after looking through the catalogue two weeks ago,
blasted that work in particular as ``disgusting'' and
``anti-Catholic.'' He cut off the city's subsidy to the museum and
filed a lawsuit to evict it _ and its vast holdings of ancient and
modern art _ from the city-owned building that it has occupied for
more than a century. In turn, the museum is suing the city,
demanding the restoration of its subsidy on First Amendment
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   When the museum's doors finally opened Saturday at 11 a.m. and
the crowds filled the halls, a pattern seemed to emerge. Of two
dozen people interviewed, some liked the show, others didn't, but
they all expressed one basic sentiment: What's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   William Parsons, a retired math teacher, stood with a crowd of
people gazing at the center of the controversy, Chris Ofili's
``Holy Virgin Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the rays emanating from her head, like a halo,'' he
said. ``I think it's magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Pelletier, a costume designer, agreed. ``She's really
quite lovely,'' she said in a tone of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of this painting have appeared in newspapers and on
TV newscasts for weeks now. But neither the photos nor its
reproduction in the museum catalogue _ which so angered Giuliani _
capture what it looks like.
</P>
<P>
   This Mary, who more resembles an African earth goddess, is
draped in a luminous blue gown against a gold backdrop that
glistens.
</P>
<P>
   The huge canvas does sit on two clumps of elephant dung, and a
highly molded and polished clump of dung represents her breast. But
elephant dung is prominent in three other Ofili paintings, which
have nothing to do with religious themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought from the newspapers that dung was going to be
smudged all over the thing,'' said Edward Moran, a Brooklyn-based
writer. ``It's not that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has said nothing about a potentially more shocking
aspect of this work _ that pasted all around Mary are photos of
bare female backsides that Ofili had cut out of porn magazines.
Then again, these fragments, shaped like angel wings, are so small,
he might not have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few inside the museum seemed bothered. ``I guess the
artist is saying she was a woman at one point,'' said Rick Casey, a
designer. ``Clearly a lot of good feeling went into this work.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Williams, a transit worker said, ``I don't understand the
point of the buttocks. But it isn't upsetting. The painting doesn't
look to me like someone trying to denigrate her.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did many seem repelled by Damien Hirst's infamous
installations _ a sliced-up pig, a cut-up cow, and a large sealed
cage filled with hundreds of flies and maggots, a cow's head, and
an electronic zapper. The flies breed, feed on the head, then die
on the zapper. Most people get the joke _ a brutal play on the
cycle of life.
</P>
<P>
   More were upset by works of the Chapman Brothers _ tangled
life-sized sculptures of little girls in perverse positions, many
with faces made of sex organs.
</P>
<P>
   But, contrary to the publicity, the vast bulk of ``Sensation''
has nothing to do with sex or religion and much more to do with
post-modern explorations into the meaning of art _ some funny, some
shocking, a few beautiful, most flatly old hat.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blimey!,'' his book about the contemporary British art
scene, Matthew Collins writes, ``Young British art is really a
movement of everything mixed up and everyone chopping and changing
between different mediums and styles.''
</P>
<P>
   At least a few museum-goers Saturday were bothered, more than
anything, by this self-conscious stylishness. ``Don't any of these
artists care about anything outside themselves?'' sighed Deborah
Kapell, an epidemiologist. ``There's no passion. It's so pointless.
It's so cool, so ironic, so detached, I don't find it very
meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   Back outside, the protesters _ most of whom said they had no
intention of seeing the show _ were finding it all too meaningful.
William Donohue, head of the Catholic League, called it hate speech
and said to much applause that the museum ``should have a couple of
Catholics on their board of directors _ then they'd understand the
real issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Giuliani's critics have accused the mayor of making such
an issue over the museum for political motives. He is the likely
Republican candidate in next year's US Senate race, and New York
statewide elections often hinge on the Catholic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Doyle Blackwall, one of the protesters, said, ``We're
sending money to Giuliani's campaign. He's standing up for what's
right. Some politician said the biggest sleeping giant in American
politics is the Catholics. Maybe it's time we woke up.''

<P>
   BREMERTON, Wash. _ Both fighters are brashly predicting a
knockout, which is nothing new in boxing. But some of the other
pre-bout banter is certainly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if this guy feels at all hesitant to get out in the ring
and hit a girl, well, I'll belt him enough to get him upset and get
him going,'' explained 36-year-old Margaret MacGregor, who will
take on a man, Loi Chow, in a fight in Seattle that is sending
waves of discomfort through the boxing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get in there and start going toe to toe,'' Ms.
MacGregor said, ``Loi Chow is going to realize something. He's
going to have to go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   After the state of Washington declared that its gender-equity
laws give it no authority and indeed no reason to prevent the
match, what is billed by its promoters as the nation's first
officially sanctioned bout between a man and a woman was scheduled
for Oct. 9 at Seattle's Mercer Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The four-round fight between Ms. MacGregor and Chow, both
expected to weigh in at around 125 pounds, is on the undercard to a
longer fight between two men. But it has stolen all the attention,
generating considerable publicity and talk-show fodder here in the
Seattle area and prompting sharp criticism from boxing officials in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is very simple in the state of Nevada,'' said Marc
Ratner, executive director of the state's Athletic Commission,
which regulates fights. ``We feel that men should fight men, and
women should fight women.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Sugar, editor of Fight Game magazine and one of the sport's
most respected historians, was one of several boxing experts who
concurred that indeed, the Seattle bout was the first official
intergender match-up. But, he quickly added, that hardly makes it
momentous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a circus, it's a sideshow,'' said Sugar, echoing what
seems to be the prevailing view among boxing officials. ``It's an
old carnival act, updated for the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. MacGregor says she is angered by the suggestion that she
does not belong in a ring with Chow, of Vancouver, British
Columbia. She is 3-0 fighting other women in the ring and 8-0-1 as
a professional kick boxer, including four victories by knockout,
two in which her female opponents were out on a 10-count and two
more in which the referee stopped the fight. Chow is 0-2 in fights
against men.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody could come up with a really good reason why this
fight shouldn't happen, that would be nice,'' said Ms. MacGregor, a
part-time landscaper in this blue-collar shipbuilding city an
hour's ferry ride from Seattle, who was drawn to study martial arts
in part, she said, because of the ``helpless'' way she felt when
her husband at the time hit her during an argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just vowed, `No man will ever do that to me again unless I
let him,''' said Ms. MacGregor, who has a new boyfriend, Mike
Hopkins, a truck driver with whom she hopes to have children some
day. As for her boxing, ``he's very supportive,'' and will work her
corner of the ring in the upcoming fight, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, most men are stronger than most women, but there
are exceptions,'' added Ms. MacGregor, after a workout at Twin
Tigers Gym here. At 5 feet 5 inches, she enjoys a three-inch height
advantage over Chow, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   War between the sexes is, of course, nothing new, and the United
States crossed some sort of sports rubicon in 1973, when Billie
Jean King, the women's tennis star, defeated an older male player,
Bobby Riggs, in a much-publicized contest.
</P>
<P>
   But an official match inside the ring is clearly breaking new
ground. Even as some state boxing commissions insisted that they
would never allow it, Washington officials said they ignored gender
altogether as a factor in sanctioning fights here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't discriminate against anybody on the basis of
gender,'' said Suzanne Taylor, a spokeswoman for the state's
Department of Licensing. Her agency, which also oversees drivers'
licenses, took over boxing regulation when the state's boxing
commission was disbanded three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at height, weight, prior experience,'' Ms. Taylor
said. ``What we're concerned about is the safety of the fighters,
and we wouldn't approve the fight if it was not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's approval was described as ``absolute madness''
by a former head of the boxing commission, Dale Ashley, in a recent
letter to The Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department of licensing will not stop until they kill
someone,'' Ashley wrote. ``They have program managers with no
boxing experience, who don't know a left hook from a jab.''
</P>
<P>
   Even officials with the International Female Boxers Association,
based in California, have objected to the MacGregor-Chow bout, for
which each fighter will receive $1,500, saying it could detract
from the big strides that all-female boxing has made. The Seattle
fight will occur one night after Muhammad Ali's 21-year-old
daughter, Laila, is scheduled to make her professional debut in a
fight against another woman at the Turning Stone Casino in Verona,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 percent of the fights sanctioned in Nevada each year
feature two women in the ring, said Ratner. Rounds are two minutes
long, rather than three as in men's fights, but otherwise the rules
are pretty much the same, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there are knockouts, women get cut, certainly their
eyes do get swollen,'' Ratner said. ``It's all a part of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The promoter of the Washington fight, Bob Jarvis, said the idea
of the man-woman match-up really arose by accident, when he could
not find a woman for Ms. MacGregor to fight and jokingly brought up
the idea with Ms. MacGregor's trainer, Vern Miller, who also
teaches kung fu and tai chi here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women don't want to fight guys,'' Jarvis said. ``But this
one, she really, really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. MacGregor was originally to fight another Vancouver boxer,
Hector Morales, but he pulled out after becoming uncomfortable with
the idea, promoters said, and Chow stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Jarvis professed dismay at all the attention the
fight is getting, even if it does sell tickets, because it has
detracted from the focus on his fighter, Martin O'Malley, whom he
described as a 10-0 phenom with huge star potential in the
lightweight division. The fighter is scheduled for a 10-round fight
with Tito Tovar of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious,'' Jarvis said. ``No one is even talking about
Martin O'Malley anymore. And he's not real happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chow, a jockey and a weightlifter, has predicted that the fight
will be over in less than a minute, with Ms. MacGregor succumbing
to the first left-right combination he lands.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. MacGregor, who sported a yin and yang earring as she
sparred in the ring Friday with a male friend, Juan Rodriguez,
warned her opponent not to underestimate her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thinks he's getting a cream puff, he's in for a real
jolt,'' she said. ``I'm going to rock his world.''

FORBES EMBRACES CHRISTIAN COALITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Steve Forbes, who once called Christian Coalition
founder Pat Robertson a ``toothy flake,'' and who put relatively
little emphasis on abortion, embraced major elements of the
coalition's agenda Saturday. He portrayed himself as the most
socially conservative choice among top GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While the Christian Coalition membership appeared to be divided
Saturday as its ``Road to Victory'' convention drew to a close
here, the speech by Forbes underscored the dilemma facing religious
conservatives. While many back Bush, many others remain concerned
that Bush may not be conservative enough on issues such as abortion
compared with the rest of the GOP field.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes used his speech Saturday before the coalition to draw a
series of sharp contrasts with Bush, who on Friday delivered his
standard stump speech at the Washington convention with only a
sentence thrown in about protecting the ``unborn.'' Forbes, by
contrast, promised to appoint antiabortion judges and to select an
antiabortion vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front-runner will not promise to appoint prolife judges,
but I have and I will,'' Forbes said. ``The front-runner won't
promise to appoint a prolife running mate, but I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the publisher who is relying on his fortune for most of
his funding, then reissued his call for Bush to participate in
debates. He suggested five sessions of several hours each. ``George
W. Bush, it is time to debate,'' Forbes said. ``No more ducking, no
more waffling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has agreed to only one debate, next January in Iowa. Bush
has declined an invitation to participate in a town hall-style
meeting this month in New Hampshire. A Bush spokeswoman said the
Texas governor believes it is too early to debate, because most
voters aren't paying attention to the race.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to abortion, Forbes embraced the coalition's view on
using tax-supported vouchers for private religious schools and said
he wanted to end the role that federal government has in local
education.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's position on abortion contrasted with the strategy of
several other GOP candidates. Bush rarely mentions the issue in his
speeches. Elizabeth Dole has played down the issue, saying she does
not want to be drawn into ``dead-end debates.'' Senator John McCain
of Arizona declined an invitation to address the coalition. And
Patrick J. Buchanan, while strongly against abortion, canceled an
appearance before the coalition. He appears likely to seek the
nomination of the Reform Party, which excludes social issues from
its platform.
</P>
<P>
   Other GOP candidates who strongly speak against abortion are in
the lower tier of the field, including former Reagan aide Gary
Bauer, talk show host Alan Keyes, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson seemed close to an endorsement when he said Friday
that Bush was ``worthy of support.'' Saturday, in an interview with
Evans and Novak of CNN, he said, ``I don't see how he could lose
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 3,000 or so coalition members who attended the
convention at the Washington Hilton still seemed split. While a
large group seemed to back Bush, an equally large number seemed
divided between the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Such a split, however, might work to Bush's advantage. A key
Bush adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Bush
strategy is to pay homage to religious conservatives with a modest
emphasis on abortion, while hoping that groups such as the
Christian Coalition are too divided to provide a big boost to any
other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's strategy has won over participants such as Aurelia C.
Hood of South Carolina. ``Bush will not give a promise that he will
appoint judges who are prolife,'' said Hood, of the Forbes
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes also lost a supporter. David Crowe of Oregon said he
backed Forbes until a few days ago, when he came to believe that
the Forbes campaign was behind rumors that Bauer was having an
affair with a campaign staff member. Forbes's campaign has denied
having anything to do with the story.

 &HT;    Marlins get low-stakes win
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Beyond everything else, it was a beautiful day at the
ballyard on Saturday, even if the stakes were nonexistent and so
were the runs when the Braves and Marlins met for the
second-to-last game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Not until Cliff Floyd hit a home run off Derrin Ebert to right
field in the 10th inning was there a score in this game and a
finish, 1-0 Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we wanted to do except win the ballgame,''
said Braves manager Bobby Cox, who got a couple of at-bats for the
starters, at-bats for just about every player on the bench, and
rest for the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   With the defeat, the Braves lost their chance at finishing with
their best record yet at Turner Field _ they needed wins in their
last two games to hit 57 for the season. But that was about all
that's left to play for as the Braves await the finish of the
wild-card race to find out who they will play Tuesday in the
Division Series. It'll be either the Reds, who lost their second in
a row on Saturday, or the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   That, and the last few postseason roster spots are all that's up
in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen is one of the question marks. He has an outside
chance at making the postseason roster as the Braves' 10th pitcher,
and made a case for it on Saturday, allowing one hit over six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first start since a July 28 loss to the Brewers, Chen
struck out six and didn't walk a batter. Floyd lined a single to
center off him in the first inning and that would be all off Chen
for the Marlins, who struck out 15 times against John Smoltz and
company Friday, only to follow it with another 13 strikeouts on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Between those two Floyd hits, the Braves retired 26 consecutive
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's season has been mostly about disappointment as he failed
in repeated chances at becoming the Braves fifth starter. But it
didn't end that way. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Chen said. ``If I don't make the postseason
roster it's like my season ends. I don't feel like it's over. I
feel strong. I feel good.... I thought I was going to be the fifth
starter and things didn't go my way. I'm glad I was able to stay
and finish the season strong.''

 &HT;    Lucky Dogs win again
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The NCAA doesn't keep it as an official statistic,
so it's difficult to verify. But based on its play the past two
games, Georgia might be the luckiest team in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs on Saturday dodged a bullet again. More accurately,
the bullet was batted away by linebacker Will Witherspoon with 18
seconds left. He went airborne to knock away Josh Booty's two-point
conversion pass for Tommy Banks, thus preserving the 10th-ranked
Bulldogs' 23-22 victory over beleaguered LSU.
</P>
<P>
   The week before, Georgia's one-point victory over Central
Florida was made possible when a Central Florida point-after
attempt hit an upright and the Golden Knights were called for
offensive interference in the end zone in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we're a team of destiny,'' Witherspoon said. ``And
your destiny is what you make of it. We're 4-0, 2-0 in the
conference. That's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Another stroke of luck _ Florida's overtime loss to Alabama on
Saturday _ means the Bulldogs head to Knoxville on Saturday to take
on No. 7 Tennessee as the first place-team in the SEC East. The
Vols have beaten Georgia eight consecutive years. But Georgia takes
them on with an identity: a team that makes the most of good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise we're not trying to do this,'' coach Jim Donnan
said. ``We understand we're very fortunate to be 4-0. We are lucky.
But this is a young team, and we're looking to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to give the fans their money's worth,'' joked
defensive tackle Marcus Stroud.
</P>
<P>
   A loss would not have been funny. The Bulldogs seemed in control
of the game and could have avoided the last-second stress. But Hap
Hines failed to convert a 31-yard field-goal attempt in the third
quarter, and Donnan elected to go for a first down on fourth-and-2
at the LSU 5 later in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But after stuffing the Tigers all of the third and most of the
fourth quarter, Georgia let them fly down the field and score on a
39-yard pass from Booty to Reggie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   LSU coach Gerry DiNardo, under heavy scrutiny after the Tigers'
collapse last season, did not hesitate going for two. ``I thought
it'd give us the best chance to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Witherspoon intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something you always dream of doing,'' he said. ``You
want to make the big play in a big game. I knew if I missed it,
(Banks) was right there behind me. It was the greatest feeling in
the world to make contact with that ball.''

PRIME RETURN FOR COWBOYS' SANDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Sitting in his truck outside the Cowboys
headquarters a few days ago, Deion Sanders took a timeout from the
hysteria surrounding today's return of Prime Time.
</P>
<P>
   That the team's resident cornerback/punt returner/preacher and
his surgically repaired great left toe will make their season debut
when the Cowboys (2-0) and Cardinals (1-2) kick off at noon today
has sparked more national interest than a certain Dallas
championship team opening its season this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Ma,'' Connie Knight, will even be in the stands at Texas
Stadium to watch her first game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a football mom,'' Knight said. ``I love football. But the
game isn't good unless my baby is playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And her ``baby'' is yearning to return in typical Prime-Time
fashion _ with a big play for a touchdown and a new ``Holy Ghost''
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My toe is not 100 percent,'' Sanders said. ``I don't know what
percent it is. But it's the best possible shape it's been in a long
time. I feel like I can play on it. When I say play, I mean play.
You are going to know I'm out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my time. You might call it a flair for the dramatic. I
just see myself doing what I've always done. I take care of my
moments. I see this as one.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Sanders, 32, swayed to the gospel music on the truck
stereo system, he acknowledged that the time away has also allowed
him to see that the moments will one day disappear. He said he's
nowhere close to retirement, joking that he would like to play
until his 5-year-old son, Deion Jr., reaches the NFL. But he also
understands that his Hall of Fame-destined career is turning the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes there will be a life without Prime Time, the
flamboyant superhero-like cartoon character he created at Florida
State to maximize his profile and earning potential. Prime Time is
Deion's alter ego, the guy he sees returning interceptions for
touchdowns on ``Monday Night Football''.
</P>
<P>
   And while he plans to continue to don his Prime-Time cape on
game days, he said it's time to end things as he started: with
Deion Sanders, not Prime Time, playing the larger role.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my career is over, the cartoon character dies,'' Sanders
said. ``I can't allow that to happen with my true self. I'm about
bringing people in the kingdom now. I must allow people to know
me.'' \Nsubheds:Who is Deion Sanders? For the bulk of his 11-year
career, the attention-grabbing persona of Prime Time, though a
marketing bonanza, turned Sanders the person into a public enigma.
He's generally portrayed to fans as a me-first, team-second prima
donna by critics in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Making the 6-foot-1, 195-pound Sanders even more of a conundrum
is that teammates and coaches throughout his career don't see him
as a selfish player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion is a good dude,'' safety Darren Woodson said. ``People
don't understand what type of guy he is because you can't see from
the outside in. The only reason people think he's selfish is
because when he comes on the field, he turns into the
attention-getting Prime Time. When he's in the locker room he is a
different guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin might relate to Sanders better
than anyone, on and off the field. Irvin knows about exposure as a
``prime time'' player on the field and a controversial image off
it. He said Sanders' confident swagger is crucial to his success at
cornerback because of the alone-on-an-island nature of the
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to do his thing,'' Irvin said. ``The position he
plays you have to have a confident mentality. He's got to do it.
Outside of that, I don't know how else to put it. It's incredible
to play with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who play with him are here because of Sanders, and
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones uses this as evidence of Prime Time's
team-oriented nature. He said Sanders was the point man in the
Cowboys' free-agent signings of linebacker Broderick Thomas a few
years ago and defensive end Alonzo Spellman this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the assistant personnel guys,'' Jones said
Sanders. ``He's always looking for guys that might help us out. The
only way that relates is that he's constantly thinking about team.
And even when he's not on the field, he's coaching his teammates,
helping them get better. Along with his obvious God-given physical
skills, Deion is one of the most intelligent players I've been
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders blames part of his negative image on cultural
misunderstandings regarding his flashy demeanor, in part because of
his own reluctance to open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at fault, too, because Prime Time is all I've showed to
some people,'' Sanders said. ``Let the truth be told, Deion is very
boring to the public. He's a lot more serious. He's honest real and
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he became more true to his teammates and family
when he became a born-again Christian two years ago. Connie Knight
said she and her son have always had a brother-sister bond. The two
became closer when he started living for Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Time, the one with all the mouth, was just on the
field,'' Knight said. ``Deion was always quiet. But he's very
different now. He has a lot more patience and we have a lot more to
talk about now.''
</P>
<P>
   What puzzles Sanders is that critics remain. People question
whether his faith is legitimate or just another Prime Time sales
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's funny is that nobody knew my life was a mess,'' Sanders
said. ``I told everybody. I told everybody I was whoring. I told
everybody I was suicidal. It's not like somebody found out.
Everybody thought I had it going on. How are people going to
persecute me for coming clean? How are you going to judge me for
telling the truth? But I don't worry about it. I have joy in my
life.'' \Nsubheds:Defining Prime Time Though Sanders is frustrated
that his on-field persona has sometimes drawn criticism, he has no
regrets for its existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal coming out of college was to take care of my
momma for the rest of my life, to secure her and retire her,'' said
Sanders, who grew up in a drug-infested neighborhood in Fort Myers,
Fla. ``Prime Time helped do that by all means. I didn't need a big
ad agency. I didn't need a firm to put my stuff out there. I did it
on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   What he did was secure unprecedented national acclaim for a
formerly overlooked position. Thanks largely to Sanders, who
coupled standout play with an attention-getting personality,
cornerback has turned into one of the NFL's glamour positions. The
megamillions in salaries invested in Sanders has paved the way for
Denver's Dale Carter, New England's Ty Law and Atlanta's Ray
Buchanan to sign huge free-agent contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The original intent was about business, but Sanders said what
you see during games is pure enjoyment for the game of football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Time comes out for a couple of hours a day for a child's
game,'' Sanders said. ``He plays with joy like he played with as a
child. Prime Time is like a kid playing in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   To be even more truthful, the root of the Prime Time nickname
was never about the way Sanders played football _ though he has
been ``dancing and high stepping on the football field since I was
7 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   ccording to]Knight said the nickname actually started because of
her son's exploits on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said Sanders, an all-star performer in football,
basketball, track and baseball in high school, helped his team win
a game with a last-second shot. One of his teammates said ``It was
a Prime Time play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it started,'' Knight said. ``It was Prime Time. He
was like that in all sports. He's not just a football player. He's
an athlete. My baby is an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Cowboys just want standout The name is not important
to the Cowboys' defense, just the athlete.
</P>
<P>
   And they want the same standout play from the person wearing No.
21 that they were getting in 1998 before he went down with a toe
injury against the Cardinals in November.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who made the Pro Bowl as a punt returner and cornerback
despite missing the last five games, said he wouldn't have come
back at all if he couldn't live up to his past standards.
</P>
<P>
   His return certainly bolsters the Cowboys' hopes of making a run
at a fourth Super Bowl title in the 1990s. Already a solid
contender this season because of their offense, the Cowboys see
Sanders' impact on defense as possibly being the difference in
making a title run.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are ranked 31st in the league in pass defense and
have allowed 11 pass plays of more than 20 yards in two games this
season. Sanders' presence should allow the Cowboys to mix up their
pass coverages and be more aggressive with the blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He allows us to dictate to the offenses instead of them
dictating to us,'' linebacker Dexter Coakley said. ``Deion is a guy
who is pretty much going to take away half of the field, which
allows us to do some things on the other half.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he doesn't need the other half _ the Prime Time guy
_ or football anymore.
</P>
<P>
   His past two contracts with the Cowboys have totaled $87
million. He's a newlywed, and he and his wife, Pilar, are expecting
their first child _ Deion has two from a previous marriage _ early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have already started building on his 35,000-square-foot
dream home on a ranch in Prosper, north of Fort Worth-Dallas. His
ministry is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he continues playing the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always played for the love of the game,'' Sanders said.
``Along with loving the game came perks. If you work hard you
should be able to play hard. My family has been able to play hard.
I can walk away now and be financially secure. There are no
pressures to be out there anymore. I'm here because I love the game
and it comes easy to me, like I'm on the playground.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like he did before there ever was a Prime Time.

 &HT;    Rudd revisiting role in hot seat
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ The heat is on Ricky Rudd at today's NAPA
AutoCare 500, but not like it was in last year's race at
Martinsville Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran driver, who starts in the eighth position today,
hasn't registered a victory this season. With seven races
remaining, Rudd is in danger of ending Winston Cup's longest active
streak of winning at least one race per season, which spans 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd was in a similar situation at the .533-mile Martinsville
oval last year, needing a win to extend the streak. In one of the
most memorable races of the season, Rudd overcame extreme
temperatures in the cockpit and severe burns to earn a drive down
victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that it was physically the toughest race I
have ever been in over the years,'' Rudd said. ``I remember some of
the race but don't remember all of it. Winning or losing simply
came down to survival.''
</P>
<P>
   An unusual set of circumstances put Rudd through the torturing
day. With 93-degree temperatures near the start, he decided to cut
holes in the upholstery in an attempt to flow in more cool air from
the car's ventilation system.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd dressed in a new cooling helmet-and-suit combination and it
malfunctioned on the second lap. As the temperatures rose in the
cockpit for Rudd, his crew tried to help on pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first stop they gave me a little glass of water down my
back and I said, `Man, I need more than (this), I need a garden
hose,''' Rudd recalled. ``I guess they weren't paying attention and
the hose laying in the sun on the asphalt was about 150 degrees and
it just cooked me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the race continued, so did the problems for Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The metal of the seat was burning through my uniform and I had
burns all over my legs and back _ I had blisters all over,'' he
said. ``The heat was the kind of stuff you jump away from, but I
didn't have anywhere to go unless I wanted to sit on the steering
wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hut Stricklin was on stand-by to be a relief driver, but Rudd
defiantly insisted on staying in the No. 10 Ford because it was
running so well. He fought off challenges from John Andretti and
Sterling Marlin to win the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so drained that if somebody spun, I wouldn't use up the
energy trying to turn _ I'd just ricochet off them,'' Rudd said.
``My plan was to take the checkered flag and then just drive
straight to the infield (medical) center and park there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, the detour to victory lane was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Richard Petty (18 years) and David Pearson (17) have longer
season streaks in history than Rudd.

EX-STATE POLICE CHIEF SAYS HIS DISMISSAL WAS REVERSE

 (CORRECTS dismissal to resignation in 2nd graf;   ADDS 7th graf
with background on Verniero;   ADDS NAACP comments in 17th graf)  (bl)  
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. _ The man who was fired as superintendent of
the New Jersey State Police after making public comments linking
minority groups to drug crimes said Saturday that his removal was
an example of reverse discrimination and that Gov. Christie Whitman
had planned all along to replace him with a minority-group member.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public remarks since he resigned under pressure ,
former Superintendent Carl Williams, 59, said he had been used as a
political scapegoat and unfairly branded a racist simply because he
made comments about racial profiling that ``were the truth'' in a
newspaper interview with The Star-Ledger of Newark in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reputation was blackened,'' he said Saturday in his
lawyer's office here, with his wife, Eloise, beside him. ``I want
my reputation back because I didn't do anything wrong. I am the
victim in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks came one day after his lawyer, Clifford Van Syoc,
filed a civil lawsuit in Superior Court in Camden, asserting that
Williams had been wrongfully dismissed for his comments and
discriminated against for being a white man.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses Whitman and former state Attorney General
Peter Verniero of firing him ``in order to replace him with a black
superintendent'' to further their political goals. Williams'
successor, Carson Dunbar, a former FBI agent, is black. His
appointment was confirmed by the state Senate in September.
</P>
<P>
   Pete McDonough, a spokesman for the governor, said he would not
comment on pending litigation, ``no matter how baseless or
boneheaded it is,'' and that he had not seen the lawsuit. Verniero,
who is now a judge on the state Supreme Court, could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero's nomination to the court was contentious, with civil
rights leaders trying to block his appointment. When he was
attorney general, his office spent nearly three years defending
troopers from a court ruling that found evidence that they had
unfairly singled out black drivers on state highways, a practice
known as racial profiling. Verniero had also resisted calls for
changes in the force.
</P>
<P>
   Williams touched off a storm of criticism last February by
telling the Star-Ledger in an interview that certain crimes were
more routinely committed by certain racial and ethic groups.
Williams was quoted as saying: ``Two weeks ago, the president of
the United States went to Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico
about drugs. He didn't go to Ireland. He didn't go to England.
Today, with this drug problem, the drug problem is cocaine or
marijuana. It is most likely a minority group that's involved with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, the same day that his remarks were published,
Whitman dismissed him, saying that the state needed to enhance
public confidence in the police. Williams had been under fire for
weeks over charges that state troopers unfairly singled out black
drivers on state highways, a practice known as racial profiling,
and that he had refused to acknowledge what critics called a long
history of racist procedures by his force.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams called profiling a ``time-honored tool'' of
police work in the interview, he condemned it and said it was
unacceptable. But he also was quoted as saying, ``It would be naive
to think race is not an issue in drug trafficking.'' Minority-group
leaders reacted swiftly and furiously to his printed remarks and
called for his dismissal hours before the governor announced it.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Leroy Jones, D-Essex County, said at the time: ``His
views are dastardly, his thoughts are ill and sickened, and he's
unfit to hold such a critical and important office. He's a racist
of the worst kind, because he doesn't even know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Saturday, however, that his remarks had been
honest, not racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``My remarks in the Newark Star-Ledger were the truth,'' he
said. ``That's the way it is.'' When asked whether he thought they
had been insensitive, he responded: ``I suppose we could play
semantics. What is insensitive?''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says Williams ``was required on occasion to answer
questions from the media, and did so truthfully in accordance with
his nickname, Carl ``The Truth'' Williams. Williams said that state
troopers had given him the nickname years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think back and you're brought up throughout life to
tell the truth, and you always tell the truth, and then you get
your life taken away from you for telling the truth, it's quite a
shock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says, ``There was nothing whatsoever `racially
insensitive' about the statements plaintiff made, which were
truthful and accurate, such that plaintiff was entitled, under the
New Jersey constitution, to make those statements without fear of
adverse consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Robinson, second vice president of the Bergen County
NAACP, said Saturday that Williams had no business suing over his
removal. ``Based on the comments that he made in The Ledger, the
lawsuit is frivolous,'' Robinson said. ``He admitted there was
profiling, and once he made those statements, the governor had no
option.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages, does
not specify an amount. His lawyer, Van Syoc, said that the
Williamses might sue some of the minority-group leaders for
comments they regarded as defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was often praised for his devotion to the state police,
which he joined in 1963. He cruised the highways as a trooper for
years, then, rising through the ranks, worked in the criminal
investigation, organized crime, intelligence, internal affairs and
narcotic units. He was appointed by Whitman early in 1994 to the
$89,963-a-year job of supervising 2,600 troopers and 1,000
civilians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said Saturday that the ``equity'' he had built up over the
years had been destroyed by his dismissal, and that while he had
sent out five resumes seeking other jobs, he had received no
responses. That did not surprise him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being called a racist by some black individuals,'' he
said. ``I'm being called insensitive by the governor and the
attorney general of New Jersey. It gives the impression that
there's something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But most painful, he said, was the damage to his reputation, one
he had built through 35 years of service. ``It, more or less,
submarined my integrity,'' he said in a quavering voice as his wife
wept silently. ``It put an emotional hurt on myself and on my
family, and, most of all, it hurt the state troopers who are out
there protecting the public.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his burden would have been unbearable if not for
the show of support from his family and from the state troopers,
who often dropped by, called, and sent cards and letters. ``I just
think I should be treated fair, and I wasn't treated fair,'' he
said.

EAST CAROLINA REPELS ARMY FOR 5-0 START
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ Unbeaten East Carolina did not need a
dramatic comeback Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, who are ranked 19th in the Associated Press poll of
news media after coming from behind last week to upset Miami, this
time had to withstand a two-touchdown rally by Army in the final
quarter before prevailing, 33-14, at Michie Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Army, those two touchdowns _ the first the
Cadets have scored in the fourth period in four games _ were, in
effect, negated by two costly miscues.
</P>
<P>
   After Army had pulled to 19-7 on a 6-yard run by fullback
Michael Wallace with 9 minutes 33 seconds remaining in the game,
quarterback Joe Gerena was sacked, the ball came loose, and the
bounding ball was recovered by 295-pound tackle Norris McCleary,
who rumbled 40 yards for a touchdown that put the Pirates (5-0)
ahead, 26-7, with 5:09 left.
</P>
<P>
   Army responded with a 65-yard drive that was capped by a 1-yard
run by Gerena to cut the Pirates' lead to 26-14.
</P>
<P>
   But Army's onside kick after the score proved disastrous.
Halfback Marcellus Harris scooped up the squib kick at the Army 46
and, behind a covey of blockers, sprinted down the right sideline
for a touchdown that sealed the victory for East Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring on four of its first five possessions, the Pirates
surged to a 19-0 lead on field goals of 30, 29, 52 and 42 yards by
Kevin Miller along with a 62-yard touchdown pass from quarterback
David Garrard to wide receiver Arnie Powell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I saw at least three missed tackles on that play,''
Army coach Bob Sutton said in referring to Powell's run after his
catch at the Army 35. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another superb passing performance by Garrard, who threw for 338
yards against Miami, and East Carolina's containment of an Army
rushing attack that had been ranked first in Division I-A were the
keys to the Pirates' victory.
</P>
<P>
   Army (1-3) had come into Saturday's contest averaging 339 yards
rushing, but was held to 184 yards, even fewer than it gained
passing, something that rarely happens for the Cadets' run-oriented
wishbone offense. Still, the Cadets outgained East Carolina, which
could amass only 52 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But Garrard, well protected throughout, made up for that
disparity by completing 24 of 34 passes for 300 yards as he
repeatedly found his receivers wide open. Gerena, meanwhile,
connected on 10 of 20 passes for 196 yards. All but one of those
passes were completed in the second half after Gerena hit on only
one of seven passes during the first two quarters.

POACHERS POSING A LARGE THREAT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A multibillion-dollar poaching industry is threatening big-game
animals in North America and the rest of the world, according to a
three-part series in Outdoor Life magazine. And, quoting the World
Wildlife Fund, the magazine says that the profit margin in this
endeavor is third only to that in illegal trade in narcotics and
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the series, in this month's issue, suggests ways to
deal with this problem, including more funds for financially
strapped federal and state fish and game agencies, stiffer fines,
jail penalties and loss of hunting rights, and even, as has
happened, recruiting reformed poachers to the anti-poaching cause.
</P>
<P>
   Also noted are the increasingly sophisticated tools used to
catch outlaw hunters, including laboratories with DNA-identifying
capabilities. And in a developing trend, nine western states have
banded together and agreed that a poacher who loses his right to
hunt in one of those states automatically loses that right in all
the others.
</P>
<P>
   The series points out that only a tiny fraction of the millions
of hunters in the United States defy the law, but most wardens also
believe that only between 5 and 10 percent of the violations are
detected. Trophy antlers of such animals as mule deer, whitetail
deer and elk account for much of the poaching in North America. A
rack from a whitetail buck large enough to be included in the Boone
and Crockett record book can fetch as much as $25,000.

MESSIER NOT READY FOR RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, Oct. 2 _ The jaw juts out as menacingly as ever when
Mark Messier hears something he does like. He may be 38 now and
coming off an injury-plagued 59-game season, the fewest he has ever
played in a regular season in his brilliant career. But mellowing?
Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, hours before the debut of Messier's 21st
National Hockey League season _ which came here against the
Rangers, no less _ Messier was asked if any thoughts of his own
ceremony had crossed his mind in Edmonton the night before, as
Messier took part in the retiring of Wayne Gretzky's number.
</P>
<P>
   Messier had been recalling the ceremony. Upon hearing the
question, his eyes narrowed as he fixed his gaze on the questioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even looking or thinking along those lines,'' Messier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the question was totally out of line. Messier, after
all, is in the final guaranteed year of the deal he signed with the
Canucks, after the Rangers let him _ more like forced him _ to walk
away from them and Gretzky two summers ago. Messier signed a
guaranteed 3-year deal with Vancouver that paid him $6 million each
season, including this one. Next season, the Canucks must decide
whether to pick up the first of two $6 million options or pay
Messier a $2 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The woeful Canucks are perennially rebuilding. It is highly
unlikely they will pick up the option. And that means Saturday
night could be the beginning of Messier's final season.
</P>
<P>
   But Messier, who helped lead the Oilers to five Stanley Cups
before captaining the Rangers to their first Cup in 54 years in
1994, does not like hearing any insinuation that he might be
joining Gretzky in retirement after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's necessary to try to predict that,'' Messier
said. ``Obviously, one day, I'm going to get up to do it and I
won't want to do it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, said Messier, that is not nearly how he feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you never know,'' Messier said, finally cracking wide one
of his trademark grins. ``I just might go fishing and never come
back one day.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a shame. How would the Oilers, and eventually the
Rangers, be able to honor Messier and retire his number if he was
out on his yacht somewhere, incommunicado?
</P>
<P>
   Messier, of course, would rather not think about that just now.
But he did allow himself to reflect on Gretzky's ceremony, and the
one for Gretzky in New York last April, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, from a selfish standpoint, it was just a sad time,
both times,'' Messier said. ``Everybody, we weren't going to be
able to see Wayne play anymore. But you take that out and yesterday
had to be a happy day.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of all those great Oilers from their dynasty years who
participated in the ceremony, only Messier is still actively
playing. Gretzky is retired. So is Jari Kurri. Kevin Lowe ushered
in his NHL coaching career in Edmonton with a 1-1 tie with the
Rangers after the Gretzky ceremony. Craig MacTavish stood beside
Lowe on the Oilers' bench as his assistant. Esa Tikkanen was
sitting up in the press box, dressed in a suit, hoping the Oilers
would change their minds after they did not offer Tikkanen a
contract after he worked out for them all preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Messier? He flew back to Vancouver after the second period to
prepare for Saturday night's game. But not before he joined
Gretzky, Lowe, MacTavish, Dave Semenko and others reminiscing about
their years in Edmonton in Lowe's office before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing time,'' said Messier, whose Canucks play the
Rangers at Madison Square Garden later this month, on Oct. 24. ``We
can get in a room like that and nothing seems to change. It was
just a comfortable feeling. It was a good night.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17,100 fans on hand for the Gretzky ceremony at Skyreach
Centre (formerly known as Northlands Coliseum) obviously felt the
same. When Messier walked out on the ice, the fans showered him
with his old nickname: ``Mooooose!''
</P>
<P>
   Messier said he couldn't remember the last time he had heard
something like that. His nickname was Mess in New York, but he was
called Moose during his Oilers days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That nickname was given to me by my brother'' _ Paul _ ``when
I was 17 or 18,'' said Messier, 6 feet 1 inch and 210 pounds. ``To
show you how much times have changed, then, I was a strapping left
winger. Nowadays, I'm a shifty little centerman. I guess it tells
you where the game has gone.
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested that the fans might have been booing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they were,'' Messier said, knowing full well they were
not. Someone else suggested that Messier had heard the Moooose call
here, in his first game with the Canucks two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, those were boos,'' Messier said, the broad grin returning
to his face.

EX-ANGEL VELARDE FEELS A MEASURE OF GUILT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Randy Velarde knows what it looks like.
</P>
<P>
   He complained. He was traded. Things got tough and he packed his
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Angels' dysfunction was plunging to a new depth,
Velarde high-tailed it for a young, contending team in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone from a losing team expected to win, to a winning
team expected to lose,'' said Velarde, who was traded along with
pitcher Omar Olivares for prospects on July29.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Velarde can't help feeling a measure of guilt for the
Angels' implosion _ one that has resulted in casualties to manager
Terry Collins and general manager Bill Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   It was an implosion Velarde helped to detonate.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde murmured the first public complaints in June,
criticizing Collins for a perceived lack of aggressiveness. He took
specific issue with Collins not allowing him to steal when Mo
Vaughn was at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it seems rather trivial. But it was just a small
portion of Velarde's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people can bottle that stuff. I couldn't,'' Velarde said.
``It was literally killing me inside. I had to vent it. I couldn't
let my poor wife listen to it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even remember who the reporter was. I just got caught
at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, it was leaked that the Angels were discussing a
contract extension for Collins, and that several players _
represented by Vaughn _ aired concerns to Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde, with his week-old comments still reverberating, became
cast as Mutinous Angel No.1
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't the only one who had something to say,'' Velarde
said. ``I was just the first one to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't the last. Darin Erstad called his teammates soft.
Gary DiSarcina questioned their heart. The ripfest came to a
cacophonous climax four weeks ago when Mo Vaughn and Troy Percival
held a very loud and very public shouting match across the visiting
clubhouse in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   By the time all the dirty laundry had been aired, Collins took
the clothesline and hung himself.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde wasn't there to witness the fallout. He had been with
Oakland for more than a month when Collins resigned on Sept.3.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the guilt comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out I'd been traded, I was disappointed, to be
truthful,'' Velarde said. ``I see myself as a faithful person. I
signed a contract to play here. When you're traded, your initial
sense is that maybe you didn't do your job.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys might think I'm crazy, but that's the way I am.
If a problem's in front of me, I don't run away. And I know that's
what it looks like _ that I'm running away from my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   His former Angels teammates don't believe Velarde ran out on
them. They don't harbor any resentment. Vaughn, Jim Edmonds and
Garret Anderson joked and chatted with Velarde near the batting
cage on Tuesday when the A's began a three-game series at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   An usher leaned against the photographers well and watched the
scene with interest. ``A week ago when Terry Collins was here,'' he
said, ``only the coaches went up and said hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde can't feel bad about his on-field performance. If he had
stayed with the Angels through the season, Velarde would have been
the team's MVP.
</P>
<P>
   With two games to play, Velarde was hitting .316 with 16 homers
and 74 RBI. He topped the 100-run mark for the first time in his
career. He was three hits short of 200. He had seven triples, 23
doubles and had stolen 24 bases in 32 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since 1996, he was injury-free the entire
season. No stiffness in his surgically repaired elbow. No strains
or sprains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have health on your side, you have an opportunity to
produce,'' Velarde said. ``Without it, you're a cheerleader. I
always said I'm not a very good cheerleader.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde has played even better since the trade, batting .331
with Oakland, and while the youthful A's came up short in their
inspired playoff run, Velarde provided a much-needed boost.
</P>
<P>
   He made enough of an impression that Oakland GM Billy Beane
already has contacted Velarde's agent about a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   He'll listen to other offers. And no, he doesn't expect any from
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what (the Angels) are going to do,'' he said.
``That's not my problem. That's their problem. I take care of what
I can between the white lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``... And I'm glad it's not my problem, because they've got
their hands full.''

MONTINI-COL _ In the fall of 1944, near a battle front in central
France, an American G.I. named Bob DeHeer was told his services as
an Army mechanic were no longer required. Roughly half of DeHeer's
outfit had been wounded or killed in a German artillery barrage,
and now the enemy was advancing on their position. Since retreat
was not an option, the job for which DeHeer had been trained _
maintaining the company motor pool _ became superfluous. ``So, I
volunteered for machine gun duty,'' he said. By E.J. MONTINI. Story

these past two games, the man who discovered the passer and helped
rebuild the team may finally be recognized around the NFL for just
what he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley Armey is the best there is,'' Rams head coach Dick
Vermeil said of his team's vice president for player personnel.
``How could you not enjoy working with him? Charley knows football
players. There are only eight players left from when I got here (in
1997). We have rebuilt this thing together along with (college
personnel director) John Becker into what we believe will be a good
football team. But when it comes to Kurt, I credit Charley Armey.
He's the reason Kurt's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, the former Patriots assistant director of personnel, may
have made his greatest find not long after his arrival in St. Louis
when he signed Warner on Dec. 26, 1997. At the time, Warner was an
Arena Football legend about whom most people knew little or
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Warner had been cut three years earlier by the Green Bay
Packers. After playing only one year at Northern Iowa and then one
summer in Green Bay and making no impression on a team that already
counted Brett Favre, Mark Brunell, and Ty Detmer among its
quarterbacks, Warner moved off to toil in football obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many young men who come unheralded into the NFL, Warner
was gone before he had a chance. He landed back in Iowa in an
oddball indoor league, where he passed for 10,164 yards and 183
touchdowns (including a remarkable 93 in 17 games in 1997). He
supplemented his meager income by working with at-risk kids for a
local YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Armey suggested to Vermeil that maybe they should sign this kid,
and Vermeil took his advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``His coach at Northern Iowa (Mike Kolling) was my first high
school quarterback when I started in coaching in Graceville,
Minn.,'' Armey recalled. ``I was grateful for that job, and now I'm
grateful to him. He told me the kid could play, and I went to watch
him. He burned up the Arena League and we sent him over to NFL
Europe, and when I saw him there, I knew he was good enough to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner led the Amsterdam Generals to a 7-2 record by completing
165 of 323 passes for 2,101 yards and 15 touchdowns, numbers that
left Armey confident he had done the right thing. After watching
Warner the past two preseasons, that belief was confirmed to his
satisfaction, even when disaster struck in training camp this year
as big-money free agent Trent Green went down for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel we had to run out and sign somebody else,''
Armey said. ``I really had a lot of confidence in Kurt Warner last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner stepped in for Green, and instead of panicking, the Rams
are prospering. Last Sunday, they slapped the defending NFC
champion Falcons silly, and they have given Vermeil every reason to
believe in both Armey's evaluations and his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the end of last season, I've never said anything other
than we'd be a good football team,'' Vermeil said. ``I said a lot
more behind closed doors. Now it's only two games. We haven't done
anything yet. But it's not like we're unlikely performers. We have
good players here.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason they do is Armey, who not only imported Warner but
was instrumental in recommending trading for running back Marshall
Faulk and passing on talented Georgia defensive back Champ Bailey
to select wide receiver Torry Holt in the first round of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey looks like he may become a star one day, but Holt has
been just as impressive and far more valuable to the Rams, who were
already solid at cornerback but without a threat at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The speedy Holt has combined with veteran Isaac Bruce to give
the Rams two dangerous deep threats, while Faulk has picked up
where he left off a year ago in Indianapolis, when he rushed for
more than 1,300 yards and caught passes for more than 900. Handed
those weapons and a solid offensive line to protect him, Warner has
thus far been nothing short of brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt Warner is Larry Bird,'' Rams defensive tackle D'Marco
Farr said in a burst of overzealousness. ``He has the Larry Bird
look. We lost Trent, and they told him, `You're our guy for the
season,' and there was no batting of an eye. Nothing but calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but calm and a 108.6 quarterback rating after two games,
a number Warner reached by completing 45 of 69 passes (65.2
percent) for 584 yards and 6 touchdowns. Vermeil admits no one
could have predicted that, but he quickly adds that one man at
least predicted he could play.
</P>
<P>
   That man is the tall one in the shadows, the one who left New
England with some people in that organization questioning his
ability to evaluate talent. This is a guy who in two years has
brought in Faulk, Holt, Warner, guard Adam Timmerman, young wide
receiver Az-Zahir Hakim, and ex-Patriot linebacker Todd Collins,
players who have become the backbone of the revitalized Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a science,'' Vermeil said of personnel work. ``You
have to be lucky. But Charley Armey helped build a team in New
England that went to the Super Bowl, and he came here and really
liked this kid Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after Trent was hurt and we started to talk about
bringing in a veteran quarterback, Charley was one of the people
who said Warner could do it. We didn't want to confuse the issue
with Trent later by bringing in a veteran, so we assumed Kurt could
step up and we'd grow with him.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the Rams have, with a quarterback from the Arena League
and a personnel director who got his start in the USFL, two guys
left too long on the outside with something to prove.
</P>
<P>
   If they prove it, the world will hear of Kurt Warner soon
enough. A few folks might even hear about a guy who proves his
stuff when players he knows have the right stuff show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of weapons here now,'' said Armey, modestly
neglecting to mention he's one of the guys ordering the armaments.
``The running back is phenomenal. Timmerman has made a huge
difference solidifying the line. (Orlando) Pace is playing tackle
as good as anybody. Todd has come in and really helped our defense.
We're pretty solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the guy who brought them in.
</P>
<P>
   Easing off a little
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil has made a small concession to those who felt the Rams
were practicing too long and too hard since he took over. Although
they still practice more than 2 1/2 hours a day, once the run
defense portion of practice is finished, he allows players to take
off their shoulder pads and finish the drills in shorts and shirts.
``I don't do as much full pad work now because we're further along
as a team,'' Vermeil explained. ``I've figured out if the guy isn't
good enough to make you a playoff-caliber team, longer practices
aren't going to change that. It's my third year back (in coaching)
and I'm trying to do it better. I'm more realistic. The players are
bigger and faster than they were when I was coaching the Eagles.
They hit harder, so it takes a little more out of them and they
need more time to recover.'' . . . There will be something on the
line Sunday when the Rams face the Bengals, even though the two
have been NFL doormats this decade. The loser will be the first
team to reach 100 defeats this decade. St. Louis is 47-99, the
Bengals 48-99 . . . Just to prove that pro football is not a family
business, we point out this fact. Since Bengals founder and
legendary coach Paul Brown died, Cincinnati has gone 39-102 with
his son Mike running the team. Being 0-3 is nothing new to the
Bengals. It is the fourth time this decade they started off that
way . . . If you wonder why they've had so many problems in
Cincinnati, you got a good example this past week, when Brown
released popular starting fullback Brian Milne while he was
rehabbing a sprained knee. That led not only to a grievance but
also to some angry players in the locker room. ``People are going
to look and say, `Man, hard work doesn't pay off,' '' tackle Willie
Anderson snorted. A day later, Brown put hard-luck running back
Ki-Jana Carter (dislocated kneecap) on injured reserve for the year
without telling him. He learned by watching ESPN that he'd suffered
his third season-ending injury in five years . . . Carter has
missed half of his 64 games in a five-year career because of injury
. . . Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is looking to join NASCAR. Well,
sort of. Jones is negotiating to have two cars carry the Cowboys'
colors in the DirecTV 500 at Texas Motor Speedway next April 2 and
at least one car in the Texas 300 a day earlier. Jones has been
negotiating with Action Performance Co., which has licensing deals
with more than 300 drivers. His representatives have spoken with
the sponsors of Bobby Labonte and Rusty Wallace. This would be a
first for an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   Things to do in Denver
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional speech last Wednesday, Denver guard Mark
Schlereth got up in front of his battered teammates and spoke about
the team's 0-3 start and his belief that they were feeling sorry
for themselves and many had become selfish. The speech reportedly
had a deep impact on Schlereth's teammates, who could not question
his dedication since he's had 21 operations and a kidney stone
procedure during his professional career. Schlereth reportedly told
his teammates, ``I've got three (Super Bowl) rings and I'm on my
last leg in this league and I've got 13 more weeks left and I'm
here and I'm going to be out here _ we're going to be out here _
doing it right.'' Whether it makes a difference when the 0-3
Broncos take on the 0-3 Jets in an odd replay of last year's AFC
Championship game is another matter. No defending champion has
started 0-3 and returned to the Super Bowl . . . For the Broncos to
turn things around, they're going to have to get a lot more out of
their offense, which has gone from one of the highest-scoring
machines the last two years to No. 27. Despite the insistence of
head coach Mike Shanahan that this is not because of the retirement
of John Elway, Tampa Bay defensive end Chidi Ahanotu finally said
last weekend that the reason for Denver's sputtering offense is
obvious: Brian Griese. But Shanahan is supposed to be a genius, and
in his genius he pulled veteran Bubby Brister before training camp
was over and installed Griese, causing a crisis of confidence on
several levels. The veteran Brister felt betrayed, many of his
teammates privately supported him, and now the young Griese has not
come through . . . Speaking of offensive ineptitude, how much worse
can it get for the Eagles? Of their 40 offensive possessions, 33
have ended with a punt (25) or turnover (8). Only three of those
drives have gone 35 yards or longer . . . Eagles fullback Kevin
Turner is contemplating his football mortality after suffering a
stinger injury last weekend, when he pinched a nerve in his neck
making a block and his arm temporarily went numb. Turner left the
game and will not play against the Giants. He has had such burning
sensations at least once a game of late and visited a specialist
this past week. Although Turner had talked earlier in the year
about his free agent possibilities next winter, he's now wondering
whether he'll continue to play at all . . . Bears offensive
coordinator Gary Crowton is having a field day with his offense.
The innovative Crowton, former head coach at Louisiana Tech, has
brought his high-powered, multi-pronged attack to the NFL, using
quick counts, no-back formations, shotguns, and no-huddles. ``They
remind me of a high school offense we used to play against in San
Diego,'' said Saints defensive tackle La'Roi Glover. ``They run 100
different formations, and each formation has 100 plays.'' . . . A
week ago we mentioned that John Elway had 18 fourth-quarter
comebacks by the end of is seventh season, while Drew Bledsoe had
14 with 14 games to go in his seventh season. Bledsoe actually had
14 when the season began, so the two this year increase his total
to 16, making him even more likely to pass Elway before this year
is out.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman is bearing up
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Spellman has found a second life in Dallas, where he will
start this weekend at defensive tackle, a position he had never
played before this season. His ex-coach with the Bears, Dave
Wannstedt, was among those who recommended the Cowboys give
Spellman a second chance despite his problems in Chicago, where
Spellman was an underachiever who walked out on the team after he
was finally benched, and then had a nervous breakdown . . . Don't
expect a wave of instant-replay challenges after the results so
far. Of 61 challenged plays in 63 exhibition games, only 14 were
overturned. That ratio is unchanged after three weeks of real play.
``It's still a little rough,'' said Patriots coach Pete Carroll.
``There's still some question marks about it, but I think everyone
on the coaching end is tolerating it, hoping it will eventually
right some wrong down the road this season. I've never been a
proponent of replay because I felt they make the call the best they
can, and that's part of the game. It evens out. But I went with the
numbers on it when we voted and hoped it would work out. They have
a very difficult job making those calls, and now they have a
difficult job ruling with the replay. We had one (in an exhibition
game) where (Vincent) Brisby made a catch in the back of the end
zone we thought was good for a touchdown, and our guys watching the
replay flopped three times on it. If our guys are having that kind
of problem deciding, what is it like for someone with no vested
interest to make a decision? I've always understood those officials
had a very difficult job, but that Brisby play reminded all of us
how hard it is.'' Dallas coach Chan Gailey believed he would use
the challenge system with some regularity, but after going 0 for 5
in challenges in the summer, he changed his approach. ``I will
challenge a lot less than I thought I would have,'' he said. ``I
did not see many overturned in preseason. Whether that was on
purpose to discourage us from challenging or whether it was just
the way it fell, I don't know. Whatever the reason, it happened. It
got to me. I'm not going to challenge very many.'' . . . The main
reason Barry Sanders's agents are making all this noise about
paying back the $5.6 million signing bonus to the Lions is that the
players' union informed Sanders's father last week he has no legal
chance of keeping the money because of a clause in his contract
that covered a non-injury-related retirement. As good a guy as
Sanders is, his reputation is taking a beating over this because
he's acting like a spoiled, manipulative brat instead of the
honorable man he's always been. Have we seen this before in sports?
. . . Buffalo general manager John Butler knows the injury problems
that decimated the Jets will be difficult to overcome but he also
knows it's much too early to write anybody off. ``We haven't heard
the last of the Jets,'' Butler cautioned. ``Sure it's terrible to
lose a key player so early in the season, especially when he's your
quarterback (Vinny Testaverde). That changes things for them, but
this is where a team's character and leadership comes in. They have
some good players there like Bryan Cox and Keyshawn Johnson and
they have to step up and they will, because invariably with a good
team when something like this happens early they bind together. It
can bring a team together if you have the right players and I think
the Jets do. They realize it's still a long season to go and a lot
of things can happen and now they don't wait on someone else to
make a play. They make the plays. They're like wounded dogs now and
that's a very dangerous animal.'' According to Butler, the Jets
also have time on their side. ``Things can change so much in a few
weeks,'' he said. ``It's not like the other sports because each
game is so much larger a part of our season. You see a team winning
for a few weeks and they seem to be one thing and by the end of the
year, it's the complete opposite. So while the injuries certainly
hurt the Jets, it's too early to say it finished them. Who in the
hell thought Vinny or Doug (Flutie) were going to do what they did
last year? A quarterback is only as good as the talent around him
and the Jets still have a lot of talent.''

PIPPEN WEARS OUT ANOTHER WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen got his wish, sort of. He's free of his newly
minted adversary, Charles Barkley. But he still loves LA, although
it may be an unrequited passion.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, Pippen signed with Houston and then, in an
article in ESPN Magazine, detailed at length how different it was
from his years of purgatory in Chicago. Now, he's in Portland after
bad-mouthing Barkley, who, lest we forget, worked for the NBA
equivalent of bag-boy money last year so Pippen, whose signing he
endorsed, could get the big payday.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Pippen wanted out of Houston, and the Rockets
could accommodate him in this salary cap-strangled league, is a
minor miracle in and of itself given Pippen's age (34), health (on
again/off again), performance from last year (mostly off again),
and recent cheesy behavior (bad form). After Barkley delivered a
mild, shut-up-and-play dictum, Pippen went on ESPN and brought out
the Big Berthas. He invoked the name of the sacrosanct Michael
Jordan, who, Pippen said, told him Barkley would never win a title.
(Pippen appparently doesn't know what Jordan has said about him
behind closed doors.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad mix for Pippen in Houston. It wasn't a great mix
for any of the Jordanaires who went elsewhere after title No. 6.
Steve Kerr couldn't get off the bench in San Antonio. Jud Buechler
was still a one-dimensional role player. Dennis Rodman, well, never
mind. The Bulls' diaspora created a lot of wealthy guys who
struggled to find themselves in new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was the most visible. He had a new team, loaded with
veterans, which never got in sync. There was a new system to adjust
to after a lockout. There was a huge sense of expectation that
never materialized. Pippen always felt unappreciated in Chicago and
now, finally free of that ogre Jerry Krause, he was going to win
and be happy in Houston. The Rockets lost and he lost it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's in Portland _ at least for the time being. How's he
going to feel watching Damon Stoudamire hog the ball? The
expectation there will be every bit as great as it was in Houston;
the Trail Blazers will be the team to beat. He may have to learn to
play fewer minutes on the deep Blazers _ maybe even come off the
bench, for goodness sakes _ and this will be his third coach and
system in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen wants LA and Phil Jax and the triangle and the presumed
greener grass. He still could get it; Portland GM Bob Whitsitt, who
unloaded half of the Willamette Valley to get Pippen, loves Glen
Rice. The holdup may well be Jerry Buss's reluctance to take on
Pippen's diamond parachute (four years, $68 million), which is mere
pocket change for Blazers owner Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of this story is that if you whine long enough and
loud enough, and if you're good enough, something's going to
happen. We thought we had seen the last of the Scottie Pippen who
wouldn't go into a game because Toni Kukoc was getting the last
shot. Apparently, that evil twin is back. The Rockets recognized
rightly that to bring Pippen back would have been untenable. He had
made it thus. Now, he's someone else's headache.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettable bottom line
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McHale was in the most jovial of moods this weekend. Who
could blame him? He went into the Hall of Fame. He had his friends
and family along to share the moment. He even got to ramble on for
the media about a number of topics.
</P>
<P>
   Then someone asked him about managing the Timberwolves and the
losses of Stephon Marbury and Tom Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was supposed to be a fun weekend,'' he quipped.
``You trying to depress me?''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on about how players have a lot of options these
days and how the real challenge is to keep what you have and build
on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But until these guys buy into the concept of team success,
you've got no chance,'' he said. ``Basketball has become too
individualized. It's not an individual game.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, he sounds like Mozart. To others, he sounds like a
fingernail across the blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   McHale paints the agents as the villains in the mess. (He must
have loved seeing David Falk this weekend; Falk was on hand for his
friend and client, John Thompson.) You don't have to prod very hard
to get his take on the negotiating process, which, you probably
know by now, is quite unappealing to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these guys are lawyers,'' he said in a separate
interview before his induction. ``I watch `Matlock' and `Perry
Mason,' but that doesn't mean I know anything about law. How does
watching those shows make me a lawyer? But these guys will tell you
`my guy can do this' and `my guy can do that,' and I say, `Your
basketball background is? Stanford Law School? Oh, I can see why
you know so much.' It drives me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agents will tell you what their guy averaged and how
much he helps the team and so forth, right, Kev? He clearly was on
a roll about one of his favorite topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know everything about basketball, and their basketball
background is none,'' he said. ``I'm thinking, `How can you be so
smart and never play?' But if they have leverage, the agents will
just try to kill you. If they have no leverage, they want to be
fair. My thing is, why don't we start out with being fair?''
</P>
<P>
   He recounted his recent negotiations with Bill Duffy, the agent
for Terrell Brandon. The Wolves re-signed Brandon for $60 million.
McHale and Duffy roomed at Minnesota and are close friends; when
McHale thought he was about to be drafted by Golden State, he
called Duffy, who was living in Northern California at the time,
and told him to clear out the guest bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talked with Billy (about Brandon), I said, `Let's try
something unique: I won't lie to you, and you don't lie to me.' And
everything went smoothly,'' McHale said. ``But the problem is that
these guys all lie to you and you're forced to lie to them, and it
becomes a big B.S. fest.' One agent told me about his client. I
said, `What number is that guy? I haven't seen him. He's been on
our team for two years? I must have missed this guy. He plays on
our team and he does all this? That's pretty impressive. Where have
I been?' ''
</P>
<P>
   McHale has a new nucleus built around Kevin Garnett, who, he
says, does not share the selfish, me-first, how-many-did-I-score?
attitude of many of today's young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin loves to play, first of all,'' he said. ``A lot of these
guys love to get paid. I keep on telling them, `You're supposed to
love to play. I know it sounds like pay, but it's different.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a burning desire to be the best player in the
league,'' McHale said. ``I don't think he wants to accept anything
less than that. That's refreshing. It's fun to see a guy play that
way. He understands he's at a level where he's such a highly
talented, multidimensional player that he'll be judged on how his
team does, not how he does. When you understand that at an early
age, you become a lot better player. When your only focus is to win
the game, it's very easy to play. Then you're willing to do
whatever it takes to win that game. If your focus is to score 25
points, where does winning the game come into that? He's not into
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave's world
</P>
<P>
   McHale's various moves around the basket have become a staple on
the international scene. ``I've been really struck by that,'' said
his former boss, Dave Gavitt, whose travels take him to remote
outposts all over the world. ``Kevin's low-post repertoire is the
primer, worldwide. All those duck-unders and things he used to do,
they're studied internationally. It's an absolute primer on how to
do it, and it's amazing that one player could have such an
impact.'' Gavitt, by the way, said he did talk with McHale about
remaining in the Boston organization after retirement. McHale said
he might have stayed had anyone offered anything, but no one did.
``I wanted to talk him into waiting to make it official until the
season was behind us for a month,'' Gavitt said. (McHale, of
course, made it official on the floor of the Charlotte Coliseum
after the Celtics were eliminated by the Hornets.) ``But I had no
success with that. Kevin was Kevin. He wasn't going to step back.
Our ownership situation at the time was very unsettled, and I think
he looked at that and said, `No way.' He was really of a mind that
he wanted to go home. We knew Jack (McCloskey, the Wolves' GM)
wasn't going to stay around much longer, and I think it was just
more comfortable for him to go back home. With him and Larry
(Bird), it's harder to do it where you played. They both went back
to where they're from.'' . . . The man McHale keelhauled in the
1984 NBA Finals, Kurt Rambis, has a new job with his old team.
Rambis will be a front office adviser for the Lakers, focusing on
the business side. ``I want to get back into coaching,'' he said.
``But this will give me an opportunity to know the business
operations a little better. (Owner) Jerry Buss gave me this
opportunity to learn, and I'll continue to learn. I don't see how
that can be a bad thing.'' Asked about McHale's defense, Rambis
said, ``I wouldn't say he was up there as one of the top defenders
I faced. But I also wouldn't say stopping me was any great feat.''
. . . Free agent Rick Mahorn, meanwhile, is waiting for the phone
to ring. ``I'm not too stressed about it,'' he said. ``I'd love to
play one more year. I'd love to play up in Boston, to prove to
those young guys that you can be old and competitive.'' Mahorn
played for the Sixers last season, and Larry Brown loved his
locker-room presence. The Sixers have no room for him this year, it
seems. Mahorn said if he does not get a job, he'd like to get into
coaching, although a player/assistant position might be the best of
both worlds. ``That's basically what I was last year in Philly,
anyway,'' he said . . . The Celtics will christen Conseco
Fieldhouse, the retro/avant garde home of the Indiana Pacers.
Indy's home opener against Boston is Nov. 6. Of the five arenas
opening this year _ Philips Arena in Atlanta, American Airlines
Arena in Miami, Staples Center in Los Angeles, and the Pepsi Center
in Denver _ the Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis is the only one
opening with a basketball game. However, of those five arenas, only
Indiana's is not shared with a National Hockey League team. Still,
you've got to love Indy to open the building with a basketball
game. The only thing better would have been the Kingston Trio.
</P>
<P>
   Flunking one test
</P>
<P>
   While we noted McHale's many achievements and highlights this
past week, one of the lowlights was his inability to win the state
high school title. His senior-year team in Hibbing, Minn., advanced
to the title game against Bloomington-Jefferson, whose big man,
Steve Lingenfelter, had a cup of coffee in the NBA. Well, Hibbing
High had the lead at the half and couldn't hold it. McHale got into
foul trouble, and the picture on the front page of the Hibbing
paper the next day showed cheerleader Lynn Spearman in tears. She
eventually married McHale. ``At the time, it was one of the most
disappointing things that ever happened to me,'' McHale said. ``A
lot of stuff happened after that that put it in perspective.
Lingenfelter's mom was dying and she was at the game. He knew it.
The guys on the team knew it. We should have won, but other forces
were at work that day. We were a better team, but we didn't win.''
His high school coach and Hall of Fame presenter, Gary Addington,
remembers it the same way. ``Have I replayed that game? Many, many
times to see if I would have done things differently. That was one
of the great frustrations of my coaching career.''

WILL DAFOE REALLY GO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps we have seen the last of Byron Dafoe in Boston black and
gold, but I don't think there are many people around here _ fans,
media, management, or Dafoe himself _ who believe that.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In disgust, Dafoe banged the table with his last possible trump
card last week, asking to be dealt, saying he had no alternative
when Boston boss Harry Sinden suggested a $4 million-a-year deal
could lead to the club's financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe hasn't been here long enough to receive Sinden's bankrupt
bombast with the same deaf ear that all of New England has learned
to apply by now. Of course, I'm not the one stuck between a $9
million and $12 million payday, so it's easy for me to chuckle at
it all. Sinden's assertion that Dafoe's dollars could lead the
Causeway cash cow to bankruptcy is nothing more than standard
Sinden posturing, in a sense a variety of British comedy (if you're
not sure it's a joke, just laugh, and keep on negotiating).
</P>
<P>
   Sinden now suggesting that the two sides hand the issue to an
arbitrator _ a process he has always loathed _ is proof that the
budget has room to meet Dafoe's figure. Otherwise, Sinden wouldn't
dare put his budget at risk, no matter how firmly he believes that
the arbitrator will side with management's figure.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, following the Dmitri Khristich situation, Sinden said
the arbitrator didn't understand terminology referring to teams
skating at full strength. Ouch. The next arbitrator might not
understand the term ``Stanley Cup winner.'' Then what? Dafoe gets
awarded $5.2 million a year?
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe and his agent, Ron Salcer, have one far better alternative
than seeking a trade or entering ``back-door'' arbitration: come
back to the table with focus, targeting a two-year contract, and
sit in the room until the deal is done. How bad could it be? Worst
case: two years, total $5 million plus incentives? Maybe better?
</P>
<P>
   Given the NHL calendar, a two-year deal would expire in about 18
months. Dafoe would be back at the table in the spring of 2001,
armed with the leverage that he would become an unrestricted free
agent only a year later. No-brainer. If he still has the goods, his
impending free agency and the natural spiraling inflation that is
built into the game should make him rich beyond imagination. And
again, that's only a year and a half down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Now, failing that, what happens? If Dafoe remains out, there's
true risk on both sides, because goalies too easily lose their
stuff (edge, magic, whatever you want to call it). A goalie in
mothballs quickly can become a dwindling, dated asset. We saw that
only last season with Felix Potvin, who sat out in a contract
dispute with the Leafs and ultimately got traded to the Islanders,
only to find he couldn't stop a beachball (11 games, 2-7-1, 3.66
goals-against mark) when he got back in net.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of others have lost it, even without sitting around to
atrophy. Let us not forget Blaine ``Let 'em in'' Lacher and, even
more frightening, ex-Vezina winner Jim Carey. Lacher is back in
Medicine Hat, Alberta, and when last contacted, he was happy to be
out of the puck-stopping business. He wasn't alone in that feeling.
Only 25 years old, Carey wasn't offered an invitation to anyone's
camp this fall and is now in Madison, Wis. (where his wife is
taking college classes), hoping that an employment opportunity
comes his way.
</P>
<P>
   According to his agent, ex-Bruin Brian Lawton, Carey had nibbles
from Carolina and Tampa Bay over the summer, but ultimately neither
club extended offers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton, reached Friday at his Minnesota office, was asked how
Carey was feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's he feeling? Oh, I don't think he feels great about the
whole thing,'' said Lawton. ``He's been down a rough road, and he
feels like he's been beaten up some. Those things can burn the
passion out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bought out by the Bruins last season when he was in Providence,
Carey was picked up by St. Louis, where he was 1-2-0 with a 3.86
GAA in four games. He got bought out there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Could Dafoe suddenly become another Lacher, another Carey? Not
likely. But who thought Potvin would be elite one day and in deep
retreat the next? Lacher was a key one minute, a Keystone Kop the
next. It can happen. And fast.
</P>
<P>
   From that perspective, the Bruins never will get more for Dafoe
in trade than today. From that perspective, perhaps the gregarious
goalie might want to get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden has made hasty, emotional trades in the past. Tom Fergus
essentially asked out in October '85, when he said he wouldn't wear
the Boston sweater again, angered that Sinden refused to
renegotiate his contract (he was making $125,000 a year). Within
days, Fergus was dished to Toronto. In the exchange, the Bruins
acquired veteran pivot Bill Derlago, who lasted all of 39 games
before he was dealt to Winnipeg for Wade Campbell, a young
defenseman who ended up playing only 28 games in black and gold
over three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fergus, 23 when he left Boston, went on to play six-plus seasons
in Toronto, where he three times broke the 20-goal plateau, and he
finished up his NHL career with a couple of seasons in Vancouver
before a two-year farewell tour in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden believed at the time he was getting fair value in return.
History proved otherwise. From Boston's standpoint, it was a total
bust. Fergus also believed he'd be better off elsewhere. His money
improved, but he was never as effective as he was in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It is in neither party's interest right now for Dafoe to go. The
Bruins almost assuredly wouldn't get equal value, and there are a
lot of teams in the Original 28 today that wouldn't offer Dafoe the
supporting cast he has right here in the Hub. He has to realize the
fact that, in part, he can boast strong numbers because of the
solid front-to-back defense that surrounds him. How do you suppose
his numbers would read in Nashville?
</P>
<P>
   Emotions have collided again on Causeway, leading Sinden to fall
back on his dyed-in-the-wool laments over his budget and sending
Dafoe into a pay-me-or-trade-me tizzy that puts him in an
impossible situation with the fans, few of whom can fathom what it
would be like to fret over such mountainous sums. Time for them
both to ask for a line change _ get Id, Ego, and Superego off the
ice _ and sit down with a realistic vision of what a two-year deal
should look like.
</P>
<P>
   Hawgood is back
</P>
<P>
   One of Boston's more entertaining alums, Greg Hawgood, caught on
with the Canucks (a one-year deal worth $450,000). Hawgie Hockey is
back. ``I have a different appreciation for it now,'' said Hawgood,
who started his career in the Hub and played a couple of years here
before being dealt to Edmonton for Rosie Ruzicka. ``I've been in
the NHL, gone to the IHL, back again now with Vancouver. When you
are away for a while, you just see things in a different way. A lot
of guys make decent money in the `I,' it's good, but it's not close
to the NHL. The money, really, doesn't matter to me as long as it's
fair, and the Canucks have been nothing but honorable and extremely
fair. There's really no such a thing as a bad contract in the
NHL.'' . . . Mixed results for a bunch of ex-Bruins looking to
catch on with training camp tryouts. It appeared Randy Burridge had
a job won with Detroit, but he was one of the Winged Wheels' final
cuts. Sandy Moger and Steve Leach failed to catch on with the
Penguins, although GM Craig Patrick expressed interest in finding a
spot for Leach in the minors, just to keep him around as insurance
(the role Leach filled late last season for the Coyotes). However,
Cam Stewart won a spot with the Panthers after convincing
management to give him a look with the condition that, if he didn't
crack the big lineup, he could return to Houston, where he was a
key contributor to the Aeros' IHL championship last season. But
Stewart's grittiness _ especially his willingness to work the
corners _ impressed head coach Terry Murray, and he'll start the
season on a line with Rob Niedermayer and Radek Dvorak. Stewart's
last fling in Boston was a 15-game run in the ill-fated 1996-97
season, leading him to Houston . . . The season opened Friday night
with 25 Group 2 free agents (similar to Dafoe) unsigned. That
doesn't include some previously highly compensated players who
remain in search of work: Ulf Samuelsson, Mark Tinordi, Joe Juneau,
Joe Murphy, Ray Sheppard, and Pat Verbeek. Sameulsson's chance of
landing back with the Rangers all but disappeared Thursday when the
Blueshirts acquired Kevin Hatcher for Peter Popovic. Hatcher will
pull down $3.1 million this season, as opposed to Popovic's $1.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer hooks on
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Bruins draft pick Ben Clymer, selected 27th overall in the
'97 draft, took a tryout fling with Tampa Bay and Friday was
rewarded with a three-year deal that his agent, Lawton, said is
worth $2.5 million (slightly ahead of what the Bruins gave Nick
Boynton). According to Lawton, Boston never got beyond offering
Clymer, a 6-foot-1-inch, 200-pound defenseman, more than $100,000.
The Bruins were headed to arbitration with Clymer this fall (after
classifying him a defected player), but, according to Lawton,
finally released him as a free agent at the start of September.
Clymer will start the year with the Detroit Vipers (IHL) for
seasoning. ``I can't understand what Boston was thinking,'' said
Lawton. ``Ben really wanted to be a Boston Bruin, but for $100,000?
What choice did we have? I asked (assistant GM) Mike (O'Connell)
for something, anything, to get it done _ maybe $400,000 or
$500,000. I mean, a No. 27 pick for $100,000? But, hey, that's the
Bruins. I'd say they lost out, but they'd probably say they made
out best, if I know them.'' . . . Washington GM George McPhee, an
on-ice brat in his playing days, sucker-punched Chicago coach Lorne
Molleken following a Capitals-Blackhawks game last week in
Columbus, Ohio. McPhee felt Molleken loaded his lineup with thugs
and then delivered his objection with the poke to the coach's
kisser (leaving Molleken with lingering double vision). And you
thought ``Slap Shot'' was an exaggeration. The league cuffed McPhee
with a $20,000 fine and told him to stay away from his own team for
a month _ never mind anyone else's squad. Loved these remarks from
Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz, good friend of ex-con Alan Eagleson:
``There's a code of conduct . . . You just don't do things like
this . . . The problem is, not enough people realize what this
whole game's about.'' Do you suppose Wirtz was reading from the
Europeans' postgame script at the Ryder Cup? Gentlemen, please, a
little etiquette. And, oh, game on!

HEARTBREAK IN CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Their orange helmets are blank, making them the only
team in pro football without a logo on their heads. This is a
mistake. What the Cleveland Browns should do immediately is find a
picture of a teary-eyed blues singer and make that their official
emblem.
</P>
<P>
   If not that, the Browns should become the first team to have a
detailed hologram on their helmets. View it from one angle and
you'd see a happy couple holding hands. View it from another and
you'd see a lawyer between the couple trying to figure out who gets
the car and who gets the house.
</P>
<P>
   The heartbreak theme is a natural in this city. You know how
some people throw rice at the end of weddings? Not here. They
shower newlyweds with divorce lawyers' business cards, just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know. You don't have to tell me. I am miserable. I can't
help it. This happens every time I return to this city by Lake
Erie, 30 miles from my hometown. All the old memories will start to
circle me Sunday afternoon when the Browns play the Patriots at
Cleveland Browns Stadium. By 4 o'clock, when Drew Bledsoe will have
thrown for 400 yards and five touchdowns (47-10, Pats?), the
memories will have me pinned against a wall, taunting, ``Look,
chump. We'll never let you forget us. Never. Understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Forget? Please. Want to know how old I was when I first had my
heart broken by the Browns? Three, I think. I learned Al Green
lyrics before I learned my ABCs. My first writing assignment didn't
come in school; I think it was the following exchange with Ann
Landers.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ann:
</P>
<P>
   I am 3 years old. Most people in my family are Browns fans.
Because of this, they all trade depressing heartbreak stories.
Husbands come home, see their wives and say, ``What are you doing
here? I thought you would have left me by now.'' I don't want to
live like this. Ann, my love, take me away.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bummed Out By The Browns &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Bummed:
</P>
<P>
   It's too late. You're ruined. Stop stalking me.
</P>
<P>
   There still is plenty to like about Browns history. The great
Jim Brown spent his entire career here. By the time I was 10, I
could recite all of Brown's quirks, even though I never saw him
play. For example, he used to get up slowly after being tackled,
making people wonder if the hits had dazed him. He then would go
back to the huddle, take the ball on the very next play and flatten
a linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brown, one of the game's top innovators, started the
franchise. If you think the war between Robert Kraft and Bill
Parcells is significant, you should have seen Brown-Art Modell.
Parcells went to coach an existing team when he couldn't get his
way. Brown founded a team _ the Bengals _ when he and Modell could
not coexist. If you approach a stranger in Cleveland and say you
love Paul Brown, you are almost guaranteed to have a peaceful
conversation. If you say you love Modell, there's a good chance you
will be the plaintiff and the stranger the defendant on ``Judge
Judy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Browns should have the climactic scene from ``Romeo
and Juliet'' on their helmets, a reminder of how close they have
been to bliss. They never have been to the Super Bowl. They thought
they were going after the 1986 season. A local band even took the
words from ``Louie, Louie'' and made ``Bernie, Bernie'' in honor of
quarterback Bernie Kosar. But John Elway drove the Broncos 98 yards
in the final minute of the fourth quarter to win the AFC
Championship game that year. The next year, in a conference title
rematch with the Broncos, running back Earnest Byner fumbled as he
was crossing the goal line and the Browns were denied again.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, the Browns always knew how to produce a coaching
drama that would twist your mind and confuse your heart. That's
because your overly sentimental heart told you, above all, that you
loved the team. But the facts were that Modell divorced himself
from established head coaches like Brown and Marty Schottenheimer
and raved about an unproven one, Bill Belichick, who was hated here
even after his team made the playoffs. I'll never forget stories of
fans burning their season tickets and picketing the team's offices
when news broke that Kosar was released by Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Modell tried to move the Browns in 1995. He couldn't. He moved
the team, but he was prevented from taking the name, colors, and
history. And even though he is a New Yorker, Modell is haunted by
Browns memories, too. If he is ever seen in the stadium, it won't
be Art imitates life; it will be more like Art running for his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, fans by the Great Lake of Heartbreak will
witness a different kind of pain. It's one thing to have your
dreams taken from you suddenly in a playoff game. But this Browns
season shows the cruelest way to crack a heart: You know the wins
won't come, but you still have to wait for the end of the season
for the emotional wreckage to be official. By January, the Browns
may have a couple of wins, but even the players know a win will not
come Sunday. The fans know it, too. You get that kind of insight
when you've been heartbroken for years.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this _ through baseball _ shortly after
arriving here this weekend. My grandmother, who still refuses to
forgive Jose Mesa for failing to protect a (Game 7) World Series
lead in '97, wanted me to watch the Indians-Blue Jays game with her
Friday night. The Indians had a 5-2 lead in that game. ``They're
going to lose,'' my grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   They lost, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   I think a fractured-heart logo would look interesting on a
helmet.

NOT AN A-1 JOB BY BC? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston College's inability to win a football game in October
seemed as though it had become a rite of autumn. The last two
seasons, at the first sign of turning leaves and a chill in the
air, it seemed the Eagles would head south for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   But not Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles (4-0) averted another October collapse by delivering
third-year coach Tom O'Brien his first BC victory in the month, a
hard-fought yet flawed 33-22 decision over Division 1-AA
Northeastern (1-3).
</P>
<P>
   Playing before an Alumni Stadium crowd of 42,032 on a
resplendent afternoon, the Eagles snapped an 0-for-8 October skein
with an effort that was good in some parts but certainly ugly in
the final summation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Northeastern a lot of credit,'' said O'Brien,
whose team travels to Philadelphia to play Temple next week. ``They
came in today and played an outstanding game. They did a good job
against us. Looking at our play, heck, obviously we didn't play
well. We didn't finish the game well.''
</P>
<P>
   The good part was that the Eagles scored 33 points, their most
so far this season. The bad part was that BC's offense, which
generated just one touchdown and 307 yards total offense (to NU's
401), gave away three fumbles and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   If the Eagles had not converted three of five Northeastern
turnovers into touchdowns _ Frank Chamberlin's 12-yard fumble
recovery, Ralph Parent's 15-yard return of a blocked punt, and
RaMon Johnson's 27-yard interception return _ BC likely would not
have survived its dogfight against the hungry Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we didn't play well today, but at the same time
they did a great job on defense,'' said BC junior quarterback Tim
Hasselbeck, who completed 11 of 26 passes for 113 yards and was
victimized by two interceptions (one in the end zone by Brian
Whitman) and three sacks (including two by Zach Falconer).
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tip your hat to them because of what they did. But
maybe it's a reality check for us a little bit, and maybe we're not
as good as we thought we were.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, it was apparent the Huskies had arrived not
only ready to play, but ready to win. William Griffin returned the
opening kickoff 58 yards to the BC 39 and, one play later,
quarterback Jason Quinlan found Dave Klemic with a 39-yard
touchdown on a flea flicker to give Northeastern a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to the game today and I told our seniors at the half,
that we're not coming for a moral victory,'' said NU coach Barry
Gallup, a BC graduate (Class of '69) and assistant under former
Eagles coach Jack Bicknell. ``We came to win the football game and
I am proud of our effort. We made some mistakes and they took
advantage of it, that's why they're 4-0.''
</P>
<P>
   After NU's flea flicker staggered BC _ ``I don't think it put
any more pressure on us, but it woke us up, that's what it did,''
said senior free safety Pedro Cirino _ the Eagles answered with a
10-play, 73-yard march that was highlighted by Hasselbeck's 34-yard
completion to Derrick Crittenden. The drive was capped one play
later by William Green's first collegiate TD on a 2-yard plunge.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last time BC's offense would score on the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Senior John Matich rallied BC to a 13-7 lead by converting field
goals of 37 and 45 yards. But the Huskies went 71 yards in eight
plays to take a 14-13 lead on Quinlan's 1-yard plunge with 4:12
left.
</P>
<P>
   However Chris Hovan stripped freshman tailback Tim Gale and
Chamberlin recovered to score on a 12-yard return, enabling BC to
take a 20-14 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, and this is to take nothing away from Northeastern, we
played tight,'' O'Brien said. ``We dropped balls. We did things
that we don't normally do. I've been a part of this game where you
play Division 1-AA teams and there is something psychological about
it. These kids pressed.''
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless third quarter, the Eagles got two more scores
off turnovers when Parent gathered in Bessette's blocked punt and
scored a 15-yard TD that made it 26-14. Johnson seemed to put the
game out of reach with 8:49 left when he intercepted Quinlan (21 of
39, 205 yards, 2 interceptions, 1 TD) and scored on a 27-yard
return, but BC fumbles on two of its last three possessions
resulted in one last Northeastern score when Fred Vallett found
Michael Mack with a 24-yard pass with 3:26 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our team was just as up for this game as any other
game. You could see it in guys' faces in the locker room and you
could see it when they took the field,'' Hasselbeck said.
``Northeastern, their intensity was the same thing and they just
did a good job. Maybe Northeastern thought it had something to
prove, but they proved they're a good football team today, in my
eyes and everyone else's, too.''

EUROPEANS ARE NO ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The answer is: Miguel Angel Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Why did Europe win the Ryder Cup in 1997?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: It wasn't that celebration on the 17th green.
</P>
<P>
   The question: Why did the United States win the Ryder Cup in
1999?
</P>
<P>
   Now keep last week's competition fresh in your minds as we go
back two years to the shameless incident involving Martin. He had
earned a spot on the European Ryder Cup team, however disappointing
that was to captain Seve Ballesteros, who deemed Martin unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   So what a stroke of good fortune it was for Ballesteros when
Martin injured his wrist. The European captain seized the
opportunity, which became all the more important when Jose Maria
Olazabal could make it only to 11th in the standings. Ballesteros
demanded Martin prove to him he could play in mid-August, a month
before the matches at Valderrama, but Martin objected. He needed
more time.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, said Ballesteros, that proved Martin was not ready.
Hiding his smile, Ballesteros said it was unfortunate, but he would
have to dismiss Martin and elevate Olazabal. Shame on European Tour
officials for going along with it. With Olazabal a qualifier, the
captain could still pick Jesper Parnevik and Nick Faldo. The
Europeans won, though dignity was not part of the package, forsaken
at the expense of Martin's honor. Who can ever forget the two team
photos, one with, one without Martin?
</P>
<P>
   Move forward to 1999 and Justin Leonard's dramatics at The
Country Club's 17th hole. The pileup on the green was excessive and
in poor taste, and the Americans rightfully apologized. The
European players shouldn't be alone in their condemnation of the US
team's behavior; any dignified golf fan should be appalled.
Olazabal still had a makeable putt that could have halved the hole
(see: 1999 Masters, 13th hole on Sunday), so how in the name of
Robert Tyre Jones Jr. could we sink to a level of celebrating putts
that clinch at least a tie for a hole when the match is still on
the line?
</P>
<P>
   A British golf writer suggested Ben Crenshaw should have done
the sporting thing and conceded Olazabal's birdie putt. That would
have been an incredible measure given the circumstances (this was
not Jack Nicklaus-Tony Jacklin 1969, i.e. a short putt with the
outcome already decided), so it's understandable why such an act
was not taken.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Ballesteros's handling of the Martin affair, which
two years later still smells, the incident at the 17th green was
spontaneous, not calculated. It may have dropped a towel of bad
taste over the event, but it should not cover up this fact: The
Europeans had their hands on the Ryder Cup and dropped it like a
2-year-old trying to handle a wet glass.
</P>
<P>
   Mark James, bless his wit and personality, rode seven players
hard and gained a two-day lead, perhaps the only logical strategy
he had. Alas, the strategy backfired because five of them _ Lee
Westwood, Darren Clarke, Sergio Garcia, Parnevik, and Miguel Angel
Jimenez _ had nothing left for Sunday's singles; they won just one
hole each on the front. Europe could not let the US build momentum,
but it did, long before Leonard's putt at 17.
</P>
<P>
   There is much second-guessing that could be done. Why didn't
James put Colin Montgomerie out first or second to get a point
early and prevent the steamroll that evolved? Why put Garcia (he's
great, but he's still just 19) 11th, where there was too much
pressure on him? Why pick Andrew Coltart if you didn't have
confidence in him? Surely, Bernhard Langer or Faldo could have
offered something for a team match and allowed a stalwart to rest.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides are guilty of taking this precious event a bit
too far. The golf was sensational last Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday, and tens of thousands in person, and millions more on TV,
got to view a thrilling competition.
</P>
<P>
   It should concern all golf fans that we're spending too much
time talking about the behavior, not the play, inside the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance isn't bliss
</P>
<P>
   So what to make of all these complaints about spectators at The
Country Club? Only this: If you desire to be a major sport and
attract a wider audience (and governing bodies of golf everywhere
must answer yes on both counts), then you have to take the good
with the bad.
</P>
<P>
   The good being big TV contracts, and large, excited galleries,
97 percent of which are excellent.
</P>
<P>
   The bad being that 3 percent, like the moron who reportedly spit
at James's wife, Jane; those who hurled crude remarks at
Montgomerie; or the guy who stood near the 17th green in falling
darkness last Friday, heckling Tiger Woods and David Duval. No
Montgomerie basher was as rude as this guy standing there chanting
``0-for, 0-for, 0-for,'' as the American players were about to lose
their four-ball match with Westwood and Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   At first, there was pity among the crowd for Woods and Duval,
being heckled by a man who no doubt had stopped in at The Country
Club on his way to a WWF engagement. Faith was quickly restored
when some folks told the guy to shut up. He didn't, of course; but
thankfully he also didn't ruin a once-in-a-lifetime experience for
97 percent of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Pro tournaments are now attracting a larger number of spectators
who have never been to golf events. Players are learning to deal
with these sad souls (Montgomerie doesn't deserve it, nor does
Woods), but governing bodies can't expect to open up gates to
40,000 people and not get a handful who think they're at a hockey
or soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   Chef surprise
</P>
<P>
   One of the more pleasant Ryder Cup stories belongs to Frank
McClelland, owner and head chef of L'espalier on Gloucester Street
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It seems he got a call from Michael Jordan, who wanted to come
in with some friends for dinner Friday night. No problem, said
McClelland.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, however, Jordan called to say they weren't coming.
No problem, said McClelland, who praised the superstar for his
consideration: ``It was gracious of him to call before we had
started our dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, however, must have thought it an inconvenience, and he
wanted to make it up to McClelland. Would the restaurant owner like
to be Jordan's guest at the Ryder Cup?
</P>
<P>
   His reply? Yes, in a split-second, and at 7 Saturday morning, a
limo picked him up and took him to the house in Brookline that
Jordan was renting. McClelland, Jordan, and former NHL great Mario
Lemieux watched the morning portion of Saturday's competition (John
Elway had departed a day earlier).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to leave (for work) at 12:30, but I stretched it to
1:30, I was having so much fun,'' said McClelland.
</P>
<P>
   McClelland said he witnessed Jordan decline a TV interview and
shy away from autographs, not drawing a lot of attention to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was there for fun, to be with his buddies and talk
sports,'' said McClelland. ``I thought it was remarkable that he
wasn't the spectacle. He didn't want to take away from the event.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, McClelland said he didn't want to impose upon Jordan,
so he never even asked to have a picture taken.
</P>
<P>
   He may get that chance, because Jordan told McClelland he'd stop
in for dinner when he's in town next time.
</P>
<P>
   Immortal words
</P>
<P>
   ``The grass grows greener, the trees bloom better, there is even
warmth in the rocks that you see about here. And I don't know,
gentlemen, but somehow or other the sun seems to shine brighter on
The Country Club than on any other place that I have seen.''
Crenshaw after the US rallied to win the Ryder Cup? No, that was
Francis Ouimet, addressing a crowd at the club's 50th anniversary
dinner, April 21, 1932 . . . The folks running this week's Dunhill
Cup have to be ecstatic. In the wake of the Ryder Cup, they get a
US team with Payne Stewart, Mark O'Meara, and Tom Lehman, not to
mention a Spanish contingent of Olazabal, Garcia, and Jimenez, the
English trio of James, Westwood, and David Howell, and Scotland's
entry of Montgomerie, Paul Lawrie, and Gary Orr. Pairings won't be
announced until Wednesday, but the delicious possibilities are
endless . . . Speaking of Olazabal, take a guess what he did on the
first hole Thursday at the German Masters? Yes, he drained a
30-footer for birdie . . . Small consolation for Europe: Its
youngsters dominated the Junior Match at New Seabury CC in Mashpee
last week. A mini-version of the Ryder Cup, the event featured 12
European teenagers (six boys, six girls) against a dozen of
America's finest. The US had won the previous two encounters, but
this time around it was a different story. Europe breezed, 10-2 . .
. Nice start to the collegiate golf career of Brent Wanner. The
Wake Forest freshman, out of Nauset Regional, has the best stroke
average (72.3) through two team events and helped lead the Demon
Deacons to a victory at the Cavalier Classic in Virginia. Indeed,
that match featured Wanner and James Driscoll, two of the more
heralded amateurs from Massachusetts recently. Wanner shot
71-71-72_214, tied for third at 2 under with Driscoll (70-71-73),
the University of Virginia senior from Chestnut Hill. At Johnson
City, Tenn., Wanner shot 73-72-72_217 to finish tied for fifth,
Wake Forest's top player, in the Ridges Intercollegiate Classic.

ARMSTRONG A TRUE EVERYDAY PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Sunday's game probably won't be as compelling to New
Englanders as the three before it were. The consensus is that the
Patriots should throttle the expansion Browns and move on to Kansas
City next week for a real test.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday will be a special moment for Bruce Armstrong. When he
steps onto the grass of the new Browns Stadium, he will
freeze-frame the moment in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   It will be his 184th start, more than any other player in team
history. On the surface, that may not seem so extraordinary; but
consider that he will pass Hall of Famer John Hannah, arguably the
best offensive lineman ever to play in the NFL. Consider that 773
players are listed on the team's roster for the past 40 years, and
that Armstrong, 34, in his 13th season, has started every game he's
ever played in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me,'' said Armstrong. ``As an offensive
lineman, I'm not going to have any stats when I'm done, so it's
important to me that I've left a legacy here somehow. I feel I've
played at a high level for a long time, and so it's in the back of
my mind that I started in all of these games, more than anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a kid out of Louisville who was a 240-pound tight
end before Howard Schnellenberger converted him to tackle three
days into spring drills of his junior season. The last ``stats''
Armstrong had were the seven catches for 103 yards he made in his
first five games of the 1985 season at Louisville. Then the stats
stopped and the heavy lifting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches always tell you that your career could be over in
one play, but you don't really believe that until it almost happens
to you,'' said Armstrong. ``When you're younger, you don't ever
think about it or realize that you could be one play away from
never playing again. When it almost happens to you, you have a
better perspective of the game and when it does happen to and
you're able to make it back, you start to appreciate things and the
game more.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Armstrong suffered what appeared to be a
career-threatening knee injury during a Nov. 1 game at Buffalo, the
midpoint of the season. He missed the remainder of the season but
came back strong and started every game in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who played right tackle his first three years,
remembers 1987, his first season, when the Miami Dolphins, his
hometown team, came to play at Foxboro Stadium. The Patriots won
that game, 27-21. He remembers the tingles down his spine on Dec.
28 of that season, the final regular-season game, when he walked
into the Orange Bowl, a place that was hallowed ground for a kid
who had attended Central High in Miami. What followed was a
rare-for-the-time 24-10 win at the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game was special and important to me because it was in
Miami,'' recalled Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, he has protected quarterbacks Steve Grogan, Doug
Flutie, Tony Eason, Marc Wilson, Tommy Hodson, Hugh Millen, Scott
Zolak, Scott Secules, and Drew Bledsoe. He's blocked for running
backs Tony Collins, Reggie Dupard, John Stephens, Mosi Tatupu,
Craig James, Robert Perryman, Marvin Allen, Terry Allen, Leonard
Russell, Jon Vaughn, Kevin Turner, Sam Gash, Marion Butts, Leroy
Thompson, Curtis Martin, Dave Meggett, Corey Croom, Robert Edwards,
Sedrick and Harold Shaw, Lamont Warren, and Kevin Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   He may have seen more people come and go than any other player
in Patriots history. But he remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I get the record for starts, I want to increase that to
200 games and beyond,'' said Armstrong. ``In this era of free
agency and because there isn't that much loyalty in the game any
more, with guys not spending so long on one team, it could be a
record that stands. The only one here who really has a chance to
break it is Drew.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe will be making his 94th start Sunday, about halfway to
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong got a new kick on life in the NFL in the offseason.
After a miserable '98 season, when he played with a fractured leg
all year and allowed 10.5 sacks, he wondered about his future. But
he decided that he was going to get into the best shape of his
life. When he walked into camp at Smithfield, R.I., he was at 290
pounds, his playing weight as a rookie. Now Armstrong speaks like
someone who will play out the remaining three years of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be overly retrospective at this point because
we're 3-0,'' he said. ``I'm really looking to play 2-4 more years.
The more games we win, the better I'm going to feel. Things are
good here right now. This team has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the game was fun again, Armstrong said, ``Now it is.
From this point on, it will be. I feel like I'm just getting
started. It's been 184 games, but for me right now, it feels like
my first.''

EAGLES HELD THAT (BOTTOM) LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are Tom O'Brien and you wake up Sunday morning with mixed
feelings abut your Boston College football team.
</P>
<P>
   You know a few facts.
</P>
<P>
   You are 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   You have won your first game in October, ending a winless streak
in the first full month of autumn that dated back to Oct. 19, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   You have just beaten cross-town neighbor and Division 1-AA
opponent Northeastern, 33-22.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, however, your stomach churns over the things that
you don't know as you prepare for the next two games, which most
people believe your team should win: at Temple, vs. Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   You worry about an offense that has been spotty all year. You
wonder about the psyche of a team that seems to need adversity to
perform at its best, such as coming from behind to win games
against Baylor, Navy, and most recently and surprisingly,
Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   You worry about a team that turned the ball over five times
against Northeastern, a performance that surely would have been
more costly against a more talented, more opportunistic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   You worry about the sloppiness _ penalties, breakdowns, and
other assorted misdeeds _ that made Saturday's game a contest
almost until the final gun.
</P>
<P>
   What most expected to be an Oktoberfest celebration of Eagle
superiority over a less-talented but not less-determined Husky team
turned into a nail-biting, upset-stomach type of game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relieved,'' was all BC athletic director Gene DeFilippo could
offer as a reaction after watching the Eagles get off to their best
start since 1992, when they opened 7-0-1.
</P>
<P>
   DeFilippo had as much reason as O'Brien to be concerned. He
scheduled the game, not only to promote college football in New
England, but to give O'Brien one more win in the quest for the
six-win minimum NCAA requirement to be bowl-eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Division 1-AA teams is often a no-win situation for
Division 1-A programs.
</P>
<P>
   If you win, the reaction is, ``So what. That's what's supposed
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If you play poorly, or heaven forbid, lose, then you can ruin a
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played 1-AA teams before,'' said O'Brien. ``I know what
that's about.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he knew now about his team that he didn't know a
week ago, O'Brien shook his head and grinned slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know more,'' he said. ``But it's of a negative nature.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is a typical reaction. Coaches worry, even
after the most impressive of wins, which was not the case against
Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Brien should worry. His team has played four games without
a loss and he still is not sure of what he has.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game should have an asterisk attached to it because
the Eagles did not have their normal pregame mindset. ``We played
tight,'' said O'Brien, acknowledging that his team read the papers
and listened to the talk about how the heavily favored Eagles
should blitz a Northeastern team that wasn't even .500 at the 1-AA
level, entering the game with a 1-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   But Northeastern coach Barry Gallup had a lot of good things
going for him, including a game plan that included trick plays
(resulting in a first-offensive-play touchdown on a flea flicker)
and an underdog feeling that relaxed his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something psychological about it (playing 1-AA
teams),'' said O'Brien. ``They (the Eagles) thought they were
supposed to kill them. I tried to tell them that those things
weren't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't. Had the Eagles played Navy, Temple, Rutgers, or
any other 1-A team on their schedule this season and gotten the
same result, the Eagles probably would have had more of a sense of
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   But instead there was more a sense of relief from everyone
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outplayed us in pretty much every aspect of the game,''
said BC safety Pedro Cirino. ``We were lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky and good enough.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien knows that as much as anyone. But he also knows the
bottom line is etched in ink, not pencil.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week from now, all that matters is that we're 4-0,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. When November arrives and the victories are tallied,
this win will be just as important as the win over Rutgers a week
ago or any future victories the Eagles might post in their quest
for a bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with the way we played,'' O'Brien said. ``I'm
ecstatic that we won.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's all that really matters.

WARD A WARRIOR IN WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ As Micky Ward rose to meet the night's final
challenge and possibly his career's last chance Friday, there was
no mistaking who he was.
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-inch gouge out of his left cheek and with a deep cut on
the edge of his lip, one didn't need a trained eye to understand
his profession.
</P>
<P>
   On wobbly legs a warrior stood, bloodied but unbowed. Resolute
but reeling. Tired but tireless. At that moment, with 1,801 people
screaming inside a smoky arena, Micky Ward stood to fight.
</P>
<P>
   No one could mistake what he was.
</P>
<P>
   Across the ring, a man from Maryland named Reggie Green stood to
do the same. Holding a lead on the cards of two judges and the
belief that he could survive Ward's assaults for one more round,
Green ached from a pounding to the ribs and kidneys but his head
was clear and his heart strong.
</P>
<P>
   His chest heaving, Green also was at the point of exhaustion,
but he was different from Ward. Both had come to a spanking new ice
hockey rink to stand nearly naked and fight for their lives, but
there was one small difference. In a sport of desperation and
delusion, Ward had more of both than Green.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime fight trainer and boxing commentator Teddy Atlas knew
what he was looking at. He knew what was in the hearts of these men
and what was deeper. More important, he knew the price each had
paid and would continue to pay long after Ward dramatically saved
his career and his self-image with one last crushing hook to the
body that undid Green and a final flurry that ended the fight with
only 20 seconds to spare when one final hook to the head that came
from the only place Ward could summon it drove Green into
helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That truly was fighting,'' Atlas said after Ward stopped Green
at 2:40 of the 10th round to keep alive faint hopes of a last title
shot. ``That was not entertainment. That was not business. That was
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a barbaric thing at the core of it. It ain't always
pretty but it's real. Like the mobsters say, that was a real guy up
there. When it came down to what a fighter is about, Micky Ward was
it. That is what a fight is and you don't see it too often no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the first time your parents took you to the zoo
and they said, `That there is a lion,' and you look and he roars
and you think, `Yeah, that's a lion.' Tonight, if you never been
there before, that was a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fighter had carried the day but two fighters had been in
there. Two men who knew bravery and a mastery of brutal skills. Two
fighters in a place where only one could survive and it was the kid
from Lowell, Mass., who is a kid no longer who did.
</P>
<P>
   Ward (34-9) turns 34 this week, a fighter past his prime but one
whose heart had remained robust through more trials than most
athletes could endure.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, two fistic accountants named Oscar De La Hoya and
Felix Trinidad boxed for millions in Las Vegas but they never
fought. De La Hoya was paid more than $23 million and took the
final four rounds off.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad earned $8.5 million and did less fighting in 12 rounds
than Green or Ward did in two. Ward was paid $15,000 before
everyone else took a piece of his blood money and Green got $20,000
before the same thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Micky and Reggie are guys who need managers,'' Atlas said.
``Guys like De La Hoya and Trinidad need accountants. There's an
urgency about what they do. There's no list of options for them.
The only option is to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other thought than getting through tonight. It's
not about a moral victory and `I fought a good fight.' Not if you
come from where (Ward) comes from. It's about winning because if he
don't, it's back to `almost' again and almost ain't good enough
when you got no other options.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the will,'' Ward said. ``He dazed me once, but with my
heart I wasn't going down. I knew the body shots were getting to
him. Even the ones on the elbows (that were blocked) were takin' a
price. I think he just said, `Enough.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The price Ward was willing to pay showed when it was over and he
sat bleeding and exhausted in his locker room. Then even the touch
of a water bottle to his lips caused him to wince.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some stitching to do tonight, Micky,'' Dr. Brian
Claussen said after he had peeled Ward's lip back to expose a wide
gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Fighter had won. His career was alive. But the pain was
there, too, and it would not go away as fast as the small money
he'd earned enduring it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're remarkable!'' screamed Hall of Fame trainer Angelo
Dundee, who had worked another fighter's corner earlier in the
evening. ``That was magnificent!''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Dundee left for an Italian restaurant to
dine with friends. Ward left for a hospital with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, even the Fighter has to leave the arena and go to a
hospital. Pain waits for him there just as it was waiting for Green
when he got back to his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The pain would be there long after the fans and most of the
money had disappeared, but they can live with that. It was a choice
they made long ago, the first time they chose to do what few people
can.
</P>
<P>
   To be lions for an evening.

   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Stepping up his efforts to woo liberal
Democrats as he pursues the party's presidential nomination, former
Sen. Bill Bradley told a gay and lesbian group here Saturday night
that Americans should be guaranteed equal government benefits and
protection from discrimination regardless of their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Bigotry against gays and lesbians should be taken as seriously
as racial or religious hatred, and fighting it requires
legislation, he said, adding, ``The laws do not by themselves
extinguish prejudice, they restrain prejudicial behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's efforts to enlist gay and lesbian backing have been
troubled by two issues: Some activists have criticized him for
insisting that the institution of marriage be limited to men and
women. And some black leaders have objected to his calls for
reopening civil rights legislation to include sexual orientation,
warning that the Republican majority in Congress might then water
down some of the protections in these laws.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a packed ballroom at a hotel in this suburb southwest
of Detroit, Bradley discussed both issues. He said that same-sex
couples should have all the legal rights available to couples
consisting of men and women but that the term ``marriage'' carried
so many religious overtones that it was not feasible to legislate
it for gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we insist on using the word, we will never get past it,''
Bradley said. ``So I will not call gay unions marriage, but I will
accept them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley drew several parallels between the civil rights movement
of the 1960s and ongoing efforts to extend legal protections to
gays and lesbians. While the evils of slavery and racial
discrimination have lasted longer and been more extensive than
discrimination against gays and lesbians, he said, American values
demand that both problems be confronted by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where justice is concerned, no half measures are acceptable,''
he said, without commenting specifically on whether there were
risks in reopening civil rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spoke at the tenth anniversary dinner of the Michigan
chapter of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest
political organization for gays and lesbians. There were standing
ovations, punctuated by whistles and cheerful cries, before and
after his speech.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Bradley sounded as though he already had the
Democratic nomination and was running for the presidency. Several
times in his remarks, Bradley criticized Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, for not
paying more attention to gay and lesbian issues. But Bradley never
mentioned his rival for the Democratic nomination, Vice President
Al Gore, nor did he mention the primary race ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also been seeking the support of gay and lesbian
Democrats. Over the summer, he addressed a gay and lesbian group in
Los Angeles and the groundbreaking for a gay and lesbian center in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And his wife, Tipper Gore, addressed a gathering of the Human
Rights Campaign in Chicago. Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gore's
campaign, said that the vice president ``has said that it's very
important to recognize that the issues that face gays and lesbians
are not narrow special interests but basic human rights, and he is
determined to fight for them.''

<P>
   &UR; VIRGINIA WOOLF &LR;  By Hermione Lee. Vintage, $18. This biography,
selected by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books
of 1997, rescues Woolf from her iconic stature and restores her to
human dimensions. The result is ``a book worthy of its subject _
graceful, astonishingly well researched,'' Daphne Merkin wrote in
The New York Times Book Review. ``Brimming with intelligence and
excitement, it sets before us the idea of an electric mind, of
indisputable greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FARMING OF BONES &LR;  By Edwidge Danticat. Penguin, $12.95.
This sobering novel by a Haitian-American writer takes place on the
island of Hispaniola in 1937, when the longstanding hostility
between Haiti and its neighbor, the Dominican Republic, threatens
to erupt into bloodshed. The narrator is a young Haitian servant in
a Dominican household, whose small personal world is shattered when
the country's Haitian minority is targeted for slaughter.
``Danticat knows the value of understatement in bringing
nightmarish scenes to life, and a spare, searing poetry infuses
many of the book's best passages,'' Michael Upchurch wrote in The
New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY DOG TULIP &LR;  By J.R. Ackerley. New York Review, $12.95. In
recalling his shared life with an elegant German shepherd,
Ackerley, a British writer and editor, unsentimentally portrays two
distinct personalities and two species. ``It is also a love story,
with all the hard truths, anguish and heightened sensibility that
such is likely to contain,'' Gene Baro wrote in 1965. ``A
masterpiece of empathy, this book is likely to be read again and
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; MY FATHER AND MYSELF &LR;  ($12.95),
an account of Ackerley's distant relationship with his father, who
led a secret double life, and his own struggle for identity as a
gay man. ``Written in lucid, exact prose,'' the memoir is
``constructed with the greatest skill, planned like an elaborate
mystery story,'' Michael Holroyd wrote in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TWO CITIES &LR;  By John Edgar Wideman. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin,
$13. This novel is about two wounded souls who fall in love under
the pressure of urban warfare in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
``Through Wideman's masterly narrative the reader learns how to
accept hopelessness without giving up hope,'' Walter Mosley wrote
last year. ```Two Cities' is as enjoyable as it is important.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GIRL IN THE FLAMMABLE SKIRT: Stories &LR;  By Aimee Bender.
Anchor/Doubleday, $11.95. Many of the young heroines in this
insouciant first collection are single and not too happy about it,
even if they don't quite know what to expect from men or from life
itself. ``Bender's stories are powered by voice ... and a
restrained sauciness,'' Lisa Zeidner wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KING OF THE WORLD: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American
Hero &LR;  By David Remnick. Vintage, $13. The author blends athletic
and political history as he traces the arc of Ali's life inside and
outside the ring, from hyperconfident youth to ecumenical spiritual
ambassador. ``It doesn't read like the case history of a man ...
but of a comic and cosmic superman,'' Budd Schulberg wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THIS BLOODY MARY IS THE LAST THING I OWN: A Journey to the
End of Boxing &LR;  by Jonathan Rendall (Ecco, $15), a British boxing
fan tells of his troubled love affair with the sport, both as a
journalist and as an adviser to the featherweight champion Colin
``Sweet C'' McMillan. In 1998 one critic called this ``a little gem
of a book, immensely readable, laugh-out-loud funny and intensely
moving.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GERTRUDE OF STONY ISLAND AVENUE &LR;  By James Purdy. Quill/Morrow,
$13. In the author's 16th novel, an aging Chicago woman researches
the life of her dead daughter, a famous artist whose flamboyant
sexuality was a source of mystery to her emotionally estranged
mother. ``Purdy is a powerful writer'' and a ``singular American
visionary,'' Bruce Bawer wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HEART OF THE ANTARCTIC: Being the Story of the British
Antarctic Expedition, 1907-1909 &LR;  By Ernest Shackleton. Carroll &AMP;
Graf, $16.95. The explorer chronicles his voyage in search of the
south magnetic pole, a harrowing journey that brought him within 97
miles of his goal. His illustrated narrative ``is unquestionably of
great scientific value, but it is primarily a story _ a story whose
realism, never forced, is so poignant as to make a Jack London tale
look pale and anemic in comparison,'' The New York Times wrote in
1909.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UTZ &LR;  By Bruce Chatwin. Penguin, $11.95. Kaspar Joachim Utz is a
cultivated Mitteleuropa aristocrat imprisoned in his apartment in
Communist Prague by his priceless collection of Meissen china
figurines amassed during World War II. ``This short novel ...
represents Chatwin at his most erudite and evocative,'' Robert
Stone wrote in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMPOSSIBLE SAINTS &LR;  By Michele Roberts. Harvest/Harcourt Brace,
$13. The unusual tale of St. Josephine is alternated with brief
accounts of 11 other female saints. The result is a ``fascinating
novel'' that suggests ``that everyday life is both more sacred and
more bizarre than we might imagine,'' David Guy wrote last year.

O'NEILL HURT AS YANKS CLINCH HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ One game remains in the regular season
and the American League playoffs are set to begin Tuesday, and the
Yankees have been pushing hard, to play better, to win enough games
for the home-field advantage. But Paul O'Neill's galloping pursuit
of a foul fly Saturday night ended in a collision with a wall and
O'Neill on the ground in pain.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill bruised his right side and lower back and left the game
grimacing; it's too early to know how the injuries will affect his
swing or his mobility. But the Yankees (98-63) do know they will
possess home-field advantage throughout the American League
playoffs, a right they earned Saturday night after edging Tampa
Bay, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the Yankees will play Texas in the best-of-5
division series, but there remains a chance they could face
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who the Yankees play, Orlando Hernandez will pitch
Game 1 Tuesday, Andy Pettitte will start Game 2 Thursday, and Roger
Clemens and David Cone are scheduled to throw Games 3 and 4,
respectively. Hernandez would pitch if a fifth game became
necessary. Torre told his starters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two more milestones were achieved in Saturday night's game:
Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center fielder, drew his 100th walk
of the season, making him the first Yankee since Lou Gehrig to
accumulate 200 hits and 100 walks in the same season. The victory
was the 400th of manager Joe Torre's tenure with the team; only
twice before have the Yankees won 400 games in a span of four years
_ they won 408 from 1961 to 1964, and 409 from 1936 to '39.
</P>
<P>
   Cone shut out the Devil Rays through five innings Saturday
night, allowing just one hit. But in the bottom of the sixth
inning, umpire Joe Brinkman replaced Derryl Cousins behind home
plate after Cousins pulled a muscle in his back. Cone's domination
quickly stopped: he walked four in a span of six hitters, the
Yankees' 3-0 lead shrank to 3-2 and Cone was removed with one out
and the bases loaded. Cone seethed as he departed, after
questioning Brinkman about some calls.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grimsley relieved Cone and retired Bubba Trammell on a
short line drive to left, with the runner at third holding. Herbert
Perry worked the count full, and Grimsley was one pitch away from
walking home a run, one pitch away from losing the lead, one pitch
away from ending any chance Cone would get his 12th victory.
</P>
<P>
   Perry lifted a long foul down the right-field line, the ball
angling toward the stands, and O'Neill charged for the catch,
knowing that an out would end the inning. The ball fell out of his
reach, O'Neill brushed against a fence in front of the stands that
is about four feet high, lost his balance, spun around _ and
slammed onto his right side on the edge of the wall. He then
slumped to the ground, holding his torso.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's teammates, Torre and the Yankees trainer Gene Monahan
rushed to check on him, and O'Neill stayed on the ground for
several minutes before walking off the field without assistance,
but in apparent pain. Grimsley got out of the inning, and the
relievers who followed maintained the lead, but the Yankees' first
concern was for O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has the best record of all members of the Yankees'
rotation, at 17-9, and all year, he has been Torre's most
consistent starter. He registered quality starts (three runs or
less in six or more innings) in 23 of 33 games, which is among the
highest percentages in the AL. And Torre constantly mentions
Hernandez's exceptional performance in Game 4 of the AL
Championship Series last year, when, on 15 days of rest, Hernandez
pitched a spectacular and precise game to beat Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said: ``It was a big surprise, because of the
established pitchers we have around here. I'm pretty happy. I'm
pretty excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte seemed to be the front-runner to pitch the second game
all along, because Yankee Stadium always has favored left-handed
starting pitchers, and Pettitte has never been comfortable pitching
in Texas, where he and much of his family resides.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had always been the ace of whatever team he pitched for
in the past. But Clemens has been erratic this year, sometimes
dominating, often struggling for his command, particularly in the
early innings. Torre considered starting Clemens in Game 1 because
of his stature, and because Torre could better regulate Clemens'
rest. Clemens generally pitches better with four days' rest, and
now he will have eight.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has always been a pitcher Torre has relied on to pitch the
crucial Game 3 _ in the World Series of 1996, in the playoffs and
World Series last year. But Cone will start Game 4, and if the
unexpected happens and the Yankees are swept in the division
series, they would do so without Cone throwing a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a sweep was on Cone's mind Saturday, after he
spoke with Torre. ``I hope I don't have to pitch in the first
round,'' said Cone, referring to the chance the Yankees would win
the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Joe can go wrong,'' Cone added. ``We would have
to feel good about the fact that in Game 3 and Game 4, Roger
Clemens and me would be going.''

SPANISH FERN WINS YELLOW RIBBON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ The Breeders' Cup finally gets in the spirit of Title
IX this year, running a $1 million turf race for fillies and mares
on its championship program Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park near Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It's a change that comes not a moment too soon for Bobby Frankel
and his latest turf starlet, an Arab-owned 4-year-old filly named
Spanish Fern who knocked off the big names under a timely ride by
Chris McCarron in the $500,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes before 37,292
fans at Santa Anita on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel trained consecutive female turf champions Possibly
Perfect, Wandesta and Ryafan earlier in the decade _ and said he
``should have had four with Toussaud'' _ but had nowhere to run
them in the Breeders' Cup. That's one reason the 58-year-old Hall
of Famer is 0 for 30 on the richest day of the thoroughbred season.
</P>
<P>
   But if Spanish Fern is as good as she looked Saturday in running
the fastest Yellow Ribbon in seven years and leaving Fiji, Tuzla
and Tranquility Lake out of the money, she just might help Frankel
break through in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had (foot injuries) at Hollywood and then she got sick on
me,'' Frankel said of Spanish Fern, who beat Caffe Latte by 1\
lengths, covered 1\ miles in 1:59.52, and seemed to earn a
Breeders' Cup trip. ``But everything happened for the best, because
I have a fresh filly for the end of the year and that's where the
money is anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Fern, coming off a troubled third in Del Mar's Ramona
Handicap, rallied from second to last in a field of seven fillies
and mares under McCarron, who took over from Alex Solis (out of
town) and Kent Desormeaux (injured).
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, the 1998 female turf champion making her first start of
'99, having been held out with a muscle pull and illness, ran an
understandably tiring sixth under Jerry Bailey. Trainer Neil
Drysdale said Fiji will use the Oct. 15 Vinery First Lady Stakes at
Keeneland as a further Breeders' Cup prep.
</P>
<P>
   The mild upset by Spanish Fern ($7.40) helped to produce a
carryover on a day when the Oak Tree association guaranteed a $1
million pick-six pool. Fans bet $978,261 and an insurance company
made up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everybody's ticket was dead after the first pick-six
race, when Santovito sprang an $84.20 surprise under Eddie
Delahoussaye, riding for the first time since a Del Mar shoulder
injury. Favorites wound up 0 for 6.
</P>
<P>
   After the $9,260 payoffs for fans picking five of six, the
carryover for today's 12:30 card is $561,810.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Alex Solis rode Ecton Park ($8.80) to victory in the
Super Derby and odds-on Menifee made it an exacta for trainer
Elliott Walden in Louisiana Downs' $500,000 race for 3-year-olds.
Ecton Park, 12th in the Kentucky Derby, won his first Grade I in a
near-track-record 2:00.59 for 1\ miles. ``The key was the
(stalking) position Alex had,'' Walden said.... Bonapartiste (Chris
McCarron) is the 5-2 morning-line favorite for today's Oak Tree
Turf Championship.... Winning aboard Golden Tassel at Santa Anita
on Saturday moved Laffit Pincay within 40 of Bill Shoemaker's
career-record 8,833.

METS IMPROVE POSITION WITH WIN OVER PIRATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Their fate and mood had been flipped end over end in
little more than 24 hours, the New York Mets solemnly staring
elimination in the face and then suddenly sticking their tongues
out like disobeying children who refuse to go to bed when they're
told.
</P>
<P>
   With a feisty resurgence as stunning as the collapse that
necessitated it, and a brilliant pitching performance by one of the
players haunted by last year's collapse, the Mets beat the Pirates,
7-0, Saturday night and are _ unbelievably, incredibly _ tied with
Cincinnati for the wild-card spot heading into Saturday
regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   The byzantine mathematics of baseball have suddenly turned in
the Mets' favor: there is only one scenario by which they will be
eliminated Sunday: if they lose and the Reds win. If the Mets win
and the Reds, who have lost three in a row, lose Sunday, or if both
win and Houston loses to create a three-way tie, the Mets will have
grasped the wild card like someone who has fallen off a cliff only
to spot a tree branch on the way down. If Houston wins and the Reds
and Mets are tied at the end of the day, they will play a one-game
playoff in Cincinnati on Monday at 2:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the team meetings, the lineup shake-ups, the forlorn
Bobby Valentine's statement that he should be fired if the Mets
don't make the playoffs seem quaint, as if they occurred in another
era. Perhaps they did.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mets have not exactly battered opposing teams to get
back in the race, they are playing with a renewed vigor and
confidence, and they are getting otherworldly pitching, all
jet-propelled by the slight missteps of the Reds and Astros,
slippages that were just long enough to allow the Mets to catch
them.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the Mets' treacherous slide into near oblivion,
their starting pitching kept them from being humiliated in every
game as the offense wallowed in a miserable slump. Saturday night,
Rick Reed, who only a month ago seemed in danger of losing his spot
in the starting rotation after coming off the disabled list with a
finger injury, was utterly dominant, giving one of the most
masterly _ and most critically timed _ pitching performances of the
season and, probably, the greatest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Reed lost one of the games during the collapse that kept the
Mets from winning the wild card almost exactly a year ago, and he
had been miserable about it during the winter. And Reed seemed
unhappy again when Valentine was less than enthusiastic about his
mediocre first starts back from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed has been superb in his last three starts. Against
Atlanta Sept. 21, Reed held the Braves to just one run _ a Chipper
Jones homer _ but the Mets lost when Dennis Cook gave up Jones'
second homer of the game. At Philadelphia last weekend, Jones
allowed just three runs on three hits, but the Mets were, by that
time, frantically tight and unable to hit with men in scoring
position, and Reed took the 3-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   None of that compared with Saturday night, though. Using a
dazzling curveball and a fastball clocked near 90 mph, Reed had
complete command of this game. He struck out 12 _ his previous best
this season was six _ allowed just three hits and gave up no walks
in the complete game for his 11th victory. He struck out the side
in the third, and, at one point, he got four of the five hitters he
faced to strike out looking.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a Keith Osik pop-up that Rey Ordonez ranged into
shallow center to grab in the fifth, just one out was recorded in
the outfield through seven innings. Reed allowed just one base
runner after the fourth inning. When it briefly appeared as if
Valentine was going to pinch-hit for Reed in the bottom of the
eighth _ Matt Franco was in the on-deck circle warming up to
pinch-hit for Melvin Mora before Reed jogged to the plate _ the
crowd booed.
</P>
<P>
   And they went positively berserk when Reed stroked a two-run
single that gave the Mets a 4-0 run lead. After Reed scored the
Mets' fifth run, he finished off the ninth to pitch just the fourth
complete game of the season for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets do make it to the playoffs _ and is everyone's
stomach turning from this roller-coaster ride? _ they will go in
with a suddenly strong rotation. They needed 119 games to get their
first complete game, but, with the season hanging in the balance,
the pitchers have given the Mets four straight spectacular
performances in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Mets have halted their skid, they have been
unable to score bunches of runs. Except for Wednesday's thrashing
of Greg Maddux, which ended with a 9-2 victory, the Mets had not
scored more than three runs since they beat Philadelphia, 8-6, on
Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   If they do make it to the playoffs, the lack of production will
be a cause for concern. Against Pirates starter Francisco Cordova,
who had an 11.57 earned run average in his two previous starts
against the Mets this season, the Mets were 0-5 with runners in
scoring position through the fifth inning. Particularly painful was
the second inning, when the Mets had the bases loaded with just one
out. But Ordonez and Reed grounded out to end the inning, and the
Mets did not have another serious threat until Aramis Ramirez
committed a throwing error that ignited the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud walked to being the inning, and Mike Piazza followed
with a broken-bat chopper that Ramirez fielded. Perhaps distracted
by the bat shard flying toward him, Ramirez overthrew second base,
and both Olerud and Piazza were safe. Then Robin Ventura, hobbled
by a bad knee and slumping at the plate, came to bat.
</P>
<P>
   He had the game winning hit Friday night _ the hit that may go
down as the one that saved the season _ and now, he stroked a
doubled off the right field wall to score Olerud. After Darryl
Hamilton lined out and Roger Cedeno was intentionally walked,
Ordonez hit a looper to Kevin Young at first. Young fielded the
ball, and looked up to see Piazza way off third base. Young threw.
_ all the way to the camera pit in foul territory. Piazza, who
would smack a home run _ his 40th _ in the eighth, furiously ran
home for the 2-0 lead. Two errors, two runs. No great bombast, but
good enough to allow the Mets to not only exhale, but to puff out
their chests a bit.

PHOENIX - In the fall of 1944, near a battle front in central
France, an American GI named Bob DeHeer was told his services as an
Army mechanic were no longer required.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roughly half of DeHeer's outfit had been wounded or killed in a
German artillery barrage, and now the enemy was advancing on their
position.
</P>
<P>
   Since retreat was not an option, the job for which DeHeer had
been trained _ maintaining the company motor pool _ became
superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I volunteered for machine-gun duty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, DeHeer hadn't passed within 20 feet of a machine
gun. The only weapon he'd ever fired was an ancient World War I
rifle, and then only a couple of times during basic training. On
the ship overseas, how ever, DeHeer met a machine-gunner who'd told
him that, in combat, it's better to be in a foxhole behind an
imposing weapon than to be advanc ing in the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured, what the hell,'' DeHeer said. ``I'd gone over there
to win that damn war, and if this is what it took, well, fine. I'd
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The young mechanic put away his wrenches and taught himself the
wrenching art of war _ firing a weapon at others and being fired
upon in return. &QL; 
Wounded hero
</P>
<P>
   DeHeer was on the line for about month before being wounded. He
was awarded the Combat Infantry man Badge, the Purple Heart and the
Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   He never gave an inch, never wa vered, never changed.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, when the 77-year-old DeHeer came under attack by his
own government, his battlefield in stincts resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   He dug in. He held his ground.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the federal prosecu tors who'd been trying to
overrun DeHeer's position throughout the spring and summer,
abruptly backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can finally write an end to this ridiculous saga,''
DeHeer's attorney, Michael Rooney, told me. ``Bob prevailed, with
the bureaucrats pro tecting their backsides to the very end.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, DeHeer drove to the Carl T. Hayden Veterans
Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix to have his hearing aids
adjusted. The condi tion can be traced to artillery shells landing
too close in '44.
</P>
<P>
   DeHeer tried to park his car in a spot at the VA hospital
temporarily labeled ``VIP'' for visiting inspec tors.
</P>
<P>
   When he was prevented from doing so, the elderly vet got into a
shouting match with federal officers. He was handcuffed, hauled off
to a holding cell and issued citations for disor derly conduct and
failing to comply with an officer. Fines for the two offenses added
up to $70.
</P>
<P>
   DeHeer refused to pay. &QL; 
Standing his ground
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning I knew I wasn't going to give in to these
people,'' he said. ``I don't think it was right, what they did, and
you can't just go along with something you feel isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors could have dropped the charges right then. They
could have recognized that Bob DeHeer earned the title ``VIP''
years ago in France.
</P>
<P>
   But the case wound up in a hands of a federal magistrate. Trial
dates were set and then postponed as lawyers argued back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Bob wanted was to talk to them,'' attorney Rooney said.
``To let the VA see his side and keep this from happening to
someone else. To maybe get an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't to be.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, however, as a new trial date approached, Rooney
re ceived written notice that, at the request of the VA,
prosecutors were withdrawing charges against DeHeer. No other
explanation was offered. No apology. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   To DeHeer, it was more of a cease-fire than a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never said they did anything wrong, they just wanted it
to go away,'' he said. ``As far as the VA and the government are
concerned, they wish all us old vets would just go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Not me. Not with federal officials sending fresh brigades of
bureaucrats to the battle front every day, and so few among us,
from any generation, willing to dig in and hold the line. &QL;

DEVILS RUIN DEBUT OF THRASHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The National Hockey League returned to this city
Saturday night for the first time since 1980 with a team named the
Thrashers. The new team was introduced amid fireworks and was met
with a rousing ovation from a sellout crowd at newly built Philips
Arena in its season opener, against the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The electrifying atmosphere from the opening ceremony continued
into the opening face-off, which the Thrashers won thanks to the
experienced Ray Ferraro, who played for the Islanders and the
Rangers. It was also fitting that the Thrashers got the first goal
in their history from their captain, Kelly Buchberger.
</P>
<P>
   But the Thrashers played like an expansion team for the majority
of the game and lost, 4-1, to the Devils, who were rather sloppy
defensively in the first two periods and at times looked as
disorganized as the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik had two goals and Krzysztof Oliwa and Sergei Brylin
had one goal each for the Devils, who played much better in the
final period and dominated play during that session.
</P>
<P>
   Oliwa opened the scoring 8 minutes 58 seconds into the second
period when he intercepted a pass in Atlanta's zone. Holik gave the
Devils a 2-0 lead 40 seconds later before Buchberger beat Martin
Brodeur just under two minutes later to pull the Thrashers to
within 2-1 to the delight of the crowd of 18,545.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Devils' four rookies on their 23-man roster played
and left good impressions, especially Scott Gomez, who played left
wing on the team's first line with center Jason Arnott and right
wing Petr Sykora.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden and Brian Rafalksi were the other rookies who
played. Madden was the left wing on the Holik line, which had Randy
McKay on the right wing, and Brian Falaski was paired on defense
with the team captain, Scott Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have traditionally done well in the regular season in
the '90s. Last season they earned 105 points. It was the fourth
time in the last five seasons that the team reached the 100-point
mark. They have been the Eastern Conference winners in the regular
season for the last two seasons, but they were eliminated both
times in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third consecutive opener on the road for the
Devils. Last season's opening-day loss in Chicago remained etched
in coach Robbie Ftorek's memory. Ftorek spoke of his unhappiness
about that loss all season, even during the playoff series with
Pittsburgh that led to the Devils' early exit.
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek puts as much value on games early in the season as he
does on games in the spring. He learned that from Jacques Lemaire
after the Devils failed to make the playoffs the season following
their 1995 Stanley Cup triumph. Lemaire went through such agony for
missing the playoffs that he decided that making the playoffs is
just as important as winning the championship.

MCCAIN GAINS STEAM, BUT
 STILL LONG SHOT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 By JEFF BARKER 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  WASHINGTON _ John McCain wasn't just
kicking off his presiden tial campaign last week, he was
celebrating his rise to the top of the pack of GOP candidates who
aren't named George W. Bush.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all he had to celebrate, though, McCain still had this to
ponder: There are a hundred ways for Bush to win the nomination.
For McCain, there are just a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCain is playing his cards as best as anybody
could,'' said former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods. ``The
problem is he's not holding many cards.''
</P>
<P>
   To blunt the Texas governor's enor mous fund-raising advantage,
Mc Cain must reduce the playing field to manageable, early primary
states. There, Bush's national resources don't mean as much, and
McCain can maneuver while his opponent is still lumbering into
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is like a big, unwieldy battleship, said Dan
Schnur, McCain's communications director: ``Before it can get out
into the open sea and use all of its firepower, it's got to get
through some very narrow straits, New Hampshire and South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in those straits that McCain, with precisely targeted
campaigns aiming to be lighter and faster in the water, hopes to
outmaneuver Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hope is that a win or near-win in New Hampshire in
early February, followed by a South Caro lina victory soon
afterward, would knock Bush off stride.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Democratic nominee Walter Mondale in 1984, who had time
to recover from an early challenge by upstart Gary Hart, Bush might
be unable to rebound. That's because the key 2000 primaries are com
pressed into a narrow, six-week window ending in early March.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he is still afloat after South Carolina, however, it's
uncertain whether McCain could muster suffi cient resources as the
battle broad ened into larger states that would include California
on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Success itself could pose another problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Bennett, a New Hampshire independent pollster, says McCain
could conceivably become next year's John Anderson, the independ
ent candidate who caught the na tional eye in 1980 by surging
unexpectedly in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, so now the (1980) campaign shifts to Illinois,'' said
Bennett, who was on Anderson's staff. ``I was in the headquarters
in Rockford, and here's a roomful of checks that have come in over
the weekend because of Massachusetts, and you don't have the staff,
you don't have the where withal to process the checks to get the
money to do what you have to do. Literally, there was a closet full
of checks, and they had people doing it 24 hours a day, but it just
wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   So it could go for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say he does well in New Hamp shire, and he does well in South
Carolina,'' Bennett said. ``Then what? How does he do well against
Bush, who has been organizing constantly?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign aides said in response that contributions can
be processed much faster these days and that, unlike Anderson, they
would have a reservoir of funds to draw upon.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has more than $5 million on hand and is hoping to raise
$15 mil lion to $20 million overall. Bush has already accumulated
$56 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's other winning scenario hinges on a possible stumble by
Bush, who hasn't held a federal office. At the least, McCain hopes
that voters, when they begin to focus more closely, won't accept
the inevi tability of Bush's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone has a chance of beating Bush now, it's John
McCain,'' na tional Republican pollster Frank Luntz said in an
interview. ``Just as Democrats are giving a second look to Gore and
Bradley, at some point Republicans are going to give a second look
to Bush and McCain. McCain would get a second look because he is a
genuine war hero and very courageous politically, and that's what
the public is looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Give this to McCain: His campaign has now become credible enough
that reporters on his chartered jet to New Hampshire last week
began to ask each other whether the Arizonan might actually have a
shot. The answer appeared to be ``Yes, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Like a road-weary traveler, McCain's strategy will simply be to
make it home. The Arizona primary will beckon on Feb. 22, if McCain
can survive in the race that long.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, a McCain staff member years ago who now admits to having
``mixed feelings'' about the senator, doesn't believe McCain will
make it. Woods hasn't endorsed anyone, but he has helped Elizabeth
Dole and says he likes Bush ``a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an analogy,'' Woods said. ``We're getting ready to
run the Triple Crown, and George W. Bush is Secretariat. He's going
to run wire to wire. And you keep saying, if he trips, those two
(McCain and Dole) are 200 yards back.''
</P>
<P>
   Early polls show McCain trailing Bush in Arizona. The sometimes
fiery senator, a former Naval aviator and Vietnam prisoner of war,
has vowed that he would not lose his home state, his competitive
instincts doubtless stoked by Gov. Jane Hull's endorsement last
week of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods, as well as many pundits and politicians who support
other candidates, have credited Mc Cain with running a smart
tactical campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, criticized by some strat egists for skipping the Iowa
Straw Poll in August, turned it into a positive by citing ``the
absurd amount of money'' spent by the candidates to get their
voters out to the poll. It all dovetailed with McCain's theme that
big money is ruining the political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John McCain's running the smartest campaign of any of
the Republican contenders,'' said Doug Wilson, national political
director of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. Wilson, an
Arizonan, ran the 1996 Democratic Coordinated Campaign that
designed the state's strategy for Clinton-Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain team says its goal is simply to survive each round.
</P>
<P>
   The race, according to Schnur, re sembles the NCAA Basketball
Tour nament. Candidates, like teams, must first win preliminary
contests in their philosophical ``regions'' to advance. The final
four will be decided by competition within those preliminary
brackets.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Schnur said, finds himself in a preliminary competition
with Dole, a fellow mainstream conserva tive. Dan Quayle, Lamar
Alexander and John Kasich all were in this cluster before dropping
out.
</P>
<P>
   A second grouping contains ``hard-line conservative'' candidates
Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, all by himself, is the third group, which Schnur labels
``the son of the former president region.''
</P>
<P>
   The final group is ``the son of the millionaire regional'' and
is occupied by Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In the NCAA tournament, Schnur said, ``the field of 64 winnows
to a Final Four, and that's when people start paying attention. And
the same thing is happening here.''

U.S. ATTACK ON OLD VET
 CALLED OFF

LIGHTNING PREVAILS AS ISLANDERS' START IS ANYTHING BUT PROMISING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ It was only one game, but because it was against
the National Hockey League's perennial doormats, the Lightning, the
Islanders' season opener had extra meaning.
</P>
<P>
   It was a forecast, and the long-term outlook does not look good.
Long Island hockey fans might want to use Tampa Bay's 4-2 victory
at the Ice Palace to measure how long and cold the coming winter
will be for their Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were not outplayed for the entire 60 minutes, just
when it counted most. An example would be on the play that led to
the game-winning goal, scored by Fredrik Modin with 2 minutes 1
second left in the third period. On the play, the Islanders' Jorgen
Jonsson was beaten on a crucial face-off, leaving Islanders goalie
Felix Potvin with no time to get set for the shot by the recently
acquired Modin.
</P>
<P>
   It is a scenario that figures to play out often this season.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four minutes before Modin's goal, Jonsson evened the
score at 2-2 with 5:50 left to play. Mike Sillinger scored Tampa
Bay's fourth goal into an empty net.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin did his part. He turned away 26 Lightning shots while
Tampa Bay's Darren Puppa stopped 32.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a considerable lack of talent on either side of the ice,
the game featured plenty of entertaining plays. And that was good
news for the Lightning owner, William Davidson, who offered Tampa
Bay fans a full refund if they were not completely entertained. The
Ice Palace was sold out for the first time since last year's
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being badly outplayed early in the game, the Islanders
managed to take a 1-0 lead into the first intermission. Mariusz
Czerkawski, the player Islanders coach Butch Goring hopes can lead
his team in scoring this season, knocked in a rebound over the
sprawling Tampa Bay goalie. Czerkawski set up himself by hitting
the post with a wrist shot from between the circles. The rebound
bounced right back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Zigmund Palffy's departure has left Czerkawski as the Islanders'
most skilled forward. Whether he wants the distinction or not, the
27-year-old right wing, who had 21 goals and 17 assists last year,
is the Islanders' go-to guy this season. Czerkawski certainly has
the talent to lead the team in scoring, but without Palffy and
Trevor Linden and Robert Reichel, all of whom were traded last
summer, it won't be easy. Czerkawski is a marked man, and he knows
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I got better,'' Czerkawski said before Saturday
night's game. ``Trevor, Robert and Ziggy aren't here anymore, so
the other team is going to come after me. I'm going to get more
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning stormed back in the second period, scoring two
goals in a 54-second span midway through the second period to put
Tampa Bay ahead by 2-1. Michael Nylander and Steve Guolla scored on
blasts from between the circles. The shots were so hard and so
clean, Potvin didn't have time to react.

BIG O HAS A NEW DIET FOR CRITICS: EAT WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Oliver Miller is standing in a hallway, trimmer than
he's looked in years. Sweat is pouring down his face, soaking a
T-shirt that hangs loosely over his frame.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza? No, thanks. Today, he's a man who hopes to dish up a
plateful of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Vecsey and his cheeseburger jokes. Ahmad Rashad. Doug
Collins saying he'd keep a six-pack before he keeps me. Don Nelson
saying I don't love the game,'' Miller said. ``They're going to
have to eat their words.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the strangest twists of the NBA off-season, Miller is
proof that you can go home again. After punishing a few scales and
burning a few bridges, Miller is back with the Suns. As recently as
last season, his weight ballooned near 400 pounds. He is now around
315, closer to reclaiming his career than he's ever been. At least
since leaving Phoenix in 1994 with a few parting shots at Jerry
Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is heavy. Just last season, Miller was suing the
organization, claiming great emotional distress following an act
performed by the Suns' mascot. It was an act that poked fun at
Miller's girth when he came to town with the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Miller could be the Triple X factor in the pursuit of a
championship. And if this wild gamble pays off, the Suns can thank
_ of all people _ the Gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, while his agent was crying foul over the infamous
skit, Miller buried himself in videotape. There, he had an
epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept looking at the replays,'' Miller said. ``And I'm like,
`God, am I that big?' I told myself I have kids to feed, futures to
take care of. I don't want to worry about working when they grow
up. About having to find grants so they can go to school. I went
out and got some help. That skit hurt me inside, but it made me
stronger. It made me do what I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After hiring a trainer, Miller slimmed down to 320 pounds. After
confirming the results, Suns' coach Danny Ainge visited Miller in
the LA Summer League. Then came a mending of relationships with the
Colangelos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Suns are leery. So much that Joe Kleine is still
practicing with the team, just in case old habits die hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone in this organization has ever held
anything against Oliver,'' Ainge said. ``He's just done some stupid
things in his life. He's been very immature, made a lot of
mistakes. I can't sit here today and tell you that I can rely on
Oliver Miller. He has a lot to prove before we can rely on him.
He's just a talented guy who is getting his fourth or fifth chance
with not very much risk on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   If Miller doesn't regress, the possibilities are tantalizing. He
is an excellent passer who can block shots. He can offer another
dimension at center, a set of skills not possessed by Luc Longley.
Miller's target weight for the season is 305, but that doesn't
concern Ainge. Just as long as Miller doesn't go in the other
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people doubt me, but I'm more mature now,''
Miller said. ``I make better decisions on the court. I make better
decisions off the court. I'm just going to get in the best shape
that I can, and prove to people that I'm for real. That I still
love the game. That I take my job seriously and I'm here to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross your fingers. Miller might again be a weighty problem. Not
for the Suns. For the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he understands some of his weaknesses and that the
battles are not going to end,'' Ainge said. ``We'll have to
continue to stay on Oliver to stay in shape. To not screw around in
practice. To keep Oliver from making too many turnovers. But at the
same time, he seems more conscientious. More humble. More
coachable. And that's a great start.'' &QL;

ASTROS WIN AND WON'T FACE BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In Cincinnati, they're bemoaning the fact Kevin Brown
isn't pitching today in the Dodgers' season finale. Ditto in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they don't know much about Robinson Checo, but they know
he's not Brown. And to them, that's great.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny. This is how the Dodgers impact the playoffs. Houston
beat them 3-0 Saturday to assure the Astros of at least a Monday
playoff game to get into the postseason. But in the Midwest and
Gotham, they're complaining and wondering why the game's most
expensive, and perhaps best, pitcher won't throw the final
regular-season game in Astrodome history.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Checo will make his first start since late July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to risk the future of this ballclub for somebody
else's gain, to go out on a limb for some teams in other cities,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``It's not up to me to rectify
the situation after 162 games. I feel very confident with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston (96-65) holds a one-game lead over Cincinnati (95-66) in
the NL Central by virtue of the Reds' loss to Milwaukee. The Astros
can clinch a playoff berth today if they win or if the Mets (95-66)
or Cincinnati lose.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Johnson rearranged the Dodgers' rotation the last
three games, including changing Chan Ho Park's plan to leave the
team early to get ready for military duty in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Park (13-11) was scheduled to return home after his last start
in San Francisco, but with Darren Dreifort and Mike Judd nursing
ailments and Ismael Valdes returning to Mexico to visit his father
(involved in a car crash), Johnson went to Park on three days rest.
</P>
<P>
   Park responded with his best effort of the season, though his
winning streak was snapped at seven. He allowed only a sixth-inning
homer to Craig Biggio in seven innings. The Astros had four hits.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jose Lima (21-10) did Park one better. Pitching on
three days rest himself, Lima yielded seven hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to beat a 20-game winner and I thought a lot about
Lima pitching and he was pretty impressive,'' Park said. ``I feel
great about (the outing) because they're good hitters. It was
really a good game. It's too bad (the season ends). I feel so good,
so strong, but it's the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's good because one day when we go to the playoffs,
I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also pitched rookie Jeff Williams on three days rest
Thursday so the lefty could face San Francisco, since Eric Gagne,
who beat the Astros on Friday, matched up better with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But the clamoring for Brown, who is 18-9 with a 3.00 ERA, comes
from his past success against the Astros. He allowed one run in two
postseason starts against Houston last season, including a
16-strikeout performance in the first game of the Divisional
Series.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that Brown would have pitched if he had a chance
to win 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I changed my rotation around so I could get my best forward...
like this was going to be us clinching,'' Johnson said. ``I can't
risk the future of this ballclub for something that doesn't impact
the future of this club. I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Switching it up: After speaking with Johnson and general manager
Kevin Malone, catcher Todd Hundley said he plans to return to
switch-batting next season. He gave it up in mid-August after
struggling through one of the worst offensive seasons of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll work on it (in the offseason),'' Hundley said. ``Start
back up with it and then see how it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was so frustrated by his lack of production right-handed
that he bagged it after a miserable at-bat in Montreal. Though he's
never been a great offensive player from the right side _ he's a
lifetime .201 batter from there _ this year was particularly
stressful on him. He was 4 for 40 with two RBI and 18 strikeouts
from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Since hitting exclusively from the left side, Hundley is 2 for
13 (.154) with three RBI against southpaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been one of those years,'' said Hundley, who's hitting
.207 with 24 homers with 55 RBI. ``I haven't been this frustrated
since I don't know when. I heard guys say, `Just one of those
years,' and I never understood it. Now, I know that they mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Told you so: Eric Karros said moments after the last out was
recorded at Candlestick Park that someone would come up with a
baseball and call it the last one used at the park. It took a day
for that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Replays clearly show him holding onto the ball instead of
handing it to pitcher Jeff Shaw, who backed up Karros' story.
Karros showed the ball in the clubhouse after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Giants trainer Mark Letendre told a San Francisco paper he
got the ball from a ball boy, who got it from Shaw, and presented
it to owner Peter Magowan ``for all he has done for the people of
San Francisco and for my family.''

HARDAWAY THE FINAL PIECE _ FOR NOW  
 SUNS BEGIN WITH A NEW FOUNDATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Here's a pop quiz:
</P>
<P>
   Name the current Suns player who has the longest tenure in a
Phoenix uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Quick. OK, pencils down.
</P>
<P>
   Would you believe it's Rex Chapman, who is entering only his
fourth season with the Suns?
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that out,'' Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Chapman is The Dean with only three full seasons
under his belt here.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd also is entering his fourth season, but he came a
couple of months after Chapman. Clifford Robinson is entering his
third season. Nobody else has been in a Phoenix uniform for more
than one season, with the exception of center Oliver Miller, who is
beginning his second stint with the team.
</P>
<P>
   And with training camp opening Tuesday in Flagstaff, there again
are a lot of new faces _ All-Star guard Penny Hardaway, forwards
Rodney Rogers and Corie Blount, rookie Shawn Marion. And a familiar
face, Miller, who began his career in Phoenix and returns after a
five-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Suns made a run to the NBA Finals in 1993, the
club has tinkered yearly in its quest for the league's Holy Grail.
A.C. Green was added. Then Danny Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Majerle was traded for John ``Hot Rod'' Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced Charles Barkley wouldn't deliver a championship, the
Suns traded him in 1996 for a handful of journeymen from Houston.
Those pieces led to the deal Phoenix made with Dallas for Kidd,
which started the club back on the upward track. Antonio McDyess
came and went. Tom Gugliotta and Luc Longley were added last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hardaway is viewed as the latest missing piece.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, he might represent the final major piece _ at
least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what we've done with this team, there has
been a tremendous amount of turnover,'' said General Manager Bryan
Colangelo, who orchestrated the trade for Kidd and the
sign-and-trade deal for Hardaway. ``Continuity is absolutely
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with Penny, this was the first time we added a significant
piece without losing any major pieces. Not to discredit Danny
Manning or Pat Garrity (who were traded in the deal), but their
roles weren't as significant as some of the players traded in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Togetherness
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more important, the Suns now have a core of players _
Kidd, Hardaway, Chapman, Robinson, Gugliotta, Longley and Marion
who will be under contract for at least four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in a long time, we're not going to have a
bunch of free agents at the end of this season,'' said Suns Coach
Danny Ainge, who was also part of that 1993 Finals club. ``We have
a good group of players in place for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we won't look for ways to improve, but we've
got a chance starting right now to really build some continuity.
We've added Penny, Rodney, Corie and Oliver and it will take some
time because they're critical players.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got a nice mix of experienced veterans and youth.
We've got more muscle and athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   While talent is the most important part of a team's success in
the NBA, continuity is valuable. Often, franchises want to break up
contending clubs because too many players are getting old at once.
It happened in Portland, where Robinson played before signing with
the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, it happened in Phoenix when the team gave up on
Majerle and Ainge in 1995. Majerle is still playing. Ainge
contended at the time that he had at least one more year in him,
and that the Suns were capable of one more run at a championship.
Instead, the club fell to 41-41 the next season and the Barkley
trade followed.
</P>
<P>
   Once NBA's best
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough call,'' Ainge said. ``Looking back, I'd say yes,
my opinion is that the decision to change at that time was too
quick. I really believe that the two years Michael (Jordan) was out
of the league, we had the best team in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after the injury to Danny Manning, I thought we were the
best team. If Charles hadn't broken down in the playoffs, I think
we could have won two championships.''
</P>
<P>
   His viewpoint was shared around the league. Chapman, who was
playing for Washington during those years, said the Suns were
considered a team on the cusp of a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really seemed like they were just a little bit of luck
away from winning it,'' he said. ``If they had been able to keep
Kevin Johnson and Charles healthy, it might have been a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teams aren't real patient, but you see the teams that are
successful are the ones that have a core of players together for
awhile. Utah has been real patient. Chicago made changes when they
were on top, but they had Michael and Scottie and kept that core
together. When Houston won it twice, they had two or three key
players that had been together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers made a couple of runs early in Robinson's
career, then broke up a team that included Clyde Drexler, Terry
Porter and Buck Williams _ all aging stars. But Robinson said the
experience players have together is critical.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to know you
</P>
<P>
   ``On those teams, we tended to push each other in the ways you
need to be pushed,'' he said. ``When you're playing with different
guys every year, sometimes you don't know how to talk to a player
to get them going. Or they don't feel comfortable telling you what
you need to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been around each other for a while, you feel a lot
more comfortable doing that. You've got to be able to push each
other and let each other know what you're thinking without anybody
taking offense. If you can't do that, it's hard to get anything
going on a consistent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Suns have a lot of new parts, some continuity
already is forming. And Ainge points out that all 13 players on the
roster showed up early for voluntary workouts, plus they'll have a
full training camp and preseason after last season's
lockout-reduced schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to build some chemistry, but for the first time since
I've been the coach I don't feel like everything has to fall
perfectly for us to be a contender,'' Ainge said. ``We've got a
more balanced roster, and we're going to have four All-Stars in our
starting lineup. That's a pretty good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be criticized if we don't win, and we should be. We all
deserve it if we don't win. But I fully expect to win. At the same
time, there are going to be at least eight teams in the Western
Conference who go into the season believing they're contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just excited to get going. I'm not going to say that it
will be a bad season if we don't win an NBA championship, but I
will say that's what we're shooting for from Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, when the Suns signed Hardaway, talked not of winning a
championship but of winning several. The optimism within the Suns
locker room is that high. But Chapman also said the Suns understand
that if they don't produce on the court, those changes will keep
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Bryan and (club President) Jerry Colangelo,''
Chapman said. ``They have shown they are not going to stand pat if
they're not winning. They want a title, and with the types of
investments they've made the last couple of years, we owe it to
ourselves and the franchise to do everything we can to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, everybody is under contract for a while. But if we don't
get the job done, that doesn't mean we're going to stay
together.'' &QL; 
I'm just excited to get going. I'm not going to say that it will be
a bad season if we don't win an NBA championship, but I will say
that's what we're shooting for from Day One. &QC;

CUST ON THE CUSP OF GREAT NESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The first time Diamondbacks scout David May laid eyes
on Jack Cust, he was sure the young prospect was overrated.
</P>
<P>
   May had heard stories about prodigious home runs that Cust was
supposed to be hitting at Immaculata High School in Somerville,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He had a hard time believing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him before I saw him play, and just looking at him he
wasn't a huge guy,'' May said of Cust, who is now 6 foot 1, 205
pounds. ``I remember going to watch him take batting practice for
the first time, and a bunch of guys were asking me if I had seen
him take BP. They were all saying, `Wait until you see this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The fence at that field is only about 300 feet away, but there
were a couple of trees about 40 or 50 feet tall right behind the
fence. He hit maybe 14 or 15 in a row that cleared those trees by a
good distance and landed in a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing to see. I had wondered if he was legitimate,
but he was. He was hitting them so high and so far they looked like
golf balls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks eventually made the left-handed hitter their
No. 1 pick in the 1997 draft, and he hasn't disappointed them a
bit. This week, he was named the organization's Minor League Player
of the Year after nearly winning the triple crown at Class A High
Desert of the California League.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cust is one of six Diamondbacks prospects playing for the
Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League. The Scorpions are
one of six teams in the league, which begins play Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The day May scouted Cust, he watched the outfielder take about
50 hacks, and after those first 15 or so bombs, Cust spread line
drives around to all fields. In the game, Cust drove the ball out
of the park with a lined shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never got more than 9 feet off the ground,'' May said. ``It
was just a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for May. In a scene right out of a movie, he
went looking for a phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty excited,'' he said. ``I called my cross-checker,
(former Diamondbacks scout) Brannon Bonifay, and told him he needed
to come see this guy as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Cust will get to see some of the best pitching prospects
from other major league organizations, most of them from Class AAA
and AA teams.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his numbers at High Desert, it appears Cust is ready.
He led the California League with 32 home runs, finished second in
hitting with a .334 average, ranked fourth in runs batted in with
112 and second in runs with 107. Not surprisingly, he was named the
California League's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more impressive, he led the league in on-base percentage
and slugging percentage. That's a rare combination, especially for
a player so young.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young I was taught, even in batting practice, not
to swing if it wasn't in the strike zone,'' Cust said. ``My dad was
big on teaching me patience. He taught me to get something in the
strike zone that I could drive.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is an unusual knowledge of the strike zone, and the
discipline at the plate to make pitchers throw strikes. It's
something that's almost unheard of in young power hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him hit some long home runs, but the impression that
stands out in my mind is how impressive his discipline is at the
plate,'' said Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. ``It
would be very natural for him to say to himself, `They didn't draft
me to walk. They drafted me to hit it up the light tower
somewhere,' and turn into a free-swinging, wild hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he hasn't done that. To me, that's just outstanding. It's
a lot like (Diamondbacks first baseman) Erubiel Durazo. Everybody
heard a lot about this power guy, but he's the same way _ very
disciplined at the plate. Jack has that same ability to make a
pitcher throw it over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cust can't think of anybody he'd rather be compared to than
Durazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an awesome hitter,'' Cust said. ``I saw him hit some in
spring training, and I watch him now on TV all the time. He's got
great knowledge of the strike zone and a great approach at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll just spit at stuff that's a couple inches off the plate.
He makes them throw strikes, and then just explodes. It's great to
have somebody like that as a model right in the same
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Cust also wouldn't mind modeling Durazo's quick rise to the
majors. Durazo began this season in Class AA El Paso, where Cust
likely is ticketed for the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to get to move up as quickly as possible,''
Cust said. ``That's what you dream about, making the big leagues.
But they've got a great club up there, and they aren't going to
bring anybody up there that isn't ready. I've still got a lot to
work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Cust was considered by most to be a first baseman while he was
in high school, but with Travis Lee in the organization, Cust was
moved to left field. Now with the emergence of Durazo, it's likely
his future is in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   So he's working to develop his defensive skills and arm
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was a good enough athlete to play the outfield,'' he
said. ``I felt more comfortable with every game I played out there.
I know when they signed me, they weren't thinking I would be a
defensive stud in the outfield by the time I was 19. They're
looking at the long-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want to give up runs out there and try to make it
up with the stick. I want to be a complete ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's another attribute Garagiola loves in Cust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's certainly first and foremost an offensive
player,'' Garagiola said. ``However, he's not a one-dimensional
player. He has worked hard on his defense and he's taking pride in
his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I think he'll keep working on his defense, and that will
be good enough to play in the big leagues. But those things aren't
going to come naturally to him. He's going to have to work at it,
and he's demonstrated he'll do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a burning desire to play in the major leagues.''

<P>
   PHOENIX - Though the Diamondbacks' playoff roster has not been
released, it has been all but set in the minds of team officials.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter had toyed with the idea of taking 10
pitchers instead of 11, but in the end decided on 11.
</P>
<P>
   Deadline for submittal of the official roster to Major League
Baseball is 6 a.m., Arizona time, on Tuesday. The Diamondbacks will
open the playoffs at Bank One Ballpark on Tuesday night at 8
against an opponent that won't be determined until today or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it came down to is whether we felt a 15th position player
or an 11th pitcher could make more of a difference late in a game,
which would strengthen us the most, and we felt it would be the
pitcher,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the starting rotation, Showalter said he will go with
left-hander Randy Johnson on Tuesday night, right-hander Todd
Stottlemyre in Game 2 on Wednesday night and left-hander Omar Daal,
who started Saturday night's game against San Diego, in Game 3 on
the road on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   If a Game 4 is necessary, it appears that left-hander Brian
Anderson will be the choice if his selection as the starter in
today's regular-season finale is any indication.
</P>
<P>
   As for right-hander Andy Benes, who finished at 13-12, he is
expected to throw a handful of innings today and likely will be a
long reliever in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has started 18 games and has a 7-2 record, said he
isn't quite sure what to make of today's start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure it matters one way or the other,'' he said.
``I think it (start in Game 4) will depend on the matchups, depend
on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I want to do (today) is work on some things, get a
good tune-up and keep it going, whatever my assignment (in the
playoffs) will be.'' &QL; 
Miller says he'll play &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Damian Miller, sidelined with a hairline fracture of the
inside of his lower right thumb/hand, did some very light throwing
and reported very little discomfort. He will attempt to swing a bat
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, I'm playing in the playoffs,'' he
said. ``The doctor said I really can't injure it any worse. I can
play through the pain. I don't want to miss this. I've got all
winter to rest.'' &QL; 
We can work it out &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are expected to have their pre-playoff-opening
workout on Monday in late afternoon, according to Showalter. It is
uncertain when the visiting club will work out. If the Cincinnati
Reds and New York Mets play a playoff game to determine the wild
card, the visitors will not have a workout. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a museum director's fantasy: hundreds of
people waiting on a clear, crisp morning for the doors to open on a
new exhibition. Enough reporters buzzing about to cover a small
war. A line of art patrons that grew longer and longer, even after
the doors opened and the cash registers began to rattle and hum.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the vomit bags passed out by angry Catholics, or the
gruesome posters of severed cow heads brandished by angry animal
lovers, or even the grim-faced man who stood there alone with a
sign that read, ``Hitler Was Right When He Got Rid of `Degenerate
Art.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art began to harvest the benefits of
controversy Saturday as it opened ``Sensation,'' an exhibition of
contemporary British art that has spun New York City into a
political, cultural and religious uproar.
</P>
<P>
   In the museum's recent history, the largest opening-day turnout
was recorded during last winter's Monet exhibition. Gazing in
wonderment at a line that stretched all the way up the museum's
long cobblestone driveway, museum officials said Saturday's crowds
made Monet seem like some second-rate Left Bank artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had lines like this, but then we've never had
metal detectors either,'' said Lynne De Rienzo, an official in the
museum's education division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Giuliani did us a favor,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has mounted an unrelenting
campaign against the museum, accusing its board of recklessly
staging an exhibition of art he views as repulsive and offensive to
religion. He has withheld the museum's monthly city subsidy and has
started eviction proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, some visitors to the museum reacted with skepticism
upon discovering that the three subway stops closest to the museum
were closed to Manhattan-bound riders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances from transportation officials that the
closings had been scheduled in advance to make track repairs, some
wondered whether it was a ploy to make it harder for New Yorkers to
see the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a big lie,'' said Irwin Greenberg, 67, a retired
lawyer from the Upper West Side. ``First of all, it's Saturday.
They're going to start track work at noon? Somebody is faking
somebody out.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it was unclear which side in the dispute was hurt the
most. Some groups that had scheduled protests blamed the subway
closures for a light turnout. They were far outnumbered by those
who came to see the exhibition, and filled only a small portion of
the area penned off by police barricades that had been set up in
front of the museum to contain the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   And with polls showing a solid majority of the public in
disagreement with Giuliani's crusade against the museum, it was
clear that many who showed up for the exhibition did so as much to
demonstrate opposition to Giuliani as to show appreciation for the
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to see the art, but it's more to stand up for the
principle,'' said the first person in line Saturday, Paul D.
Warren, a social worker and amateur artist from the Park Slope
section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,200 people had attended the show by the 11 p.m.closing
time, a museum official said. The museum's previous single-day
record was on Jan. 3, 1998, when 5,979 people saw the Monet
exhibition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who came for the art formed a diverse crowd, from the
young and hip with torn jeans and nose rings to middle-aged men
wearing tweed jackets and ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live right around the corner, and I'm here with my wife and
my granddaughter,'' said Donald Correa, a school custodian. ``We're
just here to see the art. I'm not protesting anything. A museum is
a museum for art. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest groups were equally diverse in their makeup and
viewpoints. A dozen or so protesters from People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals came to single out the artist Damien Hirst,
whose work features dead animals sliced into sections and suspended
in tanks of formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there is no creativity or beauty or imagination in
exploiting animals,'' said Martin Rowe, a spokesman for the group.
``We feel they're taking the animals out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic protest groups took aim at Chris Ofili, a British
artist of Nigerian descent whose painting ``The Holy Virgin Mary''
has stirred so much controversy that it had to be shielded by
Plexiglas in one of the exhibition halls. The painting shows a
black Madonna with a breast fashioned out of elephant dung,
surrounded by small cutouts from pornographic magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Although some art experts say the painting actually venerates
the Virgin Mary, noting that dung is a symbol of growth in the
African culture, many Catholics view it as blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   A busload of women from St. John Vianney, a Catholic church in
the Bronx, held up drawings of the Virgin Mary outside the museum
Saturday. ``Our Lady, the most beautiful Lady,'' they called out,
over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the soldiers of Mary,'' explained Hilda Hernandez, a
social worker and church member.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of another Catholic protest group, speaking over a
loudspeaker, repeated some of the most familiar words in Roman
Catholicism: ``Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee,''
he said. ``Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come to her defense,'' said Elba Griffin of the
Forest Hills section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Catholic protesters framed their opposition in terms
of the First Amendment, which, in addition to guaranteeing free
speech, guarantees freedom of religion. In their view, the city
government, by financing the museum, is indirectly supporting a
painting that attacks Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is the funding,'' said Jane Dempsey of Westchester
County. ``This painting should be shown in a private gallery. If
someone wants to use their money to show this art, well then, be
our guest.''
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters did not represent the only Catholic viewpoint
Saturday. In line for the exhibition, Stella Wilson, a retired
nurse from College Point, Queens, held the hand of her squirming
granddaughter, 5-year-old Nina Lopez. ``I believe as a Catholic,''
Mrs. Wilson said, ``that God said, `Render unto Caesar things that
are Caesar's, and render unto God things that are God's.' And I
believe that this is a secular event.''

WILL MLB SHED ITS LOSERS? 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several big-league owners floated what seemed like a silly idea
a few months ago, shrinking the major leagues from 30 clubs to 28,
or even 26. At first, most other owners laughed at the proposition.
</P>
<P>
   But recent weeks have seen the idea gain momentum in many
circles. Suddenly, it's not such a foolish idea. In fact, there are
some owners who want to bring it up for a serious feasibility study
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   With several clubs completely unable to compete because of low
revenues and virtually no serious fan base, the idea would go
something like this: Have the remaining 26 clubs pay each of the
four struggling franchises $150 million each. Then have a dispersal
draft with the players in those organizations and have them filter
out throughout the remaining major league clubs.
</P>
<P>
   With more revenue to share among fewer clubs, several owners
believe this move would make fiscal sense.
</P>
<P>
   Or, have the four struggling clubs merge into two clubs, though
that idea has less possibility since they would still be playing in
a low-revenue area. Some of the possible clubs being mentioned for
such a drastic move include Montreal, Oakland, Kansas City,
Minnesota, Florida and Tampa Bay. All but Tampa Bay and Florida,
which was sold within the past year, are on the market.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Kansas City, none of the above-mentioned
has a feasible stadium to play in and none is in steady ownership
hands, making them all liable for a worst-case scenario. Baseball
has not had a club go belly-up in the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   Some have come close but been saved by ownerships in other
cities, such as when the Washington Senators moved to Texas in 1972
or when the St. Louis Browns relocated to Baltimore in 1954. The
old Senators also picked up and left the D.C. metro area for
Minnesota in 1960, but that was a move where the Griffith family
kept and moved the club itself.
</P>
<P>
   This is no longer a laughing matter. It's scary, especially for
baseball purists who do not want to see the game tarnished by such
an ugly move that would be certain to draw the ire of many.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mere fact that the idea is gaining steam should let
all know that the game is in some trouble, at least in some pockets
around North America. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
 &UR; Mark Grace of the Chicago Cubs and former Cubs teammate and now
Texas slugger  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro are in a heated battle to become the
1990s hits leader entering the weekend. Grace entered Friday's
action with 1,752 hits, just five ahead of Palmeiro's 1,747. Name
the decade hits leaders for the previous 50 years? &QL; 
Vaughn's new home? &QL; 
There are several reasons that Cincinnati General Manager  &UR; Jim
Bowden would like to have outfielder  &UR; Greg Vaughn, a free agent
after this season, return in 2000. Of course, Vaughn's 44 home runs
and 115 RBI entering the weekend are reason enough.
</P>
<P>
   But there's so much more, Bowden believes. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   ``Because when we were down 6-1 to St. Louis last Sunday, he was
stalking the dugout snarling, `Don't give up, don't give up, don't
give up.' (The Reds came back to win, 9-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he took one of our young players privately into the
training room, stood him against a wall and said, `It's not about
you, it's about us. It's not about your stats, it is about us
winning.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Because on a hot day when it was 150 degrees on the AstroTurf
and the young players thought it was too scorching to take batting
practice, Vaughn walked to the field carrying his bat and they all
followed him like puppy dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' 95 victories entering the weekend series were the most
since the 1976 Big Red Machine finished 102-60. &QL; 
Parting words? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled and often complicated Los Angeles outfielder  &UR; Raul
 &UR; Mondesi publicly apologized for his August tirade, seven weeks
after he blasted Manager Davey Johnson and General Manager Kevin
Malone in a profanity-laced lashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel bad about this,'' Mondesi told Dodgers writers
in Spanish through translator  &UR; Eugene Mato, who also doubles as a
business associate. ``I feel bad that what happened and that I used
(foul) language and said those things. I know I'm a role model,and
you shouldn't use that type of language when you're a role model,
especially if you are. That wasn't right and I want fans to know
that I'm sorry about that. I've always loved the fans and that's
why I feel really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who reached 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases for the
second time in his career, wouldn't discuss if he still wants to be
traded or what his current feelings were toward Johnson and/or
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm going to be back or not, but I want the
fans to know how much they've meant to me,'' he said. ``Even if I
end up someplace else, I don't think I would ever find a better
group of fans. They will always be in my heart. Always.'' &QL; 
Ozzie's wizardry &QL; 
 &UR; Ozzie Guillen, who can rarely be found without a smile on his face,
went through a panic attack last weekend when he found himself in
Atlanta's starting lineup for the first time since July 31, the
same night the Braves traded for  &UR; Jose Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   As Guillen started to gather his gear he couldn't find his knee
sleeve and protective cup. After all, neither has been of much use
for Guillen, who routinely throws batting practice, in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forget how to put my (stuff) on,'' he said. ``I haven't worn
a jock in two months.'' &QL; 
With all due respect &QL; 
For Detroit's final game ever at Tiger Stadium, the starters wore
the uniform numbers of the all-time Tigers team as selected by
fans. That meant  &UR; Gabe Kapler, starting in center field, wore no
number since  &UR; Ty &UR; Cobb played before uniform numbers were used in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It also meant former Diamondbacks player  &UR; Karim Garcia, starting
in right field, wore the No. 6 of Hall of Famer  &UR; Al Kaline, which
is quite a stretch considering the quiet elegance with which Kaline
patrolled that particular corner of Tiger Stadium. To his credit,
Garcia said he only hoped he could live up to the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Free Press'' baseball writer  &UR; Gene Guidi had this to
say about Garcia's play during the final game:
</P>
<P>
   ``Garcia went out and had a Kaline-type game, making all the
plays in right field, hitting the cutoff man regularly, uncorking a
crisp throw to home plate that arrived on target on the fly to hold
a runner at third, and then capping the all-around performance with
a tiebreaking, two-run homer in the bottom of the sixth that turned
out to be the game-winning hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes fantasies do come true. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
 &UR; Robin Yount led everyone in the 1980s with 1,731 hits;  &UR; Pete Rose
was the leader in the 1970s with 2,045;  &UR; Roberto Clemente led the
1960s with 1,877;  &UR; Richie Ashburn was the 1950s leader with 1,875;
and  &UR; Lou
 &UR; Boudreau led the 1940s with 1,578 hits.  &UR; Ted Williams (1,303) and
 &UR; Joe
 &UR; DiMaggio (1,156) missed three full seasons in the 1940s while
enlisted in the military during World War II. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. AtlantaBraves are only the fourth club to have three straight
100-win seasons.  &QL; 
2. ArizonaThere's no denying that this club's rotation makes it
dangerous.  &QL; 
3. NY YankeesThe Yanks have been laying low, which could mean big
trouble for others.  &QL; 
4. ClevelandFor the second time in Indians history, a 50-win season
on the road.  &QL; 
5. CincinnatiThe Reds have very little to lose at this point,
making them scary.  &QL; 
6. HoustonYet again, the Killer B's get set to try to erase bad
playoff demons.  &QL; 
7. TexasWhere, oh where has one-time super rookie  &UR; Jeff Zimmerman's
stuff gone?  &QL; 
8. BostonHe may not be able to spell his first name, but boy
can &UR; Jimy Williams manage.  &QL; 
9. NY MetsHow big does a noose have to be for 25 players, plus one
outgoing manager? &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. MinnesotaIs 2000 the final year of baseball in the Twin Cities?
It might be.  &QL; 
29. FloridaThey won't lose 100, but they do need more than $100
million for a stadium.  &QL; 
28. Kansas CityIt may not look like it, but the Royals actually
made progress.  &QL; 
27. MontrealToo bad ``Les Expos'' played in front of far fewer fans
than they deserve.  &QL; 
26. Chicago CubsHave lost at least 93 games in two of the past
three seasons.  &QL; 
25. Colorado &UR; Pedro Astacio needs some big-time help.  &UR; Darryl Kile,
you listening?  &QL; 
24. Tampa BayHow far down and out would the Rays be without
 &UR; Roberto &UR; Hernandez?  &QL; 
23. AnaheimIf Disney is selling,  &UR; Reggie Jackson wants to be part
of the new group.  &QL; 
22. St. LouisBig Mac is impressive, but this club is filled with so
many holes. ON THE RISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Detroit Tigers: The Tigers are finishing in a flurry, which
they will say will help matters in 2000. They lie. None of this
will matter. What will help this franchise is moving into new
Comerica Park next April. What will also help is pushing the
payroll from $35 million to somewhere over $50 million. This club
is not as far away as its record might indicate. Detroit has many
young players that other clubs would love to trade for. If some of
the young arms can rebound, the Tigers appear to be the only club
in this division capable of giving Cleveland a run for the division
title in the near future. Keep an eye on the Motown Cats. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Oakland Athletics: Manager  &UR; Art Howe did a remarkable job of
pushing the A's into contention, keeping them there up until the
final week of the season. But the tank ran out of gas down the
stretch and Oakland is sputtering home in these final games,
apparently unable to lift itself up from having the pedal to the
metal throughout most of the second half. None of it should take
away from a wonderful list of spunky and low-budget accomplishments
this A's club managed in 1999. Coming close to repeating this
year's fortunes will be nearly impossible next season, and that's a
shame. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer and legendary center fielder  &UR; Willie Mays,
explaining the simple formula for playing the notorious swirling
winds in the outfield at Candlestick Park, ``Take two steps in and
five steps back, and get the ball.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but surely,  &UR; Brian Daubach climbed the ladder of Red Sox
rookie lore, joining the likes of  &UR; Ted Williams,  &UR; Fred Lynn,  &UR; Jim
 &UR; Rice,  &UR; Rico Petrocelli and  &UR; Tony Conigliaro. Daubach has already
become a household name in New England. With the playoffs set to
start this week, he is sure to make his presence known throughout
the country to baseball fans everywhere. Daubach entered the final
weekend series with 21 home runs and 72 RBI while batting .291 in
374 at-bats. More impressively, he made many Red Sox fans forget
all about  &UR; Mo Vaughn. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Now this is what we call giving back to the fans: In an era
when security guards often believe they are a godlike presence,
authorities freely allowed fans to reach over the low railing at
Tiger Stadium all last week and scoop up cups of dirt. A big
high-five to Tigers officials.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; People's exhibit No.  &UR; 893 against Philadelphia: During the
sixth inning last Sunday's game between the Mets and Philadelphia,
the person responsible for the music at Veterans Stadium selected
military ``Taps'' to play over the loudspeakers as the men from
Queens were on their way to being swept in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback (special last-day selection): Solomon Torres.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If they could somehow land Sean Casey, they may
 &UR; really have some marketing magic: The Class A Stockton Ports of the
California League will change their name to the Stockton Mudville
Nine for the 2000 season. Local historians believe  &UR; Ernest L.
Thayer penned his ode, ``Casey at the Bat,'' after a Stockton
baseball club in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thanks for coming, but you really shouldn't have: Philadelphia
climbed to a season-best 13 games over .500 on Aug. 6. The next day
the Phillies celebrated their century in baseball, a ceremony that
included former Manager  &UR; Gene Mauch, who presided over the most
well-known collapse in baseball history in 1964. The Phillies lost
34 of their next 44 games. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Diego closer  &UR; Trevor Hoffman entered the weekend against
Arizona needing two saves to break  &UR; Dennis Eckersley's
consecutive-season record of 94 saves. Hoffman, who had 53 saves in
54 chances last year, had 40 in 43 opportunities this season before
the final series.
</P>
<P>
   Some interesting perspective on Cleveland's  &UR; Manny
 &UR; Ramirez and his 165 RBI: Here are the career highs for some pretty
decent hitters;  &UR; Willie Mays (141),  &UR; Mickey Mantle (130),  &UR; Ted
Williams (159),  &UR; Reggie Jackson (118),  &UR; Mike Schmidt (121),  &UR; Stan
Musial (131),
 &UR; Frank Robinson (136),  &UR; Harmon Killebrew (140),  &UR; Rogers Hornsby
(152) and
 &UR; Hank Aaron (132).
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta outfielder  &UR; Brian Jordan, who had been struggling for
more than a month because of an ailing right hand and wrist, has
been treated by track guru  &UR; Bob Kersee, husband of  &UR; Jackie
 &UR; Joyner-Kersee for two weeks now. Jordan entered the weekend series
batting .333 (10 for 23) with nine RBI in his previous eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals franchise may be only 31 years old, but
already they have been on hand for the final game played at four
different stadiums. The Royals, the opponent in the final game at
Tiger Stadium Monday, have also been on had for finales at their
own Municipal Stadium in 1972, Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium
(1981) and Texas' Arlington Stadium (1993).
</P>
<P>
   A pair of ``New York Post'' headlines describing the Mets play
during the past week: ``Chokers Wild,'' and one about Manager
 &UR; Bobby Valentine, who offered to step aside if the Mets failed to
reach the playoffs, ``Why wait? Can the Phony Now!''
</P>
<P>
   Former Florida Marlins washout prospect  &UR; Josh Booty started at
quarterback for LSU Saturday night. Booty hit .198 during five
mostly unproductive seasons in the Marlins' system. At 24, he has
to be the oldest college quarterback in the country. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Seattle landing the 2001 All-Star Game and Milwaukee being
awarded the 2002 game, look for Arizona to be in a strong position
to lay claim to the 2004 midsummer classic, but that's only if the
D-Backs are still in the NL. Otherwise, it could be 2003 or 2005
for Bank One Ballpark to host the game.
</P>

   There is strong talk around the Bronx these days that New York
batting coach  &UR; Chris Chambliss is in jeopardy of losing his job
after this season, no matter what the Yankees do in the playoffs.
If so, look for  &UR; Don Mattingly to return to the Yankees as batting
coach.

   If  &UR; Mike Munoz cannot pitch for Texas in the playoffs (he
dropped a computer monitor on his small right toe), Texas may be
forced to go with  &UR; Jeff Fassero in its bullpen. Fassero has a 6.06
ERA and left-handed batters are hitting .462 (6 for 13) against
him.

   If  &UR; Buddy Bell does not land the Colorado Rockies managing
position, something terrible would have occurred. Bell is, far and
away, the leading candidate to replace  &UR; Jim Leyland, who said he
will retire after today's game.

   With a three-year extension worth $20 million, left-handed
starter  &UR; David Wells is fully aware that he may not return to
Toronto next season. Wells is 16-10 and has logged more than 222
innings. ``I thought I was going to be in New York for a long time,
and look what happened there,'' he said.

   Seattle's  &UR; Edgar Martinez, arguably the greatest designated
hitter ever (a title that doesn't look so impressive in print, does
it?), appears to be closing in a one-year deal for the 2000 season
that will pay him somewhere around $6 million. &QL;
