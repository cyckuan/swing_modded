<HEADLINE> Ala. Suspect Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIANA, Ala. (AP) -- A man who allegedly killed three people  
in shootings at two companies he used to work at pleaded innocent 
today by reason of mental disease or defect. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ordered psychiatric tests for Alan Eugene Miller, 34.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller is charged with capital murder in the slayings of Lee  
Holdbrooks, 32; Christopher Scott Yancy, 28; Terry Jarvis, 39. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller worked as a truck driver at Ferguson Enterprises, where  
gunfire first erupted. Holdbrooks, a truck driver, and Yancy, a 
dispatcher, were shot there. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis was killed later at Post Airgas, where Miller formerly  
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	A capital murder conviction carries a penalty of either life in  
prison without parole or the death penalty. Defense attorneys have 
said Miller would be committed to a state institution if found 
innocent by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Robby Owens said he plans to seek the death  
penalty for the Aug 5 shootings in Pelham.

<HEADLINE> Smith Agrees to Terms With T'Wolves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Free agent forward Joe Smith has agreed to  
terms with the Minnesota Timberwolves 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said today he signed a one-year, $2.2 million deal because  
he liked playing alongside Kevin Garnett and liked the direction 
the team was headed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely could have gotten a better deal elsewhere but  
this wasn't about my financial state,'' Smith said. ``When I came 
here last year I wanted to put the fun back in the game and be on a 
team that plays hard every night. I found that here. I like playing 
with Kevin and I like playing for Flip Saunders'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders, coach and general manager, said: ``Joe and KG (Kevin  
Garnett) really complement each other and give us two of the best 
shot-blocking forwards in the game today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith appeared in 43 games for the Timberwolves last season,  
averaging 13.7 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks. He was ninth in 
the league in offensive rebounding with 3.6 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was the No. 1 overall selection in the 1995 draft when he  
was chosen by the Golden State Warriors. He was traded to the 
Philadelphia 76ers on Feb. 17, 1998, and signed with the Wolves as 
a free agent last season.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Coke Scare Still Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Coca-Cola's explanation for the  
contamination of its products in Belgium is highly unlikely, 
although the cause of the health scare remains a mystery, the 
European Commission said in a report issued this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was drawn up last month and posted Monday on the Web  
site of the consumer affairs department of the European Union's 
executive body, nearly two months after dozens of people complained 
of headaches, nausea and stomach pains after drinking Coke 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints led to Coke products being withdrawn from stores  
in France and Belgium, the biggest product recall in Coke's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU report cast doubt on Coke's claim that the problem was  
related both to substandard gas used to put the fizz into Coke at a 
Belgian bottling plant and contamination of cans by a wood 
preservative on pallets used to transport Coke to Belgium from at a 
plant in northern France. 
</P>
<P>
	``The duality of explanations producing comparable symptoms at  
the same time is, from a scientific point of view, highly 
unlikely,'' the French-language report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission inspectors suggested a production fault could have  
led to high concentrations of certain plant extracts in the Coke, 
or a contamination by products used to clean vats and pipes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola stuck by its findings.  
</P>
<P>
	``Based on our extensive internal analysis as well as a  
significant number of independent studies, we believe the two 
quality breakdowns that we reported were indeed the source of the 
incident,'' said Paul Pendergrass, Coca-Cola's European spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company is awaiting the results of another study by  
Pasteur Institute in Paris due in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission inspectors criticized the Belgian and French  
authorities' handling of the scare and demanded they continue 
looking for what caused consumers' health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	French and Belgian health authorities responded by insisting  
they contained the scare. They doubted the need for further 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the Belgian authorities are concerned, the question  
is resolved. Further tests are useless unless there are some new 
developments,'' said a letter from the Belgian Health Ministry, 
also posted on the Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium and France lifted restrictions on the sale of Coke  
products June 23 after inspections failed to find any health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate incident Tuesday, Coke said it was investigating  
the widely reported complaint of a Belgian woman who said her can 
of Coke tasted of paint thinner. The company said it appeared to be 
an isolated incident resulting from a problem outside the 
production process.

<HEADLINE>  Daubach Has Dream Season for Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The mail is piled waist-high next to Brian  
Daubach's locker, a leaning tower of cards and letters in danger of 
being knocked over in the next media crush. 
</P>
<P>
	And every one of them is addressed to Nomar Garciaparra.  
</P>
<P>
	Daubach? His mail fits neatly into the general delivery  
cubbyholes provided for the more mortal Boston players. But at the 
rate the rookie first baseman is going, he could join Garciaparra 
in the hearts of Red Sox fans -- and in the record book as well. 
</P>
<P>
	After nine years in the minor leagues -- and then being released  
by the lowly Florida Marlins -- Daubach is among the top contenders 
for the AL rookie of the year award, an honor his clubhouse 
neighbor won in 1997. The 27-year-old Daubach is batting .338 with 
19 homers and 68 RBIs -- driving in 15 runs one four-game stretch 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boy can hit,'' Oakland designated hitter Matt Stairs said  
Monday night after watching Daubach beat his A's with a two-out, 
full-count, three-run double. ``He's my rookie of the year, that's 
for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other contenders for the award voted on by the Baseball Writers  
Association of America include Kansas City outfielder Carlos 
Beltran, who's hitting .292 with 18 homers and 80 RBIs, and Toronto 
closer Billy Koch, who has 24 saves and a 2.35 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally a 19th-round pick by the New York Mets in 1990,  
Daubach bounced around the minors for nine years and filled in as a 
replacement player during the 1994-95 strike. He led the 
International League with 35 homers and 124 RBIs last season, then 
had 15 at-bats with Florida as a September callup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you spend a lot of time in the minor leagues, you get  
labeled a Triple-A player,'' Daubach said. ``That's what you doubt 
more than anything else: whether you'll get the opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins didn't give it to him, so he accepted an invitation  
to go to spring training with the Red Sox, who were looking for 
someone to play first base after Mo Vaughn signed with Anaheim as a 
free agent. Now, for just $215,000, he's outperforming his $13 
million-a-year predecessor, who has been hurt much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never got a chance with the Mets,'' said teammate Butch  
Huskey. ``But he's one of those players who, when he was down 
there, he worked on his craft. Anybody can see that because he's 
doing it here now. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys that don't get the opportunity can come up and  
play. But you need a break. You need someone in your corner to get 
you to the big leagues. And when you get the opportunity, you need 
to make the most of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is exactly what Daubach has done.  
</P>
<P>
	Hours after he was named the AL's player of the week for Aug.  
9-15, batting .500 with three homers and 15 RBIs, Daubach came to 
the plate with the bases loaded, two outs and the Red Sox trailing 
5-3. He worked the count to 3-1 and then fouled off five 
consecutive pitches, missing a homer down the right-field line by 
inches, before doubling off the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-5 victory held the Athletics at bay in the AL wild-card  
race. Instead of a tie, Boston led Oakland by two games after 
Monday's games. 
</P>
<P>
	``For August, this is probably the biggest series we're going to  
have,'' Daubach said. ``It's an emotional time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was the most important hit he ever had, Daubach said  
he was more excited when he hit his first major league homer off 
Graeme Lloyd on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when I knew I belonged,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	With his next home run, Daubach will join Ted Williams and Fred  
Lynn as the only Red Sox left-handers to hit 20 homers in their 
rookie year. If he keeps it up, he could join Walt Dropo, Don 
Schwall, Carlton Fisk, Lynn and Garciaparra as Red Sox players to 
win the rookie of the year award. No award was given in Williams' 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Then maybe his mail will be spilling into Garciaparra's locker.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think (the fans) appreciate where he's come from, and maybe  
they can associate with the work ethic and the time it's taken to 
get the opportunity,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said. ``And 
then to be successful like that, maybe a lot of them feel that it's 
them in that uniform with him.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Seek Food, Drugs for Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a visit to Cuba that included talks with  
President Fidel Castro, the Senate's Democratic leader and a fellow 
farm-state senator say both Americans and Cubans could benefit from 
an easing of barriers to the sale of food and drugs to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the  
highest-ranking elected U.S. official to visit Cuba in years, and 
Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., talked about their visit to Cuba in a 
press statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Their three-day visit began Friday, nine days after the Senate  
voted to allow essentially unrestricted food and drug sales to the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of the amendment, approved 70-28, will be decided by  
House-Senate conferees. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle and Dorgan, who returned Sunday, said Cuban officials  
told them the country imports almost $1 billion in food and 
medicine and that food imports could double in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators also said Cuban doctors and hospital officials told  
them more than 200 pharmaceuticals are out of stock in Cuba, which 
has created a serious need to replenish the country's supply of 
medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It serves neither the U.S.'s nor Cuba's interest to continue  
the embargo on vital supplies like food and medicine,'' Daschle 
said. Dorgan added: ``To continue such an embargo only hurts U.S. 
family farmers, who are prevented from serving that market, and the 
citizens of Cuba, who need the food and medicine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts over the years by congressional opponents of the  
three-decade-old trade embargo normally have been easily defeated 
by embargo supporters. The Aug. 4 vote reflected congressional 
eagerness to ease the plight of American farmers rather than a 
general softening of attitudes toward Castro's communist-led 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Monday evening, Dorgan said Cuban  
officials had said he and Daschle were free to speak to any Cuban 
during their visit. But, he said, Cuban leaders from Castro on down 
refused them access to four Cuban dissidents sentenced in March to 
prison terms of 3 years to 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan said he had a special interest in meeting with one of  
that group who is fasting -- an apparent reference to Marta Beatriz 
Roque, an economist who is serving a 3 1/2-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan said Castro seemed unmoved by the argument that virtually  
every country, including longtime communist bastions Vietnam and 
China, have embraced many elements of the free market approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He staunchly defended the current system,'' Dorgan said. ``He  
staunchly defends what he has done. ... He rejects the notion that 
there are human rights violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who was born in Cuba,  
criticized Daschle and Dorgan on Monday. They were ``feasting with 
Cuban dictator Fidel Castro while the Cuban people are condemned to 
misery and oppression by the dictatorship,'' the congressman said.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Pumps To Be on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) -- Drivers getting gas at some of BP Amoco  
PLC's gas stations will soon also be able to obtain traffic and 
weather information through the oil company's new 
Internet-connected kiosks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the three-year deal with BP Amoco, Tokheim Corp. is  
providing new pumps that include Web browsers using Microsoft 
Corp.'s Windows CE operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to weather and traffic reports, the new pumps  
include a system that allows customers to reserve hotel rooms and 
prints booking confirmations, said John Negovetich, Tokheim's 
executive vice president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The kiosks will also enable BP Amoco to track the sales of its  
franchisees and the buying habits of customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The kiosks were jointly developed by Tokheim and Radiant  
Systems, a point-of-sale technology company based in Alpharetta, 
Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokheim, based in Fort Wayne, is primarily engaged in the  
design, manufacture and servicing of gas station equipment, 
point-of-sales control systems and card- and cash-activated 
transaction systems. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco, based in London, is one of the world's largest  
producers of oil, natural gas, petrochemical and solar products.

	For more than a year, Nebiolo, who has steered the  
organization's growth for 18 years, has been rumored to be in ill 
health with prostate cancer, but he has denied the suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am well and I hope people continue to talk about my healing  
because it brings me luck,'' said the gravely voiced Nebiolo, who 
remains extremely active for someone considered to be ailing. ``I 
heard I am sick, but what can I say.

	``I am not the fighter I once was, but I am still in perfect  
shape.''

<P>
	Nebiolo's spokesman, Giorgio Reineri, also discounts the rumors  
about his boss' health. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he looks tired, but his brain is working perfectly,''  
Reineri said. ``He has a terrific memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo certainly needs a good memory just to keep track of all  
his responsibilities.

<P>
	In addition to being chief of the IAAF, he has been president of  
the International University Sport Federation (FISU) since 1961, 
president of the Association of Summer Olympics International 
Federations (AOSIF) since 1983, a member of the International 
Olympic Committee since 1992, and president of the University 
Sports Club of Turin, his hometown, since 1948.

<P>
	The tireless and enthusiastic Nebiolo also is chairman of  
several companies, particularly in the field of construction. In 
May 1991, he was appointed by the Italian government to the 
administrative board of Finmeccanica, one of the largest state 
holding companies in Italy, comprised of 85 companies with more 
than 95,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In sports, Nebiolo's biggest impact has been with the IAAF.

<P>
	When he took over in 1981, there were fewer than 100 members.  
Now, there are more than 200.

<P>
	He has skillfully overseen the transition of the sport from  
amateur to professional. Older athletes such as 35-year-old pole 
vaulter Sergei Bubka and long sprinter Michael Johnson, 31, have 
kept competing because they can make a generous living from track 
and field. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo introduced prize money, appearance fees, world-record

<HEADLINE>  Daubach Has Dream Season for Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The mail is piled waist-high next to Brian  
Daubach's locker, a leaning tower of cards and letters in danger of 
being knocked over in the next media crush. 
</P>
<P>
	And every one of them is addressed to Nomar Garciaparra.  
</P>
<P>
	Daubach? His mail fits neatly into the general delivery  
cubbyholes provided for the more mortal Boston players. But at the 
rate the rookie first baseman is going, he could join Garciaparra 
in the hearts of Red Sox fans -- and in the record book as well. 
</P>
<P>
	After nine years in the minor leagues -- and then being released  
by the lowly Florida Marlins -- Daubach is among the top contenders 
for the AL rookie of the year award, an honor his clubhouse 
neighbor won in 1997. The 27-year-old Daubach is batting .338 with 
19 homers and 68 RBIs -- driving in 15 runs one four-game stretch 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boy can hit,'' Oakland designated hitter Matt Stairs said  
Monday night after watching Daubach beat his A's with a two-out, 
full-count, three-run double. ``He's my rookie of the year, that's 
for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other contenders for the award voted on by the Baseball Writers  
Association of America include Kansas City outfielder Carlos 
Beltran, who's hitting .292 with 18 homers and 80 RBIs, and Toronto 
closer Billy Koch, who has 24 saves and a 2.35 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally a 19th-round pick by the New York Mets in 1990,  
Daubach bounced around the minors for nine years and filled in as a 
replacement player during the 1994-95 strike. He led the 
International League with 35 homers and 124 RBIs last season, then 
had 15 at-bats with Florida as a September callup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you spend a lot of time in the minor leagues, you get  
labeled a Triple-A player,'' Daubach said. ``That's what you doubt 
more than anything else: whether you'll get the opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins didn't give it to him, so he accepted an invitation  
to go to spring training with the Red Sox, who were looking for 
someone to play first base after Mo Vaughn signed with Anaheim as a 
free agent. Now, for just $215,000, he's outperforming his $13 
million-a-year predecessor, who has been hurt much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never got a chance with the Mets,'' said teammate Butch  
Huskey. ``But he's one of those players who, when he was down 
there, he worked on his craft. Anybody can see that because he's 
doing it here now. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys that don't get the opportunity can come up and  
play. But you need a break. You need someone in your corner to get 
you to the big leagues. And when you get the opportunity, you need 
to make the most of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is exactly what Daubach has done.  
</P>
<P>
	Hours after he was named the AL's player of the week for Aug.  
9-15, batting .500 with three homers and 15 RBIs, Daubach came to 
the plate with the bases loaded, two outs and the Red Sox trailing 
5-3. He worked the count to 3-1 and then fouled off five 
consecutive pitches, missing a homer down the right-field line by 
inches, before doubling off the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-5 victory held the Athletics at bay in the AL wild-card  
race. Instead of a tie, Boston led Oakland by two games after 
Monday's games. 
</P>
<P>
	``For August, this is probably the biggest series we're going to  
have,'' Daubach said. ``It's an emotional time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was the most important hit he ever had, Daubach said  
he was more excited when he hit his first major league homer off 
Graeme Lloyd on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when I knew I belonged,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	With his next home run, Daubach will join Ted Williams and Fred  
Lynn as the only Red Sox left-handers to hit 20 homers in their 
rookie year. If he keeps it up, he could join Walt Dropo, Don 
Schwall, Carlton Fisk, Lynn and Garciaparra as Red Sox players to 
win the rookie of the year award. No award was given in Williams' 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Then maybe his mail will be spilling into Garciaparra's locker.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think (the fans) appreciate where he's come from, and maybe  
they can associate with the work ethic and the time it's taken to 
get the opportunity,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said. ``And 
then to be successful like that, maybe a lot of them feel that it's 
them in that uniform with him.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs $8.4B Military Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With reservations about unnecessary spending  
and an admonition to Congress to speed up its work, President 
Clinton signed an $8.4 billion spending bill Tuesday to underwrite 
new military construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Military Construction Appropriations Act pays  
for ``the vast majority'' of his requested military construction 
projects and housing program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The requested projects are critical to supporting military  
readiness and the quality of life of our soldiers and their 
families,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he signed the bill, Clinton criticized lawmakers for  
providing $93 million less than he requested for a chemical weapons 
decommissioning program and adding $301 million for 40 projects the 
Defense Department did not list as priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made a similar complaint Tuesday in signing a $4 billion  
bill funding flood control and other water projects. He said he is 
disappointed that Congress piled on new projects the Army Corps of 
Engineers cannot afford, especially since the Corps already has a 
$27 billion backlog in water resources projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The president noted that Congress has finished work on only two  
of the 13 appropriations bills it must complete by the end of 
September. Republican provisions in many of the remaining bills 
already have drawn veto threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the remaining bills would require deep cuts in  
essential government programs, including education, law 
enforcement, science and technology, the environment,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge Congress to approach this work responsibly in order to  
pass funding bills which are sufficient to meet our nation's 
needs.''

<HEADLINE> Court Stays Texas Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A court today halted the planned  
execution of a man who was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, 
in a case that critics say demonstrates problems with the state's 
treatment of the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 5-4 ruling, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the  
state's highest criminal court, blocked tonight's scheduled lethal 
injection of Larry Robison after his attorneys questioned the 
inmate's mental competence. He was convicted in a rampage that 
claimed five lives 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Death penalty opponents and Robison's relatives have held for  
years he should be spared execution because he was insane and 
demanded that Gov. George W. Bush, running for president as a 
``compassionate conservative,'' show his humanitarianism by 
postponing this evening's punishment. Bush had not announced his 
decision by the time the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Browne, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general's  
office, said it was not immediately clear if the state could or 
would appeal the court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In its brief, four-paragraph opinion, the court sent the  
question of insanity back to the trial court. It effectively puts 
the execution off for weeks if not months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he has long suffered from schizophrenia, he does not  
understand the nature of the punishment to be imposed upon him,'' 
Judge Tom Price wrote in a concurring opinion to the short order. 
</P>
<P>
	Robison doesn't deny the killings and said he's looking forward  
to his execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real excited about it and glad to be leaving here,'' he  
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But relatives of the 42-year-old and capital punishment  
opponents cite Robison as an example of why mentally ill people 
should be treated for their conditions instead of executed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the rampage, Robison had been diagnosed as a paranoid  
schizophrenic. But he was not considered violent and was released 
from a number of public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys filed a last-day appeal that challenged his mental  
competency. Similar claims were rejected earlier by state and 
federal courts. All nine justices on the appeals court are 
Republicans, and run for election. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted  
unanimously against recommending to Bush that the death sentence be 
commuted to life. Besides the last-minute appeal to the courts, the 
only other recourse that had been left would have been for Bush to 
issue a one-time 30-day reprieve, something he never has done in 
his nearly five years as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Edwards, a Bush spokeswoman, had said the governor would  
announce a decision today. 
</P>
<P>
	The former construction worker from Abilene was arrested Aug.  
11, 1982, in Wichita, Kan., driving the car of 33-year-old Bruce 
Gardner of Lake Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous day, Gardner was one of five people found  
mutilated, shot or stabbed in neighboring cottages near Lake Worth. 
Also killed were Gardner's girlfriend, Georgia Ann Reed, 34; her 
mother, Earline Barker, 55; and Ms. Reed's 11-year-old son, Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	In a cottage next door, authorities found the remains of Rickey  
Lee Bryant, 31, Robison's lover and roommate, who had been shot 
twice in the head, decapitated, and stabbed 49 times. His genitals 
were found in the kitchen sink. 
</P>
<P>
	Robison pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, but a jury  
convicted him of capital murder for Gardner's slaying and sentenced 
him to death. The conviction was overturned because of an error by 
the trial judge, but Robison was retried, convicted and condemned 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Lois, who has been leading a years-long effort to  
spare her son, says neither the public nor juries understand mental 
illness and that he deserves treatment rather than death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of punishment, even death, means nothing to a  
psychotic person,'' she had said earlier. ``If we really want to 
stop these most horrendous crimes, and be safe in our homes and on 
our streets, prevention is the only answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capital punishment opponents like Amnesty International and  
religious groups, including representatives of the Vatican, had 
joined her in pleas to the governor, the parole board and others. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that mentally ill people  
could be executed as long as they understood the punishment that 
awaited them and why they were being put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Pipes, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted  
Robison, said the idea that he was insane is an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did diagnose him (as schizophrenic),'' Pipes said. ``But  
there are an awful lot of people diagnosed as schizophrenic that 
aren't killing people.''

<HEADLINE> Scientist Says Matter in Black Hole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA scientists have detected what they say  
may be the first actual evidence of matter falling into a black 
hole in space. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics,  
Paul Nandra and colleagues at Goddard Space Flight Center in 
Greenbelt, Md., observed the emission of X-rays from iron atoms in 
the gas swirling around a central, dense object. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the X-rays was a rare light emission from iron atoms  
traveling away from the viewer at 6.5 million miles per hour -- 
possibly a mark of material being drawn into a black hole, Nandra 
reported in an upcoming edition of Astrophysical Journal Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	This differs from the previously observed phenomena regarding  
black holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You often see evidence of matter flying out of a black hole,  
but never falling in,'' Nandra, an astrophysicist, said in a 
statement. ``The evidence is pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The data came from five days of observation of galaxy NGC 3516  
about 100 million light years away. It is thought to harbor a 
massive black hole. 
</P>
<P>
	In a black hole, the force of gravity is so powerful that  
nothing, not even light, can escape its pull. 
</P>
<P>
	Buried in the typical X-ray emissions from matter around black  
holes, however, was a rare glimpse of a red-shifted light from iron 
atoms. That suggests matter is moving away from the viewer -- in 
this case at about 6.5 million miles per hour, towards the black 
hole, Nandra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The emission spectrum is a breakdown of light into its component  
colors, much like a prism separates white light into a rainbow. 
This provides information about the type of gas emitting the light, 
as well as its velocity, temperature and pressure. The emission 
from NGC 3516 comes from a blur of gas molecules or atoms moving in 
many directions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Nandra detected a red-shift, he knew the matter was  
moving away from Earth because of the Doppler effect. It is the 
same phenomenon that distorts the sound of the horn on a speeding 
car as it approaches and passes. The Doppler effect distorts light 
waves as well as sound waves. Objects moving away emit light with 
wavelengths shifted towards red light, those approaching appear 
more blue.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants in N.H. Jail Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Immigrants being held in a New Hampshire  
jail are protesting the conditions of their confinement by refusing 
to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	The detainees claim they are locked up for 20 hours a day, get  
only half-hour visits, are verbally abused by staff and have to 
wait a week to get new clothing. They also say they do not have 
enough information about their cases and access to the court 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the immigrants, Sophan Srey, 21, of Cambodia, said in a  
telephone interview that 16 people stopped eating on Monday, and by 
Tuesday night, 50 people were participating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The officers abuse us all the time, they call us names,'' he  
said. ``They tell us we have no rights in New Hampshire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James O'Mara Jr., the jail's superintendent, said only 13  
detainees were refusing to eat. O'Mara said he would investigate 
claims that staff members had been abusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Otten, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service, said INS and county jail officials would meet with the 
inmates to try to resolve their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS detains about 16,000 people in prisons and jails, partly  
the result of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant 
Responsibility Act, which allows immigrants guilty of minor crimes 
to be deported or detained for long periods.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Gov. Vetoes Umpire Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Legislation that would have protected  
umpires and referees from violent fans was vetoed by Illinois Gov. 
George Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan vetoed a bill this weekend making it illegal to attack  
sports officials and setting a minimum $1,000 fine for offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor argued the bill was vague because it applied to  
attacks on ``sports officials,'' which could include coaches, 
ticket-takers or any stadium personnel. He also said it is unneeded 
because it already is a felony to attack someone -- sports official 
or not -- in a public place. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Senate President James ``Pate'' Philip spoke against the  
bill in the Legislature, saying umpires and referees ``deserve a 
pop every once in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators roared with laughter and quickly voted 33-16 -- with  
Philip voting ``no'' -- to advance the legislation to the House, 
where it also won passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip later explained he has never attacked a referee but  
considers them a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Mano, president of the Wisconsin-based National  
Association of Sports Officials, said his group gets a police 
report every week on violence against referees and umpires.

<HEADLINE> Doctors: Elliott Might Play Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott can keep his dream of returning  
to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old San Antonio Spurs star should be able to live a  
normal life -- and perhaps even play basketball again -- after a 
successful kidney transplant from his brother, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly unprecedented, but he's a very motivated  
individual,'' said Dr. Francis Wright, who performed the surgery 
Monday at Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not going to be the one who tells him he can't  
play basketball again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a 10-year NBA veteran and starting forward on the  
championship Spurs, could leave the hospital within a week and 
start his workout regimen within the next two months if he's up to 
it, Wright said. The NBA season starts in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said it will take up to three months before they  
know for sure whether he can play again in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recommend some limitation on activity for six to eight  
weeks to allow the incision to heal properly,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, who must take medication the rest of his life, was in  
stable condition and was expected to be moved out of intensive care 
into a regular recovery room today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs are thinking only of Elliott's recovery and are not  
worried about his return to the court, coach Gregg Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us gives a damn about basketball right now,'' Popovich  
said. ``If he never played another game, as long as he had his 
health and the rest of his life, that would be fine. We go forward 
as if he's not going to be playing for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott received the kidney from his 32-year-old brother, Noel.  
</P>
<P>
	Urologist Sammy Vick, who removed Noel's left kidney, said Noel  
might be able to go home in 3-5 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Noel matched five of the six antigen markers.  
</P>
<P>
	``It should be an extremely good transplant for Sean,'' Wright  
said. ``His brother is a better-than-average match. ... That bodes 
well, in particular, for the long-term results of the transplant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors left Elliott's two kidneys in place while inserting the  
donor organ on his right side, down in the pelvis area near the 
bladder, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most kidney transplant recipients don't require removal of the  
original organs unless there is a threat of some kind of infection, 
Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (new) kidney's functioning well,'' Wright said. ``Sean had  
no problems at all and Noel had no problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His own kidneys are still functional to some extent in that  
they are still producing some urine and water volume, but are not 
capable of carrying out the normal filtration functions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Elliot was in a regular recovery room and could be released  
from the hospital within the week. He should be able to live a 
normal life with the one kidney, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's agent, Armando Rios, said Elliott met with his brother  
and other members of his family Sunday night before the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a little fear in Sean with everything going on,''  
Rios said. ``The family is very, very close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by the hospital, Noel said: ``I am both  
honored and glad that I can be here for my brother in his time of 
need. ... My brother has always been there for me and I will always 
be here for him. The Lord is with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott needed a transplant because of a condition that slows  
the kidneys, preventing them from properly filtering waste from the 
blood. The cause of the disease -- focal segmental glomerular 
sclerosis -- is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott announced last month, a few weeks after the Spurs won  
the NBA championship, that he was in need of a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had kidney problems since June 1993, when he was  
diagnosed with a kidney infection while with the Detroit Pistons. A 
trade to the Houston Rockets in 1994 fell through because of a 
failed physical stemming from the kidney problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Had there not been a family match, Elliott would have been  
placed on a transplant waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 62,000 Americans are awaiting a heart, lung, liver,  
kidney or pancreas. Last year, 4,000 people died before they could 
get the organ they needed.

<HEADLINE> Deere Profits Fall 76 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Farm equipment maker Deere &AMP; Co. reported a  
76 percent drop in third-quarter earnings Tuesday as depressed 
commodity prices continued to hold down demand for tractors and 
combines. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended July 31, net income totaled $68.9  
million, or 29 cents a share, compared to $290.8 million, or $1.19 
a share, during the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings still exceeded Wall Street expectations of 25 cents  
a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell 18 percent during the period to $3.03 billion from  
$3.69 billion during the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Moline-based Deere reported that worldwide demand for  
agricultural equipment continued to decline because of depressed 
grain and oilseed prices. Adding to the decline in sales are 
drought conditions in parts of the United States and the uncertain 
prospects of additional government financial assistance to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Deere reports it expects retail demand for farm equipment will  
now decline by 30 percent to 35 percent in North America this year 
from last year's levels. The company had previously estimated that 
sales would decline by 18 percent to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result the company is cutting back production at its  
agricultural-equipment plants to reduce inventories. Deere also 
announced plans to initiate a voluntary early retirement program 
that it estimated will cost up to $80 million in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is estimating that North American retail demand for  
farm machinery next year will be 5 percent to 10 percent lower than 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Deere fell 25 cents to close at $43 on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

	Enormity of Turkey Quake Clear  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Terrified earthquake survivors sought  
the safety of open ground Tuesday as the enormity of Turkey's 
tragedy became clear: more than 2,000 people killed, 10,000 injured 
and thousands more missing after an overwhelming show of nature's 
power. Geophysicists at the U.S. National Earthquake Information 
Center described the quake as one of the most powerful recorded in 
the 20th century, nearly rivaling the 7.9-magnitude tremor than 
devastated San Francisco in 1906. As many as 10,000 people could 
still be trapped in rubble around the town of Golcuk, 80 miles 
southeast of Istanbul, according to the town's mayor, Ismail Baris.

	Feds Bust Drug Networks in 14 Cities  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents arrested scores of people and  
seized drugs and money in 14 cities today in an effort to break up 
what the FBI called one of the top 20 drug distribution networks in 
the country. The target of the multiagency Operation Southwest 
Express was the drug trafficking organization of Omar Rocha Soto, 
arrested with his wife, Adriana Espinoza, early Tuesday as they 
left their $649,000 home in a San Diego suburb. During the yearlong 
investigation, agents seized 4,158 pounds of marijuana, 2,727 
kilograms of cocaine and more than $1.15 million in cash. By late 
this afternoon, 77 arrests had been made, and more than 20 others 
were expected, the FBI said.

<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Bosnia's Muslim president on  
Tuesday branded as lies allegations by international officials that 
top Muslim, Croat and Serbian officials may have stolen more than 
$1 billion in public funds and international aid. The allegations, 
based on findings of the anti-fraud unit of the Office of the High 
Representative, appeared in The New York Times. A spokeswoman for 
the OHR, which oversees implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace 
agreement, said the report was largely correct.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iraq has extended the range of one of its best  
anti-aircraft missiles, but the retooled weapon poses no 
significant additional threat to U.S. and British pilots patrolling 
no-flight zones over Iraq, the Pentagon said today. Iraq has 
challenged the patrols since last December by attempting to shoot 
down the planes; today it fired anti-aircraft artillery and tracked 
U.S. planes with radars used by surface-to-air missiles, U.S. 
officials said. In response, U.S. planes bombed Iraqi missile 
sites. The official Iraqi News Agency in Baghdad quoted the 
military as saying eight people were killed in attacks in the 
northern zone and 11 were killed in the south.

<HEADLINE> Caregivers Prescribing More Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The number of drugs prescribed by nurse  
practitioners and physician assistants is rising dramatically, 
reflecting the increased legal authority granted these caregivers 
and their growing acceptance by doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurse practitioners wrote 15 million prescriptions in the United  
States last year, up 66 percent from 1997, according to a study by 
the consulting firm Scott-Levin. Physician assistants wrote 12 
million prescriptions, up 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While those numbers still represent a fraction of the 2.5  
billion prescriptions written annually, consumer and medical groups 
say the trend aids patient convenience and makes doctors offices 
more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``The increase in scripts reflects the increasing numbers of  
nurse practitioners and physician assistants working with 
doctors,'' said Dr. Thomas Reardon, president of the American 
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Physician assistants, who practice medicine under a doctor's  
supervision, can write prescriptions in 46 states, almost twice as 
many as a decade ago. States not granting them legal authority are 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurse practitioners -- registered nurses with advanced,  
specialized training -- have prescription drug ordering authority in 
all 50 states, although in four states, a nurse practitioner must 
have a doctor co-sign the prescription. Those four states are 
Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	While some doctors still argue these caregivers lack enough  
education to prescribe medicines, proponents of giving them this 
authority say it makes doctors available to work on more complex 
cases and saves patients time, too. 
</P>
<P>
	About 34,000 physician assistants and 60,000 nurse practitioners  
work in the United States. The two specialties began in the 1980s 
as a way to complement physicians and offer a less expensive 
alternative to help busy practices and hospital clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	As managed care has reduced doctor fees -- pushing them to see  
more patients to maintain their incomes -- doctors increasingly rely 
on nurse practitioners and physician assistants. At least one 
health maintenance organization, Oxford Health Plans, lets its New 
York City members choose a nurse practitioner as their primary 
caregiver. 
</P>
<P>
	All states require that doctors supervise physician assistants,  
and most nurse practitioners also do much of their work with 
doctors. Some states prohibit nurse practitioners and physician 
assistants from ordering highly addictive drugs or controlled 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Kohlhepp, a physician assistant at the occupational  
medicine clinic at the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven, Conn., 
and president of the American Academy of Physician Assistants, said 
having the ability to write prescriptions speeds the patient 
through the office. Though the physician he works with periodically 
reviews his drug orders, he said changes are almost never made. 
``We develop similar therapeutic styles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physicians used to look at prescribing drugs as the one thing  
that separates them from other people,'' he said. ``They initially 
thought they would be giving something up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as doctors become more comfortable with physician  
assistants, he said, they realize the assistants aid their practice 
by giving them more time to handle the difficult cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is positive for the patients,'' said Kohlhepp,  
``Prescribing drugs is part of practicing medicine.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Rise 0.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices edged up just 0.3 percent in  
July despite big increases for energy and airline fares. At the 
same time, construction of new homes staged a solid rebound and the 
nation's factories boosted production at the fastest pace this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	All three government reports, released Tuesday, provided fresh  
evidence that the U.S. economy continues to power ahead without 
triggering worrisome inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The mild 0.3 percent gain in the Labor Department's Consumer  
Price Index, the most closely watched barometer of inflation, came 
after two straight months of flat prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly good news for everybody, including  
consumers,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with WEFA Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists and investors still believe the Federal Reserve  
will raise interest rates when it meets next week to slow the 
economy and keep inflation at bay -- but only by a quarter of a 
point. However, the inflation report could forestall further rake 
hikes, some said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a modest hike is really in the cards,'' Shaber said.  
</P>
<P>
	Russell Sheldon, chief economist with MCM MoneyWatch, said a  
quarter-point interest rate increase ``is probably a done deal next 
week, but the CPI report could make it less likely that a series of 
increases after that one would follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some economists said a surge in new home construction in  
July and a strong 0.7 percent advance in output at the nation's 
factories, mines and utilities last month could raise concerns at 
the Fed that the economy is still growing too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line for the Fed is that home-building is still a  
bit too strong,'' said First Union economist Mark Vitner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said single-family homes and apartment  
construction rose a stronger-than-expected 5.7 percent last month 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.66 million units. In 
June, housing starts fell 5.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite rising mortgage rates, housing construction last month  
increased everywhere but the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than not buying, people are staying in the market but  
are shifting to adjustable rate mortgages'' that carry lower 
interest rates than a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, said David 
Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home 
Builders. The 30-year rate soared last week to 8.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed said July's increase in industrial output reflected  
increased demand for electricity during the heat wave. It was the 
biggest factory production gain since last October. 
</P>
<P>
	That advance pushed up the overall industrial operating rate to  
80.7 percent of capacity in July, still far below the level at 
which analysts begin to worry about production bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the inflation front, the 0.3 percent increase in consumer  
prices was the biggest gain since a 0.7 jump in April, which 
resulted from a 6.1 percent spike in gasoline and other energy 
prices. That April increase concerned the Fed, which nudged up 
interest rates June 30, the first hike in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	After falling in May and June, energy prices climbed by 2.1  
percent in July, accounting for almost half the overall increase in 
consumer prices. Gasoline prices, which had soared 15 percent in 
April, rose 4.3 percent last month and were up 30.2 percent so far 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Production cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  
Countries and a pickup in global demand reflecting economic 
recovery in many countries damaged by the Asian currency crisis 
helped account for the gain in gasoline and other energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline fares, which fell in May and June, rose 6.5 percent in  
July, the largest increase since October 1992. Some economists said 
rising energy costs and strong demand for airline seats during the 
summer helped account for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, consumer prices are rising at an annual rate  
of 2.4 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent increase for all of 
1998. This acceleration reflects the rebound in energy costs, which 
were rising at a rate of 12.4 percent in the first seven months of 
this year after dropping 8.8 percent for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices, meanwhile, rose just 0.2 percent in July, after no  
change in June. A 3 percent drop in fresh fruit prices helped 
offset a 2.5 percent increase in vegetable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, prices were up  
just 0.2 percent last month. So far this year, this core rate of 
inflation is rising just 1.7 percent, better than last year's 2.4 
percent rise.

<HEADLINE> FCC Reasserts Internet Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission,  
claiming authority to regulate providers of high-speed Internet 
access, is raising questions about how cable companies that offer 
such services should be classified. 
</P>
<P>
	In a long-awaited friend-of-the-court brief in AT&AMP;T's case  
against Portland, Ore., the FCC argued Monday that local officials 
could create ``regulatory disparity'' by exercising authority over 
cable companies offering Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland area cable officials required AT&AMP;T, which took over the  
nation's No. 2 cable TV company, Tele-Communications Inc. earlier 
this year, to open its lines to rival Internet competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge upheld the decision. The case is currently  
before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has repeatedly opposed local and municipal officials  
coming up with their own regulatory policy. In its brief, the 
commission justified this position by saying that it alone has 
authority over all providers of high-speed Internet service -- also 
known as broadband. Cable, phone, satellite and wireless companies 
are all racing to build these high-speed connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials do not have regulatory authority over service  
providers other than cable systems, the commission maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Local regulation of cable Internet services ``might pose a  
significant risk of regulatory disparity with respect to all other 
broadband service providers,'' the FCC lawyers wrote in their 
brief. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also left open the question of whether cable  
companies providing Internet service should be treated as cable 
providers or whether they are more properly classified as 
``telecommunications'' or ``information'' services. The FCC said 
both parties might have jumped the gun by presuming that cable 
companies offering Internet services fall under the category of 
cable providers and should therefore be regulated as such. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission has noted the existence of a serious dispute  
concerning the proper classification of cable modem service, 
although it has not yet resolved the issue,'' the FCC wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	So-called broadband access over cable lines provides connection  
speeds dozens of times faster than today's telephone modems. Some 
Internet providers and consumer groups fear that cable companies 
will develop a monopoly in delivering high-speed services, unless 
they are required to share their wires with competitors.

<HEADLINE> M's Rodriguez Has Suspension Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Frankie Rodriguez's seven-game suspension was  
upheld Tuesday by AL president Gene Budig, who cut Jay Buhner's 
suspension from four games to three. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez immediately began serving his penalty, which stemmed  
from an Aug. 6 brawl with the New York Yankees. Budig heard the 
appeals Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have thought my suspension would have been reduced by  
at least one day,'' said Rodriguez, who charged after and punched 
Yankees catcher Joe Girardi. ``How many times does a reliever get 
more than five games?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner, suspended for a fight with Los Angeles Dodgers on July  
11, will start his suspension after Rodriguez's is completed.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Group To Train Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) -- In the newsrooms of the Thomson newspaper  
group, a new type of reporter is hitting the beat. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been advertising in its own newspapers for local  
writers -- no experience preferred. The would-be reporters will 
instead get 12 weeks of training at a school created and run by 
Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hopes that by taking residents from the communities  
it covers and personally training them it can boost readership and 
create journalists dedicated to local news. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty such reporters started work at their hometown papers last  
week. And on Sunday, they will begin their training course. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are going to be taught to do things  
differently,'' said Jim Jennings, vice president and editorial 
director of Thomson Newspapers, based in Stamford, Conn. ``We are 
going to change the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The training program, based in Oshkosh, is modeled after  
England's Trinity Editorial Training Center, which Thomson has run 
for more than 20 years. But it is unique to U.S. journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	With labor markets tight and journalists' salaries notoriously  
low, several other media companies are also going outside normal 
channels to recruit employees, said Jim Gray, executive director of 
the Society of Professional Journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics said 12 weeks of training may not be enough to  
instill the ethics of the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they have thought through how long it can take for  
somebody to understand the culture of journalism, which has some 
very important and fundamental values about what constitutes 
news,'' said Terry Hynes, president of the Association of Schools 
of Journalism and Mass Communication. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson created the program to try to make the news in its 56  
daily newspapers in 13 states useful and relevant to readers at a 
time when many U.S. newspapers are struggling to keep their 
readership, Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want people committed to community journalism and really  
writing about their communities,'' said Lou Ziegler, who directs 
the training program, known as Reader inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company wants people with little or no journalism  
experience -- people like Army veteran Frank Scotello of Fond du 
Lac. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired lieutenant colonel has been a college English  
professor and a published poet but said he has always been drawn to 
journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in the fifth grade, I started a school newspaper. I  
guess it is a long, unfulfilled romantic notion of being in the 
press,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotello, now an employee of The Reporter in Fond du Lac, is in  
Thomson's first class of recruits. All but two have college 
degrees, and nine have graduate degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson's minimum requirement was a high school education and  
passage of a test on current events, culture, history, people and 
writing skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20 will get their 12 weeks of training at the Oshkosh  
Northwestern, a Thomson newspaper, where they will get a 
combination of classroom instruction and hands-on writing 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Each student earns $5.35 an hour and makes a commitment to work  
at their hometown newspaper for at least 21 months. Then they get a 
$2,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	What the school teaches about community journalism and marketing  
may be the key to whether it can produce journalists who fulfill 
their traditional role as watchdogs of the community, said James 
Naughton, president of Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla., 
which has programs for professional journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it means these are bright, creative and enterprising people  
willing to challenge authority on behalf of citizens, no harm done. 
If it means they are going to be compliant, easy to manage, 
unresistant, low paid, then that is a problem,'' Naughton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson is investing $3.3 million in training programs, both for  
the new recruits and its own experienced reporters, Jennings said. 
He said critics are wrong to infer Thomson is trying to get 
reporters ``on the cheap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trevis Mayfield, editor of the Thomson-owned Tribune Star in  
Terre Haute, Ind., said he looked to the new recruiting program as 
a way to staff his newspaper with people who know the town's 
culture and people. 
</P>
<P>
	His newest hire, Peter Ciancone, is a 43-year-old college  
history professor from Terre Haute. A reporter's job paying about 
$26,000 a year is waiting for him once he completes the training 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an opportunity to do something that is intellectual,  
challenging, around people and gives me a chance to write, which I 
do anyway,'' Ciancone said. ``Now they are going to pay me for 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Hedges on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Republican Rudolph Giuliani, weighing a bid  
for the U.S. Senate and perhaps courting support from New York's 
Conservative Party, appears to be hedging on past strong support 
for abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I think that I'll address myself to if and  
when I announce and I get a chance to think out all of those 
positions,'' the New York City mayor said when asked about his past 
opposition to a ban on what critics call partial-birth abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's opposition to such a ban has put him at odds with  
Gov. George Pataki and other top New York Republicans and with the 
state's small but politically influential Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
	No Republican has won statewide office in New York without  
Conservative support since the third party was founded more than 25 
years ago. The party's vote gave Pataki the governorship in 1994 
over Democratic incumbent Mario Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate race in New York, for the seat being vacated next  
year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, could pit Giuliani 
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, an abortion rights supporter who 
opposes any ban on the late-term abortion procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Told Tuesday about Giuliani's noncommittal comment, abortion  
rights activist Kelli Conlin expressed surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been so strong on this issue, ... it would just be very  
shocking to me if this was something he switched on,'' said Conlin, 
of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, who 
served on Giuliani's mayoral transition committee in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, as he ran for a second term, Giuliani told the league  
he would ``oppose legislation that would make criminals of doctors 
who perform intact D&AMP;X abortions.'' Intact dilation and extraction 
abortion is the technical term for what abortion opponents call 
partial-birth abortions.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Memos Said To Prove Guilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- Internal State Farm memos prove the company  
promoted the use of inferior replacement parts on policyholders' 
cars despite reservations about their quality, an insurance 
consultant testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``State Farm has for several years knowingly used ... parts that  
it knows are inferior,'' said Tim Ryles, a former Georgia insurance 
commissioner hired by plaintiffs to study State Farm documents in a 
$2 billion class-action lawsuit against the insurance giant. The 
trial began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses Bloomington-based State Farm of breach of  
contract, claiming its use of aftermarket parts fails to restore 
cars to their pre-loss condition as promised in the company's 
insurance policies. Such parts are modeled on factory parts, but 
are made without the benefit of factory specifications and often 
fail to provide the same level of performance as the originals, the 
plaintiffs claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which covers the potential claims of 5.5 million  
current and former State Farm policyholders, also accuses State 
Farm of consumer fraud for failing to disclose problems with the 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryles testified Tuesday that State Farm was sending customers  
brochures touting the performance and cost savings of ``Quality 
Replacement Parts'' even as high-level executives were circulating 
memos suggesting that those same parts were inferior when compared 
to original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quality and fit of non-OEM ... parts continue to present  
problems,'' said an Oct. 15, 1993, internal memo presented as 
evidence Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo cites poorly fitting bumper covers, plastic parts that  
``do not mirror OEM quality for chroming and fit'' and a model of 
an imitation truck hood equipped with safety latches that will not 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``This presents an obvious safety problem,'' the memo said of  
the hoods. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements Monday, State Farm attorneys said there is  
no evidence that aftermarket parts pose any safety threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a 1993 memo from the Certified Automotive Parts  
Association -- a group formed by insurers to set standards for 
aftermarket parts -- shows that the group felt its initial standards 
were ``only slightly above the 'lowest common denominator' 
approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryles said the documents show a pattern in which State Farm  
officials chose the lowest-priced part for their customers' cars 
without regard for quality. 
</P>
<P>
	But State Farm spokesman Bill Sirola said outside the courtroom  
that the documents reflect the company's leading-edge efforts to 
bring aftermarket parts up to the level of factory parts, not an 
effort to conceal their flaws. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm is the nation's largest auto insurer, covering one of  
every five autos on the road.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Send Jiminez to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Rookie Jose Jiminez, whose no-hitter against  
the Arizona Diamondbacks was a bright spot in an otherwise 
inconsistent season, was optioned to Triple-A Memphis Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals recalled Rick Heiserman, 26, a right-hander who  
was the closer at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiminez, a right-hander, beat Randy Johnson and the Diamondbacks  
1-0 with his no-hitter on June 25 at Phoenix. A little over a week 
later, Jiminez and the Cardinals again shut out Johnson and the 
Diamondbacks at home. 
</P>
<P>
	But otherwise, Jiminez has struggled. After going 3-0 in a  
September callup last season, Jiminez is 5-12 with a 5.81 ERA in 
1999. In his last start Sunday, Jiminez lasted just two innings 
against the Chicago Cubs, giving up five earned runs and five hits 
-- including two Sammy Sosa homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiminez said he has some mechanical flaws to work out.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised, but I'll find my way back,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa said Jiminez likely will be recalled Sept.  
1, when active rosters expand from 25 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
	``His results have been mixed,'' La Russa said. ``I think he's  
learning from his ups and downs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa wasn't sure who would replace Jiminez in the rotation,  
but said he was leaning toward Juan Acevedo, 4-4, with a 6.05 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Rising Golf Star May Never Turn Pro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Matt Kuchar has played in the  
Masters and was on the leaderboard midway through last year's U.S. 
Open. Yet he was as nervous as ever when he teed off in the U.S. 
Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar, the 1997 amateur champion, shot a 1-over-par 73 Monday  
while playing with a lighting salesman from New York and a recent 
graduate from the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar, a Georgia Tech student, was among the leaders after the  
first round. After another round today of stroke play on the Pebble 
Beach and Spyglass Hill courses, the top 64 players advance to six 
rounds of match play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really nervous out there today, as nervous as I've been  
in a while,'' Kuchar said. ``Knowing it's the national championship 
and trying to relive what I did in '97. Making the top 64 is tough, 
and you think about match play and how tough that is. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get that nervousness, it's just a strange feeling,  
your stomach is churning. When you get that feeling you wonder, 
`Why do I play golf? I can't eat, I can't sleep.' But to have that 
feeling is exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Bolli, a recent graduate of the University of Georgia,  
had Monday's low round among the 312 amateurs with a 2-under 70 on 
Spyglass on a cool, calm day along the Pacific Ocean. He had six 
birdies in his round. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Salinetti of Lee, Mass.; Ben Curtis of Kent, Ohio; and Gene  
Elliott of West Des Moines, Iowa, were at 71, while five players 
had rounds of 72. Kuchar was among 19 players at 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Stevens of Fort Worth, Texas, had the shot of the day  
with a hole-in-one on the 186-yard fifth hole at Spyglass. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar was in his favorite element Monday, playing with guys who  
love the game and do it for fun. His playing partners were Al 
Falussy Jr., 34, of Dix Hills, N.Y., and Adam Dooley, 23, a scuba 
diving enthusiast from Albany, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Falussy shot a 90 and Dooley had an 81. And Kuchar had to  
overcome a triple-bogey on the 15th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar said he is excited to be playing again in the U.S.  
Amateur, even while peers such as Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia 
battle for riches on the pro circuit. In fact, Kuchar is enjoying 
his amateur status so much he might never turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something special about amateur golf, these  
tournaments, the friendships you make,'' Kuchar said. ``When you 
tee it up in the Open or the Masters as an amateur, there's a 
special feeling about it. There's a sense that this guy loves the 
game and he's not just another one of those money-hungry kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar said last year it was only a matter of time before he  
turned pro, but now he's not so sure. In fact, he drops the name of 
Bobby Jones while talking about the possibility of remaining an 
amateur for a couple more years -- or perhaps for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I thought would be special, pretty neat. I was  
thinking about how I could still play as much golf as possible and 
do business and take care of things financially,'' said Kuchar, who 
will be on the U.S. team for the amateur Walker Cup in Scotland 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the future, turning pro is the most likely thing. But  
staying amateur is still possible. If I turn pro and wish I'd 
stayed amateur, I can't go back.''

<HEADLINE> Woman on Trial in Daughter's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- An elderly woman on trial for shooting and  
paralyzing her daughter -- who eventually died after winning the 
right to be taken off life support -- was briefly removed from the 
courtroom today after shouting at the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The outburst from 68-year-old Shirley Egan came with jurors out  
of the courtroom during a hearing on whether to allow a detective 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry. I'm so confused,'' Ms. Egan shouted. ``I've had  
memory loss since I was a child. This isn't fair. I didn't do it. I 
loved my daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Thomas Mihok ordered Ms. Egan out of the courtroom  
and warned her that she would be removed permanently if she had 
another outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan was wheeled back in about five minutes later and  
apologized to the judge. Mihok ruled that Orange County Sheriff's 
Office Detective Riggs Gay could testify. 
</P>
<P>
	The outburst from Ms. Egan on the second day of her trial was a  
sharp departure from her demeanor the previous day. The feeble 
woman, who is blind in one eye, sat slumped in her wheelchair and 
spent most of the day with her face buried in a sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Egan opened fire March 8 after overhearing her  
42-year-old daughter, Georgette Smith, and Ms. Smith's boyfriend 
talking about putting her in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith was shot in the neck and paralyzed from the neck down,  
barely able to speak and incapable of swallowing or controlling her 
bladder. Saying she couldn't bear to live in that condition, Ms. 
Smith won the right in May to be taken off life support, and died. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements Monday, defense attorney Bob Wesley told  
the jury that his client was on medication that altered her 
sensibilities at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shirley Egan was not responsible for her actions,'' Wesley  
said, calling her ``angry, crazy and irrational'' from taking 
Prozac and medication to relieve pain from a 1997 accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Wesley and prosecutor Pam Smith told jurors they would see  
a videotaped deposition taken a day before Ms. Smith died in which 
Ms. Smith said she thought the shooting was accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	``She does not want to believe that her mother shot her,'' the  
prosecutor said. ``She wants to believe it was an accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony Monday, paramedic Tiffany Rinehart, who treated Ms.  
Egan after the shooting, said that the elderly woman said she had 
retrieved her gun to scare Ms. Smith and the boyfriend, Larry 
Videlock. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said she was tired of them harassing her and telling her  
they were going to put her in a nursing home,'' Rinehart said. 
``She said she meant to shoot it over her head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The paramedic also testified Ms. Egan said she had $7,300 in the  
apartment that she intended to give to a charity but Ms. Smith and 
Videlock wanted the money for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan was charged with two counts of attempted murder, for  
wounding her daughter and shooting at Videlock, who was not hurt. 
After her daughter died, prosecutors considered bringing murder 
charges, but decided against it, citing Ms. Egan's failing health 
and her relationship to the victim. Wesley said Ms. Smith did not 
want her mother charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was broadcast live over the Internet by the Florida  
Circuit Court. It was believed to be the first criminal trial in 
the nation to be broadcast online by a court, said Valerie Taylor, 
a spokeswoman for the Virginia-based National Center for State 
Courts.

<HEADLINE> Military Depots Live On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMBERSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Tom Cohenour maneuvered his golf cart  
through a cavernous maintenance building at the Letterkenny Army 
Depot, past the hulking ghosts of busier days. 
</P>
<P>
	He glided past the huge structures where the Army's tanks were  
X-rayed and the turntables where specialists repaired equipment. He 
passed the machine shop that once manufactured any tank part that 
couldn't be bought. It now mostly sits idle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were three shifts here. It's sad, really sad,'' said  
Cohenour, who earns $44,000 a year supervising mechanics. With the 
tank jobs gone, only one-fifth of the depot's past work force 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	If he worked for a private company that lost a major contract,  
Cohenour might be out of work, too, and the facility closed. But 
Letterkenny -- and other depots like it from Virginia to Hawaii -- 
stay open because members of Congress have the political muscle to 
protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials are eager to save money by consolidating the  
repair, storage and maintenance facilities known as depots and 
shipyards, which were built to serve a larger military during World 
War II and the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could take that money for weapons modernization and quality  
of life issues like family housing,'' said Randall Yim, the 
Pentagon's deputy undersecretary for installations. ``We don't need 
massive warehouses any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a classic case of protect-your-district politics, the  
bipartisan group of 77 House members -- they call themselves the 
Depot Caucus -- have blocked the congressional action necessary to 
close a depot. The caucus includes members of defense and 
appropriations committees that control spending and military 
policy, and they can exercise enormous influence over their 
colleagues on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department spends about $13 billion a year to store,  
repair and modernize its equipment. Most of that work was done at 
the depots in years past; now $6 billion of that money goes to 
private industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure would be higher, but the lawmakers of the Depot  
Caucus pushed through legislation that requires the Defense 
Department to keep at least 50 percent of maintenance work within 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18 large depots and several smaller facilities still perform  
valuable functions, and some have proven they can do work cheaper 
than private industry. Letterkenny boasts state-of-the-art 
equipment to repair missiles, for example. But its workforce, 
almost entirely civilian, has dropped to 1,320 from 6,200 at its 
peak in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterkenny and the Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, Texas,  
have suffered some of the largest losses since the last base 
closings in 1995. Defense Department figures show Letterkenny is 
operating at 73 percent of its capacity; Red River is at only 37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army depot in Anniston, Ala., is now operating at 68 percent  
of capacity. The Air Force logistics center in Ogden, Utah, is at 
53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Caucus members protecting the depots argue that it is unwise to  
shut facilities that are essential in war time. A private business 
can be hit with a strike or have financial problems that could harm 
the nation in time of crisis, these lawmakers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The caucus boasts several influential members, including Rep.  
Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee, who holds sway over road and 
transportation projects in every member's district, and Rep. Tillie 
Fowler, R-Fla., a member of the House Republican leadership and the 
Armed Services committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Few want to tangle with them. Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., said  
he was threatened with losing a place on a key House-Senate 
conference committee when he tried to oppose the group in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say they use no-holds-barred tactics verging on being  
ruthless,'' Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Fowler said the caucus doesn't bully opponents, and is  
simply trying to educate colleagues on the importance of the 
depots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry that in five years, 10 years they'll get rid of the  
depots. We learned that in these battles, we better be prepared,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also are prominent in the depot-saving effort. Rep.  
Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who serves on the Appropriations defense and 
military construction subcommittees, is a caucus member. And Rep. 
Solomon Ortiz of Texas, ranking Democrat on the Armed Services 
readiness subcommittee, is co-chairman of the caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz said the group has contacts throughout depots so it can be  
alerted to any efforts to cut work. ``We are like the CIA,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials say they're not trying to starve the depots  
by sending more work to the private sector, but rather are trying 
to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall policy is to outsource to the extent allowed by  
law, where it could make sense,'' said Robert Mason, the Pentagon's 
assistant deputy secretary who specializes in depot issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterkenny, a 57-year-old installation in south central  
Pennsylvania, was built to service a much larger military. Until 
recently, a huge chunk of its business, in partnership with a 
private contractor, was converting old tanks into modern, 
self-propelled howitzers called the Paladin. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Henry W. Suchting III, the depot's commander, isn't willing  
to stand by and watch his facility crumble. He pursues work -- even 
from nonmilitary sources -- in a manner that would have been 
unthinkable for an Army officer years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He researches whether private companies would pay to use his  
facility's huge tank painting sheds, chrome-plating equipment, or 
his air conditioning repairmen. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Letterkenny didn't get missile work that depot  
officials anticipated, Suchting asked Army supervisors to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranae Coheley, 46, a program analyst at the Anniston depot, said  
the Depot Caucus is fighting for the system that ``supported me my 
entire lifetime.'' Her father worked there for nearly 40 years, her 
crane-operator husband has been there for 27 and she has put in 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just hope the depot will stay open until we have enough  
years to retire,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the caucus has a say, it might.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's life or death as they see it,'' said former Rep. Vic  
Fazio, D-Calif., who went against the caucus in 1997 to save jobs 
in his Sacramento district. ``Their dedication probably increases 
as they get closer and closer to the grim reaper.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Send Jimenez to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Rookie Jose Jimenez, whose no-hitter against  
the Arizona Diamondbacks was a bright spot in an otherwise 
inconsistent season, was optioned to Triple-A Memphis Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals recalled Rick Heiserman, 26, a right-hander who  
was the closer at Memphis. Heiserman pitched 1 2-3 scoreless 
innings in Tuesday's 6-5 win over the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez, a right-hander, beat Randy Johnson and the Diamondbacks  
1-0 with his no-hitter on June 25 at Phoenix. A little over a week 
later, Jimenez and the Cardinals again shut out Johnson and the 
Diamondbacks at home. 
</P>
<P>
	But otherwise, Jimenez has struggled. After going 3-0 in a  
September callup last season, Jimenez is 5-12 with a 5.81 ERA in 
1999. In his last start Sunday, Jimenez lasted just two innings 
against the Chicago Cubs, giving up five earned runs and five hits 
-- including two Sammy Sosa homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez said he has some mechanical flaws to work out.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised, but I'll find my way back,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa said Jimenez likely will be recalled Sept.  
1, when active rosters expand from 25 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
	``His results have been mixed,'' La Russa said. ``I think he's  
learning from his ups and downs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa wasn't sure who would replace Jimenez in the rotation,  
but said he was leaning toward Juan Acevedo, 5-4 with a 6.05 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday  
as many investors took profits ahead of the release later in the 
day of the U.S. consumer price index, a widely watched gauge of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the key  
index rose for the seventh straight session as investors bought 
select international blue chip shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 34.06 points,  
or 0.19 percent, to close at 17,860.09. On Monday, the average 
finished up 390.86 points, or 2.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blue-chip stocks continue to lead the market, and we may see  
further polarization of stronger and weaker shares,'' said Ken 
Yamano, general manager of the equities section at Taiheiyo 
Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was subdued as market players waited for the price data  
for clues on the direction of U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 114.60 yen in  
late-afternoon trading, down 0.24 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and 
below its level late Monday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manila, heavy selling of Philippine Long Distance Telephone  
Co., a weaker peso and rising domestic interest rates sent share 
prices plunging to their lowest level in four months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected companies  
fell 88.17 points, or 4.1 percent, to 2,087.13 after rising 4.31 
points Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the decliners was PLDT, which reported a 64 percent drop  
in its first half net profits to 1.61 billion pesos ($41 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 39.620 pesos, up from 39.425  
pesos on Monday. It averaged 39.589 pesos, up from Monday's 39.315 
pesos. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares also closed sharply lower, pushed down by  
doubts over whether the financially troubled Daewoo Group will be 
able to carry out its restructuring plans agreed upon with creditor 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 33.58 points, or 3.7  
percent, to 873.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit-taking pushed prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange  
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 111.62 points, or 0.9  
percent, to close at 12,783.16. On Monday, the index had surged 
286.60 points, or 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading remained thin as many investors stayed on the sidelines  
ahead of the release later Tuesday in the United States of the July 
consumer price index, which could determine the direction of U.S. 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was closed in Indonesia for national day  
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher as Morgan Stanley Capital  
International's decision to double the weighting of Taiwan stocks 
in its global indexes continued to spur buying. The market key's 
Weighted Stock Price Index rose 64.96 points, or 0.8 percent, to 
8,083.43. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed mixed. The benchmark  
NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 1.84 points, or 0.08 percent, to 
2,188.39. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed broadly lower. The  
benchmark All Ordinaries Index fell 29.9 points, or 0.9 percent, to 
2,988.0. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower as investors  
continued to sell stocks ahead of September 1, when foreign 
investors will be able to repatriate their funds from the country 
without paying tax. The Composite Index fell 14.94 points, or 1.9 
percent, to 751.47. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower as investors stayed on the  
sidelines ahead of U.S. economic data. The Straits Times Index fell 
15.07 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,983.52. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Help to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As U.S. search and rescue teams headed to  
Turkey, President Clinton today offered his thoughts and prayers to 
survivors of that nation's deadly earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must stand with them and do whatever we can to help them to  
get through this terrible crisis,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president noted that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  
Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, was in Ankara for military meetings, and 
has offered military support for recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to determine what further help is needed,''  
he said. ``You can only imagine how difficult this is for them and 
we will do what we can to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson also was in Turkey, and was  
asleep in an Istanbul hotel room when the quake hit at about 3 a.m. 
local time. 
</P>
<P>
	Both U.S. officials were unhurt and there were no reports of  
Americans hurt or of damage to U.S. buildings, said White House 
spokesman David Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Turkish prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, previously scheduled  
a meeting with Clinton at the White House for Sept. 28. The two 
leaders plan to discuss security in the region, and the tussle 
between Turkey and Greece over control of the island of Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
	Search and rescue teams from Miami and Fairfax, Va., are headed  
to Turkey as part of an Agency for International Development 
delegation, the White House said. The U.S searchers will advise and 
help train local and European teams, Leavy said.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Prices Advances / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were higher in  
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices received a big boost from another decline in the  
U.S. Agriculture Department's weekly crop rating. The corn crop is 
in particularly bad condition in Ohio, where 27 percent of the crop 
is considered in poor or very poor condition. At this point in the 
season, experts say they do not expect to see much improvement in 
the condition of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices received a boost on the export front.  
Egypt, Algeria and Taiwan have entered the market for U.S. wheat. 
The USDA also has announced the sale of 140,000 metric tons of 
wheat to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	A 4 percent decline in the wheat crop rating also is giving a  
lift to prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices were higher on National Weather Service forecasts  
of limited rainfall in the Midwest and Great Plains over the next 
10 days. The USDA also lowered the rating of the soybean crop, 
saying on 51 percent of the crop was in good-to-excellent 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, wheat for September delivery was 3 1/2 cents  
higher at $2.72 1/4 a bushel; September corn was 4 1/2 cents higher at 
$2.18 1/2 a bushel; September oats were 1 1/2 cents higher at $1.10 1/2 a 
bushel; August soybeans were 15 cents higher at $4.71 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and hog futures prices were mixed in early trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle were .10 cent higher at 66.45 cents a pound.  
August feeder cattle were .03 cent lower at 77.17 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs were .43 cent higher at 45.85 cents a pound; 
August frozen pork bellies were 1.40 cents lower at 51.90 cents a 
pound.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Gain / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were higher in  
trading Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as the market reacted 
to the government's latest crop condition reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices surged at the start of trading in response  
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's rating of the crop as 58 
percent good to excellent, a decline from the previous week. There 
also was concern that below normal precipitation in coming days 
could further hurt the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices surged early in the day in reaction to  
weather forecasts and the USDA's weekly soybean update, which 
indicates the poor condition of some of the corn could mean a drop 
in the 2.87 billion bushels forecast Aug. 12. But the early gains 
were trimmed by profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were higher as the market reacted to news Algeria,  
Egypt and Tunisia are in the market for U.S. wheat. The USDA also 
announced the sale of 140,000 metric tons of wheat to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices also got a boost from an unexpected decline in the  
condition of the wheat crop. The USDA estimates 58 percent of the 
crop is in good to excellent condition. Ideas the dry weather will 
help with the harvest trimmed the early gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery was a 1/4 cent higher at $2.69 a  
bushel; September corn was 2 1/2 cents higher at $2.16 1/2 a bushel; 
September oats were 1 3/4 cents lower at 1.07 1/4 a bushel; August 
soybeans were 8 1/2 cents higher at $4.64 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and hog futures prices were mixed in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog futures prices were lower as supplies remain strong as  
consumer demand wanes. Pork belly futures prices were lower on the 
expectation the USDA's monthly cold storage report, out Friday, 
will show more pork bellies in storage than had been anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle were unchanged at 66.35 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle were .17 cent higher at 77.37 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs were 1.57 cents lower at 43.85 cents a pound; August pork 
bellies were 1.90 cents lower at 51.40 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Son of Sam Killer in CNN Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Son of Sam killer David Berkowitz never meant to  
threaten Spike Lee's family and has only good wishes for the maker 
of a film that reminded the public of his infamous crimes, 
Berkowitz said in an interview broadcast Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	When Berkowitz mentioned Lee's wife and family by name in a  
recent New York Times article, Lee said he read the comments as a 
veiled threat against his wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Concerning Mr. Lee's family, I was misquoted totally,''  
Berkowitz said in an hourlong prison interview on ``Larry King 
Live'' on CNN. ``I don't monitor anything about his family, I pray 
for them, I have absolutely nothing against Mr. Lee, and I never 
said anything bad about him. I pray that God blesses him in every 
area of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to a spokeswoman for The New York Times Monday night was  
not immediately returned. A call to the office of Lee's film 
company also was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's movie ``Summer of Sam'' recreated the steamy, turbulent  
summer of 1977, when New Yorkers sweated through a record-setting 
heat wave, endured a citywide blackout and read tabloid stories 
about a serial killer who sent taunting notes signed ``Son of 
Sam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berkowitz killed six people and wounded seven in his yearlong  
crime spree, which ended that July. He confessed after his arrest 
and claimed he'd been ordered to kill by the dog of a neighbor 
named Sam. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had not seen Lee's movie and was pleased that the  
flurry of media attention it brought him had subsided. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that's out of my life, at least for a while,'' he  
said. ``I'm not living in the past anymore.'' The interview was 
taped last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Now serving his life sentence at the Sullivan Correctional  
Facility in the Catskill Mountains, Berkowitz, 46, helps counsel 
other inmates and tries to teach them religion.

<HEADLINE> Tagliabue Monitoring Jets Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, visiting  
the New York Jets' training camp Tuesday, said he is keeping close 
tabs on the pending sale of the team but isn't sure how long it 
will take for a deal to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to get an update this week when I meet with  
John Hess and get a status report of where they are,'' Tagliabue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, the son of the club's late owner, Leon Hess, is helping  
supervise the sale. Leon Hess died in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which is handling the screening of  
prospective buyers, has been working to finalize a prospectus for 
interested investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets are expected to be sold for more than $500 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``With this team, and with other teams, you're looking for  
someone with a vision of the future who is looking for the 
long-term,'' Tagliabue said. ``You need someone coming in for the 
long-term with a vision for what the Jets could be in New York, and 
for New York sports fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the peripheral issues surrounding the sale is where the  
Jets will play once the club's lease with Giants Stadium in East 
Rutherford, N.J., expires in 2007. Several groups have appealed to 
potential owners to return the franchise to New York, specifically 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leon Hess talked to me about that early this spring,''  
Tagliabue said. ``Obviously, anytime you can get a new stadium and 
one that would be really convenient to Jets' fans and a facility 
for the Jets, it would be attractive. But you also have to be 
realistic and know how it's going to be. In all likelihood, it 
would be a part of something bigger like a convention complex or 
some other multipurpose complex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jets president Steve Gutman is representing the Hess family in  
dealing with Goldman Sachs on the ballclub's sale. Gutman declined 
to comment Monday on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Jets have been, as you would expect, very cooperative and  
we've had a good working relationship with Steve Gutman,'' 
Tagliabue said. ``We've also had a number of good discussions with 
John Hess. Everyone understands that if this process goes smoothly, 
it will be important to the league and important for the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say that with an executive like John Hess in the mix,  
representing the family in effect, and Steve Gutman representing 
the team, we think that this will work very smoothly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue also addressed the pending legal action against  
veteran Jets offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott, who faces criminal 
charges stemming from a brawl at a Long Beach, N.Y., bar in July. 
Elliott, arrested for disorderly conduct, public lewdness, 
second-degree harassment and third-degree assault, is scheduled to 
be in court at Long Beach on Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime a player like Jumbo Elliott and other players get  
involved in these types of allegations, you are disappointed 
because you don't want that type of allegation made about a 
player,'' said Tagliabue, who may discipline Elliott under the 
league's new violent crime policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it, at this stage, seems to depend on how the civil  
authorities will deal with it, and then our timetable (for 
disciplinary action) would have to kick in after that.''

<HEADLINE> Japan To Study Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese researchers hope gigantic, solar-powered,  
cigar-shaped airships will be the latest tools in the fight against 
global warming. It just needs to figure out how to launch them. 
</P>
<P>
	The helium-filled craft would analyze the atmosphere for such  
industrial byproducts as carbon dioxide and methane and transmit 
the data electronically to researchers below. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about something the size of a battleship,''  
Yasukazu Tamura, a deputy director at Japan's Science and 
Technology Agency, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists hope it will help them measure progress achieved  
since leaders from 38 nations promised in 1997 to cut greenhouse 
gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is expected to cost $95.7 million. Researchers hope  
to send the approximately 330-foot behemoth as high as 12 miles in 
the sky by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	But setting aloft anything that size is no easy task.  
</P>
<P>
	The ship needs to be big to withstand the strong wind and low  
air pressure at high altitudes, Tamura said. 
</P>
<P>
	And another thing -- researchers still have yet to learn how to  
land the airship.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs School Commandments Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A state appeals court on Tuesday upheld a  
school district's refusal to display the Ten Commandments on a 
ballfield fence. 
</P>
<P>
	The case started in 1995, when Downey High School sought ads to  
pay for new uniforms. Edward DiLoreto, chief executive of a local 
engineering firm, paid $400 and had a sign made up with the Ten 
Commandments under a caption inviting readers to ``meditate on 
these principles to live by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school refused to display the sign. After obtaining an  
opinion from then-Attorney General Dan Lungren that the posting 
would be legal, the Downey Unified School District instead removed 
all ads from the fence in 1996 and ended the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	DiLoreto, represented by the conservative Individual Rights  
Foundation, sued the district, claiming violation of free speech 
and freedom of religion. Superior Court Judge Thomas McKnew ruled 
against him and was upheld by the 2nd District Court of Appeal.

to the NBA after kidney transplant surgery is in the realm of 
possibility after a successful operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 31-year-old Elliott will be on medication the rest  
of his life, his doctors said he should be able to return to a 
normal life, maybe even basketball. The NBA season starts in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly unprecedented, but he's a very motivated  
individual,'' said Dr. Francis Wright, the surgeon who performed 
the transplant surgery Monday at Methodist Specialty and Transplant 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not going to be the one who tells him he can't  
play basketball again,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a 10-year NBA veteran and starting forward on the San  
Antonio Spurs championship team, could leave the hospital within a 
week and start his workout regimen within the next two months if 
he's up to it, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said it will take 2-3 months before they'll know if  
he can play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recommend some limitation on activity for six to eight  
weeks to allow the incision to heal properly,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott was in stable condition after Monday's surgery and was  
expected to be moved out of intensive care into a regular recovery 
room by today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs are thinking only of Elliott's recovery and are not  
worried about his return to the court, coach Gregg Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us gives a damn about basketball right now,'' Popovich  
said. ``If he never played another game, as long as he had his 
health and the rest of his life, that would be fine. We go forward 
as if he's not going to be playing for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott received the kidney from his 32-year-old brother, Noel.  
</P>
<P>
	Urologist Sammy Vick, who removed Noel's left kidney, said Noel  
might be able to go home in 3-5 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Noel matched five of the six antigen markers.  
</P>
<P>
	``It should be an extremely good transplant for Sean,'' Wright  
said. ``His brother is a better-than-average match. ... That bodes 
well, in particular, for the long-term results of the transplant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors left Elliott's two kidneys in place while inserting the  
donor organ on his right side, down in the pelvis area near the 
bladder, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most kidney transplant recipients don't require removal of the  
original organs unless there is a threat of some kind of infection, 
Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (new) kidney's functioning well,'' Wright said. ``Sean had  
no problems at all and Noel had no problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His own kidneys are still functional to some extent in that  
they are still producing some urine and water volume, but are not 
capable of carrying out the normal filtration functions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Elliot was in a regular recovery room and could be released  
from the hospital within the week. He should be able to live a 
normal life with the one kidney, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's agent, Armando Rios, said Elliott met with his brother  
and other members of his family Sunday night before the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a little fear in Sean with everything going on,''  
Rios said. ``The family is very, very close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by the hospital, Noel said: ``I am both  
honored and glad that can be here for my brother in his time of 
need. ... My brother has always been there for me and I will always 
be here for him. The Lord is with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott needed a transplant because of a condition that slows  
the kidneys, preventing them from properly filtering waste from the 
blood. The cause of the disease -- focal segmental glomerular 
sclerosis -- is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott announced last month, a few weeks after the Spurs won  
the NBA championship, that he was in need of a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had kidney problems since June 1993, when he was  
diagnosed with a kidney infection while with the Detroit Pistons. A 
trade to the Houston Rockets in 1994 fell through because of a 
failed physical stemming from the kidney problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Had there not been a family match, Elliott would have been  
placed on a transplant waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 62,000 Americans are awaiting a heart, lung, liver,  
kidney or pancreas. Last year, 4,000 people died before they could 
get the organ they needed.

<HEADLINE> Students Return With Caution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The doors opened, the hallways filled, the  
cliques reunited, the classes began. So it goes each year, when 
students across the country head back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	But is it just like any other year?  
</P>
<P>
	A few months after the Colorado and Georgia school shootings --  
and within weeks of summer shooting incidents seemingly spurred by 
racial or ethnic hatred -- schools nationwide are opening their 
doors warily. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mixed mood,'' said Bruce Hunter of the American  
Association of School Administrators. ``There's a real current of 
optimism running smack into just a dread of potential violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials -- recovering from last spring's shootings in  
Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, Ga., and the prank threats that 
followed -- spent a busy summer installing metal detectors, 
practicing emergency drills, adding security cameras and two-way 
radios, crafting dress codes and bookbag bans and trying to hire 
counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	Students vowed to break the conspiracy of silence about  
dangerous classmates; parents promised to parent; lawmakers 
promised to get tough -- no matter where they stood on gun control. 
On Tuesday, the White House launched a series of television and 
radio public service messages featuring students talking about 
their fears and President Clinton urging parents to talk to young 
children about safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as classes resume across the U.S. this month and next, and  
almost every family faces the issue in school newsletters, 
classroom discussions, assemblies and practice drills, many agree 
fear might just be the biggest threat. 

</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have more metal detectors and preventing  
bookbags,'' said Maya Hughley, 17, who starts her senior year at 
Jesup Scott High School in Toledo, Ohio, next week. ``Columbine had 
a major impact on schools, but you can't make too big a deal of 
everything. You just have to mentally be prepared.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Along with increased security, many recent school openings  
included rallies and assemblies to ease community fears. Before 
classes began at Columbine High on Monday, students, teachers and 
staff held a ``Take Back the School'' rally. A U.S. flag that had 
been at half-staff since the April 20 shootings was finally raised. 
</P>
<P>
	In Charlotte, N.C., where schools also opened Monday, parent  
Blanche Penn was reassured of her two children's safety at an 
earlier open house by the district. That, she said, gave her hope 
for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you know how the news media can get everybody hyped  
up,'' she said. ``It's good to know schools are taking every 
precaution that they can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Penn's son was afraid to go to his middle school  
after the Colorado shootings; on Monday he and his sister both went 
back to school happily. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt safe sending our children to school this morning, and  
they came home safe,'' she said. ``There was not a lot of talk 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, elementary school principals reported in a recent  
survey that more parents were asking about their children's safety 
after the spring incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and children also are worried about how school officials  
will treat students who seem different. Though Columbine's 
principal asked students to be more tolerant, given that the gunmen 
had been viewed as social misfits at the school, many other schools 
will welcome back students with increased monitoring of their dress 
and other behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to see a model where children who wear  
trenchcoats or go on the Internet become instantly classified as 
kooks and crazy,'' said Larry Gray, father of 17-year-old Quentin, 
who attends Duke Ellington School for the Arts in Washington. ``A 
lot of these kids are really underestimated and sharp as tacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Barry, a parent and town official in Ludlow, Mass., says  
the tragedies elsewhere have given parents there a new resolve to 
pay more attention to their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``You keep thinking it's never going to happen,'' said Barry.  
``But everybody is trying to stay aware of it. People aren't 
closing their eyes to things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to get back to the basics and you have to get back to  
family atmosphere and family support.''

<HEADLINE> Lycos Reports Improved Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Lycos Inc., a leading search and directory  
site on the World Wide Web, reported a 137 percent surge in 
fourth-quarter revenue, helping the company post operating earnings 
that beat analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter ended July 31,Lycos reported a net loss of $21.4  
million, or 24 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $6.8 
million, or 9 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding costs related to mergers aquisitions and other  
one-time expenses, the company earned $605,000, or 1 cent per 
share, up from a $703,000, or 1 cent per share, loss in the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	That beat analysts' expectations that the company would break  
even for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues grew to $45.1 million, a 137 percent increase over the  
$19 million Lycos took in last year in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lycos has been spending freely, incurring a number of  
significant costs in recent months, including $265 million to 
acquire three companies: WhoWhere?, Wired Digital and Internet 
Music Distribution Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos also ended its fiscal year July 31, posting a  
5-cent-a-share, $6.2 million loss on the year, adjusting for the 
one-time expenses, compared to a 6-cent-a-share, $3.6 million loss 
in the year ending July 31, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Including one-time expenses, Lycos lost $52 million, or 60 cents  
a share, in fiscal 1999, up from $28.4 million, or 46 cents a 
share, the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	But revenues skyrocketed from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999,  
increasing 142 percent, from $56.1 million to $135.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltham, Mass.-based Lycos is a leading Internet portal, a sort  
of jumping off point for people surfing the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings statement was released after the close of trading  
Tuesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Lycos' stock closed the session 
up $1.87 1/2 at $42.31 1/4.

	1,000 Said Dead in Turkey Quake  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkish government officials say 1,000  
people are dead and thousands injured after a powerful earthquake 
rocked western Turkey early this morning. The quake, measured at 
7.8, struck at 3 a.m. local time (8 p.m. EDT Monday), catching most 
people asleep in their beds. Some ran into the street in panic, 
others were crushed in the rubble. Dozens of buildings and highway 
overpasses collapsed in Istanbul, state TV said. Private NTV 
television said 160 sailors were reported dead from the collapse of 
two navy buildings in the town of Golcuk. Authorities said at least 
156 people were killed in Istanbul alone.

	Photographers Not Blamed for Diana  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's state prosecutor's office said today it  
found no evidence to prove that chasing photographers were directly 
responsible for the car crash that killed Princess Diana. The 
prosecutor's office said it sent a recommendation to the 
investigating judge that charges be dismissed against the nine 
photographers and a press motorcyclist implicated in the crash. The 
photographers and the motorcyclist were placed under investigation 
shortly after the Aug. 31, 1997, crash that killed Diana, her 
boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul.

	Clinton Unveils School Violence Ad  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three new public service announcements urging  
parents to talk to their children about violence will be unveiled 
today by President Clinton. The messages, to debut tomorrow on 
major broadcast and cable television networks, include a toll-free 
number to call for a free booklet on how to talk to children, 
especially those aged 8 to 12, about safety and the dangers of 
weapons and of gang violence. One TV ad begins with a school bell 
ringing. It ends with Clinton saying, ``Our children need our 
help.'' In between, students chat about knives in book bags and 
their personal safety at school.

	Scores Hold Steady on College Test  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scores on one of the key college entrance  
exams held steady this year. A report on the 1999 ACT exam finds 
the average score was 21 out of a possible 36, the same as last 
year. A decade ago, the average score was 20.6. The ACT measures 
English, math, reading and science skills. It's taken by 1 million 
American high school students, mostly in the west and south. 
Results from the other major college entrance exam, the SAT, will 
be released later this month. 

</P>

	Poll: Many OK With Racial Separation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About half the young adults in a recent poll  
said racial separation in America is all right ``as long as 
everyone has equal opportunity.'' The poll, released yesterday by 
Hamilton College, also found that 56 percent said the federal 
government should make sure black people receive fair treatment in 
jobs, and about 57 percent agreed that generations of slavery and 
discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for 
blacks to work their way out of the lower class.

	New Home Construction Rebounds  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction of new homes and apartments,  
which fell 5.8 percent in June, rebounded in July, reflecting 
continued strength in the U.S. housing sector despite rising 
mortgage rates. The Commerce Department reported today that new 
home construction rose 5.7 percent. Meanwhile, rates on a 30-year 
fixed mortgage soared to 8.15 percent, the highest in more than two 
years. The National Association of Home Builders said that some 
builders are concerned that rising interest rates are starting to 
affect buyer demand, which had been robust earlier this year.

	Suzuki To Sponsor Heisman Trophy  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fans will be able to have a say, albeit a small  
say, in next year's Heisman Trophy voting. The Downtown Athletic 
Club, which presents college football's most prestigious individual 
award, entered into a three-year $1.5 million deal with American 
Suzuki in a deal that allows fans to vote by visiting Suzuki 
dealers. The votes won't count for much, though. All Suzuki voters 
together will get just one vote. Sports writers, sports 
broadcasters, some coaches and former Heisman Trophy winners get 
992. The Japanese car maker will spend $35 million over three years 
with Time Warner in a marketing partnership to promote the award.

<HEADLINE> Ex Mich St. Football Player Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood, the first-round  
draft pick from Michigan State who left the Minnesota Vikings 
training camp and was later released, was arrested and briefly held 
Tuesday on a warrant over a parking ticket, campus police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, 22, was arrested about 2:20 a.m. on the Michigan  
State campus for a traffic violation, said Lt. John McCandless of 
the campus Department of Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Campus police learned that warrants issued in Lansing were  
pending against Underwood and a passenger in his vehicle. Both were 
turned over to Lansing police, McCandless said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood paid a $150 fine and was released from the city jail  
shortly afterward, Lansing police Lt. Ray Hall told television 
station WLAJ. Neither McCandless nor Hall would identify the person 
arrested with Underwood or say what that person was charged with. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite missing his entire senior season with a sprained ankle,  
the Vikings made Underwood their top draft pick, and 29th overall, 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract with the Vikings on  
Aug. 1, but walked out of training camp the next day. Underwood, 
who couldn't be located for days, met Aug. 10 with Minnesota coach 
Dennis Green and, according to the club, ``told Coach Green that he 
has no desire to play football and has decided not to play for the 
Vikings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Dolphins claimed Underwood off waivers Monday,  
although team officials said they weren't sure if he would play 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood explained his departure from the Vikings' camp by  
saying he was torn between a desire to pursue the ministry and the 
need to support his family, including his 16-month-old twins who 
live in Michigan with his former girlfriend.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Crossing Guard Hit by Pickup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- A school crossing guard was hit by a  
pickup truck after pushing two youngsters to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Cook, 66, was hospitalized in satisfactory condition with a  
broken knee, hip and ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cook pushed 7-year-old Amber Stringer and 10-year-old Tony  
Stringer out of the way of the pickup Monday near Crystal Lake 
Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you possibly thank someone for saving your kids'  
lives?'' said Christina Stringer, the children's mother. ``Even 
when Jill was on the ground, all she asked about was if my kids 
were safe. She is one incredible woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the school Tuesday, many of the 600 youngsters worked on  
cards and posters for Mrs. Cook. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cook ``said she was just protecting the lives of children  
like she was trained to do,'' said a daughter, Joyce Cook. 
</P>
<P>
	No immediate charges were filed against the driver.

<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's independence day was  
marred today by clashes between pro-democracy protesters and riot 
police in Jakarta, the strafing of East Timor's separatist 
movement's headquarters and reports that five people were killed in 
strife-torn Aceh province. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of four civilians were found Monday in Jamoaye  
district in North Aceh, 1,100 miles northwest of Jakarta. All had 
their throats slit, Jacob Hamzah, leader of a local human rights 
group, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamzah said the four men had been abducted early Monday by about  
30 armed men in military uniforms in Ulee Gle village. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in nearby South Aceh, an unidentified gunman shot a  
soldier to death early today, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, secessionists fired on a military post in  
North Aceh, wounding at least seven marines, the official Antara 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence came as Indonesia celebrated its 54th independence  
anniversary. The archipelago nation declared independence from 
Dutch colonial rule Aug. 17, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	In East Timor, unidentified gunmen opened fire on the offices of  
the region's main pro-independence group at dawn today, just hours 
before die-hard loyalists gathered for what could be the last 
Indonesian national day celebration in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported in the attacks on two buildings  
housing the offices of the National Council for Timorese 
Resistance. The group blamed anti-independence militiaman for the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	One office, located in the city's waterfront area, was the site  
of Sunday's rally by thousands of pro-independence supporters that 
kicked off their campaign for the Aug. 30 ballot on whether East 
Timor should become independent or remain part of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Though many predict the former Portuguese colony, which  
Indonesia invaded in 1975, will opt for independence, Gov. Abilio 
Jose Osario Soares disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will not be the last independence ceremony,'' he told  
some 1,000 members of the military, police and civil guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia celebrated its anniversary by granting remissions to  
hundreds of prisoners across the country. Among them was imprisoned 
East Timor guerrilla commander Jose Alexandre 'Xanana' Gusmao, 
whose 20-year sentence was slashed by five months. 
</P>
<P>
	The gesture was symbolic as Indonesia has promised to release  
Gusmao from house arrest in Jakarta after the independence ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities in Jakarta included a military pageant at the  
presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
	However, hundreds of students blocked a busy road after police  
stopped them from marching on parliament. Many lay down on the 
pavement and refused to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
	Other students were injured in a scuffle with police outside the  
national electoral office.

	Though many predict the former Portuguese colony, which  
Indonesia invaded in 1975, will opt for independence, Gov. Abilio 
Jose Osario Soares disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will not be the last independence ceremony,'' he told  
some 1,000 members of the military, police and civil guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia celebrated its anniversary by granting remissions to  
hundreds of prisoners across the country. Among them was imprisoned 
East Timor guerrilla commander Jose Alexandre 'Xanana' Gusmao, 
whose 20-year sentence was slashed by five months. 
</P>
<P>
	The gesture was symbolic as Indonesia has promised to release  
Gusmao from house arrest in Jakarta after the independence ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities in Jakarta included a military pageant at the  
presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
	However, hundreds of students blocked a busy road after police  
stopped them from marching on parliament. Many lay down on the 
pavement and refused to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
	Other students were injured in a scuffle with police outside the  
national electoral office.

<HEADLINE> Feds Bust Drug Network in 14 Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents arrested scores of people and  
seized drugs and money in 14 cities Tuesday in an effort to break 
up what the FBI called one of the top 20 drug distribution networks 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents had warrants to arrest 100 people and search more than 70  
sites in an operation against a group alleged to import tons of 
cocaine and marijuana across the Southwest border and distribute it 
in the East and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The target of the multiagency Operation Southwest Express was  
the drug trafficking organization of Omar Rocha Soto, arrested with 
his wife, Adriana Espinoza, early Tuesday as they left their 
$649,000 home in a San Diego suburb. ``He was definitely on his way 
to being a big-big-time trafficker,'' said Errol Chavez, chief of 
the Drug Enforcement Administration's San Diego office. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested Tuesday were three brothers who agents said  
coordinated transportation for the group from their El Paso, Texas, 
base. Daniel, Raul and Angel Sotello-Lopez were arrested in El 
Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	They and others arrested were charged with drug trafficking,  
money laundering and conspiracy. The trafficking charges alone can 
carry 20-year prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
	During the yearlong investigation, agents seized 4,158 pounds of  
marijuana, 2,727 kilograms of cocaine and more than $1.15 million 
in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Seized Tuesday were 14 more kilograms of cocaine, two Ferrari  
autos, a Land Rover and seven weapons, including an AK-47 assault 
rifle, Assistant FBI Director Thomas Pickard said. By late Tuesday 
afternoon, 77 arrests had been made, and more than 20 others were 
expected, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This investigation has resulted in a major disruption of the  
flow of drugs from the Southwest border throughout the United 
States,'' said FBI Director Louis Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickard said the raids disrupted ``a major drug trafficking  
organization from its distribution system to its retail sales.'' He 
ranked the group among ``the top 20'' drug trafficking networks in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The group brought drugs into San Diego and El Paso and shipped  
them to friends and associates in Chicago in covert compartments of 
cars, tractor-trailers and by piggyback trains that haul trailers, 
Pickard said. From Chicago, the drugs were sent on to Cleveland, 
New York and Boston and then to Nashville, Tenn., and Atlanta. He 
said the drugs originated in Mexico, South America and Southeast 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``This organization that was disrupted today embraced the  
American capitalist idea and would sell any type of drug for a 
profit,'' Pickard said. ``It did not discriminate in its dealings 
with any other drug organizations. For example, they sold to 
Dominicans, blacks, Middle Easterners and any other organized crime 
group throughout the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was conducted by the FBI, the Drug Enforcement  
Administration, the Justice Department, Customs Service, Internal 
Revenue Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service. More 
than 50 state and local police agencies also took part. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important element was working together to pool our  
intelligence,'' said Joseph Keefe, DEA's chief of special 
operations. ``Everybody's got a piece of information down to the 
local police level. It's just a matter of getting everybody to work 
together on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickard said agents used pen registers, to record telephone  
numbers dialed by the gang, and court-approved wiretaps including a 
roving wiretap on one individual who used 12 different phones in 
one month. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not say where all of the arrests or seizures on  
Tuesday occurred. But, including previous law enforement 
activities, arrests or seizures in the operation have occurred in 
Houston; Lufkin, Texas; Chicago; La Salle, Ill.; Cleveland; Dayton, 
Ohio; Allentown, Pa.; New York; Albany, N.Y.; Boston; Nashville; 
and Atlanta, the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Rise 0.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices edged up just 0.3 percent in  
July despite big increases for energy and airline fares. At the 
same time, construction of new homes staged a solid rebound and the 
nation's factories boosted production at the fastest pace this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	All three government reports, released Tuesday, provided fresh  
evidence that the U.S. economy continues to power ahead without 
triggering worrisome inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The mild 0.3 percent gain in the Labor Department's Consumer  
Price Index, the most closely watched barometer of inflation, came 
after two straight months of flat prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly good news for everybody, including  
consumers,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with WEFA Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets were heartened by the inflation report. The  
Dow Jones industrial average closed up 70.29 points to 11,117.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists and investors still believe the Federal Reserve  
will raise interest rates when it meets next week to slow the 
economy and keep inflation at bay -- but only by a quarter of a 
point. However, the inflation report could forestall further rake 
hikes, some said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a modest hike is really in the cards,'' Shaber said.  
</P>
<P>
	Russell Sheldon, chief economist with MCM MoneyWatch, said a  
quarter-point interest rate increase ``is probably a done deal next 
week, but the CPI report could make it less likely that a series of 
increases after that one would follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some economists said a surge in new home construction in  
July and a strong 0.7 percent advance in output at the nation's 
factories, mines and utilities last month could raise concerns at 
the Fed that the economy is still growing too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line for the Fed is that home-building is still a  
bit too strong,'' said First Union economist Mark Vitner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said single-family homes and apartment  
construction rose a stronger-than-expected 5.7 percent last month 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.66 million units. In 
June, housing starts fell 5.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite rising mortgage rates, housing construction last month  
increased everywhere but the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than not buying, people are staying in the market but  
are shifting to adjustable rate mortgages'' that carry lower 
interest rates than a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, said David 
Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home 
Builders. The 30-year rate soared last week to 8.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed said July's increase in industrial output reflected  
increased demand for electricity during the heat wave. It was the 
biggest factory production gain since last October. 
</P>
<P>
	That advance pushed up the overall industrial operating rate to  
80.7 percent of capacity in July, still far below the level at 
which analysts begin to worry about production bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the inflation front, the 0.3 percent increase in consumer  
prices was the biggest gain since a 0.7 jump in April, which 
resulted from a 6.1 percent spike in gasoline and other energy 
prices. That April increase concerned the Fed, which nudged up 
interest rates June 30, the first hike in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	After falling in May and June, energy prices climbed by 2.1  
percent in July, accounting for almost half the overall increase in 
consumer prices. Gasoline prices, which had soared 15 percent in 
April, rose 4.3 percent last month and were up 30.2 percent so far 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Production cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  
Countries and a pickup in global demand reflecting economic 
recovery in many countries damaged by the Asian currency crisis 
helped account for the gain in gasoline and other energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline fares, which fell in May and June, rose 6.5 percent in  
July, the largest increase since October 1992. Some economists said 
rising energy costs and strong demand for airline seats during the 
summer helped account for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, consumer prices are rising at an annual rate  
of 2.4 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent increase for all of 
1998. This acceleration reflects the rebound in energy costs, which 
were rising at a rate of 12.4 percent in the first seven months of 
this year after dropping 8.8 percent for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices, meanwhile, rose just 0.2 percent in July, after no  
change in June. A 3 percent drop in fresh fruit prices helped 
offset a 2.5 percent increase in vegetable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, prices were up  
just 0.2 percent last month. So far this year, this core rate of 
inflation is rising just 1.7 percent, better than last year's 2.4 
percent rise.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns on Tuesday re-signed point guard  
Randy Livingston to a multiyear contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, a backup to starter Jason Kidd, was signed by the  
Suns on May 4, prior to the team's regular-season finale against 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston scored 12 points in 22 minutes against the  
Timberwolves and then was put on the playoff roster, averaging 5.3 
points and 2.3 rebounds in 8 minutes over three games against 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Before signing with the Suns last season, Livingston played for  
Sioux Falls of the CBA. He previously played in the NBA for Houston 
(1996-97) and Atlanta (1997-98).

<HEADLINE> Island Evacuated As Hurricane Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON ISLAND (AP) -- Anticipating a direct hit from a  
weakening hurricane, the U.S. Army evacuated most of the 1,300 
military and civilian personnel from this small central Pacific 
island where a chemical weapons incineration facility is located. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials closed tanks and lines in the incinerator and secured  
the rest of the weapons in storm-proof bunkers as Hurricane Dora 
approached the island, part of a four-island atoll located 825 
miles southwest of Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was expected to pass 7 miles north of the island later  
tonight, close enough for National Weather Service forecaster Jeff 
Powell to call it a direct hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army was to decide today whether to remove about 200 workers  
who were not evacuated Monday, said spokesman John Fairbank. 
</P>
<P>
	Evacuees were taken to Hickam Air Force Base near Honolulu.  
</P>
<P>
	Also being evacuated were workers from the U.S. Fish and  
Wildlife Service, which operates a bird refuge on the atoll. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Dora has maximum sustained winds of about 85 miles per  
hour with some higher gusts, but further weakening was expected 
before the storm hits the island, said weather service forecaster 
Hans Rosendal. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters predicted waves of up to 12 feet, raising concerns  
about flooding on the island, which has a high point of 7 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not worried so much about winds as they are concerned  
about storm surge and seas,'' Powell said.

<HEADLINE> Swastikas Found at Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Students returning to Columbine High  
School for the first time since a massacre by two student gunmen 
were met by swastikas scratched on restroom walls and a brick wall 
outside the school. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials on Tuesday said they had etched off the four  
one-inch Nazi symbols and would punish any student responsible to 
the full extent of school policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The two gunmen had openly admired Adolf Hitler, and the April 20  
massacre that left 15 dead was on the anniversary of Hitler's 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like they are laughing in our faces, `Ha, ha, school's  
back in session and so are we,''' said Tammy Theus, mother of one 
of just 15 black students at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	She and a group of other concerned parents patrolling the school  
before the start of semester classes Monday discovered the 
graffiti. They covered the symbols with duct tape until school 
officials could have them removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 1-inch swastikas were found scratched into a freshly painted  
stall in a girl's restroom, another was found in a boy's restroom 
and a fourth was scratched into a brick wall outside the school, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking this incident very seriously, and I am asking  
students to cooperate to find the person or persons responsible,'' 
Principal Frank DeAngelis said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a rally Monday he had warned students that slurs and  
harassment would not be tolerated. Jokes about the killings or 
jokes with racial or sexual overtones are grounds for suspension, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 2,000 students returned to Columbine on Monday, their  
first day back since students Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, 
heavily armed with explosives and guns, opened fire in the school. 
The two killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded 23 people 
before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said Harris and Klebold had often told racial jokes and  
gave the Nazi salute in bowling class when they threw strikes. The 
two also wore black trench coats in school, and Harris wrote 
hate-filled messages on the Internet, vowing death to all who had 
slighted him. 
</P>
<P>
	District officials said they believed the swastikas had been  
etched in the restrooms on Monday because all of the rooms were 
repainted before fall classes began.

	1,100 Said Dead in Turkey Quake  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The worst recorded earthquake to hit  
western Turkey killed at least 1,100 people and injured thousands 
today, destroying buildings and cutting off power and water to 
millions living along the heavily populated Bosporus Strait. By 
late afternoon, the crisis center at the prime minister's office 
had tallied 1,169 dead and 5,550 injured. The numbers were expected 
to rise. The quake struck at 3 a.m. local time (8 p.m. EDT Monday), 
catching most people asleep. Dozens of buildings and highway 
overpasses collapsed in Istanbul, state TV said. Many roads were 
severely damaged and unpassable. ``There could be as many as 10,000 
people under the debris,'' said Mayor Ismail Baris.

	FDA Restricts Blood Donations

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration ruled today  
that Americans who visited Britain frequently at the height of that 
country's mad-cow-disease scare will be banned from donating blood 
back home. The FDA decision affects Americans who have spent a 
total of six months in Britain since 1980. There is no evidence 
that any mad-cow-type illness has been spread through blood 
transfusions. But because mad-cow disease has been linked to a 
human brain destroyer in Britain, federal health officials decided 
the blood donor ban was an appropriate precaution.

today and the military simulated a response to a chemical attack. 
During the exercise, a dozen military helicopters and vehicles 
rushed to wash down an eight-lane boulevard in southern Seoul that 
was ``contaminated'' in the simulated attack. Others rescued 
injured civilians while special forces troops recovered a 
government building supposedly occupied by a group of North Korean

represent Nichols with payment from the state court fund. Nichols 
already is serving a life prison sentence on federal convictions 
stemming from the April 1995 blast at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building, which killed 168 people. In the state trial, he could 
face the death penalty. Jim Bednar, executive director of the

<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford is working on a hydrogen-powered  
internal combustion engine that it says could be a cleaner-burning 
alternative to the gasoline engine until automakers perfect a 
fuel-cell powertrain. Ford officials say the engine, a modified 
version of Ford's 2-liter Zetec four-cylinder gasoline engine, 
promises 25 percent to 30 percent better fuel efficiency. The 
company plans to begin road-testing later this year. The fuel-cell 
powertrain engine produce electricity from an electrochemical 
reaction between hydrogen and oxygen; the only emission is water. 
Experts say a breakthrough on fuel-cell production is at least a 
decade off.

<HEADLINE> Suspicious Valise Spurs DC Gridlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A suspicious package in a service alley behind  
a downtown hotel turned today's morning rush hour into a nightmare 
for thousands of commuters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took the necessary precautions,'' said Police Chief Charles  
Ramsey, defending the decisions that led to the closing of more 
than a dozen blocks to pedestrians and motorists a few blocks 
northeast of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	A homeless man discovered a leather case in an alley near  
Holiday Inn Crown Plaza Hotel about 5 a.m. He opened the case and 
described its contents to police as ``a long cylindrical object 
inside of the case with another box on top with lights flashing,'' 
said Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, the FBI, the Fire Department and several federal  
agencies sent experts to the site. An X-ray camera examined the 
case and the experts agreed the contents could be some kind of 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	For 3 1/2 hours police and rescue squads closed off the area,  
ordering everyone to move at least two blocks away. About 400 
guests at the hotel were evacuated and nearby businesses were 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	When the suspicious suitcase was blown open with a high-pressure  
water cannon, ``We found some materials taken possibly from a 
construction site,'' Ramsey said. The contents included wire, an 
acetylene torch and canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	The area remained closed off for another half-hour, until crews  
determined there were no hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``The device had absolutely no hazards at all associated with  
it,'' said Fire Chief Donald Edwards.

<HEADLINE> Swastikas Found at Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Newly scrawled swastikas marred  
students' return to Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was the first day students had returned for classes since  
April 20, when students Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, heavily 
armed with explosives and guns, opened fire. They killed 12 
classmates and a teacher and wounded 23 people before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most kids were really happy to get back in school,'' student  
body president Mike Sheehan after a welcoming rally. 
</P>
<P>
	However, three freshly scrawled swastikas were found in some  
bathrooms, said Tammy Theus, mother of one of just 15 
African-American students at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the walls were clean when she and other concerned  
parents toured the school a week ago, but on Monday they found one 
swastika in a boys' bathroom and two in girls' bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurt,'' she said today. ``The rally was great. They've made  
changes in the dress code, like not allowing trench coats. Then I 
see this. It's like they are laughing in our faces, `Ha, ha, 
school's back in session and so are we.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold had openly admired Hitler, celebrating  
strikes in bowling class by giving the Nazi salute. The attack took 
place on Hitler's birthday. The two wore black trench coats and 
Harris wrote hate-filled messages on the Internet, vowing death to 
all who had slighted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Another swastika was found scratched into the brick outside the  
school, said district spokeswoman Marilyn Saltzman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really concerned about this,'' she said. However, she  
hadn't heard about the bathroom swastikas and was checking before 
saying anything more. 
</P>
<P>
	School district official Rick Kaufman has said that jokes about  
the killings and racial or sexual jokes are grounds for immediate 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were mostly upbeat as they returned to class Monday,  
striving for a normal day under abnormal circumstances. They were 
met with a huge rally, led by Principal Frank DeAngelis. 
</P>
<P>
	In classrooms, teachers reminded students that counseling is  
available, and about 25 students stopped by the so-called safe room 
to talk. Two mental health experts have been added to the staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's mixed feelings. Some people are very happy to be back;  
others can't handle being here,'' senior Kim Blair said during her 
lunch break. ``It's somewhat typical, but somewhat really 
strange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County School District spent $1.2 million to  
transform the inside of Columbine from a scene of unspeakable 
carnage back into a place of learning. A new wall of lockers blocks 
the entrance to the second-floor library, where Klebold and Harris 
killed 10 students and shot themselves to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Security has also been tightened. Along with armed guards, 16  
more surveillance cameras were added inside the school, and all 
students and staff must wear ID badges. However, the students will 
not have to pass through metal detectors or submit to backpack 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students chaffed at the new restrictions, especially a  
``zero-tolerance'' policy against the kind of harassment Klebold, 
17, and Harris, 18, claimed they suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so bad being back, except all this whining and  
zero-tolerance stuff,'' said Trevor Pousson, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	At the rally before school started, DeAngelis implored his  
students to be more respectful of those who might seem different. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that the compassion and the unity that you had at the  
end of last year will continue and will be built upon to give us 
the strength to move forward,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who returned Monday was student Lance Kirklin. The  
16-year-old survived five gunshot wounds, including a shotgun blast 
that tore away much of the left side of his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his classmates and at least two employees chose not to  
come back, but about 97 percent of the 2,000 students enrolled at 
Columbine attended class Monday, 1 percentage point better than 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the 23 wounded students, Richard Castaldo, remained  
hospitalized Monday, undergoing rehabilitation for a spinal injury. 
</P>
<P>
	At least six parents of students who were killed in the rampage  
attended the rally and later expressed anger that there was no 
moment of silence for those who died. 
</P>
<P>
	``They completely left out the victims, those who lost their  
lives, those who will never be the same,'' said Brian Rohrbough, 
whose 15-year-old son, Daniel, was shot while holding an exit door 
for fleeing students. ``They put it under a carpet, like it's a 
little fire and they put it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, school district spokeswoman Barbara Monseu said the  
intention was not to forget but to find a way to move forward.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Touts Gun, Hate Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tougher gun and hate-crime laws coupled with  
greater social responsibility are needed to fight the kind of 
violence that overtook parts of Los Angeles last week, Democratic 
presidential candidate Bill Bradley said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to see it in a broader context,'' Bradley said.  
``There are too many places this could strike if we don't have a 
broader social response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spoke from New Jersey via video teleconferencing  
devices. He joined a dozen political, community and religious 
leaders on a panel at a town hall meeting titled ``Seeking 
Solutions: When Hate Turns into Violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forum, which was broadcast live on radio, was sparked by the  
shooting rampage Aug. 10 at the North Valley Jewish Community 
Center where three children attending day camp, a 16-year-old 
counselor and a 68-year-old receptionist were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, white supremacist Buford O. Furrow, 37, was  
arrested in the center shooting and the killing of a postal worker 
the following day in Las Vegas. He remained jailed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he supports new gun laws that would require taking  
a safety course before purchasing a gun and would prohibit gun 
dealers in residential neighborhoods. His suggestion that new laws 
are needed drew boos from several crowd members.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Many OK With Racial Separation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About half the young adults in a recent poll  
said racial separation in America is all right ``as long as 
everyone has equal opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll released Monday in Washington by Hamilton College of  
Clinton, N.Y., found 50 percent of respondents strongly or somewhat 
agreed with the statement: ``It's OK if the races are basically 
separate from one another as long as everyone has equal 
opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, 47 percent of those polled disagreed strongly  
or somewhat with the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, co-sponsored by the NAACP and Zogby International,  
surveyed 1001 randomly selected people ages 18 to 29 over one week 
in April and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other poll findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Some 56 percent said the federal government should make sure  
black people receive fair treatment in jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 57 percent agreed that generations of slavery and  
discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for 
blacks to work their way out of the lower class. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some 54 percent said it was unlikely the United States would  
elect a black president in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Lotto Winners To Bring Daughter Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LORAIN, Ohio (AP) -- Multimillion-dollar lottery winners Ernest  
and Lucille Hasan have no plans for big spending on a mansion or 
jewelry -- they would simply like to bring their daughter home. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Hasan, 42, has been in a coma since her car was hit by a  
truck 13 years ago. She lives at a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was any way possible we could take care of her here,  
there's no way she'd be in that nursing home,'' said Ernest Hasan, 
70. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hasans won a jackpot worth $8 million Saturday in Ohio's  
Super Lotto drawing, but chose to take their winnings in a lump sum 
payment of $3.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They said that other than thinking of moving their daughter,  
which might mean buying a bigger house, they're still too shocked 
by their win to make any definite plans for the money. They might 
help out their six other children and 25 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasan said he'll continue working as a maintenance worker for  
the Lorain County Community Action Agency. He's been working full 
time at various jobs since he was 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't changed in all these years,'' Ernest said. ``Why  
should I now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The money will just give us some peace of mind,'' said Mrs.  
Hasan, 62.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Economy Shows Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A robust farm sector helped boost  
Brazil's economy in the second quarter, indicating that a prolonged 
slump may be ending, the government said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's gross domestic product, the total value of its goods  
and services, shrank by a smaller-than-expected 0.76 percent in the 
second quarter compared to a year earlier, the Brazilian Institute 
of Geography and Statistics said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to the first quarter, the GDP actually grew 0.93  
percent in real terms, while the first-half GDP shrank 0.42 percent 
compared to the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance exceeded the expectations of many private  
economists, who projected a year-on-year decline of around 2.2 
percent in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural output grew 1.6 percent compared to the second  
quarter of 1998, the institute said. The 1999 grains and oilseeds 
harvest is a record 82.6 million metric tons, nearly 10 percent 
higher than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	The services sector, which accounts for around 60 percent of  
Brazil's economic output, grew a slight 0.04 percent. Industrial 
output, however, contracted 3.2 percent in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	The first half also featured unexpectedly low inflation of  
nearly 4 percent. The institute said a decline in demand that 
followed January's currency devaluation took the pressure off 
prices and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, the government predicted the economy would  
shrink by 3.5 to 4 percent this year. But the estimate was revised 
in May to around 1 percent, and economists say recovery should 
speed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can expect to see a faster recovery in the third and fourth  
quarters,'' said Rubens Sandenburg, chief economist at ABM Amro 
bank in Sao Paulo.

<HEADLINE> Filmmaker Ready for New Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The huge success of ``The Blair Witch  
Project'' has opened doors for the film's young creators. Now 
they're waiting for the attention to die down so they can 
concentrate on new projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fame part kind of gets in the way of the filmmaking part,  
so hopefully the fame will fade and we can get back to 
filmmaking,'' producer Michael Menello said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, which was made for about $35,000, has become one of  
the largest grossing independent films in history, bringing in 
around $108 million since it went into wide release three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The success has elevated the five former University of Central  
Florida film students from starving artists to press-hounded 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	The mock documentary has given directors Daniel Myrick and  
Eduardo Sanchez and producers Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie and Monello 
the financial freedom to focus on the creative side of filmmaking 
instead of spending nearly half their time fundraising. 
</P>
<P>
	But fame has also created new demands on their time, including  
juggling interviews and phone calls from agents, fans and 
``long-lost friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All we've been doing is struggling to keep up with things,''  
said Sanchez. ``It's amazing how much non-filmmaking there is.''

<HEADLINE>  South Korea Conducts Air Raid Drill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Air raid sirens blared today and the  
military simulated a chemical attack on Seoul amid fears of a 
possible missile test by communist North Korea. A leader in the 
isolated North said the missile issue should be resolved with 
dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hourlong exercise, a dozen military helicopters and  
vehicles rushed to wash down an eight-lane boulevard in southern 
Seoul that was ``contaminated'' in the simulated attack. Others 
rescued injured civilians while special forces troops recovered a 
government building supposedly occupied by a group of North Korean 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in a related 20-minute civil defense drill, pedestrians in  
the South Korean capital ducked into nearby buildings and cars in 
normally clogged streets pulled over. 
</P>
<P>
	The exercises showed the tensions that persist on the Korean  
peninsula a half-century after the war between the North and South. 
</P>
<P>
	A close adviser to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il accused the  
United States of stirring discord with repeated warnings to 
Pyongyang to scrap any plans for a test of a long-range missile. 
But he was also conciliatory, in contrast with recent belligerent 
rhetoric from Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
	``If things are discussed in a reasonable manner, then they will  
turn out well,'' Kim Yong Sun, secretary of North Korea's ruling 
Korean Workers' Party, said in an interview with Cable News 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic about it. If a visitor brings us cake, we will  
also give cakes. But if they bring a sword, we will respond with a 
sword,'' Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin  
welcomed Kim's statement and said North Korea would benefit if it 
decided not to launch a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly hope that this statement indicates that North  
Korea is prepared to seize the opportunity for improved relations 
with the United States,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. and South Korean officials believe North Korea is  
using the threat of a missile launch to extract economic and other 
concessions in exchange for shelving the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, South Korea and the United States have said North Korea  
faces economic and diplomatic penalties if it launches a new 
missile that military analysts believe could reach Alaska or 
Hawaii. Hard hit by food shortages, Pyongyang gets aid from all 
three countries. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian news agency quoted unidentified military and  
diplomatic sources in Moscow as saying North Korea may test the 
missile later this month or in September. The long-range ballistic 
missile, the Taepodong II, has a range of more than 2,500 miles, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea is sending its foreign minister to Japan early next  
week to discuss ways to keep North Korea from launching a missile 
and how to respond if it does. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Seoul subway station, schoolchildren chatted, giggled and  
read comic books during the defense drill. Some people used 
cellular telephones to say they would be late. Police blew whistles 
to call back a few people who tried to sneak into the street. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill, which is held four times a year and first started in  
1972, was held in coordination with a 12-day joint military 
exercise between U.S. and South Korean forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The exercise mostly involves computer simulations designed to  
evaluate and improve joint contingency operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, generals from the American-led U.N. Command and  
North Korea met again at the border village of Panmunjom inside the 
demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, but failed to reach 
agreement on a disputed borderline at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	One North Korean warship sank and an estimated 30 North Korean  
sailors were killed on June 15 when warships from both Koreas 
exchanged fire in a contested zone in the Yellow Sea. Four rounds 
of previous talks failed to produce any agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, North Korea alarmed Northeast Asia by sending a  
rocket sailing over northern Japan and into the Pacific Ocean. 
Pyongyang said it had launched a satellite, but the United States 
said it was a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	In the CNN interview, Kim did not say whether North Korea would  
go ahead with a launch, but he said the United States had no right 
to complain because it has its own powerful arsenal of missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do have a missile, why should they necessarily think  
that it poses a threat to their national security?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said North Korea wanted to write a peace treaty with the  
United States to replace the temporary armistice that ended the 
1950-1953 Korean War. The United States has said that South Korea 
must be included in any such treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, peace talks in Geneva involving the two Koreas, China  
and the United States ended with little apparent progress and no 
agreement on a specific date for the next round.

<HEADLINE>  700 May Be Dead in Turkey Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Rescuers dug frantically with their bare  
hands today to free people trapped in the rubble of a massive 
earthquake that rocked western Turkey's biggest cities, with 
unofficial estimates saying at least 700 people were killed and 
thousands injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Private NTV television said 160 sailors were reported dead from  
the collapse of two navy buildings in the town of Golcuk. 
Authorities said at least 156 people were killed in Istanbul alone, 
where 3,721 people were injured, the semi-official Anatolia news 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake struck at 3 a.m. local time (8 p.m. EDT Monday),  
catching most people asleep in their beds. The lucky ones ran into 
the street in panic, others were crushed in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people fled their homes in night clothes and without shoes.  
Later they walked through the glass-strewn streets with cloth 
wrapped around their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of buildings and highway overpasses collapsed in  
Istanbul, state TV said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents used car headlights to work in the predawn hours,  
while the young and elderly slept in the open. One elderly man was 
filmed by Turkish television reading from the Koran, the Muslim 
holy book, in front of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest-hit area appeared to be around the industrial city  
of Izmit, where an oil refinery was in flames. Thick black smoke 
filled the morning sky as firefighters struggled to contain the 
huge flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Pinar, an official from the Istanbul-based Kandilli  
observatory, said Izmit, also known as Kocaeli, is located on a 
quake-prone fault line. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 100 people in addition to the 160 sailors were believed  
killed in Golcuk, near Izmit and 80 miles southeast of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fear that there are many more under the rubble,'' said  
Mayor Ismail Baris. 
</P>
<P>
	With the city's resources exhausted, it was mostly neighbors and  
relatives that fought to pull people from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the loss of lives will be huge,'' Prime  
Minister Bulent Ecevit said. But he added: ``God willing, we will 
not be faced with a picture as bad as we fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,  
said the quake had a magnitude of 7.8, making it nearly as powerful 
as the 7.9-magnitude San Francisco quake in 1906, which killed 700 
people. The quake occurred at a relatively shallow six miles below 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 250 aftershocks followed, the Kandilli observatory  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was in Istanbul for  
talks on Caspian Sea oil and gas pipeline projects, was unhurt, as 
was Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who 
was visiting Ankara. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson told reporters the United States had offered  
assistance and was waiting for Turkey to assess what it needs. He 
called the quake ``devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty-five seconds worth of very violent shaking in our hotel  
room, myself and my staff. It was very violent shaking and we were 
able to observe the darkness of the earthquake, people streaming 
into the streets. Lights going out in Istanbul,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Switzerland immediately dispatched teams to help with  
the rescue operation, NTV said. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy 
said its army rescue unit was on alert and told Turkish authorities

<HEADLINE>  700 May Be Dead in Turkey Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Rescuers dug frantically with their bare  
hands today to free people trapped in the rubble of a massive 
earthquake that rocked western Turkey's biggest cities, with 
unofficial estimates saying at least 700 people were killed and 
thousands injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Private NTV television said 160 sailors were reported dead from  
the collapse of two navy buildings in the town of Golcuk. 
Authorities said at least 156 people were killed in Istanbul alone, 
where 3,721 people were injured, the semi-official Anatolia news 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake struck at 3 a.m. local time (8 p.m. EDT Monday),  
catching most people asleep in their beds. The lucky ones ran into 
the street in panic, others were crushed in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people fled their homes in night clothes and without shoes.  
Later they walked through the glass-strewn streets with cloth 
wrapped around their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of buildings and highway overpasses collapsed in  
Istanbul, state TV said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents used car headlights to work in the predawn hours,  
while the young and elderly slept in the open. One elderly man was 
filmed by Turkish television reading from the Koran, the Muslim 
holy book, in front of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest-hit area appeared to be around the industrial city  
of Izmit, where an oil refinery was in flames. Thick black smoke 
filled the morning sky as firefighters struggled to contain the 
huge flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Pinar, an official from the Istanbul-based Kandilli  
observatory, said Izmit, also known as Kocaeli, is located on a 
quake-prone fault line. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 100 people in addition to the 160 sailors were believed  
killed in Golcuk, near Izmit and 80 miles southeast of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fear that there are many more under the rubble,'' said  
Mayor Ismail Baris. 
</P>
<P>
	With the city's resources exhausted, it was mostly neighbors and  
relatives that fought to pull people from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the loss of lives will be huge,'' Prime  
Minister Bulent Ecevit said. But he added: ``God willing, we will 
not be faced with a picture as bad as we fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,  
said the quake had a magnitude of 7.8, making it nearly as powerful 
as the 7.9-magnitude San Francisco quake in 1906, which killed 700 
people. The quake occurred at a relatively shallow six miles below 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 250 aftershocks followed, the Kandilli observatory  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was in Istanbul for  
talks on Caspian Sea oil and gas pipeline projects, was unhurt, as 
was Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who 
was visiting Ankara. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson told reporters the United States had offered  
assistance and was waiting for Turkey to assess what it needs. He 
called the quake ``devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty-five seconds worth of very violent shaking in our hotel  
room, myself and my staff. It was very violent shaking and we were 
able to observe the darkness of the earthquake, people streaming 
into the streets. Lights going out in Istanbul,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Switzerland immediately dispatched teams to help with  
the rescue operation, NTV said. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy 
said its army rescue unit was on alert and told Turkish authorities 
it could be sent immediately. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Elam Still Seeks Shoe Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- It appears Jason Elam still needs to pad  
his resume. Maybe fudge a few numbers. Drop a few names. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite an NFL record-tying 63-yard field goal, two Super Bowl  
rings, two Pro Bowl trips and six game-winning kicks, the Denver 
Broncos kicker can't find anybody to endorse his phenomenal foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even get a shoe deal,'' Elam said Tuesday. ``I'm not  
with Nike anymore. Adidas won't even return my phone calls. I can 
get hat deals and all these other kind of deals. You'd think the 
most logical one would be a shoe deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elam has only himself to blame. Had he not kicked his way into  
the record book against Jacksonville last Oct. 25, Elam would still 
be using the kangaroo-skin Nike Tiempos he has favored since high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike has since redesigned the Tiempo, and Elam's last pair of  
originals went to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, along with the 
ball he kicked through the uprights to tie Tom Dempsey for the 
longest field goal in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing was perfect, and he ended up crushing it,'' said  
Tom Rouen, Elam's holder. ``I just remember the sound it made. It 
had that definite thud to it. When I looked up, it was heading 
straight down the pipe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wayward kicks have been rare for Elam. In six NFL seasons, he  
has made 115 of 120 field goal attempts inside 40 yards, and he has 
converted 259 of 260 point-after attempts in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak of PATs currently stands at a franchise-record 235  
and means nearly as much to Elam as his memorable field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make every kick inside of 40, and the ones over 40,  
I'm not going to get that upset with myself if I miss from time to 
time,'' he said. ``I want to be consistent. I don't really care 
about making a 63 and coming back and missing a 28. I don't want to 
be that kind of kicker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accuracy aside, Elam will be best remembered for 63 yards just  
as Mark McGwire is known for 70 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People that didn't know me before probably heard about it,''  
Elam said. ``Anybody that I meet now, that's usually the first 
thing out of their mouth. `Nice 63-yarder.' It's fun, though. I've 
enjoyed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like McGwire being chased by Sammy Sosa, Elam has his own  
pursuers and doesn't expect his record to stand alone like 
Dempsey's did for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Elam's choices to go long sometime soon: John Hall of the  
New York Jets, Brad Daluiso of the New York Giants and John Kasay 
of the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be broken. It's not going to be another 28 years  
before it's broken,'' Elam said. ``There's just too many good guys 
that are capable of doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rouen wouldn't be surprised if it is his teammate who rewrites  
the record book. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's definitely a possibility,'' Rouen said. ``This  
time, if we do it, I think we'd back it up a yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they don't get another historic chance, Elam and Rouen  
at least have the memory of watching the ball sail through the 
uprights in the north end zone at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm walking out on the field, I'll just kind of gaze at  
that spot on the left hash mark at the 47-yard line,'' Elam said. 
``I think about it a lot, but I think about a lot of the ones that 
I missed, too.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies Owners Sued Over Trustee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A lawsuit filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court accuses  
the Colorado Rockies of failing to cooperate with a bankrupt 
trustee who is trying to sell a multimillion-dollar stake in the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed Monday on behalf of the trust liquidating  
the assets of Oren Benton, a former Denver uranium trader and 
former Rockies partner. The defendants are Rockies managing general 
partner Jerry McMorris and general partners Dick and Charlie 
Monfort. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustee David Beckman cited several complaints against McMorris  
and the Monforts, the most crucial being their decision to reject, 
on the grounds of conflicts of interest, a number of individuals or 
groups considering buying the 23.7 percent stake once owned by 
Benton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been overly patient making sincere efforts to work  
with the other owners to sell our significant ownership in the 
team,'' Beckman said in a statement. ``Unfortunately, we have 
concluded that McMorris and the Monforts have at every turn been 
aggressively uncooperative, seemingly in an attempt to force a sale 
of our ownership share back to them at a ridiculously low price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit accuses McMorris and the Monforts of failing to pay any  
annual profits to the two Benton trusts and of providing only 
sparse and late information about the team's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as confident as I'm standing here that our cooperation has  
been 100 percent,'' McMorris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides acknowledge McMorris made an offer to buy the Benton  
stake two years ago. Seeking more money for the trusts, Beckman 
hired the investment banking firm Warburg Dillon Read to seek 
prospective bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris said one of the bidders had ties to Ascent  
Entertainment Group, the Denver pay-per-view company that recently 
agreed to sell the Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche and the 
Pepsi Center for $461 million to Denver telecommunications magnate 
Donald Sturm.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Sign Quarterback Stoney Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens signed quarterback  
Stoney Case to a one-year, $400,000 contract Tuesday and promised 
him ample opportunity to move up from No. 4 on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	Case, 29, was cut last week by the Indianapolis Colts. He went  
through his first practice with the Ravens on Tuesday, working 
behind quarterbacks Scott Mitchell, Tony Banks and Wally 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a couple other opportunities, but I like this team and  
the direction they're going in,'' Case said. ``It's one of those 
things where I had to make a good decision, and hopefully this is 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case was drafted in the third round in 1995 by the Arizona  
Cardinals. He has played in four games, starting one, and has not 
thrown a pass in an NFL game since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Case was the third-string quarterback in Arizona last season. He  
signed a two-year, $2 million contract with Indianapolis that 
included a $500,000 signing bonus, but the Colts released him last 
Wednesday after signing Steve Walsh as a backup to Peyton Manning.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARKABA, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas clashed with  
Israeli troops in southern Lebanon today, killing two Israeli 
soldiers and wounding six others in retaliation for the death of a 
Hezbollah commander, security officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel sent its air force on two bombing runs during the fierce  
artillery, mortar and rocket battles, which raged for nearly four 
hours in Wadi Slouki, a valley in a no-man's land across from the 
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli jets fired two missiles at the area, which is believed  
to be used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on 
Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen in the occupied 
zone. There was no word on casualties from the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Wadi Slouki lies between the village of Khirbet Silim and the  
villages of Houla and Markaba, about two miles from the Israeli 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate confirmation from Israel on its  
casualties or on the fighting, the most serious since Israeli air 
raids killed 10 Lebanese people in June. 
</P>
<P>
	If confirmed, the Israeli combat fatalities would be the first  
in Lebanon since Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office in July 
would certainly increase calls in Israel for a withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in the southern Israeli town of Beersheba, Barak  
referred to the escalation in Lebanon and suggested the fighting 
``will be what makes it possible in the end to remove the Israeli 
army from Lebanon by agreement and deploy it on the international 
border.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has pledged to pull the army out of Lebanon within a year.  
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said its jets attacked  
guerrilla targets, destroying a Hezbollah gun and towing vehicle. 
There was no independent confirmation that any guerrilla targets 
were hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lebanese security officials, speaking on customary condition  
of anonymity, said the Israeli casualties were airlifted by 
military helicopter to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchanges started several bush fires in nearby hills and  
valleys, sending clouds of heavy smoke in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its guerrillas launched  
a series of attacks on Israeli troops and allied militiamen in Wadi 
Slouki to retaliate for the death of Hezbollah commander Ali Hassan 
Deeb, better known as Abu Hassan, who was killed in a roadside bomb 
explosion in the southern port city of Sidon on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for the  
bombing, although no one has claimed responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``This crime will not go unpunished. The enemy will regret his  
action,'' Sheik Nabil Kaouk, the Hezbollah commander in southern 
Lebanon, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blood of martyred commanders will only boost the Islamic  
Resistance (Hezbollah's) determination, strength and 
effectiveness,'' said a Hezbollah statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli television said Monday that Abu Hassan was on the top of  
Israel's most wanted list for carrying out attacks against Israeli 
soldiers in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, suggested  
today that Abu Hassan's death was the result of a power struggle 
among the guerrillas themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not in the habit of interfering in the internal rivalry  
between the terrorist organizations in Lebanon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, asked whether Israel played  
any role in the killing, said: ``Things happen there every day, and 
Israel does not have to comment on everything that happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the English-language Daily Star reported today that a  
Lebanese army soldier assigned to protect Parliament Speaker Nabih 
Berri, has been detained on suspicion of spying for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted unnamed security sources as saying adjutant  
Hussein Olayan was apprehended Aug. 9 for his contacts with agents 
of Israel's Mossad intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Berri's Amal militia movement said Olayan was  
called in for questioning after a surveillance operation ``reached 
a stage of confirming suspicions'' about him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebanese army officials have not confirmed the arrest.

<HEADLINE> Boeing To Cooperate With Govt Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Boeing Co. agreed Tuesday to give the  
Labor Department access to facilities and records the government 
wants in its enforcement of affirmative action and 
nondiscrimination requirements on federal contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department sought the documents and information in an  
investigation of a Boeing employee's class-action complaint 
alleging race discrimination at the company's commercial aircraft 
facility in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The employee is among black Boeing workers who filed a lawsuit  
contending they were treated with hostility and were passed over 
for promotions that went to less-qualified white workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing also agreed to cooperate with a routine compliance review  
at a training facility in Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing is scheduled next month on a government allegation  
that Boeing has also thwarted Labor Department compliance reviews 
at commercial aircraft and military space and defense facilities in 
Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interests of preserving our ongoing relationship with  
the agency, we agreed to settle on two of the issues and are still 
negotiating in the third case and hope to have it resolved 
shortly,'' Boeing spokesman Larry McCracken said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department filed the three complaints against Boeing  
in July with administrative law judges, who offer a first avenue 
adjudicating disputes outside the normal court system. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Stuart Levin, a Labor Department administration judge  
here, will retain jurisdiction over the settlement for up to one 
year while the government investigations are completed. 
</P>
<P>
	With $11 billion in government business last year and 230,000  
workers nationwide, Seattle-based Boeing is the second-largest 
defense contractor after Lockheed Martin Corp.

<HEADLINE> UAW Members Vote on Authorization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- United Auto Workers members at Ford Motor Co.  
cast ballots nationwide Tuesday over whether to authorize their 
bargainers to call a strike should they be unable to reach 
agreement on a new national contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Such votes are routine every three years before negotiations  
intensify in September. The current contracts expire Sept. 14. 
Members usually vote overwhelmingly to grant their representatives 
the right to call a strike. Results of the vote were to be released 
Wednesday, UAW spokesman Paul Krell said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 101,000 union members at 43 locals across the country are  
eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the voting was being conducted on Tuesday alone, which  
is unusual. Typically, the locals vote at their convenience over a 
longer period. UAW members at General Motors Corp. and 
DaimlerChrysler are voting in that manner this week. 
</P>
<P>
	That has led to speculation that the UAW is trying to send a  
message to the No. 2 automaker over the possible spinoff of its 
Visteon Automotive Systems Corp. parts unit. The union opposes a 
spinoff of Visteon, which has about 28,500 UAW members. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike votes come as the union continues separate  
negotiations that began in June with the three automakers. Talks 
are expected to intensify around Labor Day.

<HEADLINE>  Photographers Not Blamed for Diana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's state prosecutor's office said Tuesday it  
found no evidence to prove that chasing photographers were directly 
responsible for the car crash that killed Princess Diana. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor's office said it sent a recommendation to  
investigating Judge Herve Stephan that charges be dismissed against 
the nine photographers and a press motorcyclist implicated in the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation did not establish ``direct cause and effect''  
between the photographers and the loss of control of the vehicle, 
which appears to be the ``decisive cause of the accident,'' the

<HEADLINE>  Photographers Not Blamed for Diana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's state prosecutor's office said Tuesday it  
found no evidence to prove that chasing photographers were directly 
responsible for the car crash that killed Princess Diana. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor's office said it sent a recommendation to  
investigating Judge Herve Stephan that charges be dismissed against 
the nine photographers and a press motorcyclist implicated in the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation did not establish ``direct cause and effect''  
between the photographers and the loss of control of the vehicle, 
which appears to be the ``decisive cause of the accident,'' the 
prosecutor's office said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Presents School Violence Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton introduced three new public  
service announcements Tuesday urging parents to talk with their 
children about violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our children need our help to deal with tough issues like  
violence. Please talk with your kids,'' Clinton says in one of the 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used an event announcing the ads to renew his call for  
new gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	No law can stop every madman with a gun, he said, but sensible  
gun control will save lives and make children safer at school. 
Reducing the ``appalling ease'' with which young people can get 
guns is essential to cutting youth violence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control opponents in Congress and the National Rifle  
Association claim it would be ineffective to require trigger locks 
or to close what the Clinton administration calls ``the gun-show 
loophole'' that allows for no-questions-asked purchases of some 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``No law can stop every disturbed person from committing a  
violent act with a gun, but we would never do anything as a people 
if we gave in to our objections that all of our actions would have 
less than a 100 percent impact,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton presented  
the three frank back-to-school messages in the aftermath of 
shooting sprees in high schools in Colorado and Georgia and copycat 
threats and violence that followed in schools elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also pledged $15 million in Justice  
Department community policing grants to focus on crime and violence 
in or near schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The messages, debuting Wednesday on major broadcast and cable  
television networks, include a toll-free number to call for a free 
booklet on how to talk to children, especially those ages 8 to 12, 
about safety and the dangers of weapons and gang violence. Similar 
radio ads are to air later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads were paid for by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation,  
an independent health care philanthropy based in Menlo Park, 
Calif., and Children Now, an independent advocacy group for 
children in Oakland, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Browns, Fans Impressed With New Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns packed up their equipment,  
boarded buses and went on their shortest trip of the season Tuesday 
-- just up the road to play in their brand new home. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it took them three years to get there.  
</P>
<P>
	The players got to practice in the new Cleveland Browns Stadium  
for the first time on Tuesday, a dress rehearsal for Saturday 
night's exhibition game against the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	As workers continued putting the finishing touches on the  
state-of-the-art, 72,000-seat facility, the Browns took the field 
for their afternoon practice after working out in the morning at 
their training facility in Berea. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful,'' linebacker Chris Spielman said after coming  
off the Browns' home field. ``I can't believe there's this many 
people here for a practice. The turf is great and I can't wait 
until we can get started for real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither can Browns fans.  
</P>
<P>
	A crowd estimated at 25,000 watched the team run through its  
drills for two hours. They roared as the Browns defense jogged 
toward the famed Dawg Pound, Cleveland's rabid bleacher section of 
10,000 which has been replicated and remodeled in the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Corey Fuller and safety Tim McTyer even christened  
the Dawg Pound by diving over the 7-foot-walls into the crowd, 
giving a Cleveland twist to Green Bay's Lambeau Leap. 
</P>
<P>
	The team used the day, dubbed ``Stadium Sneak Preview'' as a dry  
run for Saturday's game, the first NFL game in Cleveland since Dec. 
17, 1995, just before owner Art Modell took his team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Season-ticket holders were invited to the event to check out  
their new seats. Concession areas served hot dogs, burgers and 
beers. Videos were shown on the stadium's two giant scoreboards and 
a high school marching band provided pre-practice entertainment as 
if it were a football Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	For Cleveland fans, Saturday's game will be more than a  
preseason game. It will be a homecoming and the completion of a 
three-year drive to return their beloved Browns to their Lake Erie 
shoreline home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's gorgeous,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said.  
``It's a monument to the city of Cleveland for what they've done, 
how they built the stadium and how they brought their team back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer wanted his team to have a test run in the new stadium  
before Saturday's game. He didn't want opening night to overwhelm 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Browns had not seen the new $283 million stadium,  
built on the same site as the old Cleveland Stadium. Some had 
played in the dingy, dilapidated ballpark, which after being torn 
down was dumped in the lake and is now a reef. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Browns arrived, workers were still affixing the letters  
for the stadium's name on the north side, which as of Tuesday 
afternoon said: CLEV LAND BROWN. 
</P>
<P>
	But once inside, the team and its fans got their first glimpse  
of posh suites, roomy seats -- complete with cup holders -- and 
pristine locker rooms that look like they belong at the local 
country club. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should have heard all the oohs and aahs when the players  
walked in,'' said Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Browns were amazed by the home locker room, an  
11,000-square foot space which is the largest in the NFL and has 
multi-colored mosaic tiles in the showers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're used to a dirty, grungy type atmosphere. It's great in  
there,'' quarterback Ty Detmer said. ``You go in there and there's 
plenty of space for everybody. It's really a great place. You don't 
want to get things dirty.''

<HEADLINE> Iran Hostages Said Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A Spanish hostage held in  
Iran by suspected drug smugglers has called police to say he and 
the other four captives were doing well, a newspaper reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostage first spoke in Spanish and then in English, the  
Entekhab newspaper said, quoting Mohammad Ali Karimi, a security 
official in the central Iranian province of Kerman where the 
kidnapping took place Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper did not give the captive's name.  
</P>
<P>
	The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the kidnappers  
are members of the Baluchi Shah Bakhsh clan. Tribal elders are 
trying to get the five tourists -- three Spaniards, an Italian and 
their Iranian guide -- released, Karimi told IRNA, monitored in 
Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper said the leader of the kidnappers,  
Nazar Shah Bakhsh, was demanding the release of his brother Ghader 
from prison. The paper quoted Kerman security chief Abbas Doagooie 
as saying the brother was arrested when police smashed a drug ring 
in the area Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerman lies on the main route for drug smugglers heading from  
Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran, isolated after its Islamic revolution in 1979, has been  
trying in recent years to promote tourism to boost its faltering 
economy. Hundreds of visitors arrived last week because Iran was 
considered one of the best spots from which to view the last solar 
eclipse of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	According to IRNA, Iranian lawmakers are planning to propose a  
law that would toughen punishment for those who attack foreign 
tourists. The report did not provide any further details.

<HEADLINE> Former Cavs Coach Hired by Turner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Fratello, who was fired as coach of the  
Cleveland Cavaliers in June, signed a multi-year deal to return to 
broadcasting with Turner Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello replaces Doc Rivers, who left Turner to become head  
coach for the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello spent the last six seasons with Cleveland and compiled  
a 248-212 mark before being replaced by Randy Wittman. Fratello led 
the Cavs to the playoffs four times, but had just a 2-12 record in 
the postseason and was unable to advance past the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello was an NBA analyst for NBC from 1990-93 and worked for  
Turner during the playoffs from 1994-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike is a proven commodity as a television broadcaster,'' said  
Turner executive producer Mike Pearl. ``His 13 years of coaching in 
the NBA give Mike a unique insight into the game that is essential 
in an analyst. He is the perfect addition to our NBA broadcast 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello was also head coach of the Atlanta Hawks for seven  
seasons, from 1983-1990, compiling a 324-250 record.

<HEADLINE>  Matthaeus Signs With MetroStars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- German star Lothar Matthaeus signed a one-year  
contract Tuesday to play in the Major League Soccer and will report 
to the New York-New Jersey MetroStars early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus, 38, will reportedly earn approximately $1 million in  
the deal, a combination of his $250,000 salary plus bonus and 
incentives from sponsorship and endorsement deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus, who has played in the most World Cup games (25) and  
is third on the career list with 139 caps, first announced his 
intention to move to the United States and the MLS in June 
following weeks of speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the MLS refused to say anything more than that it had  
discussions with Matthaeus until it received written assurance from 
Matthaeus' German club, Bayern Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very positive development for the league to be able  
to secure the services of such a high-profile player like Lothar 
Matthaeus,'' MLS executive vice president Ivan Gazidis said. 
``Given the budget and the world we live in, it was not the easiest 
job. ... It will raise the awareness of MLS outside the boundaries 
of the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus will be released from Bayern on Jan. 1. The first half  
of the Bundesliga season ends Dec. 18, with the German season 
taking a six-week break before it resumes play Feb. 5. The MLS 
season begins in March.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Soar / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices soared Tuesday, driving yields to  
their lowest point in nearly a month, after a government inflation 
report appeared to reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to hike 
interest rates significantly to cool off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/16 point, or  
$10.62 1/2 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 6.01 percent from 6.08 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a week ago, the 30-year bond yields had moved to 6.27.  
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in  
July, boosted by another rise in energy prices. Excluding food and 
energy, core consumer prices rose a more benign 0.2 percent. Both 
increases matched economists' inflation forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The modest rise in consumer prices eased concerns that had been  
building in the market that Federal Reserve policy makers would 
raise short-term interest rates by a half-point when they meet next 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With inflation remaining dormant, more traders now believe the  
Fed will be content to raise the federal funds target rate by a 
quarter-point to 5.25 percent and leave it there through the end of 
the year. Investors previously were anticipating the Fed to raise 
rates twice more this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders don't like higher interest rates because they make fixed  
rate investments like bonds less attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader secondary market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were up between up 3/32 point and 5/32 point, and 
intermediate maturities ranged from 1/4 point higher to 21/32 point 
higher, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.81 percent with a  
discount of 4.68 percent, down 0.01 percentage point from late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 5.11 percent while the discount was 4.91  
percent, up 0.02 percentage point from late Monday. One-year yields 
were 5.20 percent with a discount of 4.93 percent, down 0.02 
percentage point from Tuesday's Treasury auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.93 3/4 percent from 5.19 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 12/32 point to 113. The average yield 
to maturity was 5.86 percent, down from 5.88 percent.

<HEADLINE> Man Allegedly Preyed on Widows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A convicted rapist who picked his first  
string of victims from a magazine article chose more recent victims 
by looking at newspaper obituaries for women who had just been 
widowed, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements Monday, Douglas County prosecutor Don  
Kleine said physical evidence, witness testimony and testimony from 
three victims of the previous attacks would prove David Burdette 
raped a 34-year-old woman in Bennington. 
</P>
<P>
	Burdette broke into her home last October, gagged her with her  
late husband's tie and raped her in front of her two young 
children, Kleine said. Her husband had died less than a week 
earlier in a motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Burdette, 44, was released from prison last year after serving  
more than 15 years for rape in a series of attacks in 1982. The 
case gained notoriety when officials revealed he had picked his 
victims from an article on Omaha's ``10 Most Eligible Women,'' 
which profiled successful single professional women. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest case, Burdette is charged with first-degree sexual  
assault, robbery and burglary. He also is being tried on charges of 
attempted sexual assault and burglary in a break-in last fall at a 
home in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Burdette faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 25  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening statement Monday, public defender Tim Burns  
argued that officials had no forensic evidence or fingerprints 
linking Burdette to the assault on the Bennington widow. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other break-in, sheriff's deputies were inside the home  
when they say Burdette entered through an unlocked sliding glass 
door. They believed Burdette had been stalking the woman who lived 
there. She also was a recent widow. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Burns said Burdette, who lives in Omaha, was  
trying to burglarize the woman's house and did not intend to 
assault her. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Michael McGill has ruled that three victims in the 1982  
attacks may testify for prosecutors in Burdette's trial, to show 
his pattern of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Burdette was found innocent of an assault on a  
31-year-old Bellevue woman in July 1998. The judge in that case 
said police were overzealous, and the woman's identification of 
Burdette as her attacker was tainted. Prosecutors had said he had 
found her through an ad for a moving sale in a local shopper that 
included her address.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Can Stay Afloat Until Aug. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux doesn't have to close on his  
plan to buy the bankrupt team by the end of the week because the 
Penguins have enough money to stay afloat through the end of 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's line of credit with a French bank runs out Friday,  
but the Penguins can borrow enough money to keep running if 
Lemieux's deal doesn't close by the end of this week, said James 
Walsh, a bankruptcy lawyer representing the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The team could get more money from Societe Generale, the French  
bank that has financed the team since it filed for bankruptcy in 
October, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some loose ends of the financial plan could be tied up Tuesday  
night. The Allegheny Regional Asset District Board was slated to 
vote on whether to earmark sales tax revenue to help the city and 
county pay $16 million in bond debt on the Civic Arena, where the 
Penguins play. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, the Public Auditorium Authority agreed to take  
over debt payments on the Civic Arena owed by the team and the 
arena's landlord, SMG. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Allegheny County Commissioner Bob Cranmer has balked at  
that plan, and his opposition could stall the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is moving in a very positive direction with both  
investors and SMG to bring this deal to completion,'' said Lemieux 
spokesman John Brabender. ``The only concern still ahead is working 
out a new deal with the county that will be to Cranmer's 
satisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon St. Denis, director of the sports advisory group at SG  
Cowen, the French bank's subsidiary, said lending officials were 
aware that the deal might not be finalized by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do whatever is in the best interest to keep the  
franchise in Pittsburgh and maintain the franchise value,'' St. 
Denis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux needs $50 million in outside private investments to  
finance his takeover. A list circulated to prospective investors 
showed $51.4 million in commitments, but listed $5 million coming 
from a party ``to be announced,'' the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Brabender said that money was in escrow with Lemieux's group and  
represents an actual investor. He was not sure why the investor's 
name had not been listed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Rooney, nephew of late Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art  
Rooney, Sr., is a candidate to run the Penguins' business 
operations when Lemieux's deal closes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he recently  
interviewed with Lemieux. His job title with the team would likely 
be chief operating officer. General manager Craig Patrick would 
continue to run the hockey side of the operation. Lemieux's lawyer, 
Chuck Greenberg, declined comment.

<HEADLINE>  Matthaeus Signs With MetroStars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- German star Lothar Matthaeus signed a one-year  
contract Tuesday to play in the Major League Soccer and will report 
to the New York-New Jersey MetroStars early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus, 38, will reportedly earn approximately $1 million in  
the deal, a combination of his $250,000 salary plus bonus and 
incentives from sponsorship and endorsement deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus, who has played in the most World Cup games (25) and  
is third on the career list with 139 caps, first announced his 
intention to move to the United States and the MLS in June 
following weeks of speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the MLS refused to say anything more than that it had  
discussions with Matthaeus until it received written assurance from 
Matthaeus' German club, Bayern Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very positive development for the league to be able  
to secure the services of such a high-profile player like Lothar 
Matthaeus,'' MLS executive vice president Ivan Gazidis said. 
``Given the budget and the world we live in, it was not the easiest 
job. ... It will raise the awareness of MLS outside the boundaries 
of the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus will be released from Bayern on Jan. 1. The first half  
of the Bundesliga season ends Dec. 18, with the German season 
taking a six-week break before it resumes play Feb. 5. The MLS 
season begins in March.

<HEADLINE> Money Dispute Threatens Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Get ready for the greatest event left in golf.  
</P>
<P>
	The prize for winning next month's matches is not a green  
jacket, a claret jug or even something called the Wanamaker. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a cup.  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it looks like any other trophy, only this has some  
history. The cup was donated by a golf enthusiast in the 1920s who 
wanted to encourage competition between the best players on both 
sides of the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	This is about team. About pride. About patriotism. It is a  
chance every two years for a select group of players to represent 
the Stars and Stripes without getting a dime. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one thing to be staring over Rae's Creek at the 12th green  
on Augusta National, trying to protect a one-stroke lead on Sunday. 
The pressure can be just as great standing over a 6-foot putt with 
your teammates -- your country -- counting on you. 
</P>
<P>
	If that sounds enticing, then book a flight to Scotland.  
</P>
<P>
	The Walker Cup begins Sept. 11.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest fear at the start of the season was that money would  
ruin golf, but not many had the Ryder Cup in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget the $134 million purse on the PGA Tour or the $5 million  
World Golf Championship events that supposedly were going to cause 
players to reduce their schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	The number that ruined golf is $63 million, the estimated  
revenue from the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate is whether the players, those ultimately responsible  
for such revenues, should get a portion of the $23 million in 
profits to give to the charity of their choice -- or whether they 
should just shut up and play. 
</P>
<P>
	But without such a shocking figure, there would be no debate at  
all. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were getting $1 million, that wouldn't change too many  
people's thoughts,'' Fred Couples said last week. ``But $63 million 
is a lot of money for a golf event, I can tell you that. I'd like 
to run it for a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before anyone suggests that U.S. players are greedy, keep in  
mind they are independent contractors whose pay is determined by 
their play. The top two players in the world, Tiger Woods and David 
Duval, each have made over $3 million this year -- 179 baseball 
players make at least that much. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the greed, does anyone really think Woods needs to be  
paid for playing in the Ryder Cup. Can anyone find where Duval ever 
said he wanted to be paid? 
</P>
<P>
	This is not about compensation, it's about control.  
</P>
<P>
	The PGA of America pumps $12.5 million into programs to ``grow  
the game of golf.'' Duval only wonders why a small portion can't go 
to a library or a soccer field in his community. 
</P>
<P>
	The precedent comes from the Presidents Cup, which allocated  
$100,000 to each player for them to designate to a charity of their 
choice. If PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem were in charge of the 
PGA of America, there probably would not have been a Tuesday night 
meeting at Medinah -- or a controversy. He specializes in putting 
out fires, and this one is out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Ryder Cup captain Tom Kite saw the first sparks two years  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the PGA after (Valderrama) they'd better do something  
to fix this situation,'' Kite told Golf World magazine. ``I'm 
surprised they didn't. Something has to happen now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Something already has.  
</P>
<P>
	The Ryder Cup is tainted by money.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Sergio Garcia put on such a show in the PGA  
Championship that the controversy was forgotten, but not for long. 
It will be there next week at the NEC Invitational, the $5 million 
event where Ryder Cup players supposedly get rewarded for making 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Americans win back the cup, they will be perceived as  
greedy. If they lose, they will be crucified. No matter the 
outcome, the Ryder Cup will be remembered for the money -- $63 
million this year, who knows how much in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to stop this is for the Americans to start beating  
the pants off Europe like they did for 50 years, when the Ryder Cup 
was about competition and not cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
	That would keep the PGA of America from raising the price tag on  
corporate hospitality, and it would keep the players from raising 
their eyebrows over where all the money is going. The PGA would 
have less to spend on the growth of golf, but the game has managed 
to survive just fine for 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
	With so much focus on money, and a backlash of disgust by the  
American public, some have suggested rooting for Europe next month 
at The Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's another alternative.  
</P>
<P>
	Go Matt Kuchar! You da man, Tom McKnight! Keep that Walker Cup  
in America. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be the most valuable cup left.

<HEADLINE> New Home Construction Rebounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction of new homes and apartments  
rebounded in July, reflecting continued strength in the U.S. 
housing sector despite rising mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that new home  
construction rose 5.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 1.66 million units in July. That was better than analysts had 
been expecting. Housing starts had fallen 5.8 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	New home construction was up in all parts of the country except  
for the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgage rates have been rising since the beginning of the year  
and last week the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage 
soared to 8.15 percent, the highest in more than than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Home Builders reported Monday that  
some builders are concerned that rising interest rates are starting 
to affect buyer demand, which had been robust earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in some markets, the association said that builders also  
continue to voice concerns about shortages of skilled workers and 
materials, especially gypsum wallboard, brick and insulation. The 
shortages are dragging out production schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall increase reflected a 11.3 percent increase in  
apartment construction and a 4.4 percent gain in single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The West led the way in new home construction last month with a  
22.7 percent gain. In the South, new home construction was up 8.5 
percent and in the Northeast 6.3 percent. But in the Midwest new 
home construction was down 16.8 percent last month.

<HEADLINE> Freeman Is NFL's Highest-Paid WR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Antonio Freeman had a payday unlike any other wide receiver.  
</P>
<P>
	Freeman signed a seven-year, $42 million contract with the Green  
Bay Packers on Monday, making him the highest-paid receiver in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman's agent, Joel Segal, told The Associated Press the deal  
also includes a $10 million signing bonus, the largest ever for a 
wide receiver, and second-highest in team history. The Packers gave 
quarterback Brett Favre a $12 million bonus in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was everything I hoped and dreamed,'' Freeman said. ``I'm  
just happy to be a Green Bay Packer for a long, long time to come. 
I love it here, and I always wanted to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract includes two voidable years, meaning the All-Pro  
wideout can opt out of the deal after five seasons. The contract is 
contingent on Freeman playing in 25 percent of the Packers' 
offensive plays in any season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a landmark contract,'' Segal said. ``This is something  
that's never been done before. It breaks the ice for all the other 
receivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, who briefly participated in drills Monday morning, set  
career highs with 84 catches for 14 touchdowns and a league-best 
1,424 yards, despite breaking his jaw late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, the Packers offered Freeman a five-year, $17  
million contract with a signing bonus of just over $3 million. 
Freeman rejected the deal, choosing instead to play for the team's 
tender offer of $1.153 million and become a free agent at season's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a gamble, and it worked out,'' Freeman said.

<P>
	Offensive tackle Ernest Dye was in fair condition at Flagstaff  
Medical Center, where he underwent extensive surgery Monday evening 
following a car accident. Teammates Lester Holmes and Carl Simpson 
also were in the car as they were on their way to a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were attempting to repair a fractured humerus -- the bone  
between the shoulder and the elbow -- and at least one of the 
arteries that supplies blood to his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye's surgeon, Dr. Tim Bonatus said the 28-year-old's arm was  
crushed rather than severely cut, ``leaving the viability of the 
arm in question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next step following surgery occurs during the next 24 hours,  
when doctors attempt to re-establish and maintain blood flow in the 
arm, Bonatus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes was driving Dye's car north on Interstate 17 about 10:15  
a.m. when the car veered into the median and rolled. Simpson and 
Dye were ejected from the vehicle. Only Holmes was wearing a seat 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes was in good condition with a cut on his forehead. Simpson  
was released from the hospital after being checked for pain in his 
left hip.

<P>
	Dimitrius Underwood, a first-round draft pick released last week  
by the Minnesota Vikings after he left them to pursue his faith, 
was claimed off waivers by Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins were awarded the rights to Underwood because no NFL  
team with a worse record last year claimed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood went AWOL after his first practice with the Vikings on  
Aug. 2, leaving his family, his agent and team officials to 
speculate about his motive and whereabouts. Underwood explained his 
absence by saying he was torn between a desire to pursue the 
ministry and the need to support his family.

	Running back Jamal Anderson practiced in pads for the first time  
since ending his two-week contract holdout last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves said he was watching to see if Anderson, the  
NFL's No. 2 rusher last season with 1,846 yards, was ``mentally and 
physically'' ready for a game situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see how it goes, and make a decision later in the week  
whether he goes Saturday (against Baltimore) or if we hold him off 
another week,'' Reeves said.

</P>
<P>
	Rookie Tim Couch will be Cleveland's starting quarterback in  
Saturday's exhibition game against the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ty Detmer is still penciled in as the team's opening  
day-starter, coach Chris Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer has been the starter for the Browns (1-1) in both  
exhibition games so far, while Couch, the top overall draft pick, 
has come in during the second and third quarters. Palmer said he 
wants to see what each can do in different situations. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	While Vinny Testaverde solidified his position as New York's  
starter, the battle for the backup slot intensified when Ray Lucas 
had a poor second half against Green Bay on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Parcells said nine-year veteran Scott Zolak will take  
most of the snaps in the team's home exhibition opener against 
Philadelphia on Friday night. Lucas, a former special teams 
standout converted to full-time quarterback last season, likely 
won't see any action against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh released rookie free agent kicker Matt Davenport to  
make room for fellow rookie Kris Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a second-round draft pick, was 3-of-4 on field-goal  
attempts in the Steelers' 30-23 victory over Chicago on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	New England signed tight end Henry Lusk and linebacker Aaron  
Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Lusk, 27, was originally drafted by the New Orleans Saints in  
the seventh round of the 1996 draft. In 1996, he had 27 catches for 
210 yards, the most receptions by a Saints rookie since wide 
receiver Eric Martin had 35 in 1985. He was released by the 
Redskins in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, 24, had 51 tackles and four tackles for a loss of yardage  
at Louisiana State University. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	Detroit signed free agent linebacker Steve Morrison to replace  
Matt Russell, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in Friday's 
exhibition opener at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison played four seasons with Indianapolis. He has started  
29 games in his pro career, including 12 last season, when he had 
65 tackles and one sack.

day-starter, coach Chris Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer has been the starter for the Browns (1-1) in both  
exhibition games so far, while Couch, the top overall draft pick, 
has come in during the second and third quarters. Palmer said he 
wants to see what each can do in different situations. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	While Vinny Testaverde solidified his position as New York's  
starter, the battle for the backup slot intensified when Ray Lucas 
had a poor second half against Green Bay on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Parcells said nine-year veteran Scott Zolak will take  
most of the snaps in the team's home exhibition opener against 
Philadelphia on Friday night. Lucas, a former special teams 
standout converted to full-time quarterback last season, likely 
won't see any action against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh released rookie free agent kicker Matt Davenport to  
make room for fellow rookie Kris Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a second-round draft pick, was 3-of-4 on field-goal  
attempts in the Steelers' 30-23 victory over Chicago on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	New England signed tight end Henry Lusk and linebacker Aaron  
Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Lusk, 27, was originally drafted by the New Orleans Saints in  
the seventh round of the 1996 draft. In 1996, he had 27 catches for 
210 yards, the most receptions by a Saints rookie since wide 
receiver Eric Martin had 35 in 1985. He was released by the 
Redskins in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, 24, had 51 tackles and four tackles for a loss of yardage  
at Louisiana State University. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	Detroit signed free agent linebacker Steve Morrison to replace  
Matt Russell, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in Friday's 
exhibition opener at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison played four seasons with Indianapolis. He has started  
29 games in his pro career, including 12 last season, when he had 
65 tackles and one sack.

<HEADLINE> Court Declares Law Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The Ohio Supreme Court has invalidated a  
sweeping overhaul of the state's civil justice system that was 
intended to curb frivolous lawsuits and runaway jury verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 4-3 decision Monday, the court said the state law that took  
effect in 1977 violates the constitutional separation of powers 
among the three branches of government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio reforms were some of the most far-reaching that have  
been adopted by states under the banner of so-called tort reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature ``boldly seized the power of  
constitutional adjudication, appropriated the authority to 
establish rules of court and overruled judicial declarations of 
unconstitutionality,'' Justice Alice Robie Resnick wrote for the 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the law called it an opportunity for businesses,  
hospitals and manufacturers to evade their responsibilities to 
provide safe goods and services. They also said huge jury awards 
attract headlines but are so rare that the law wasn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers said the law would lead to lower insurance premiums and  
product costs. Injured Ohioans still would be able to recover the 
costs of medical care, lost wages and other quantifiable damages, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law limited most non-economic damages at $500,000 and  
punitive damages at $250,000 or three times compensatory damages, 
whichever is greater. Punitive damages are designed to punish a 
defendant's misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a terrible law, terribly conceived and should never  
have been passed,'' said William Burga, president of the Ohio 
AFL-CIO. The state AFL-CIO and the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers 
brought the lawsuit that challenged the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Doehrel, president of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, said  
he was ``disappointed and angered'' by the decision and promised to 
make it a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This court has simply said, `We're going to run public policy  
in this state,''' he added. ``That's ridiculous.''

<HEADLINE> Golf Notes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The future of golf is getting younger by the minute.  
</P>
<P>
	On the same day that 19-year-old Sergio Garcia got the cheers  
and 23-year-old Tiger Woods earned his second major championship, 
NCAA champion Grace Park breezed her way onto the LPGA Tour by 
completing an amazing summer on the Futures Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Park, a 20-year-old South Korean who was raised in Phoenix, won  
for the fifth time last week with a record 16-under 200 in the 
Betty Puskar Classic to finish atop the money list with $43,742. 
The top three from the Futures Tour are exempt for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been my goal to be on the LPGA Tour every since I was a  
junior golfer,'' said Park, who played 20 of 25 rounds under par. 
``I feel I have gotten there now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park is a former U.S. amateur champion who has Tiger-like length  
that enables her to overpower courses. In a round of 64 last week, 
she made eagles on two par-5s -- one approach was to 3 feet, and 
another was a fairway metal that kissed off the pin for a tap-in. 
</P>
<P>
	And like Woods, some expect her to take the LPGA Tour by storm.  
</P>
<P>
	She tied for sixth in the Samsung World Championship last year.  
In her last event as an amateur, she tied for eighth in the U.S. 
Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Having already played the Dinah Shore and the Standard Register  
Ping in Arizona this spring, Park has only two sponsor's exemptions 
left this year. 
</P>
<P>
	She will make her pro debut on the LPGA Tour on Sept. 4 in the  
State Farm Rail Classic, followed by the Safeco Classic two weeks 
after that. Park also will team with Jim Carter, who also played at 
Arizona State, in the JCPenney Mixed Team Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Woods and Kelli Kuehne, Park decided not to sign with a  
management agency or go after endorsement deals until after her 
tour card was secure. That process may accelerate now, although 
family adviser Kerry Graham says she is in no hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``She doesn't want the pressure of feeling like she has been  
paid a lot before she earns it,'' Graham said. ``But if some 
opportunity presents itself, she will consider them. She's staying 
focused on the fact she wants to be a great golfer. All the other 
amenities will come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Lovander and Audra Burks finished second and third on  
the money list and also are exempt for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MONEY AND SCHEDULES:* The top two players in the world appear  
to be right on schedule when it comes to playing the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	One concern over the three World Golf Championship events worth  
$5 million and big increase in purses was that players would make 
more money and spend less time playing. That doesn't appear to be 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods already has played 16 times through the PGA  
Championship, the same amount as 1998. He is expected to play as 
many as six more tournaments this year -- not including the Ryder 
Cup -- which actually would give him two more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval has played 17 tournament, also the same number  
compared to this time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The only change is the money. Both are over $3 million, while no  
one else has more than $2 million. With three $5 million events 
left, it's conceivable that one of them could top $5 million by the 
end of the year -- almost as much as Jack Nicklaus made in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RYDER RIVAL:* The ideal match for Sunday's singles in the Ryder  
Cup would be Sergio Garcia against Tiger Woods, but perhaps a more 
fitting match would involve Tom Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, it was Lehman who invited the 16-year-old Garcia onto  
the 18th green at Royal Lytham and St. Annes after the 1996 British 
Open, handed him the claret jug and said, ``You're going to hold 
this someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You just can't help but love him,'' Lehman said. ``He's been  
saying for the last three months, 'I want to play you in the Ryder 
Cup.' And I'll say back to him, 'Well, I've been pretty tough on 
Spaniards in the Ryder Cup, so you better watch out, buddy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Lehman gunned down Seve Ballesteros at Oak Hill in 1995  
and then whipped Ignacio Garrido at Valderrama two years later. 
Neither match got past the 15th hole. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FLOM FLEECED:* The Women's British Open was the best tournament  
for Cindy Flom in more than four years -- and perhaps her most 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Her clubs were stolen out of her rental car on Tuesday and Flom  
had to borrow a set of rentals from the Woburn Golf and Country 
Club for the first round. A replacement arrived that afternoon, but 
Flom decided to stick with the rentals. 
</P>
<P>
	She wound up with rounds of 71-74-69-71 for a tie for third, her  
best finish since she was the Ping Welch's Championship runner-up 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Tiger Woods' victory in the PGA Championship ended  
three straight weeks of tournaments won by Nike Tour alumni. The 
Buick Open, won by Tom Pernice, was the 13th PGA Tour event won by 
a Nike grad, tying the record set last year. ... The Salesmanship 
Club of Dallas, which puts on the Nelson Classic, raised $5.9 
million for charity, tops among all PGA Tour events. Proceeds go to 
at-risk youth programs in the area. ... Paul Stankowski missed his 
first PGA Championship since 1994 but was home in Dallas for a 
greater prize -- he and wife Regina had their first child (Joshua). 
... Sophie Gustafson recorded the second double-eagle on the LPGA 
Tour this year, a 3-iron from 217 yards on the par-5 sixth hole in 
the British Open. The other albatross also came overseas -- Alison 
Nicholas in the Australian Ladies Masters. ... MacGregor Golf, 
which got a huge lift when Jose Maria Olazabal won the Masters, is 
moving to a 60,000-square-foot building in Albany, Ga., for 
manufacturing and testing. It also is moving corporate headquarters 
to Atlanta from Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* After only 11 tournaments as a pro, Sergio  
Garcia is No. 31 in the world rankings. Tiger Woods was No. 33 
after his first nine tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD:* ``Generation X is looking like Generation Selfish  
to me.'' -- Lanny Wadkins, the 1995 Ryder Cup captain, on the flap 
over Ryder Cup revenue.

<HEADLINE> Md. Task Force Called Inquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Maryland task force studying religious cults  
on college campuses is violating constitutional rights and 
conducting a ``religious inquisition,'' according to a lawsuit 
filed by Seventh-day Adventists and Unification Church members. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Monday, alleges that the state General Assembly  
has ``determined that it is both unnecessary and harmful for 
students to think for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, which include the International Coalition for  
Religious Freedom, funded primarily by Rev. Sun Myung Moon's 
Unification Church, claim the Task Force to Study the Effects of 
Cult Activities on Public Senior Higher Education Institutions is 
violating the establishment and free-exercise clauses of the First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government cannot, absolutely cannot, get involved in  
adjudicating what's a right religion and what's a wrong religion,'' 
said Kendrick Moxon, a Los Angeles civil rights attorney 
representing the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks an injunction against the task force, as well as  
a declaration that the inquiry is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	William Wood, chairman of the task force, denied that it  
targeted religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force was created last year in response to the Heavens  
Gate mass suicide in California, several cult-motivated murders and 
a subway-gassing incident in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``College students are particularly vulnerable to cult  
recruitment because they are often grappling with becoming 
independent, overwhelmed with new responsibilities and 
relationships, adjusting to new environments and anxious about 
their futures,'' according to the resolution.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Martin Linked to Leases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Three cars leased by Miami Dolphins receiver Tony  
Martin for a longtime friend are among more than $1.3 million of 
unaccounted wealth the friend amassed over a four-year period, an 
IRS agent testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS special agent Ron Wise listed the cars among nearly three  
dozen big-ticket acquisitions Rickey Brownlee made between his 
November 1993 release from prison and his January 1998 arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise classified Martin as a ``nominee owner'' in the deals,  
saying he was used as a way to help conceal Brownlee's wealth. At 
the time, Brownlee was reporting to his probation officer an income 
of some $1,800 a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have to earn about $26,000 a month to maintain that  
level of spending,'' Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is being tried alongside Brownlee, who served seven years  
in prison for two 1980s drug convictions, in a case largely 
focusing on Brownlee's alleged narcotics activities from 1995-97. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday, with the defense  
scheduled to begin calling witnesses Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Michael K. Moore was asked to dismiss the  
five money laundering counts against Martin, as attorney Howard 
Srebnick argued prosecutors hadn't proven their case. Moore 
rejected three of the motions and said he wanted to review case law 
before ruling on the other two. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, is accused of leasing three cars in his name on  
behalf of Brownlee, who paid him back with cash. Martin also is 
accused of writing a $100,000 check to Brownlee's first lawyer in 
exchange for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether Martin, who has known Brownlee since  
childhood and calls him his uncle, knew he was accepting drug 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee, known on the streets as ``the Mayor of Opa-locka,'' is  
charged with five counts of possessing heroin or cocaine with the 
intent to distribute, and one count of conspiracy to possess and 
distribute. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise took jurors through a timeline of purchases traced to  
Brownlee. Because there is no record of Brownlee's income, he said, 
a spending analysis became the best method for determining wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	``No company ever filed a W-2 form on Rickey Brownlee during  
that time period,'' Wise testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Brownlee's transactions were eight real estate purchases,  
including a $101,000 down payment on a house in suburban Davie that 
measured some 25,000 square feet. He also acquired an Opa-locka 
convenience store and a nearby building that was converted into a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Raben, Brownlee's attorney, questioned Wise's accounting  
methods by noting that while listing the restaurant and convenience 
store among Brownlee's acquisitions, the proceeds from the 
businesses were omitted. 
</P>
<P>
	If Wise had included some $1 million in restaurant proceeds and  
another $500,000 from the convenience store, Raben argued, it would 
account for the unexplained wealth. He offered dozens of payroll 
checks with Brownlee's signature to show Brownlee was running the 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise said he didn't analyze the business records because they  
were licensed in the name of one of Brownlee's associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Srebnick questioned Wise's inference that a $29,000 cash payment  
made by Martin on a 1996 Mercedes 500 SL convertible in May 1996 
was dirty. He introduced records showing Martin kept $20,000 from a 
check he deposited in March 1996, then cashed a $9,000 check two 
weeks later.

<HEADLINE> Jurors See Video of Woman's Daughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Jurors were riveted Tuesday by a videotape  
deposition of a paralyzed woman, taken just before the removal of 
life support, in which she said her mother didn't mean to shoot her 
when she opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it was an accident,'' 42-year-old Georgette Smith  
said in the videotape. ``I know it was. She can't see that good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Egan clasped a wrinkled hand over her mouth and looked  
down in horror Tuesday as the videotape of her daughter was played. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Egan opened fire March 8 after hearing her  
daughter and Ms. Smith's boyfriend talking about putting her in a 
nursing home. Ms. Smith was shot in the neck and paralyzed from the 
neck down, left barely able to speak and incapable of swallowing or 
controlling her bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital-bed deposition of Ms. Smith was taken in May, one  
day before she was taken off life support at her request and died. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition, Ms. Smith struggled to pronounce each word,  
but her message was clear. She didn't think her mother had intended 
to shoot her. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 20-minute deposition, a nurse wiped foam from Ms.  
Smith's mouth and a noise from her respirator was audible. Jurors 
watched riveted and glanced at Ms. Egan when Ms. Smith said she 
loved her 68-year-old mother, who sat with her hand over her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love her dearly,'' Ms. Smith said on the tape. ``She is the  
best friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan was charged with two counts of attempted murder, for  
wounding her daughter and shooting at the boyfriend, Larry 
Videlock, who was not hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both sides rested their cases Tuesday. Closing  
arguments were scheduled for Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan's attorney has argued she was on medication that made  
her ``angry, crazy and irrational'' and didn't intend to kill her 
daughter and Videlock.

<HEADLINE> Games Pitched Record Set by Oriole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jesse Orosco set a major league record Tuesday  
night by pitching in his 1,072nd game, breaking a tie with Dennis 
Eckersley atop the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco, 42, received a standing ovation from the crowd of 40,485  
at Camden Yards as he stepped to the mound with two outs in the 
seventh inning of the Baltimore Orioles' game against the Minnesota 
Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Before facing Todd Walker, he waved his cap to the appreciative  
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a little bit better having it happen at our own  
ballpark,'' he said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, a left-handed batter and the only hitter Orosco faced,  
popped a lazy flyball to center. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco waved his cap to the crowd upon leaving the mound and  
greeted his family in the front row of the box seats. He was then 
presented the baseball by center fielder Brady Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Orosco signed with the Twins in 1978 after being  
selected in the second round of the amateur draft. The left-hander 
made his first appearance in the majors the following season with 
the New York Mets and played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland 
and Milwaukee before being signed by the Orioles as a free agent in 
April 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco has appeared in 47 games this season, all in relief. He  
hasn't started a game since 1982, for the Mets. Over the past 
several seasons he has been used primarily against left-handed 
batters and usually lasts no more than an inning. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't detract from a feat that represents more than  
two decades of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty remarkable record, that's for sure,'' Orioles  
manager Ray Miller said. ``It's something to be proud of, 
especially when you think of how many times he warmed up and didn't 
even get into the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this season, Orosco broke Kent Tekulve's record of  
pitching in 1,050 games in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely proud of both records,'' Orosco said. ``The  
first one meant a lot to me because I'm a reliever. But it's a real 
nice milestone, being the guy with the most games pitched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he took a 6.29 ERA into Tuesday's game, Orosco has  
retired 21 of the last 24 batters he faced over 15 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	His contract runs though next season, and on opening day he will  
become one of a handful of players whose career spanned parts of 
four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until somebody says, `Jess, it's time to hang up the cleats,'  
I'll keep pitching,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Assign Orie To minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Florida Marlins infielder Kevin Orie, on the  
disabled list since July 1, was sent Triple-A Calgary on an injury 
rehabilitation assignment today. 
</P>
<P>
	Orie, 26, sprained his left wrist on Aug. 3 while he was with  
Calgary on a previous rehab assignment. Orie, hitting .266 with 
five homers and 25 RBIs, was sidelined by partial tear of his left 
quadriceps before he hurt his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Orie's career has been plagued by injuries since he was selected  
by the Chicago Cubs in the 1993 amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent four months on the disabled list in 1994 with a  
cartilage tear of his right wrist. He was on the DL for three weeks 
in 1996 with a separated right shoulder, and in 1997 Orie was on 
the DL for a month with right shoulder inflammation.

<HEADLINE> French Banking Deadlock Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- With little hope for a quick settlement, French  
banking officials met Tuesday to try to break a takeover deadlock 
between hostile bidder Banque Nationale de Paris and its unwilling 
target, Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting, led by Bank of France chairman Jean-Claude Trichet,  
ended without a decision. The officials said in a statement they 
would meet again next week and issue a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Three possible scenarios were on the table:  
</P>
<P>
	--BNP, which has a one-third stake in Societe Generale, would be  
allowed to keep its shares and proceed with plans to create the 
world's largest bank in a three-way merger that would also include 
the French bank Paribas 
</P>
<P>
	--BNP would be forced to give up its Societe Generale shares or  
</P>
<P>
	--The big banks would be ordered to the negotiating table.  
</P>
<P>
	BNP had hoped to take over both Paribas and Societe Generale to  
create the world's largest bank with assets of more than $1 
trillion. But it gained only a third of Societe Generale's shares 
and 31.5 percent of its voting rights in a tender offer that ended 
on Friday. BNP did win a clear majority stake in Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said there were no easy answers to the situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``A quick solution is looking less and less likely,'' said  
Elisabeth Grandin, a banking analyst at Standard and Poor's in 
Paris. ``The authorities will have trouble forcing the banks 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale Chairman Daniel Bouton said in an interview  
with RTL radio he will continue to resist BNP's unwelcome 
overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	But if regulators side with Societe Generale, they could face  
criticism for having left France's banking system on the sidelines 
of a worldwide wave of consolidation. Siding with BNP also creates 
problems -- officials could be seen as imposing a solution that 
shareholders didn't clearly choose. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing BNP to retain its stake could also pave the way for a  
lengthy stock market fight. 
</P>
<P>
	French authorities, including Finance Minister Dominique  
Strauss-Kahn, were said to favor BNP's three-way plan because it 
would discourage a takeover by a foreign bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, market players were speculating that BNP might make a  
sweetened offer to Societe Generale's reluctant shareholders, or, 
alternatively, that Societe Generale might line up a white knight, 
or a more acceptable suitor, to ward off BNP. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to its BNP's $37 billion hostile bid in March, Societe  
Generale and Paribas were heading smoothly toward a merger of their 
own. The takeover battle is the latest example of the rush among 
European businesses to cut merger deals as they try to become more 
competitive in the global market. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale is the largest private-sector bank in France,  
with assets of about $412 billion. BNP is No. 2 at about $349 
billion. Paribas has assets of about $284 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP chairman Michel Pebereau, who argues BNP's stake in Societe  
Generale gives it effective control of the bank, suggested he and 
Bouton should ``sit calmly around a table'' to iron out their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale's board said late Tuesday it backed Bouton.

<HEADLINE> Gore Project Overstated Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the cost savings claimed by Vice  
President Al Gore's project to streamline government were 
overstated, and other cuts in expenses can't be substantiated, 
according to auditors who looked at changes in three agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's ``reinventing government'' project claimed $21.8 billion  
in savings it lacked evidence to support, inflated savings by 
double-counting cost cuts and took credit for savings that may have 
been the result of other efforts to cut government bureaucracy, the 
General Accounting Office report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Project officials also neglected to take into account expenses  
that offset some of the savings, said the GAO, Congress' auditing 
and investigative arm. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials disputed the GAO findings and said offsets  
to the savings were accounted for. They acknowledged that savings 
were overstated by several hundred million dollars but said the 
reinventing project is on track to save an estimated $137 billion 
and characterized the GAO's findings as ``an arcane debate about 
accounting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What really matters is that government is smaller than it's  
been since the Kennedy administration, and it operates better, more 
efficiently and is saving taxpayers money,'' said Linda Ricci, 
spokeswoman at the White House Office of Management and Budget, 
which calculated the savings estimates for Gore's project. 
</P>
<P>
	A House Republican who requested the report seized on its  
findings to criticize Gore, the front-running Democratic 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform  
Committee, said the report released Monday shows that Gore 
``greatly exaggerated the success of his National Partnership for 
Reinventing Government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like they were reinventing accounting rules,'' Burton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore launched the reinventing project in 1993, promising to make  
government ``work better and cost less'' by reducing bureaucracy, 
cutting contracting costs and relying more on technology. Project 
officials claim $107 billion in savings and say they have ``locked 
into place'' another $29.6 billion in savings. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO looked at almost $30 billion in claimed savings from  
reinvention initiatives at NASA and the departments of Agriculture 
and Energy. They found several problems: 
</P>
<P>
	--OMB did not keep records supporting $21.8 billion in claimed  
savings. Ricci said OMB did not save worksheets from the 
calculations, some of which were done six years ago. But she said 
that OMB budget specialists could reconstruct how they calculated 
the savings. 
</P>
<P>
	--OMB double-counted estimated savings in at least two instances,  
thereby inflating cost cuts. Ricci disputed GAO's findings and said 
OMB analysts inadvertently double-counted in only one case, leading 
to an overstatement of about $770 million in savings. She said that 
was more than offset by another counting error in which OMB 
underestimated about $2 billion in savings. 
</P>
<P>
	--The project claimed savings that ``could not be fully  
attributed to its efforts'' and actually resulted from separate 
efforts, said GAO. For example, Gore's project took full credit for 
savings at Energy Department weapons laboratories that would have 
occurred anyway because of the end of the Cold War, GAO noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricci said that NPR's estimate of $137 billion in savings will  
pan out. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I won't predict down to the dollar,'' Ricci said, ``we  
will be comfortably within that range.''

<HEADLINE>  Matthaeus Signs With MetroStars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lothar Matthaeus, one of the Germany's  
best-known players, signed a one-year contract to play in the Major 
League Soccer and will report to the New York-New Jersey MetroStars 
early next year, an MLS source said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was to be announced later Tuesday on the league's  
weekly telephone news conference with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Matthaeus will earn approximately $1 million in  
the deal, a combination of his $250,000 salary plus bonus and 
incentives from sponsorship and endorsement deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus, who has played in the most World Cup games (25) and  
is third all-time with 139 caps, first announced his intention to 
move to the United States and MLS in June. That followed weeks of 
speculation. However, MLS refused to say anything more than it had 
discussions with Matthaeus until it had received written assurance 
from Matthaeus' German club Bayern Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	The MLS source said the league had received documents  
guaranteeing MLS that Bayern will release Matthaeus after the 
club's final game of the first half of the Bundesliga season on 
Dec. 18 against Werder Bremen. The German season takes a six-week 
break and then resumes on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The MLS season begins in March.

<HEADLINE>  Fortner To Coach Indianapolis WNBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Nell Fortner, coach of the U.S. women's  
basketball team, was hired Tuesday to coach the new Indianapolis 
WNBA franchise, starting in its second season. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Purdue coach will miss the team's first season next  
summer because of the Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'll definitely have my eyeball on it and my hand on the  
telephone,'' she said at a news conference at Market Square Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	An interim coach will guide the still-unnamed team through its  
inaugural season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Fortner, an assistant coach for the U.S. women's  
team in 1995-96, came to Purdue in 1996-97 and led the Boilermakers 
to a 17-11 record and a share of the Big Ten championship. She was 
the conference coach of the year but left the Boilermakers after 
just one season to become the coach of the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, she has compiled a 54-12 record in international  
competition and won the 1998 world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortner, a Jackson, Miss., native and 1982 graduate of the  
University of Texas, spent eight years as an assistant at Stephen 
F. Austin and Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love college ball,'' she said. ``But I think this is the  
perfect time for me to step into the WNBA, to go from coaching the 
national team, the pros at that level, and then to continue on with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``As young girls grow up and continue to grow and believe  
they're going to be in the WNBA, our product will get better. So I 
think this is where I belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis joins Miami, Portland and Seattle as the new WNBA  
franchises, boosting the league to 16 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Each new franchise is conditional, however -- it must sell at  
least 5,500 season tickets by Oct. 15. The Indianapolis team has 
sold about 3,000 season tickets so far.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Demands Apology From Bennett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Bob Bennett should apologize for  
using a race-specific scenario to describe what he believes it 
would take to prevent George W. Bush from winning the Republican 
presidential nomination, Utah's NAACP leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, R-Utah, said during an Aug. 13 meeting with the  
editorial board of the Standard-Examiner of Ogden that Bush seems 
to have a lock on the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless George W. steps in front of a bus or some woman comes  
forward, let's say some black woman comes forward with an 
illegitimate child that he fathered within the last 18 months, or 
some other scenario that you could be equally creative in thinking 
of, George W. Bush will be the nominee,'' Bennett told the 
newspaper. 
</P>

	NAACP Salt Lake branch President Jeanetta Williams said Bennett  
``owes the community and the nation a public apology.'' But she 
said she didn't think he should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Lewis Jr., president of the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People's tri-state conference for Idaho, 
Nevada and Utah, said Bennett ``felt very comfortable in his 
whiteness'' to make the remark. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued by his office, Bennett said he ``certainly  
regrets'' making the comment. ``Those who heard his remark 
firsthand, including the publisher of the Ogden Standard-Examiner, 
have said that they interpreted no racial overtones,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said he plans to meet with NAACP representatives to  
``express these sentiments personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ogden newspaper's publisher, W. Scott Trundle, was out of  
the office Monday and unavailable. Don Porter, editorial page 
editor, said he had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks make up less than 1 percent of voters in Utah. Lewis  
called on Bennett to consider the needs of all his constituents, 
``not just the white population.''

<HEADLINE> NY Board Wants Gun-Toting Judge Gone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge who once carried a gun into court  
should be removed for making slurs about Italians and lying under 
oath, the state's judicial misconduct board ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission on Judicial Conduct ruled Monday against Onondaga  
County Judge J. Kevin Mulroy, who said he will appeal to the State 
Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said Mulroy, 47, lied as a character witness in  
the forgery and larceny trial of a lawyer, who was acquitted. He 
was also punished for telling a prosecutor of Italian descent at a 
1996 charity dinner: ``You know how you Italian types are with your 
Mafia connections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after becoming a judge in 1987, Mulroy carried a 9mm  
semiautomatic gun under his robe during the trial of William Blake. 
Blake was convicted of killing a sheriff's deputy and wounding 
another during an escape attempt and Mulroy said he carried the 
weapon after receiving death threats. 
</P>
<P>
	At Blake's sentencing, Mulroy told the defendant that ``about  
six bucks of electricity would solve the problem'' and chastised 
then-Gov. Mario Cuomo for his opposition to the death penalty. His 
comments prompted an investigation by the judicial commission, 
which reprimanded him in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Mulroy described a rape victim as ``the kind that work  
'em into a frenzy, and then cut 'em off and watch 'em squirm.''

<HEADLINE> Skeleton in Pennsylvania Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISON CITY, Pa. (AP) -- The wife and stepdaughter of a man  
whose skeletal remains were found earlier this month buried in the 
basement of their home years after they moved away have been 
arrested and charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Sloan, 52, of New Brighton and Bonnie Marie Neely, 33,  
of Altoona are charged in Westmoreland County with the death of 
Willis Casteel, 62. Casteel was stabbed and shot with a shotgun, 
Penn Township police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Neely allegedly confessed to police, saying that in late  
1983, her mother handed her a knife, saying, ``It's time,'' the 
Beaver County Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sloan and Ms. Neely lived in the house for nine more months,  
then moved on. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob and Linda Galet bought the home in 1986. They found the  
skeleton Aug. 9 while digging in the earthen basement of their home 
in preparation for pouring a concrete slab. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Galet's shovel hit something hard, and they uncovered bones  
and boot tips. The Galets contacted officials, who unearthed an 
entire skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
	No motive for the killing had been determined.  
</P>
<P>
	The women were arraigned Monday and then jailed at the  
Westmoreland County Detention Center without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Aug. 24.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Holmes Out At Least 10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee Titans defensive end Kenny  
Holmes will be out at least 10 days after undergoing arthroscopic 
surgery Tuesday to repair a flap of cartilage in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes had played in the Titans' 22-20 exhibition loss Sunday  
night to Kansas City after missing a few practices with the sore 
knee. The knee stiffened Monday, and coach Jeff Fisher said they 
decided to fix the problem now rather than wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those situations that probably would settle down  
and go three, four weeks without a problem and then have some more 
discomfort. We just wanted to get it behind us,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Steve McNair sat out both practices Tuesday, and  
Fisher said he will hold McNair out of Friday's game at Arizona if 
his stiff back doesn't ease up in the next couple days. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher would prefer that McNair play after he started the opener  
off by being flagged for intentional grounding out of the end zone 
and then being intercepted for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played pretty well (after the mistakes), but he still needs  
to play. He needs to work on his timing with the receivers, 
especially the receivers,'' Fisher said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed in Volatile Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With no surprises in the latest inflation data,  
the dollar turned in a mixed performance in volatile trading 
Tuesday, gaining against the euro but losing ground to the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0509, down  
from $1.0575 late Monday. The dollar also was quoted at 114.05 
Japanese yen, down from 114.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign exchange analysts said a seesaw session for the dollar  
began early in the day, when Japanese traders sold large amounts of 
euros for yen. The selloff weakened the euro against the dollar, 
but strengthened the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro fell apart against everything,'' said Kevin Harris,  
an international economist at MCM Currencywatch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar regained some ground against the yen later in the day  
after the Labor Department released its consumer price data, which 
indicated that inflation remained in check. The Consumer Price 
Index, a closely watched gauge of inflation, rose 0.3 percent in 
July, matching analysts' expectations and raising hopes that the 
Fed will take a moderate course in setting interest rates when it 
meets Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders are expecting the Fed, which already nudged up rates on  
June 30, would raise rates modestly next week. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been worries that fresh signs of inflation would lead  
to a third rate increase later this year. Tuesday's figures reduced 
those jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. stock and bond markets both moved higher on the benign  
inflation news, setting the stage for the dollar to gain back some 
of the ground it lost earlier to the yen. But it was not enough for 
a broad gain for the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5228 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5154, and 1.4786 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4835. The British 
pound rose to $1.6044 from $1.6013.

<HEADLINE> UPS Takes Earnings Hit Over Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service is taking a $1.44 billion  
hit on second-quarter earnings in a possible move to stop a huge 
disputed tax bill from ballooning further with interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced it would set the money aside on Monday, a  
week after a federal judge ruled the Atlanta-based shipping giant 
was illegally using offshore companies as tax shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	If the company pays off the bill, it could still appeal to the  
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta or negotiate a 
settlement, meaning possible refunds from the Internal Revenue 
Service. If it doesn't pay the bill, the IRS could continue to 
charge interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Norman Black said no decision on payment of  
the taxes or possible appeals has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still reviewing this, but in the meantime, we have to  
recognize that there was an adverse court ruling in this case,'' 
Black said. ``As a result, we have to set aside this money to 
prudently manage the interest of existing shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS issued a notice of tax deficiency in 1995 for the tax  
years 1983 and 1984, which totals $67 million in taxes plus 
penalties and interest. UPS has continued the practice, and could 
owe $259 million for 1985 through 1990 -- IRS is seeking taxes for 
those years as well -- and potentially millions more for years after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge was listed on a required quarterly filing to the  
Securities and Exchange Commission, and includes a tax assessment 
charge of $1.78 billion that includes $230 million in securities 
already set aside. Another $344 million was included as income from 
tax refunds from interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The restated earnings change the second-quarter net income of  
$588 million to a net loss of $854 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge will not affect the company's revenue of $6.56  
billion and operating profit of $1 billion. It also won't affect a 
planned initial public offering later this year, UPS said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS also said it will re-examine the way it provides extra  
insurance for packages. The company covers up to $100 in value, and 
customers must buy extra coverage for packages worth more. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, UPS created a subsidiary in Bermuda that was later  
called Overseas Partners Ltd., which was subsequently spun off but 
remains owned by UPS employee-shareholders. Its purpose was to 
provide reinsurance -- a way of spreading risk -- for UPS packages 
insured for over $100, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	That arrangement was found to be an illegal offshore tax shelter  
by Tax Court Judge Robert P. Ruwe, who ruled on Aug. 9 that UPS was 
``motivated by the reduction of federal income tax'' in what the 
judge called a ``sham transaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said UPS is examining ways to create a new subsidiary or  
work with an existing one to handle the insurance and avoid tax 
discrepancies.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Dye in Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals offensive lineman Ernest Dye  
was in critical condition today following extensive surgery to 
repair his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye, 28, was injured Monday in a single-car rollover accident  
while traveling to the Cardinals' camp in Flagstaff with defensive 
end Carl Simpson and guard Lester Holmes for a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye suffered a fractured humerus - the bone between the shoulder  
and the elbow - and damaged at least one of the arteries that 
supplies blood to the hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons at Flagstaff Medical Center spent Monday afternoon and  
much of Monday night working to save Dye's arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye was originally listed in fair condition. The change to  
critical condition is standard procedure for someone recovering 
from such extensive surgery, Cardinals spokesman Greg Gladysiewski 
said today. ``His life is not in danger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened about 25 miles south of Flagstaff on a  
rain-slicked section of Interstate 17. Holmes was driving Dye's 
black 1995 Mercedes when it veered into the median and rolled. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye and Simpson were thrown from the car. Holmes was the only  
one wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes severely cut his forehead in the accident. He remained at  
Flagstaff Medical Center this morning in good condition. Simpson 
was checked for pain in the hip and released Monday.

<HEADLINE> Sears Dumps Softer Side in New Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After taking a beating from both discount and  
specialty retailers, Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s is shelving its 
``softer side'' and battling back with a harder pitch as the 
nation's largest department store chain looks to revive flagging 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based company on Tuesday unveiled a  
much-awaited, more value-focused advertising tag: ``The Good Life 
At A Great Price. Guaranteed. Sears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we like it or not, we're in a price-game war, a value  
shootout with all our competition,'' said Mark A. Cohen, Sears' 
executive vice president of marketing. ``With the Softer Side 
campaign, the customer feedback has been 'We love the commercials, 
imagery and models, but we don't find those goods at Sears.' 
</P>
<P>
	``But we are far more competitive than customers give us credit  
for,'' he said. ``The fact is, shame on us, we've been avoiding 
shouting about price, shouting about our quality guarantees and the 
products we offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Sears forced its two advertising agencies into  
unprecedented cooperation to come up with the new tagline and to 
develop 40 television commercials set to debut in September that 
emphasize Sears as a place to shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sears sells across the country an enormous amount of products  
that are components of a customer's lifestyle. We sell four out of 
10 kitchen and laundry appliances. We sell an enormous number of 
tools, and Sears has been clothing families for 100 years,'' Cohen 
said. ``Now we're saying Sears is the place you have to go to make 
all of these products pay off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign is the final piece in a series of changes the  
retailer announced early this year, including a move toward more 
trendy clothing, remodeling its stores and selling merchandise on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears would not reveal the cost of the new campaign, which also  
will involve print and radio advertising, but the effort clearly is 
aimed at reviving the fortunes for a company that appears to have 
lost its way recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have said Sears chairman Arthur Martinez's rescue of the  
company from the brink of bankruptcy in 1992 only delayed the 
inevitable as middle-priced stores such as Sears, J.C. Penney and 
Montgomery Ward are squeezed from both ends, by higher priced 
competitors such as Macy's and Bloomingdales and discount and 
specialty shops such as Wal-Mart, the Gap and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
	But analyst Kurt Barnard, president of the consulting firm  
Barnard's Retail Trend Report, warned against counting Sears out 
just yet, calling its new campaign ``extremely effective.'' The ads 
will highlight nice-looking clothes and other merchandise, while 
stressing to much sought-after younger shoppers that they can 
attain the ``good life'' at reasonable prices from Sears, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is intended very clearly to challenge everyone, namely the  
conventional department stores as well as the discount stores,'' 
Barnard said. ``The tagline is a worthy replacement of the Softer 
Side tagline, which worked so well but which has lost its edge to 
overexposure. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that Sears needs now to do is to make its stores live up  
to the expectations the tagline raises,'' he said. ``In other 
words, they need to have a store where people walk in and say 'Hey, 
this is my store, they know me and buy merchandise for me.' ''

<HEADLINE> Travelers' Blood Donations Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Americans who traveled frequently to  
Britain during that country's mad cow disease crisis are being 
banned from donating blood back home -- a restriction that will cut 
the U.S. blood supply during a critical time of shortage but one 
the government deems a necessary precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday imposed the ban on  
blood donations by anyone who has traveled to, or lived in, Britain 
for a total of six months since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The average tourist who spent just a few weeks in Britain can  
still donate blood -- but people who went to Britain repeatedly 
between 1980 and 1997, the crisis years, will have to add up their 
trips to see if they're under the six-month limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada issued a similar restriction Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The donor ban is strictly a precaution -- there is no evidence  
that any mad cow-type illness has been spread through blood 
transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mad cow disease that swept through Britain's cattle has  
been linked to a human brain-destroying illness, and both illnesses 
are so mysterious that scientists simply can't rule out the 
possibility they could infect blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the FDA's donor ban is controversial. It is sure to  
frighten Americans whose blood is refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, the American Red Cross estimates the ban will cut U.S.  
blood donations by 2.2 percent at a critical time. Even before 
Tuesday's action, experts were predicting severe, nationwide blood 
shortages to hit as early as next year because blood donations 
already were falling. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 200,000 to 250,000 blood donors could be turned away  
by the new ban, said James MacPherson of America's Blood Centers, 
which represents blood banks that provide half the nation's supply. 
Because people in the Northeast and large cities travel more than 
people from other parts of the country, areas such as New York 
could be hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly do not intend by this to scare people,'' said  
Mary Elizabeth Jacobs, the FDA scientist who coordinated the 
policy's development. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA plans to work with blood banks to find ways to ease the  
donor loss, but MacPherson said the government also needs to help 
blood banks explain the issue to the confused or frightened donors 
they turn away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an extremely difficult issue for people to  
understand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is an infection that kills by literally eating holes in  
brain tissue. In cattle, it's called mad cow disease, and it swept 
through British herds starting in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in 1 million people around the world gets a similar  
brain disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. Although 
CJD sometimes is hereditary, usually its cause is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	The worry about blood stems from Britain's discovery in the  
mid-1990s that some people apparently caught a new strain of CJD by 
eating beef infected with mad cow disease. Named ``new variant 
CJD,'' it has killed 41 Britons. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known mad cow disease in U.S. cattle. The United  
States has not allowed importation of British beef for over a 
decade and no American is known to have caught new variant CJD. 
</P>
<P>
	But because these brain diseases can incubate for years without  
causing symptoms, some scientists say the possibility exists that 
they'll one day discover a link between blood transfusions and 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Much is not known about the new human disease, including exactly  
how Britons were sickened. Theoretically, even a brief visit to 
Britain could have exposed someone to new variant CJD. But the FDA 
settled on the six-month limit to reduce the possible risk without 
slashing the U.S. blood supply; banning donors who spent less time 
in Britain would have had a far greater impact. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban covers travel to or residence in England, Scotland,  
Wales, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.

<HEADLINE> Cook May Start for Redskins at DE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- Defensive end was a position of transition  
and confusion at the Washington Redskins training camp on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenard Lang acted as if he had lost his starting spot even  
though coaches said it wasn't so, and Kelvin Kinney, a starter from 
last year, was cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Cook, signed as a free agent in March, took the  
first-team snaps ahead of the Lang in the morning and afternoon 
practices. Lang has been a starter from the first game of 1997, his 
rookie season, except for five games when he had a serious ear 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lord works in mysterious ways,'' said Lang, clearly  
puzzled by his apparent demotion as he walked off the field. ``It's 
time to step up. It's my third year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cook and defensive coordinator Mike Nolan gave a different  
spin on the switch, indicating the job has been put up for grabs 
because Cook is having a good training camp. Cook also had a sack 
in Friday night's exhibition victory at New England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cook's a good player, so is Kenard,'' Nolan said. ``We just  
wanted to give the both the chance to compete for the position. 
It's not like Kenard's been sitting-on-the-job type thing, he's 
been doing what he's supposed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, head coach Norv Turner weighed in with a different  
verdict: Nothing's changed at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenard Lang's our starter; Anthony Cook's a good football  
player,'' Turner said. ``Kenard Lang is having a good camp, but 
there's times where we're going to alternate our defensive linemen 
and the opportunity was there today to give Anthony some work with 
the first group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins began training camp as the only NFL team with four  
first-round draft picks on the first-team defensive line. Marco 
Coleman, Dana Stubblefield, Dan Wilkinson and Lang looked to be the 
team's strongest unit, and Lang looked solid during the first two 
weeks of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lang, despite getting seven sacks last year, still has the  
occasional problem of playing too high when trying to fend off a 
block instead of going low to get leverage. It's a common 
concentration mistake that leaves many defensive ends shoved aside 
by 300-pound offensive tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still learning,'' Lang said. ``A lot of times you're tired  
and you've got to tell yourself to stay low, but fatigue sets in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cook just missed being a first-rounder. Chosen No. 35 overall by  
the Oilers in 1995, he had four injury plagued seasons in Houston 
and Tennessee. The Redskins originally signed him to play right 
end, but they later added Coleman to fill that spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether I'm starting, it don't matter to me,'' Cook said. ``I  
want to contribute. What's important to me is when I'm on the 
field, I do what I'm supposed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins cut Kinney, who started 12 games at right end last  
season after Rich Owens injured a knee. 
</P>
<P>
	A sixth-round pick in 1996, Kinney never developed any kind of  
forceful presence on the line. He became expendable when Cook and 
Coleman were signed and would have been released anyway on cutdown 
day, but the Redskins decided to let him go early after he missed 
the last three days of practice to deal with a personal matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't fit in with our plans,'' player personnel director  
Vinny Cerrato said. ``When you want to raise the level of 
expectations and set high standards, you jump on board or you 
don't.''

<HEADLINE> Fla To Alter Congresional Districts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida officials have agreed to alter  
the shape of several congressional districts in a plan critics say 
could dilute the voting power of minorities in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, approved by lawyers for Gov. Jeb Bush, still must be  
approved by a panel of three federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would change the boundaries of seats now held by two  
black Democrats -- Alcee Hastings and Carrie Meek -- and a Hispanic 
Republican, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, along with five neighboring 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was devised to settle a lawsuit filed last year by a  
white candidate, Tom Fouts, who lost a bid for a state Senate seat 
held by a black incumbent. Under the terms of the settlement, Fouts 
dropped any challenge over state districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings' existing district ties together black neighborhoods in  
seven counties in southern Florida, yielding a black voting 
constituency of 44 percent. The proposed settlement, to be filed 
today in Miami, would reduce that number to nearly 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings' attorney, Terry Anderson, said Monday night he was  
still reviewing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, Alcee could probably win any district they could  
carve up at this stage,'' Anderson said. ``His concern is that he 
leave behind a district in which African-Americans have a fair 
opportunity to win a seat in Congress. ... My preliminary reaction 
is that this doesn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings' district was one of three designed to give black  
voters a better opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice 
when it was drawn by a panel of federal judges in 1992. That year, 
Florida elected its first blacks to Congress since Reconstruction: 
Corrine Brown, Meek and Hastings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Supreme Court has since ruled that race cannot be  
the predominant factor in drawing political boundaries. That has 
forced changes in congressional and legislative districts across 
the country.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Proposes To Ban Gun Show Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gun and ammunition sales on Los Angeles  
County property would be banned under a proposed ordinance backed 
by a majority of the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
	Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky asked the county legal counsel on  
Tuesday to draft a report on legal questions involving such a ban, 
and report back within one week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The county should not be leasing its property, and should not  
be permitting its property to be used for the sale of guns and 
ammunition,'' Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Gloria Molina also favor  
such a ban, which would affect four gun shows held each year at 
Fairplex in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban and another anti-gun measure proposed by Yaroslavsky  
Tuesday are prompted by the killing of a postal worker and the 
wounding of five people last week at the North Valley Jewish 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, state officials placed a moratorium on  
scheduling new gun shows at all state fairgrounds. The shows 
already scheduled at the 54 state fairgrounds throughout California 
will still be held. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state Department of Food and Agriculture advised the  
fairgrounds not to schedule any new events as legislators attempt 
to tighten regulations on gun expos.

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign Veteran RB Vaughn Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts on Tuesday  
signed running back Vaughn Hebron, a member of Denver's Super Bowl 
championship teams the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-8, 192-pound Hebron was signed after a morning  
workout and was returning kicks during afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every team prides itself on bringing a player in that's been a  
part of a winning organization and hopefully it becomes a kind of 
fever,'' said Hebron, originally signed as a free agent in April 
1993 by Philadelphia and waived by the Eagles prior to the start of 
the 1996 season. Seven days later, the Broncos signed the former 
Virginia Tech star as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	In six seasons Hebron has played in 79 games with seven starts.  
He has averaged 24.1 yards on 158 kickoff returns and 4.2 yards per 
carry. He also has 41 receptions for 303 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been there. I know what it takes, so from that standpoint  
you know if a team is doing everything it needs to be done to get 
to that (championship) level. At the same time, I can recognize 
when it is not,'' said Hebron, who was cut by Denver after last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebron was the Broncos' backup to Terrell Davis, the NFL's MVP  
last season. He had only 58 carries for 253 yards the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kick returns, that's where I made my niche in,'' Hebron said.  
``Whatever you ask of me, I'm that man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Mora said the Colts felt they needed another back  
because Darick Holmes is expected to be out for at least six weeks 
with a fracture near his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in the league six years. He's been a real good  
kickoff return guy, and a running back,'' Mora said of Hebron. ``He 
can catch the ball out of the backfield, so we decided to sign 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mora said he might use the team's newest member to return kicks  
in Saturday's exhibition game at New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> CNNfn Executive Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The executive vice president of CNNfn was  
dismissed and asked to leave the network's Manhattan headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The ouster Monday of David Bohrman came more than two months  
after the departure of Lou Dobbs as CNNfn chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans were announced last month to give CNN 3 1/2 hours of new  
financial and business news programming, to be simulcast on CNNfn 
and use some of CNNfn's staff. The programs were to be under the 
control of Jeff Gralnick, executive vice president of financial 
news at CNN, and not Bohrman, who objected to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were unable to reach a decision with David concerning the  
scope of his responsibilities as they would relate to the new 
business news programming,'' said Steve Korn, vice chairman and 
chief operating officer of CNN News Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bohrman and Gralnick reported to Dobbs, who had overseen  
financial news coverage for all of CNN's news networks and 
engineered the launch of CNNfn. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that while both executives  
were hired by Dobbs, it was Bohrman, not Gralnick, who was seen as 
closer to him. But Korn insisted this had nothing to do with the 
decision to dismiss Bohrman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	While CNN reaches 76 million homes, CNNfn reaches just 12  
million homes, a fraction of the 68 million homes that can receive 
its financial-news rival, CNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs left to start an Internet venture. His position as  
president of CNNfn remains unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Named as Bohrman's replacement was Teya Ryan, a 10-year CNN  
veteran who most recently served as executive producer of the 
weekly prime-time magazine show ``Newsstand: CNN &AMP; Fortune.''

<HEADLINE> Victim's Wife Sues Day Trading Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The widow of a man murdered by Mark O. Barton  
during his shooting spree last month at two day-trading firms has 
filed the first lawsuit stemming from the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulshan Harjee, wife of victim Dean Delawalla, sued the All-Tech  
Investment Group, Barton's estate, the owners of the building where 
All-Tech's Atlanta office is located and the building's security 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Delawalla, 52, an All-Tech customer, was trading at the office  
when Barton opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other allegations, the suit filed Friday claims All-Tech  
negligently failed to supervise Barton and to protect him from 
large financial losses that may have prompted the shootings. The 
``murderous acts ... were reasonably foreseeable'' by company 
officials, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, a former chemist who reportedly lost as much as $450,000  
while trading at All-Tech and Momentum Securities in the last year, 
killed nine people and wounded 13 others at the two companies' 
Atlanta offices on July 29. Hours later, he committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the attacks, Barton also killed his wife and two  
children, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Weinstock, Ms. Harjee's attorney, said All-Tech had a  
responsibility to check the backgrounds of its day traders and 
should have discovered that Barton was a ``volatile individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're creating a pressure environment that, in this case,  
with the pressure environment on top of a volatile individual ... 
it basically exacerbates a dangerous circumstance,'' Weinstock said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Lerner, an attorney for Montvale, N.J.-based All-Tech, did  
not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also said Barton Protective Services, which is not  
related to Mark Barton, failed to provide adequate security in 
All-Tech's office building. It also seeks compensation from 
Barton's estate and the building's owner.

<HEADLINE> Military Depots Living On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMBERSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- As commander of the Letterkenny Army  
Depot, Col. Henry W. Suchting III knows that every time there's a 
threat of more layoffs the installation's union representatives 
will call their congressional contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Suchting, commanders of the military's maintenance and  
repair depots from Virginia to Hawaii look the other way -- or 
quietly encourage those contacts with the powerful House group that 
works to keep the depots open. 
</P>
<P>
	The 77 lawmakers call themselves the Depot Caucus, and their  
mission is to fight the Pentagon's drive to let more private 
contractors maintain and overhaul the nation's weapons of war. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 18 major depots and shipyards -- and numerous smaller  
maintenance and repair operations -- have suffered increased layoffs 
and shuttered buildings as the Pentagon tries to save billions of 
dollars to serve a much smaller military. 
</P>
<P>
	The caucus members stick together in classic  
protect-your-district politics, standing guard to ensure depots 
keep their gates open. The Pentagon cannot close any major military 
facilities without congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The group includes members of defense and appropriations  
committees that control spending and military policy, and they can 
exercise great influence over their colleagues on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware of it,'' Suchting said of the union-Depot Caucus  
contacts, pointing out that depot commanders are obligated to make 
their points with the military chain of command. ``Far be it for me 
to try to stop it. It's rather benign with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department spends about $13 billion a year to store,  
repair and modernize its equipment. Most of that work was done at 
the depots in years past; now $6 billion of that money goes to 
private industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure would be higher, but the Depot Caucus lawmakers  
pushed through legislation that requires the Defense Department to 
keep at least 50 percent of maintenance work within the military. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Pentagon could get rid of unneeded facilities, ``We could  
take that money for weapons modernization and quality of life 
issues like family housing,'' said Randall Yim, the Defense 
Department's deputy undersecretary for installations. ``We don't 
need massive warehouses anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The depots still perform valuable functions, and some have  
proven they can do work cheaper than private industry. 
</P>
<P>
	At Letterkenny, in south central Pennsylvania, the cavernous  
maintenance building where civilian workers once overhauled tanks 
now sits mostly idle. Although the depot still uses 
state-of-the-art equipment for missile repair, its work force has 
dropped to 1,320 from 6,200 at its peak in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like a ghost town now,'' said Tom Cohenour, who  
supervises mechanics at Letterkenny. ``There were three shifts 
here. It's sad, really sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letterkenny and the Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, Texas,  
have suffered some of the largest losses since the last base 
closings in 1995. Defense Department figures show Letterkenny is 
operating at 73 percent of its capacity; Red River is at only 37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force logistics center in Ogden, Utah, is at 53 percent.  
In the Navy, the Portsmouth, N.H., shipyard is operating at 52 
percent capacity; the shipyard at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, at 56 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Caucus members protecting the depots argue that it is unwise to  
shut facilities that are essential in wartime. A private business 
can be hit with a strike or have financial problems that could harm 
the nation in time of crisis, these lawmakers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The caucus boasts several influential members, including Rep.  
Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee, who holds sway over road and 
transportation projects in every member's district, and Rep. Tillie 
Fowler, R-Fla., a member of the House Republican leadership and the 
Armed Services Committee.	   Few want to tangle with them. Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., said 
he was threatened with losing a place on a key House-Senate 
conference committee when he opposed the group in a 1997 
legislative battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say they use no-holds-barred tactics verging on being  
ruthless,'' Everett said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Fowler said the caucus doesn't bully opponents, and is  
simply trying to educate colleagues on the importance of the 
depots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry that in five years, 10 years, they'll get rid of the  
depots. We learned that in these battles, we better be prepared,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also are prominent in the depot-saving effort.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who serves on the Appropriations  
defense and military construction subcommittees, is a caucus 
member. And Rep. Solomon Ortiz of Texas, ranking Democrat on the 
Armed Services readiness subcommittee, is co-chairman of the 
caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz said the group has contacts throughout depots so it can be  
alerted to any efforts to cut work. ``We are like the CIA,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials say they're not trying to starve the depots  
by sending more work to the private sector, but rather are trying 
to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall policy is to outsource to the extent allowed by  
law, where it could make sense,'' said Robert Mason, the Pentagon's 
assistant deputy secretary who specializes in depot issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterkenny, a 57-year-old installation, was built to service a  
much larger military. Until recently, a huge chunk of its business, 
in partnership with a private contractor, was converting old tanks 
into modern, self-propelled howitzers called the Paladin. 
</P>
<P>
	Suchting, the commander, isn't willing to stand by and watch his  
facility crumble. He pursues work -- even from nonmilitary sources -- 
in a manner that would have been unthinkable for an Army officer 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He researches whether private companies would pay to use his  
facility's huge tank painting sheds, chrome-plating equipment, or 
his air conditioning repairmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranae Coheley, 46, a program analyst at the Army depot in  
Anniston, Ala., said the Depot Caucus is fighting for the system 
that ``supported me my entire lifetime.'' Her father worked there 
for nearly 40 years, her crane-operator husband has been there for 
27 and she has put in 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just hope the depot will stay open until we have enough  
years to retire,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the caucus has a say, it might.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's life or death as they see it,'' said former Rep. Vic  
Fazio, D-Calif., who went against the caucus in 1997 to save jobs 
in his Sacramento district. ``Their dedication probably increases 
as they get closer and closer to the grim reaper.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Network Cuts Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Nashville Network is canceling some  
country music-oriented programing, including the talk-variety 
format that has been its prime-time flagship for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at the cable network on Monday confirmed reports that  
``Prime Time Country with Gary Chapman'' would stop production in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Three entertainment magazine shows that focus on country singers  
are also being canceled: ``Crook &AMP; Chase,'' ``Crook &AMP; Chase 
Tonight'' and ``This Week in Country Music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network is developing series and specials to broaden its  
audience, said TNN spokeswoman Cheryl Daly. The new shows will be 
announced in September and debut in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Country music fans are not one-dimensional, and they want TNN  
to offer a wide variety of programs to address their interests,'' 
Ms. Daly said. ``It's like MTV, which started with music videos, 
then added sports and lifestyle shows.''

<HEADLINE> Cop Says Wrong Man Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Disgraced police Officer Justin Volpe has given  
authorities a written account of his assault on a Haitian immigrant 
that claims jurors convicted the wrong officer as his accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
	In excerpts of the statement published Monday in the New York  
Post, Volpe, who pleaded guilty to sodomizing Abner Louima with a 
broken broom handle in a Brooklyn police station bathroom, says 
Officer Thomas Wiese -- and not Officer Charles Schwarz -- acted as a 
lookout during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury convicted Schwarz in June after prosecutors  
identified him as one of the two officers Louima claimed were in 
the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz and Volpe are in federal custody awaiting sentencing.  
They face maximum sentences of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In a May 25 plea with the jury absent, Volpe claimed that  
another officer was present while he sodomized a handcuffed Louima 
with a stick, but at that time he did not identify which officer it 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, his attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, said that Volpe said the  
second officer was not Schwarz. But not until recently has Volpe 
given a detailed statement to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz's attorney, Ronald Fischetti, on Monday said he would  
appeal the case and hinted he would use Volpe's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, in his statement, describes flying into a rage because he  
believed -- mistakenly -- that Louima had punched him during a brawl 
outside a Brooklyn nightclub in the summer of 1997. He says that 
after making a weapon by breaking a broomstick in half, he spotted 
Wiese holding a handcuffed Louima and pulled the prisoner away from 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wiese followed me into the bathroom, stood by the door,''  
Volpe wrote in the statement. ``He saw what was going on and did 
nothing to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kornberg confirmed that Volpe had written the statement, but he  
refused to provide a copy. The statement was not filed in Brooklyn 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Kornberg claims the same information was offered to the  
government during the trial, when Volpe decided to admit his guilt 
and try to clear Schwarz by identifying Wiese as the second 
officer. Prosecutors, saying Volpe had no credibility, rejected his 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury instead relied on Louima's testimony that the second  
officer in the attack was the same one who drove him to the police 
station; records show the driver was Schwarz. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government didn't want to hear the truth, so the jury  
didn't hear the truth,'' Volpe's lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Wiese's attorney, Joseph Tacopina, maintains his client is  
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiese and Officer Thomas Bruder were acquitted by the same jury  
that convicted Schwarz. They had been accused of beating Louima in 
a patrol car before the bathroom attack.

<HEADLINE> Boston Bruins Let Khristich Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In an unprecedented move, the Boston Bruins  
decided to let forward Dmitri Khristich become a free agent on 
Tuesday rather than pay the $2.8 million that an arbitrator set as 
his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly disagree with the arbitrator's assessment that  
Dmitri is a $2.8 million player,'' Bruins general manager Harry 
Sinden said. ``We had a player almost triple his salary in two 
years. It just didn't add up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``walkaway'' rights were negotiated into the collective  
bargaining agreement that ended the 1994-95 lockout. It gives a 
team the right to reject a limited number of arbitration decisions 
and make the player a free agent instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins retain the right to match for any contract Khristich  
signs that is less than 80 percent of the $2.8 million arbitration 
award, or $2,240,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was put in to handle what people refer to as a runaway  
decision, like a runaway judge,'' Sinden said. ``In case that 
happens, you had to have some way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the four arbitration seasons since then, no team had  
chosen to let a player go without compensation, according to NHL 
spokesman Frank Brown. The Bruins tried to trade Khristich during 
the 72 hours allotted for a decision but found no one willing to 
take on the $2.8 million salary, either. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Sinden, who had been active in negotiations during the  
lockout and a vocal opponent of rising player salaries, to make the 
ground-breaking move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have that in mind, I can tell you that,'' he said.  
``The way teams conduct their business is none of my business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khristich made $1 million in 1997-98 before winning a $1.95  
million arbitration award last season, when he scored 29 goals and 
had 41 assists. In a nine-year NHL career, the 30-year-old left 
wing from Kiev, Ukraine, has scored 225 goals with 282 assists for 
a total of 507 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release announcing their decision, the Bruins noted  
that Khristich's production tailed off from 18 goals in the first 
half of last season to 11 in the second half. Sinden had also been 
critical of his performance in the playoffs, when he had three 
goals and four assists in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinden said the team offered Khristich a contract at last year's  
salary of $1.95 million, but he asked the arbitrator for $3.5 
million. Khristich's agent, Larry Kelly, did not immediately return 
a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinden left open a slim possibility that Khristich would return  
to the Bruins for a lower salary. Otherwise, the team is prepared 
to enter the season with the forwards it has; the Bruins signed 
Dave Andreychuk as a free agent earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may not get all the way there with Andreychuk,'' he said.  
``But we feel like we've got plenty of forwards. We feel in a 
position to replace Dmitri on the team so the team doesn't get 
hurt.''

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros right fielder Derek Bell was  
placed on the team's 15-day disabled list Tuesday, a day after 
straining his left groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell was hitting .244 with 11 homers and 61 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	Astros manager Larry Dierker shuffled his starting outfield  
Tuesday night, moving center fielder Carl Everett to right field. 
Glen Barker started in center field and Lance Berkman went to left. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll give Barker a couple of games and hit him in the two  
spot and see if we can get some energy at the spot,'' Dierker said. 
``We know he can play defense and run the bases. We need to find 
out if he can get on base.''

<P>
	Barker, the Astros' fastest runner, has played in 60 games and  
is hitting .333 with six RBIs and 13 steals.

	Dell Profits Rise 47 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. posted a 47 percent  
increase in second-quarter profit today, beating Wall Street 
expectations with strong sales of computers to small businesses, 
home users and over the Internet. Dell, the largest seller of 
computer directly to customers, said it earned $507 million, or 19 
cents per share, in the quarter that ended July 30. That was up 
from a profit of $346 million, or 12 cents a share in the same 
period last year. Revenues rose 42 percent to $6.14 billion from 
$4.33 billion. Dell stock closed down 5/16 at 41 1/8.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- ETrade Group Inc. plans to offer after-hours  
trading through Instinet, bringing the Internet's second biggest 
pool of investors to the busiest market for buying and selling 
stocks when regular exchanges are closed. The service, set to begin 
next month, would make ETrade the biggest online broker so far to 
let its customers react to late-breaking news, a privilege long 
enjoyed by money managers, mutual funds and other ``institutional'' 
investors. ETrade shares finished up 3 3/8 at 30 1/4.

	Consumer Price Report Favorable  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices edged up just 0.3 percent in  
July despite big increases for energy and airline fares. At the 
same time, construction of new homes staged a solid rebound and the 
nation's factories boosted production at the fastest pace this 
year. All three government reports, released today, provided fresh 
evidence that the U.S. economy continues to power ahead without 
triggering worrisome inflation pressures. The mild 0.3 percent gain 
came after two straight months of flat prices.

	Retailers' Earnings Top Estimates  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Retailers reported better-than-expected earnings  
today as the robust U.S. economy continued to encourage Americans 
to shop. Strong sales at its Target discount stores boosted 
second-quarter profits at Dayton Hudson Corp. by 33 percent from a 
year ago. Profit at J.C. Penney Co. Inc. rose 14 percent, boosted 
by demand for its private-label clothes. The Limited Inc.'s 
earnings doubled from a year ago, amid strength in its Express, 
Lerner New York, Lane Bryant and Intimate Brands Inc. chains. Home 
Depot's profits also rose sharply, while Tiffany &AMP; Co.'s earnings 
gained as shoppers snapped up luxury items.

	AT&AMP;T-MediaOne Merger Protested

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer groups are asking federal regulators  
to block AT&AMP;T's bid to buy MediaOne, saying the cable merger would 
give the company too much control in the markets for cable TV and 
high-speed cable Internet services. The groups joined today in 
opposing the deal on grounds that it violates existing antitrust 
laws and federal rules that restrict the number of cable customers 
a single company can control. With such a large percentage of the 
market, AT&AMP;T could block new companies from getting into the cable 
business. AT&AMP;T stock gained 11/16 to 49 3/4.

tasks. Compaq Computer Corp. unveiled a new type of powerful 
computer today that uses less expensive Intel chips and runs on 
Microsoft Windows operating software. The machine ties together 
eight microprocessors to match the performance of the higher-priced 
computers. Dell Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM are

	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. displayed its latest attempt to  
carve a new niche out of the highly profitable light-truck segment 
today: a combination sport utility vehicle and pickup called the 
Explorer Sport Trac. The Sport Trac combines the front end and cab 
of a four-door, five-passenger Explorer SUV with a 4-foot cargo 
bed. The idea is to provide the room and comfort of an SUV with the 
cargo utility of a pickup. Other automakers plan to follow in the 
search for the next hit product in the increasingly crowded U.S. 
truck market. Shares in Ford ended up 5/8 at 49 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell slightly against the yen today as  
many market participants stayed sidelined ahead of the release of 
U.S. consumer price data. Tokyo stocks rose slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.60 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
0.24 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and below its level late Monday 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 34.06 points, or 0.19  
percent, to close at 17,860.09. On Monday, the average finished up 
390.86 points, or 2.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were waiting for the release on today of the U.S.  
consumer price index, a key measure of inflation, for an indication 
of the dollar's prospects. Benign inflation numbers could stoke 
U.S. markets and boost the dollar, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 120.66 yen, down  
from 121.58 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei rose for the seventh straight  
session as investors bought select international blue chip shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blue chip stocks continue to lead the market, and we may see  
further polarization of stronger and weaker shares,'' said Ken 
Yamano, general manager of the equities section at Taiheiyo 
Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was subdued as market players waited for the U.S. price  
data for clues on the direction of U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 5.63 points, or 0.38 percent, to 1,474.14. The 
TOPIX closed up 26.02 points, or 1.80 percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 386.80  
million shares, nearly unchanged from 378.65 million shares Monday. 
Declines outnumbered advances 732 to 448, while 134 issues were 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond yield fell to 1.9150 percent from its close Monday of 1.9250 
percent, driving its price up to 99.02 yen from 98.94 yen Monday.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Reviews Papers About Diana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is re-examining U.S. intelligence  
documents containing references to the late Princess Diana at the 
request of Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of her boyfriend Dodi 
Fayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday an initial review  
of the documents last May yielded no information useful to the 
investigation of the Paris car accident that killed Diana and Fayed 
in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mohamed Al Fayed's request, Robert Tyrer, the chief of staff  
to Defense Secretary William Cohen, agreed to review the papers 
again, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not anticipate that a re-review of the documents will  
reach a different conclusion than we've already reached, which is 
there is nothing in these documents that relates in any way to 
information explaining the circumstances of the death of Princess 
Diana,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon declined to discuss the nature of the documents except to  
say they number ``several dozen'' and were generated ``in ordinary 
operations.'' He said, for example, that they may include reports 
from American embassies on the public reception received by Diana 
and Prince Charles on trips abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, the U.S. government acknowledged that  
intelligence documents compiled by the National Security Agency 
over many years include mention of Diana on 1,056 pages. They said 
the references were incidental and that she was never a target of 
U.S. intelligence operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that NSA agents picked up mentions of Diana in  
international electronic monitoring was disclosed when the agency 
denied an Internet news service's Freedom of Information Act 
request for any intercepts mentioning her, but acknowledged in the 
process that such intercepts exist. 
</P>
<P>
	The NSA, which monitors electronic communications abroad and  
protects U.S. communications from foreign intercepts, is under the 
control of the secretary of defense.

<HEADLINE> Bush Circle of Advisers Diverse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- When Republican presidential front-runner  
George W. Bush needs advice these days, he turns to a circle of 
political professionals, policy wonks and fellow politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have been with him from the start. Others have come aboard  
within the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mixing public, private and academic experience, they generally  
are more conservative than the team assembled by Bush's father, 
analysts say. But being the son of a former president certainly 
helps recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Bush, it's not difficult to pull together a group because,  
of course, he's been around Republican and conservative 
intellectual circles for a long time,'' said Norman Ornstein, a 
senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he wants to make a statement that his presidency will  
be a little bit more like Ronald Reagan's than George Bush's -- that 
he's more conservative,'' Ornstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	 *The Pros    	
</P>
<P>
	Closest to Bush are a trio of advisers who have worked together  
since Bush's first gubernatorial campaign in 1994: strategist Karl 
Rove, spokeswoman Karen Hughes and campaign manager Joe Allbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Rove, a friend of George Bush's 1988 campaign manager, Lee  
Atwater, is a longtime political consultant and a major reason the 
GOP dominates Texas elections right now. 
</P>
<P>
	After going for more than 100 years without electing a Texas  
governor, Republicans today hold all 29 statewide elected offices. 
Many of the campaigns were masterminded by Rove. 
</P>
<P>
	He orchestrated the highly visible pilgrimages that national  
Republican figures made to Austin this year, as Bush was staying 
home to consider running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bush asked him to sell the consulting company he founded  
two decades ago to concentrate on helping him win the White House, 
Rove did. ``He's been my friend for 25 years,'' Rove explained. 
``I'd want to be able to put my heart and soul into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hughes is another member of the so-called Iron Triangle,  
although she says she's in the dark about the origin of the 
nickname the news media hung on Bush's closest advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Fort Worth television reporter, Ms. Hughes moved from  
covering politics to playing the game. Texas press coordinator for 
Reagan-Bush in 1984, she later became executive director of the 
Texas GOP and joined Bush in the early months of the 1994 race. 
She's spoken for him ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Allbaugh is a big presence in the campaign's day-to-day  
workings. An Oklahoma native and campaign veteran, Allbaugh quickly 
earned a reputation among staffers in Bush's first campaign as the 
guy who said ``no'' to spending requests. He served as Bush's 
executive assistant -- with an office only steps away from the 
governor's -- until the Texas Legislature ended its 1999 session. 
</P>
<P>
	The three helped Bush oust popular Democratic Gov. Ann Richards  
in 1994 and get nearly 70 percent of the vote in his 1998 
re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good campaign teams are the ones that emerge in the heat  
of battle. They did that in 1994. I have a lot of respect for 
them,'' said Chuck McDonald, spokesman for Richards' last campaign. 
``They are very good at getting on their message and staying on 
their message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *The Policy Wonks    	
</P>
<P>
	In many ways Bush's policy team, now numbering more than 100  
conservative thinkers, can trace its creation to a small April 1998 
gathering at the Palo Alto, Calif., home of former Secretary of 
State George Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
	Shultz assembled fellows from Stanford University's Hoover  
Institution to meet with Bush. Those who attended say they came 
away impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We covered the landscape, from foreign policy and national  
security to tax policy and Social Security reform,'' says Bush 
adviser John Cogan, an economist and senior fellow at the 
institution. ``What amazed me and surprised me was how often the 
governor would ask a series of follow-up questions, probing into 
your idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is leaning heavily on the Hoover think tank. Shultz, a  
Hoover distinguished fellow, was on Bush's presidential exploratory 
committee. Cogan and Hoover fellows Martin Anderson and Michael 
Boskin are giving economics and tax advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Stanford provost and Hoover fellow Condoleeza Rice, a  
national security adviser to President Bush, heads a foreign policy 
and defense team that includes Dick Cheney, a former White House 
chief of staff and defense secretary, and Paul Wolfowitz, a former 
ambassador to Indonesia and President Bush's undersecretary of 
defense for policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the economic team is Lawrence Lindsey, a former Federal  
Reserve governor and American Enterprise Institute scholar who says 
he had planned to stay nonaligned in this year's presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew most of the other Republican candidates. I had never  
met Governor Bush,'' Lindsey said. But after a meeting set up by Al 
Hubbard, a Harvard Business School classmate of Bush and former 
aide to Dan Quayle, Lindsey signed on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say most of the people (advising Bush) are  
conservative, but most have served in or near government and in 
that sense have a pragmatic sense of what's possible,'' Lindsey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you're looking at tax policy or national security or  
education or you name the field, he has managed to draw in the best 
people in the country who agree with him philosophically,'' 
Anderson says. 
</P>
<P>
	 *The Pols    	
</P>
<P>
	Advice with a twist comes from Bush's fellow politicians --  
including several Republican governors and Indianapolis Mayor 
Stephen Goldsmith, an advocate of privatization and leader of 
Bush's domestic policy team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a set of principles he's used as governor of Texas, and  
he applies those to whatever we're discussing,'' Goldsmith said. 
``He's sometimes the teacher and sometimes the student. He can take 
over these meetings and interrogate the experts. He has lots of 
questions, and he doesn't let people off the hook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush insiders point to three governors -- John Engler of  
Michigan, Marc Racicot of Montana and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania -- 
as having Bush's ear. 
</P>
<P>
	All three trace their ``family ties'' to the elder Bush's  
campaigns, all have worked with the younger Bush as state chief 
executives, and all describe Bush as appreciative of those who can 
get things done in a political arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows they're seared by experience to be responsive to  
people. Their judgment is rounded out by practical exposure, not 
just theoretical analysis,'' Racicot said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a governor, you bring a certain mindset to this job that's  
a little different from the mindset at the national level,'' Ridge 
said. ``Having been in Congress -- and I say this with all respect -- 
most of the time members of the House and Senate aren't really 
concerned about how a program will work back in the states.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Reasserts Internet Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission,  
claiming authority to regulate providers of high-speed Internet 
access, is raising questions about how cable companies that offer 
such services should be classified. 
</P>
<P>
	In a long-awaited friend-of-the-court brief in AT&AMP;T's case  
against Portland, Ore., the FCC argued Monday that local officials 
could create ``regulatory disparity'' by exercising authority over 
cable companies offering Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland area cable officials required AT&AMP;T, which took over the  
nation's No. 2 cable TV company, Tele-Communications Inc. earlier 
this year, to open its lines to rival Internet competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge upheld the decision. The case is currently  
before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has repeatedly opposed local and municipal officials  
coming up with their own regulatory policy. In its brief, the 
commission justified this position by saying that it alone has 
authority over all providers of high-speed Internet service -- also 
known as broadband. Cable, phone, satellite and wireless companies 
are all racing to build these high-speed connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials do not have regulatory authority over service  
providers other than cable systems, the commission maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Local regulation of cable Internet services ``might pose a  
significant risk of regulatory disparity with respect to all other 
broadband service providers,'' the FCC lawyers wrote in their 
brief. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also left open the question of whether cable  
companies providing Internet service should be treated as cable 
providers or whether they are more properly classified as 
``telecommunications'' or ``information'' services. The FCC said 
both parties might have jumped the gun by presuming that cable 
companies offering Internet services fall under the category of 
cable providers and should therefore be regulated as such. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission has noted the existence of a serious dispute  
concerning the proper classification of cable modem service, 
although it has not yet resolved the issue,'' the FCC wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	So-called broadband access over cable lines provides connection  
speeds dozens of times faster than today's telephone modems. Some 
Internet providers and consumer groups fear that cable companies 
will develop a monopoly in delivering high-speed services, unless 
they are required to share their wires with competitors.

<HEADLINE> FBI Investigates LAPD Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have launched an  
investigation into the shotgun killing of two unarmed robbery 
suspects by members of the police department's controversial 
Special Investigation Section. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael J. Gennaco called for the FBI  
investigation on Monday after a preliminary autopsy report found 
that the two men were shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Los Angeles Times, SIS officers have engaged in  
more than 50 gun battles, killed at least 34 suspects and wounded 
dozens of other people since the group's formation 34 years ago. 
Critics say its members sometimes act recklessly, violating 
suspects' civil rights, and wonder if the squad is worth its extra 
cost. Defenders cite such high-profile arrests as the killer of 
Bill Cosby's son. 
</P>
<P>
	The two suspects were shot Saturday after a brief standoff with  
police. Officers believed the men were involved in a robbery at a 
travel agency in Granada Hills and were suspects in a series of 
travel agency heists. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the men did not obey orders to surrender.  
</P>
<P>
	One man was shot while reaching for his waistband and turning  
toward detectives, officers said. The other man was reaching for 
his waistband as he crawled out of a window of their car, 
investigators reported. 
</P>
<P>
	However, officials acknowledged that neither man had a gun. A  
handgun that had not been fired was found on the front seat of the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Cmdr. David Kalish said the department will cooperate  
with the federal probe and conduct its own investigation.

<HEADLINE> Kiwi Air To File for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Kiwi International Air Lines will file for  
Chapter 7 bankruptcy in five days unless the grounded, debt-ridden 
carrier finds an investor willing to bring it back from almost 
certain death, the airline's court-appointed trustee said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means the ball game's over,'' said Charles Stanziale,  
standing in Kiwi's empty offices facing Newark International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny, Newark-based carrier is down to a skeleton staff of  
nine employees . The company auctioned off its office furniture 
Tuesday to help repay an $830,000 state loan. Auctions of spare 
plane parts are scheduled for next month in Atlanta and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-year-old airline, which had four planes and flew to six  
cities before it was grounded earlier this year, owes $12.5 million 
in taxes and $20 million to creditors, said Stanziale. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've searched high and low'' for an investor to bring back the  
airline as a charter, rather than as a bargain commercial carrier, 
he said. But he has no likely prospects and will likely apply to 
change the airline's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing to a Chapter 7, 
focusing on liquidation rather than reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi has not had planes or permission to fly since March, when  
the Federal Aviation Administration said the carrier was unable to 
fly safely. Kiwi laid off nearly all of its 500 workers and 
surrendered its four leased jets shortly after declaring Chapter 11 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA in April changed the revocation to a suspension, giving  
Kiwi time to find someone to rescue the airline. Pan Am Airways had 
offered to buy Kiwi in March for $3 million. But that plan 
collapsed when Kiwi could not immediately restore its flight 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, auctioneer Herbert Caspert led a listless group of  
20 buyers through cluttered rooms of old furniture, trying to 
interest them in buying scores of battered desks, filing cabinets, 
a giant conference table and cubicle dividers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cheaper than Staples,'' Caspert said, trying to coax a $5 bid  
for a desk. The entire auction netted about $3,200 for Kiwi, 
Caspert said. No bids were made on about half the furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the mid-90s, Kiwi had 1,200 workers who owned a  
controlling share of the airline, and 15 leased jets. The founding 
pilots and flight attendants named the airline for a flightless 
bird to symbolize how they had lost their wings -- and jobs -- when 
Eastern and other carriers failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, unable to compete with carriers with similar  
bargains and expanded flying schedules, declared bankruptcy in 
1997, but was rescued by a Baltimore physician who invested a 
reported $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the airline continued to shed workers, routes, jobs and  
planes until declaring bankruptcy again this year.

<HEADLINE> HP's Quarter Profits Rise 37 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- After several years of tough competition  
and disappointing earnings, Hewlett-Packard Co. credited a 37 
percent rise in quarterly profit to its new efforts to focus on 
revenue growth. 
</P>
<P>
	HP, the world's second largest computer company, said Monday it  
earned $853 million, or 81 cents a share in the fiscal third 
quarter ended July 31. That was up from a profit of $621 million, 
or 58 cents a share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time costs of separating into two companies, HP  
would have earned 85 cents a share, handily beating the 80 cents 
share expected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard stock, which shot up 4 percent on Monday in  
advance of the release of the figures and gained even more in 
after-hours trading, slumped today to give up those gains. In 
midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Hewlett-Packard was 
down 5.6 percent, or by $6.12 1/2, at $104.12 1/2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $12.23 billion, from $10.98 billion in the  
year-ago quarter. HP cited a 12 percent increase in sales of 
computer and imaging products, buoyed by strength in Unix business 
computers, desktop machines, scanners and printers. 
</P>
<P>
	Net revenue in the U.S. was $5.6 billion, up 8 percent from a  
year ago. Revenue from outside the U.S. rose 14 percent to $6.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, HP split into two separate ventures -- a computer and  
imaging business, and a testing and measurement business dubbed 
Agilent Technologies -- in an effort to revitalize underperforming 
divisions and improve sagging profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, HP named Carleton Fiorina, the former president of  
Lucent Technologies' telecommunications network services business, 
as its new CEO and president to replace retiring president Lewis 
Platt. 
</P>
<P>
	Platt, who remains chairman, said the company is beginning to  
see the results of efforts to convert orders for products and 
services into stronger revenue growth. He said the profits were a 
nice surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of businesses improved their profitability, with  
overall profitability exceeding our expectations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fiorina said the strong quarter is an indicator of HP's new  
commitment to making money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must become more aggressive and much more focused, and we  
are resolved to do so,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue growth in the businesses that will make up Agilent  
Technologies was up 8 percent over the same period last year, with 
broad-based growth across all its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine months ended July 31, HP earned $2.73 billion, or  
$2.61 a share, up from a profit of $2.24 billion, or $2.09 a share, 
in the year-ago period. Revenues rose to $36.59 billion from $34.84 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Promotes Warmheartedness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Violence among today's youth may stem  
from society's failure to promote a sense of ``warmheartedness'' in 
children, the Dalai Lama said Tuesday during a panel discussion at 
Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today there is more violence in society, particularly the  
younger generation,'' the exiled Tibetan leader said. ``This 
happened because of many decades of negligence about basic human 
values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discussion, which wrapped up a weekend-long violence  
prevention conference, reached far beyond the bounds of the IU 
conference room as it was broadcast live on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama was joined by William Sessions, former director  
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Chief Judge Sarah Evans 
Barker of the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis; and Richard 
Kimberly, vice president of government relations for the 
Kimberly-Clark Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama said he feels education has not focused enough on  
morals, and that a lack of ``warmheartedness'' in young people can 
lead to a lack of contentment, and then to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed the need for all people to have a moral  
counterbalance in their lives, something that won't let their 
desires drive them too far. To reach the younger generation, he 
said, will require effort by educators, families and religious 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonviolence does not mean we remain indifferent,'' he said.  
``We must remain fully engaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sessions, whose zeal for the subject matter lead him to  
occasionally cut off the Dalai Lama in midsentence, spoke of the 
need to empower children by teaching them how to mediate problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps summing up the panel's thoughts with his well-known  
sense of spiritual simplicity, the Dalai Lama said: ``We simply 
want happiness or a happy life. We don't want pain or suffering. 
Violence brings suffering, pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 64-year-old monk is the 14th Dalai Lama and as such is  
considered a reincarnation of the Buddha of compassion. He won the 
Nobel Prize in 1989 for his nonviolent efforts to win autonomy for 
Tibet, which has been under Chinese control since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama is being reunited with his brother Thubten Norbu,  
a retired Indiana University professor and founder of the Tibetan 
Cultural Center, where the Dalai Lama will perform the Kalachakra 
Initiation -- a series of rituals and teachings intended to help 
believers on the path to enlightenment.

<HEADLINE> Student Can't Wear Star of David </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union has  
promised to sue a school district that banned a Jewish student from 
displaying a Star of David necklace because administrators feared 
it could be mistaken for a gang symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	High school officials had told Ryan Green he could wear the  
necklace, but not where it could be seen. David Ingebretsen, head 
of the ACLU of Mississippi, said Green's family agreed Tuesday to 
challenge the policy in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their son has said he wanted to do this, not only for himself  
but others who might be affected by the policy in the future,'' 
Ingebretsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Green told the Harrison County School Board on Monday that  
the necklace symbolized his son's religious convictions and that he 
didn't want his son to be afraid to express those beliefs in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't appreciate calling the Star of David a gang symbol,''  
he told the board. 
</P>
<P>
	The board voted unanimously to uphold the policy that keeps  
students from wearing anything that could be considered a gang 
symbol. Law enforcement officials say some gang symbols incorporate 
six-pointed stars but normally have other elements such as a letter 
or a pitchfork. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a religious issue,'' said Frank Baskin, a  
spokesman for the Harrison County Sheriff's Office. ``This is a 
safety issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ingebretsen said the Star of David is a form of constitutionally  
protected religious speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ryan Green's Star of David necklace is clearly an expression  
of his Jewish faith, just as a necklace with a cross is an 
expression of Christian faith,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Island Evacuated Due to Dora </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON ISLAND (AP) -- The U.S. Army evacuated the last of 1,100  
military and civilian personnel Tuesday as a weakening Hurricane 
Dora neared this central Pacific island where a chemical weapons 
incinerator is located. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds at the center of the hurricane had diminished to 70 mph to  
75 mph by Tuesday evening as the storm passed about 70 miles south 
of the island. At the island itself, winds of only about 40 mph 
were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might not be that severe; nothing like Hurricane John in  
1994,'' said National Weather Service forecaster Hans Rosendal. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm earlier had sustained winds of 85 mph as it headed  
toward the island, part of a four-island atoll that is a U.S. 
possession. Forecasters had put the storm seven miles north of the 
island -- practically a direct hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding was a chief concern because the atoll has a high point  
of only 7 feet. Waves of up to 12 feet had been forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army evacuated the entire island, flying everyone to Hickam  
Air Force Base near Honolulu, 825 miles to the northeast. Ten hours 
before the hurricane was expected to pass through, not one was left 
on the atoll. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanks and lines in the weapons incinerator were closed, and  
weapons were secured in bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bunkers are weatherproof. Waves can wash right over and it  
most likely would not even seep into the bunkers at all,'' said 
U.S. Army Pacific spokesman John Fairbank. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force planes will fly over the island and make a visual  
assessment of damage at daybreak Wednesday, Fairbank said. 
</P>
<P>
	A full-scale evacuation was ordered before Hurricane John swept  
though the island in 1994, causing $10 million to $15 million worth 
of damage and forcing a one-month shutdown of the plant's automated 
system that destroys nerve and mustard gas weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Johnston facility is scheduled to be closed by the end of  
next year.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Give Up on Reichel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Phoenix general manager Bobby Smith  
said Tuesday that forward Robert Reichel won't play for the Coyotes 
next season and the team is open to reasonable trade offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel he will play in the Czech Republic,'' Smith told The  
Tribune, a newspaper serving suburban Phoenix. ``We won't have him. 
It has come to the point where I can see us trading him and we will 
look into that -- if someone makes a reasonable offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Travis Green is our No. 2 center (behind Jeremy Roenick), and  
with Daniel Briere and Juha Ylonen we feel like we will be fine at 
that position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel, obtained in a March 20 trade with the New York  
Islanders for forward Brad Isbister, played 13 regular season and 
seven playoff games with the Coyotes before becoming a restricted 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	His 70 points last season (including 14 in 13 games with  
Phoenix) were two points behind Roenick, who led the Coyotes. 
Reichel had 10 points came in his first seven games as a Coyote, 
but faltered during the playoffs against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said talks with Reichel's agent, Paul Kraus, have gone  
nowhere this summer. Reichel, who made $1.7 million last season, 
has been seeking a multiyear contract beginning at more than $3 
million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraus said in July that Reichel would rather play in the NHL but  
staying home in the Czech Republic is a viable option. He also 
intimated that the price to sign Reichel was rising during the 
summer -- apparently something that led Smith to sever all further 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to lose my phone number,'' Smith said of Smith.  
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes still have three other unsigned restricted free  
agents: goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin, forward Shane Doan and 
defenseman Stan Neckar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes issued three different contract proposals -- a  
three-year, a four-year and a five-year package -- to Khabibulin's 
agent, Jay Grossman, in June. Smith said Grossman has not submitted 
a counteroffer but expects talks to heat up with training camp 
scheduled to open for veterans in a little more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remain confident that we will come to a deal that will work  
for Nik and work for us,'' Smith said. ``We'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Scores Hold Steady on ACTs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although the 1990s have produced a generation  
of high school students who seem better prepared for college than 
their predecessors, scores have leveled off on a major 
college-entrance exam, according to a report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average composite ACT score for 1999 was 21 of a possible 36  
for the 1 million high school students who took the set of tests, 
formerly known as the American College Testing assessments. It was 
the third year in a row at the same level. 
</P>
<P>
	Results from the tests -- which measure student skills in  
English, math, reading and science -- have become an annual 
barometer of high school achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	The average 1999 composite score is the same as last year, when  
995,000 students took the test, and the 1997 average, according to 
the Iowa City, Iowa-based organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990s have ended, however, with the highest-ever rise in the  
average score, four-tenths of a point from 20.6 in 1989 to 21 in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores rose over the '80s decade by just one-tenth of a point.  
</P>
<P>
	During the 1960s, national scores decreased on average a full  
point, and in the 1970s, the average score fell an additional 1.3 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Educators praised the 1990s increases, because scores usually  
decline as test participation rises, but the number of students 
taking the test has grown by nearly 200,000 since the decade began. 
</P>
<P>
	``This combination of trends -- more students preparing for  
college while achieving higher entrance-exam scores -- should be 
welcomed by those concerned about American education,'' ACT 
President Richard L. Ferguson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACT report also surveys what courses college-bound seniors  
are taking and what careers they plan. It reflects the skills of 36 
percent of the nation's estimated 2.3 million high school graduates 
and 60 percent of America's entering college freshmen. The test is 
one of two major entrance examinations. Results from the other, the 
SAT, also will be released this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACT is given mainly in Western and Southern states.  
</P>
<P>
	Of the states where more than half of graduating seniors take  
the test, the highest average composite scores were in Wisconsin 
(22.3), Minnesota (22.1) and Iowa (22). The highest average score 
overall was in Rhode Island (22.7 with 3 percent high school 
graduates tested), the lowest in the District of Columbia (18.6, 
with 13 percent of graduates tested). Mississippi, which had the 
highest share of ACT test-takers at 82 percent, had the 
second-lowest average score, 18.7. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson said overall performance is improving because more  
students took higher-level courses in subjects covered by the ACT. 
Ten years ago, 46 percent of the test-takers reported preparing 
themselves for college with the appropriate classes. This year, 63 
percent have taken core courses. 
</P>
<P>
	As companies demand higher-skilled, better-educated employees,  
students are being encouraged to take classes that will prepare 
them for college. The American Federation of Teachers union 
launched a campaign Tuesday to advise middle-school students -- 
seventh-graders to ninth-graders -- on how to prepare for college 
and the work force. Thousands of businesses nationwide say they 
will rely on student course work in future entry-level hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's students still have a way to go. The ACT report  
indicates that less than half are prepared for college classes. 
Typically students who score under 16 points on any part of the ACT 
will need extra help in their freshman year; even scores up to 19 
suggest minimal readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, on the ACT English test for 1999, 48 percent of  
students scored 21 points or higher, indicating they are ready to 
do well in college composition courses, and 47 percent scored 22 
points or higher on the reading test, meaning good preparation for 
entry-level history or psychology courses. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also showed that just 4 percent of college-bound  
graduates plan careers in computer and information sciences, 
despite strong job growth and an increasingly computer-literate 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	The gender gap has closed to its closest point ever, but the  
boys' average score slipped a tenth of a point, from 21.2 to 21.1, 
while the average score for girls held steady at 20.9.

<HEADLINE> Lutherans Weigh Unity Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Challenging his listeners to ``make history,'' a  
noted historian today presented a controversial proposal for close 
unity, but not full-fledged merger, between the Episcopal Church 
and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin E. Marty, a Lutheran pastor and recently retired  
University of Chicago professor, was co-chair of the panel that 
wrote the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through your vote, you can make history,'' Marty told the  
Lutheran church's national assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Episcopal co-chair, Bishop Christopher Epting of Iowa, told  
the assembly ``we may not have this opportunity again. I pray that 
we will not miss it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What a step into the new millennium,'' Lutheran Presiding  
Bishop H. George Anderson, who also favors the pact, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his sermon at opening worship Monday, Anderson said he  
faced the week's deliberations with ``fear of boiling frustrations, 
of misunderstood arguments, of tempers out of control, of conflict 
that seems unresolvable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's prepared text said some have talked about ``an  
ecumenical train wreck'' here, but he omitted that remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed pact, scheduled for a vote Thursday, the 5.2  
million Lutherans and 2.3 million Episcopalians would recognize and 
share each other's clergy and sacraments, cooperate in mission 
projects and make joint decisions on important issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Daniel Perry, the ecumenical officer for the  
Episcopalians, said the pact would help both denominations because 
they could share clergy and mission work in urban and rural areas 
where their resources are spread thin. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact needs two-thirds approval from the 1,039 delegates. Two  
years ago, the Episcopal Church gave overwhelming approval but the 
Lutheran assembly's vote fell just short of two-thirds. The pact 
has been slightly reworked since. 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point is that in the future Lutherans must follow  
the Episcopal practice known as the ``historic episcopate.'' Each 
Lutheran bishop will be installed by three predecessor bishops in a 
line believed to extend back to Christ's apostles, and all clergy 
will be ordained by such bishops. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic and Orthodox churches, like the Episcopalians and other  
Anglicans, follow this procedure. But Lutheran teaching does not 
require it and many Lutheran bodies, including those in the U.S., 
have never followed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the assembly opening, a meeting of Lutheran bishops  
shared worries about this week's deliberations and the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Richard Foss of Fargo, N.D., a staunch foe, assured his  
colleagues that no schism will occur if the Episcopal pact passes. 
``There is zero chance of a breakaway church. That's just not on 
the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But several of his colleagues warned there will be hard feelings  
among members whichever side wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a divided church on this issue,'' said Bishop Peter  
Rogness of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, when the Lutherans and Episcopalians first declared  
a preliminary level of fellowship, the Episcopal Church has seen a 
net loss of 455,000 members, or 16 per cent. The Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America has lost membership, too, but far less 
drastically.

<HEADLINE> Retailers' Earnings Top Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some of the nation's biggest retailers reported  
better-than-expected earnings Tuesday as the robust U.S. economy 
continued to encourage Americans to shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales at its Target discount stores boosted  
second-quarter profits at Dayton Hudson Corp. by 33 percent from a 
year ago. Profit at J.C. Penney Co. Inc. rose 14 percent, boosted 
by demand for its private-label clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited Inc.'s earnings doubled from a year ago, amid  
strength in its Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant and Intimate 
Brands Inc. chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Depot's profits also rose sharply as consumers continue to  
spend money to fix up their homes, while Tiffany &AMP; Co.'s earnings 
gained as shoppers eagerly spent on luxury items such as jewelry 
and china. 
</P>
<P>
	While the earnings reported Tuesday topped Wall Street analysts'  
expectations, most of their stocks failed to post big gains amid 
concerns that retailers could be hit hard if the robust U.S. 
economy slows its pace in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Saks Inc. which also reported strong earnings, issued a warning  
that its profits for the remainder of the year will be weaker than 
expected. Its shares fell nearly 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Results were reported for the quarter ended July 31 for all of  
the companies except for Home Depot, which reported for a quarter 
ended Aug. 1. All stocks trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Dayton Hudson Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis-based retailer earned $224 million, or 48 cents  
a share, in the quarter vs. $172 million, or 36 cents a share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased 9.9 percent to $7.75 billion, compared with  
$7.06 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial  
had expected Dayton Hudson to report earnings of 46 cents a share. 
Dayton Hudson stock rose 62 1/2 cents to $61.87 1/2 in trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said that its strong performance was driven by its  
Target division, where pretax profit rose 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayton Hudson operates 881 Target stores, 267 Mervyn's  
moderately priced department stores and 64 department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, Dayton Hudson earned $418 million, or 89  
cents a share, compared with $330 million, or 69 cents a share a 
year ago. Sales rose to $14.97 billion from $13.52 billion. 

</P>
<P>
                        *J. C. Penney Co. Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Plano, Texas-based company reported operating earnings of  
about $112 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with $97 million, 
or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates of  
34 cents a share. But Penney's stock fell 43 3/4 cents to $42.56 1/4 in 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $7.3 billion from $6.76 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales at department stores opened at least a year, which is  
considered an industry gauge of performance, rose 1 percent in the 
quarter. The company said that sales of its private-label apparel, 
such as St. John's Bay, were strong, while sales of athletic 
sportswear and basic jeans were weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores increased 10.5 percent  
over the second quarter a year ago. But Penney still said that the 
results at Eckerd were disappointing as the process of integrating 
Eckerd into its business has taken longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalog sales dipped 2.8 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, Penney reported operating earnings of $279  
million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $273 million, or 99 cents 
a share, a year ago. Sales rose to $14.88 billion from $13.81 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	J. C. Penney operates nearly 1,150 J.C. Penney department stores  
and 2,900 Eckerd drugstores. It also operates 23 Renner department 
stores in Brazil. 

</P>
<P>
                          *The Limited Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Columbus, Ohio-based specialty clothing retailer earned  
$60.44 million, or 26 cents a share, compared with $31.8 million, 
or 13 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The healthy second-quarter results further confirmed that the  
giant retailer is on track to turn its business around from the 
slump that began in the early 1990s. In recent years, the company 
has undergone a major restructuring, including closing 300 stores 
and creating a design team for each of its divisions to better keep 
pace with fashion trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 9 percent to $2.27 billion from $2.08 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Limited let Wall Street know that its  
results would be better than the 18 cents a share that the company 
had expected to make in the quarter, and Tuesday's results 
confirmed that. It was the second time this year that the Limited 
has topped analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Limited shares were fell 43 3/4 cents to $44.37 1/2 in trading.  
</P>
<P>
	The Limited attributed the profit gain to strong performances at  
the company's Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant and Intimate 
Brands Inc. -- which owns Victoria's Secret and Bath &AMP; Body Works -- 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were calculated as if the Limited's spinoff of  
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch casual apparel chain had occurred at the 
beginning of 1998. Abercrombie became a public company in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, the Limited earned $94 million, or 40 cents  
a share, compared with $52.3 million, or 22 cents a share. Sales 
rose to $4.37 billion from $4.09 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Limited operates 3,373 specialty stores. The company also owns  
about 84 percent of Intimate Brands, which operates more than 1,800 
stores. 

</P>
<P>
                           *The Home Depot    	
</P>
<P>
	Home Depot earned $679 million, or 44 cents a share, for the  
quarter, compared with $467 million, or 31 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted earnings of 
41 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Home Depot shares fell 93 3/4 cents to $63.06 1/4 in trading.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 28 percent to $10.4 billion from $8.1 billion. Arthur  
M. Blank, president of the Atlanta-based chain, credited the gains 
to increased demand for home improvement items. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, Home Depot reported net income of $1.17  
billion, or 76 cents a share, compared with $804 million, or 53 
cents a share, in the same 1998 period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 27 percent to $19.4 billion from $15.3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Home Depot opened 49 new stores and relocated four others during  
the most recent quarter. By the end of the quarter, it had 846 
stores in the United States, Canada, Chile and Puerto Rico. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Tiffany &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Tiffany earned $23 million, or 31 cents a share,  
for the quarter, compared with $13.5 million, or 19 cents a share, 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results exceeded Wall Street's expectations of 24 cents a  
share, and Tiffany's shares rose $6.31 1/4 to $53 in trading, 
surpassing its previous 52-week high of $51.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 23 percent to $307.1 million from $247.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Kowalski, President and Chief Executive Officer of  
the New York-based luxury goods retailer, said the gains came from 
the company's push to open more stores in the United States and 
abroad. International sales rose 30 percent, while domestic sales 
climbed upward by 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's direct-marketing sales rose 5 percent, fueled  
mostly by customers ordering through catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the fiscal year, Tiffany reported  
net income of $39.1 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with 
$24.6 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 17 percent to $579.3 million from $473.9 million.  

</P>
<P>
                             *Saks Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	Saks, based in Birmingham, Ala., earned $26.6 million, or 18  
cents per share, excluding expenses the department store chain made 
to pay off debt early and make its computers year-2000 compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	The results compared with profits of $12.1 million, or 8 cents  
per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures matched Wall Street's expectations of 18 cents per  
share. 
</P>
<P>
	However, R. Brad Martin, chairman and chief executive of the  
Birmingham, Ala.-based company, revised its estimate for annual 
profits down to $1.80 per share. Analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial had been predicting $2.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin blamed that on lackluster sales from the Mercantile  
department store chain, which was bought last year, lower earnings 
from Saks' credit card division, and unexpected expenses from its 
e-commerce operation. 
</P>
<P>
	After his announcement, Saks shares closed down sharply, falling  
$4.68 3/4 to $19 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the most recent quarter totaled $1.43 billion, up 12  
percent from $1.28 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the fiscal year, Saks reported  
earnings of $66.4 million, or 45 cents per share, excluding the 
one-time expenses. That's 57 percent from $42.3 million, or 29 
cents per share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month sales were up 10 percent, from $2.97 billion to $2.7  
billion.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Levens Pushes Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Practice was finished, Dorsey Levens  
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rest of the Green Bay Packers hit the showers Tuesday  
morning, Levens and teammates William Henderson and Edwin Watson 
ran wind sprints. Sweating under his shoulder pads, Levens grunted 
with each turn and reverse, pushing himself a little bit harder 
into the next trip across the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra workout was Levens' idea. Teammates and coaches alike  
have noticed renewed dedication in Levens, a Pro Bowl starter two 
seasons ago who held out through last year's training camp and then 
had a terrible season marred by injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the first minicamp of spring, it has been clear Levens  
doesn't want to fail his teammates or himself again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't love to work hard,'' Levens said. ``It's just  
necessary if you want to be one of the best. Deep down inside, I 
think that if I don't work this hard, I won't be doing the best 
that I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At this time last year, Levens was being called greedy,  
egotistical and selfish. He eventually received a five-year, $25 
million contract after a protracted holdout, but the money came at 
the cost of his 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That deal could have got done a lot sooner, but it didn't,''  
Levens said. ``I think that's just a distraction. I'm trying to 
start off on the right foot this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levens worked out faithfully during his holdout but wasn't in  
game shape. In the Packers' second game, he sprained his right 
ankle so severely it fractured a bone in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed Green Bay's next nine games and was inconsistent when  
he returned, finishing with just 378 rushing yards in seven games. 
His best effort of the season came in the Packers' playoff loss to 
San Francisco, when he rushed for 116 yards and caught six passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think last year hurt Dorsey personally,'' offensive  
coordinator Sherman Lewis said. ``He's a guy with a lot of pride in 
himself and in his game, and to have the holdout and then his 
struggles, that didn't feel good. He's on a mission now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Levens struggled, the Packers' rushing game dried up.  
Green Bay finished 25th in the league with 95.4 rushing yards per 
game, a sharp decrease from the team average during the Packers' 
two Super Bowl seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	If Levens feels any resentment that the Packers agreed to wide  
receiver Antonio Freeman's demands much sooner than his, he isn't 
showing it. Levens said he's happy Freeman didn't have to endure 
the uncertainties and frustrations of a long holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't want the same thing to happen to Free,'' Levens  
said. ``That was a bad situation, and I'm glad they avoided it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's also excited about being the featured back in an offense  
that finally looks whole. With Brett Favre, Mark Chmura, Levens, 
Henderson and Freeman locked up in long-term contracts, Green Bay 
has its offensive skill positions solidified through the next 
half-decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know each other pretty well, and I think we've got the  
potential to do a lot of pretty good things,'' Levens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levens worked his way up the ladder in Green Bay, playing  
infrequently as a blocking back for Edgar Bennett his first two 
years. When Bennett tore his Achilles' tendon early in the 1997 
season, Levens stepped in and rushed for 1,435 yards, earning a Pro 
Bowl start. 
</P>
<P>
	Levens has an unusual mix of talents. At 6-foot-1 and 228  
pounds, he's big enough to be an effective blocker, but he also has 
speed and is an excellent receiver out of the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fact remains Levens has had just one standout season in  
four years in the league. Coach Ray Rhodes hadn't heard entirely 
positive reviews of Levens when he arrived in Green Bay last 
January, but he quickly learned Levens was committed to returning 
to form. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say things that you file away, but Dorsey has been a  
leader on this offense,'' Rhodes said. ``He knows he can play again 
like he did in '97, and that's why he's out here working hard.''

<HEADLINE> New Business Computers Lob Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major makers of personal computers are uniting  
with computer chip giant Intel Corp. as they seek to crack the 
market for business machines that manage heavy-duty computing 
tasks, such as processing millions of transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer Corp., lobbing the first salvo, unveiled a new  
type of powerful computer Tuesday that uses less expensive Intel 
chips and runs on Microsoft Windows operating software. The 
machine, called an ``eight-way server,'' ties together eight 
microprocessors to match the performance of the higher-priced 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other makers, such as Dell Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.  
and IBM, are expected to follow with similar products. 
</P>
<P>
	The new computers take aim in large part at Sun Microsystems  
Inc., which specializes in selling high-end RISC, or reduced 
instruction set Unix computers. IBM and Hewlett-Packard also sell 
these machines, which can cost corporate customers up to several 
million dollars each, but are selling the new Intel machines as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, whose chips are the brains of 90 percent of the world's  
personal computers, has been aggressively trying to sell 
microprocessors for bigger machines, a lucrative market. A big 
reason is Intel's profits are shrinking on its least expensive 
chips for PCs, hurt by price wars with rivals.

<P>
	A few years ago, Intel launched a successful effort to sell  
chips for workstations, or powerful desktop machines, which 
displaced computers using RISC technology. The machines cost less 
in part because Intel, as the world's largest chip maker, is able 
to mass-produce microprocessors at low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Intel wants to move up the corporate ladder by selling chips  
for machines that form the hub of networks of smaller business 
machines, or for computers used to run Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	But hurdles remain to Intel, Compaq and others seeking to usurp  
the crown of high-end computing. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, Intel-based servers commonly use the Windows NT  
operating system for running the computer's basic functions. But 
Microsoft Corp. isn't releasing new operating software specifically 
made for the new breed of machines until next year.

<HEADLINE> Punk Version of Japan Anthem Sacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Cancel those plans to slam-dance to Japan's  
national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	A record company is scrapping a punk rock version of the hymn  
that has long been renounced by pacifists as reminiscent of 
militarism. 
</P>
<P>
	Polydor has refused to release a new album by the group Little  
Screaming Revue because it included ``Kimigayo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Kimigayo'' was so controversial it was only recognized as the  
national anthem last week, when a law passed in Parliament giving 
official recognition to the song, along with the Rising Sun flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not want to give the impression we were taking sides on  
an issue that has so divided national opinion,'' Polydor spokesman 
Kenji Goto said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiyoshiro Imawano, the band's leader, saw the cancellation of  
the album as an infringement of his artistic freedom and is trying 
to release the seven-song ``A Cross in Winter'' through another 
record company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The song has no political ideology, and it is not a parody,''  
said agent Satoru Koyama, while acknowledging that conservative 
Japanese may be shocked by Imawano's rendition. ``It is a 
conceptual suggestion from a musician.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Imawano, 48, kept the melody and lyrics intact but sings the  
lyrics to a punk rock arrangement that includes frenzied drumming 
and bass. Guitarist Shinji Miyake plays solos that evoked Jimi 
Hendrix's famous Woodstock performance of ``The Star Spangled 
Banner,'' Koyama said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese flag -- a red disc on a white field -- and the  
``Kimigayo'' homage to the emperor have long served as de facto 
national symbols. 
</P>
<P>
	But they have not been legally sanctioned as such since World  
War II because, to many Japanese and other Asians, the symbols 
represent Japan's military aggression in the 1930s and 40s.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Politicians Foster Bigotry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sen. John McCain blamed ``sharp and  
intolerant'' rhetoric in American politics for encouraging the kind 
of bigotry that caused a white supremacist's shooting rampage at a 
Jewish community center here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us in public office bear the burden of blame for this  
tragedy,'' the Republican presidential candidate said Monday at a 
lunch sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League less than a week 
after the shooting that left five wounded, including three boys 
ages 5 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our rhetoric is too sharp and intolerant. Our differences are  
defined with too much venom. Partisanship is all-consuming,'' the 
Arizona senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a political climate has bred deep public distrust of  
government and an unraveling of patriotism, he said, and Americans 
are seeking other values to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people quit seeing themselves as part of something  
greater than self-interest, and the bonds of community are severed 
by cynicism, the virtues of shared national purpose give way to the 
temptations of selfishness, bigotry and hate,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not single out officeholders or political fights.  
</P>
<P>
	Pressed in an interview for an example of a conflict that  
exemplified such an acrimonious atmosphere, McCain recalled the 
nomination a decade ago of former Sen. John Tower for defense 
secretary. Tower's reputation as a ladies' man with a fondness for 
drink dogged him, and the Senate refused to confirm him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They basically crucified him on unfounded charges,'' McCain  
said. ``They destroyed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, McCain derided ``easy answers to complicated  
questions'' after shootings like the one at the Jewish community 
center last Tuesday that left five wounded and a Filipino-American 
postal worker dead a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Such attacks lead politicians to blame easy access to guns,  
violence-obsessed media and hate-group Internet sites, McCain said. 
``But despite our common yearning for an instant solution, each of 
us knows that there's no law that will make all this better,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, McCain said recent shooting sprees, such as the  
Jewish center attack and the one that left 15 dead at Columbine 
High School in Littleton, Colo., in April, have altered his views 
on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Issues or proposals that a year or two ago I would reject out  
of hand, I would at least pay attention and consider some of 
them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he favors outlawing cheaply made handguns called  
Saturday night specials, but added any proposal would raise 
questions about how to define such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	He also favors requiring safety locks on certain guns, and said  
he was intrigued by new technology that electronically identifies a 
person handling a gun, allowing only the owner to fire it.

<HEADLINE> Death Row Inmate Wins Reprieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Larry Robison never expected to wake up  
this morning in his death row cell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such is life,'' the inmate said Tuesday after an appeals court  
halted his execution four hours before it was to begin. ``I'm going 
to get off death row one way or another. Maybe it's the Lord 
working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Death penalty opponents had portrayed Robison's case as a test  
of Gov. George W. Bush's ``compassionate conservatism.'' But the 
judicial reprieve also spared the Republican presidential hopeful 
from having to decide whether to delay the execution of an admitted 
killer who has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no appropriate action for Gov. Bush to take in this  
case at this time,'' the governor's office said in a statement 
after the ruling. ``This is a legal issue to be decided by the 
courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any reprieve from Bush would have been unprecedented. The  
governor, in his 4 1/2 years in office, never has stopped an execution 
-- a span that has seen 98 executions in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Robison, 42, had said he was looking forward to dying by  
injection. His relatives and death penalty opponents contended he 
was mentally ill and should not be executed for a rampage in which 
five people were slain near Fort Worth 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the citizens of your state and now all  
American voters are entitled to know just how real and deep your 
sense of `compassion' reaches,'' wrote death penalty opponent 
William Moffitt, president of the National Association of Criminal 
Defense Lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Moffitt and others clamored for Bush to grant a one-time 30-day  
reprieve as allowed under Texas law. But the Texas Court of 
Criminal Appeals made the request moot. In a 5-4 ruling, the court 
agreed with Robison's attorneys that the inmate's mental problems 
deserved review. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that mentally ill people  
could be executed -- as long as they understood the punishment that 
awaited them and why they were being put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be weeks, if not months, before the case is resolved.  
The former construction worker will undergo testing by 
psychiatrists, and then a trial court must decide if Robison is 
sufficiently fit to comprehend his execution. 
</P>
<P>
	His case was considered by many critics an example of the  
problems with the state's treatment of the mentally ill. Robison 
had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic before the killings, but he 
was not considered violent and was released from several public 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings happened in neighboring cottages near Lake Worth in  
1982. One of the victims was Rickey Lee Bryant, 31, Robison's lover 
and roommate, who was shot twice in the head, decapitated, slashed 
eight times and stabbed. Robison said he ate the man's testicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Robison pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, but a jury  
convicted him of capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 17-0  
against recommending that Robison's sentence be commuted to life. 
That meant that Bush could do no more than grant the 30-day 
reprieve to allow him more time to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lois Robison celebrated word of her son's reprieve with hugs.  
She has led the fight to have her son spared and treated. 
</P>
<P>
	But the delay was a bitter blow to relatives of the five  
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 17 years of trials and multiple appeals, we feel  
betrayed that the Texas courts have again allowed Larry Robison to 
manipulate the legal system to postpone justice,'' said Melissa 
Estes, whose cousin, Bruce Gardner, 33, was one of the victims.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Says Ranked List Unused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A list ranking journalists, politicians  
and others on their statements about alleged espionage at the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory was never used, a suspended lab 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The list ranked the statements as for, against or neutral.  
</P>
<P>
	It was created by a well-meaning but naive junior employee, said  
Sylvia Brucchi, who is on paid leave from her job as public 
relations director while the incident is being investigated. Los 
Alamos has been under scrutiny after accusations that nuclear 
secrets were leaked by personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the project was only to compile a list of people who  
were making public statements on the alleged espionage and who were 
knowledgeable on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, the database was never used and there was no plan for  
its use other than to help track media coverage of the espionage 
crisis,'' lab director John Browne said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the Energy Department and the University of  
California, which has operated the lab under a government contract 
since 1943, condemned any effort to create a list of people for and 
against the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	The list contained 149 names or organizations, 12 rated as pro,  
18 as con, 37 as neutral and the rest unrated. The list also 
contained background information. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disturbing that the lab would spend taxpayer resources  
tracking the pulse of its political opponents, it smacks of Nixon's 
list,'' said Christopher Paine, a Natural Resources Defense Council 
nuclear-weapons analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just trying to keep up with what the issues were and  
who was bringing them up,'' Brucchi said. ``It was not my intention 
to have ratings. A junior staff member (did that) without my 
knowledge and without my approval.'' She would not identify the 
staff member.

<HEADLINE> Conflicts Hindering WTO Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Trade negotiators are preparing to launch new  
efforts to steer the global economy into the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the countdown to the launch begins, they can't even agree  
on a name for the talks, let alone what they should cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The 134-nation World Trade Organization has spent the past year  
discussing the agenda for a ministerial meeting in Seattle 
beginning Nov. 30. The meeting should kickstart negotiations aimed 
at rolling back barriers to exports and thus -- in theory -- boosting 
international prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far there have been few results. And when WTO diplomats  
return from their leisurely summer break, the tough task of 
whittling down more than 80 proposals into a feasible work schedule 
will begin in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Moore, New Zealand's former premier who takes up his post  
as WTO director-general Sept. 1, is under no illusions about the 
enormity of the task. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the 1990s and there are new issues which have exploded  
which we have never thought of,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the previous round of trade talks, nobody knew about  
electronic commerce, ``but now business in the Internet is doubling 
every hundred days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six months ago none of us really thought about genetically  
modified foods. These are the major issues,'' added Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand people are expected in Seattle for the  
conference, the WTO's third since it was set up in 1995. The 
four-day session is shaping up as a showdown between competing 
regional and economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The joke that the negotiators will be ``sleepless in Seattle''  
has been told hundreds of times already. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreements reached in the last trade talks, known as  
the Uruguay Round, the WTO is committed to making a new effort in 
the year 2000 to open trade in services and agriculture. But there 
is nothing to stop the Seattle conference from taking on other 
areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing countries including Pakistan and Mexico are insisting  
that the meeting should focus on compliance with the Uruguay Round 
accords rather than tackling new areas. In particular, they accuse 
industrialized countries of violating promises to import more 
textiles and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union, on the other hand, wants to see talks across  
the full spectrum of international trade. Critics say this is 
merely a ruse to deflect attention from agriculture, where the EU's 
protectionist policies are expected to come under threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States wants to discuss labor standards.  
</P>
<P>
	``As President Clinton has stated, the development of the  
trading system must come together with efforts to ensure respect 
for these standards, and its results must include benefits for 
working people in all nations,'' U.S. Deputy Trade Representative 
Susan Esserman told a recent meeting of the WTO general council. 
</P>
<P>
	That is anathema to the developing nations, who do not believe  
labor standards should be part of international trade agreements. 
They feel it is a form of protectionism, aimed at making poorer 
countries less competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is also resisting any suggestion that  
antidumping regulations should be included. Washington has used its 
regulations, which allow higher tariffs for U.S. industries 
threatened by imports, to provide relief for domestic steelmakers 
in the wake of the Asian currency crisis, provoking angry 
opposition from countries such as Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the looming rows between governments, the WTO  
also has to come to grips with other pressures. Nongovernmental 
organizations are pressing their case for a bigger say in the 
organization's policymaking, and thousands of anti-WTO campaigners 
are also planning to descend on Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	And if that's not enough, negotiators will have to face the  
tricky problem of what to call the new trade round. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been vague suggestions that it should be the  
``Clinton Round,'' but these aren't taken too seriously. There is 
more acceptance of the idea of a ``Millennium Round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This has alarmed the Trade Development Alliance of Greater  
Seattle, which has launched a campaign to make sure the official 
name is the ``Seattle Round.''

<HEADLINE> Networks Invest in Personalized TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Looking to gain a foothold in a technology  
that could shake up their revenue structure, several television 
networks are investing $57 million in a company that makes personal 
video recorders, digital devices expected to replace VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Mountain View-based Replay Networks Inc., to be  
announced today, involves Time Warner Co., The Walt Disney Co., 
Showtime Networks Inc., the Tribune Co. and Liberty Media Group, 
among others. The arrangement follows a smaller investment by some 
of the same companies in TiVo, a Sunnyvale firm that is the other 
leading maker of PVRs. 
</P>
<P>
	PVRs are essentially set-top boxes that can search channels and  
line up many hours of shows that fit an individual viewer's tastes. 
They also allow instant replays of live television, and promise to 
be much easier to use than VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's one major selling point customers won't hear so much  
about when PVRs appear in stores in the coming months -- a 
quick-skip feature that allows viewers to zip past commercials in a 
few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to cease promotion of the quick-skip button.  
They're definitely going to re-evaluate that,'' said Peg Murphy, 
vice president of business development for NBC Interactive, one of 
a half-dozen investors in both TiVo and Replay Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Murphy wouldn't say whether the investors extracted a  
promise to remove the quick-skip button entirely in exchange for 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Replay Networks spokesman Jim Plant said during an interview  
Tuesday, ``It's not our goal to destroy an advertising-based 
business model. We know there will be people who want to skip 
commercials. The goal for us is to find other ways for companies to 
deliver their messages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technology has the potential to further fracture advertising  
markets once entirely dominated by the TV networks, by letting 
third parties, such as Replay Networks and TiVo, take a share of 
the profits. 
</P>
<P>
	This prospect led a consortium including Time Warner Inc., Walt  
Disney Co., Discovery Communications Inc., CBS Corp. and News 
Corp., to threaten last week to sue any PVR makers for copyright 
infringement unless they deal with the networks first. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just TiVo and Replay -- companies like WebTV are doing  
similar things,'' Ms. Murphy said. ``It opens up new opportunities 
for advertising revenues, but remains to be seen how that will be 
divided up. It's better to have everyone talking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Replay Networks and TiVo products have a high-capacity  
computer disk that can store up to 30 hours of shows without a 
videotape and play them on demand. Both companies' recorders are 
already being sold on the Internet and should be in stores well in 
advance of the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	TiVo's PVR costs $499 to $999, depending on storage capacity and  
customers pay a $9.95 monthly service fee. Replay's device costs 
between $699 and $1,499, and there is no monthly service fee.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rally Late; Dow Gains 70.29 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another late afternoon rally propelled stocks  
higher Tuesday after news of a mild increase in consumer prices 
suggested that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates only 
modestly when it meets this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 70.29 to close at  
11,117.08. Earlier in the session, the blue-chip index fell as much 
as 35 points from Monday's close, but traders blamed Hewlett 
Packard for most of the decline. The nation's No. 2 computer maker 
fell as investors took profits following a solid earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended higher after trading in a narrow  
range for most of the day. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 13.39 to 
1,344.16, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 25.94 to 2,671.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially rose after the Labor Department said its  
Consumer Price Index, a closely watched gauge of inflation, rose 
0.3 percent in July. That matched analysts' expectations, and 
raised hopes that the Fed will take a moderate course in setting 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed raised short-term rates in June, and has indicated it  
would be willing to do so again if policy-makers determine higher 
rates would keep inflation at bay. The threat of higher rates -- and 
in turn, lower corporate profits -- has kept many on Wall Street 
tightly focused on each new economic indicator. 
</P>
<P>
	While the CPI report suggested inflation is not accelerating,  
the good news was somewhat tempered by two separate reports that 
showed a surge in new home construction in July and a strong 
advance in output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many analysts were reassured that the Fed would perceive  
the data as grounds for one small increase, probably when its Open 
Market Committee meets on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest concern before today was that the Fed would keep  
pushing that interest rate lever, raising rates higher and 
higher,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist 
at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``That no longer seems to be the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, stocks regained momentum as investors took their  
cues from the inflation-sensitive bond market. The CPI report 
boosted prices, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down 
to 6.01 percent from 6.08 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks, among the first to be affected by  
interest rate fluctuations, rose Tuesday. American Express led the 
Dow's gains, rising 4 3/8 to 140 1/4 and Chase Manhattan rose 2 3/4 to 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Those gains were outweighed by some major losses in the  
technology sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett Packard, which helped the Dow to a 73-point gain Monday,  
plunged 5 3/4 to 104 1/2 Tuesday. After the close of trading Monday, the 
company reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations, and 
many investors chose to lock in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip maker Micron Technology fell 2 13/16 to 57 3/4. But online  
brokerage ETrade rose 3 3/8 to 30 1/4 after announcing it will offer 
individual investors access to after-hours trading through 
Instinet. 
</P>
<P>
	The retail sector proved that strong earnings don't always  
guarantee a stock bounce. J.C. Penney slipped 7/16 to 42 9/16 and 
Ann Taylor fell 1 3/4 to 35 7/8 after both companies beat analysts' 
predictions for second-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has now closed higher for five consecutive sessions, its  
longest rally since the beginning of July. However, low volume and 
a pattern of late-day rallies suggested to some analysts that 
investors have not truly determined their own course of action, and 
may trade tentatively until the Fed's meeting is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has rallied over the past few days, but on very  
light volume,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities 
America. ``There are some questions about whether this is the start 
of something major, or just a sucker's rally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 829.61 
million shares, compared with 720.01 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.82 to 628.71, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.01 to 782.51. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.18 to 436.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.19 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.05 percent, France's CAC-40 rose 0.5 
percent, and Britain's FT-SE 100 closed 1.1 percent lower.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, viewed  
on Wall Street as the golden boy of the U.S. economy, is hoping he 
still has the Midas touch. This time, he is focusing on gold leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin on Tuesday joined a fund-raising drive sponsored by the  
Treasury Historical Association to raise money to restore the 
Treasury Department's historic Cash Room to the way it looked when 
Ulysses S. Grant used it for his Inaugural reception in 1869. 
</P>
<P>
	The $200,000 the association hopes to raise will provide for  
gold leaf in the Cash Room's ornate ceiling and two nearby 
staircase domes. That section of the Treasury, the third oldest 
government building in Washington after the Capitol and White 
House, was heavily damaged in a 1996 fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress appropriated the money to restore the building's office  
functions but left it to private donors to raise the money needed 
to replace 19th century architectural features that have been lost 
through the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who held many of his news conferences in the Cash Room,  
said he was happy to do what he could to support the restoration 
effort ``in a room with so much history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas O'Malley, chairman of the association's board, said that  
so far $136,000 has been raised in an effort that has the support 
of nine other former Treasury secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who left the Cabinet in early July, said he is still  
examining his options now that he is back in private life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be at least two or three months before I sort  
through what I am going to do,'' he said. Rubin said he is ruling 
out any run for public office.

<HEADLINE> New Yorker Completes Magazine Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New Yorker magazine occupied spanking new  
quarters in a glitzy Times Square skyscraper on Monday after a 
weekend move from its old haunt on West 43rd Street. Many staff 
members celebrated -- or eased the pain -- by going on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	The venerable literary and current affairs magazine was the last  
of 14 publications to make the move to the $500 million, 48-story 
Conde Nast building at 4 Times Square -- a structure already noted 
for a troubled construction history that cost at least two lives 
and forced the shutdown of a hit Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering the view from The New Yorker's new 21st floor digs,  
its haughty masthead figure, Eustace Tilley, might wish to swap his 
monocle for a pair of binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether the new state-of-the-art building passes aesthetic  
muster with the magazine that is self-appointed arbiter of what's 
good, bad and tasteful in Gotham remained to be seen; no mention of 
the move appeared in the fat August double-issue that hit 
newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the staff, ``some people probably were more excited than  
others,'' said Maurie Perl, spokeswoman for Conde Nast. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times said some staffers were ``both nostalgic and  
nervous'' and one unnamed editor described himself as ``in complete 
denial'' about the move. 
</P>
<P>
	New Yorker editor David Remnick told his staff that the  
magazine's spirit would not change just because the address did. 
``The soul (of the magazine) is its writers and artists and 
everyone who contributes to it,'' The Times quoted Remnick as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The editor was among those on vacation and was not available for  
comment, Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, those staffers not on vacation were unpacking boxes  
and files, some of which dated back to the magazine's original West 
43rd Street offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the artifacts, prized enough to be kept under guard, were  
Plexiglas-encased pieces of plaster wall with sketches by humorist 
James Thurber, who drew large because of near-blindness. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Yorker, which had moved once before, in 1991, joins such  
publications as Vanity Fair, Vogue, Glamour, GQ, House and Garden 
and Allure, most of which moved from the former Conde Nast building 
on Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the company's publications, Wired, Architectural Digest  
and Bon Appetit, are based in California but have business offices 
at 4 Times Square, Ms. Perl said.

<HEADLINE> Rising Golf Star May Never Turn Pro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Matt Kuchar has played in the  
Masters and was on the leaderboard midway through last year's U.S. 
Open. Yet he was as nervous as ever when he teed off in the U.S. 
Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar, the 1997 amateur champion, shot a 1-over-par 73 Monday  
while playing with a lighting salesman from New York and a recent 
graduate from the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar, a Georgia Tech student, was among the leaders after the  
first round. After another round today of stroke play on the Pebble 
Beach and Spyglass Hill courses, the top 64 players advance to six 
rounds of match play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really nervous out there today, as nervous as I've been  
in a while,'' Kuchar said. ``Knowing it's the national championship 
and trying to relive what I did in '97. Making the top 64 is tough, 
and you think about match play and how tough that is. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get that nervousness, it's just a strange feeling,  
your stomach is churning. When you get that feeling you wonder, 
`Why do I play golf? I can't eat, I can't sleep.' But to have that 
feeling is exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Bolli, a recent graduate of the University of Georgia,  
had Monday's low round among the 312 amateurs with a 2-under 70 on 
Spyglass on a cool, calm day along the Pacific Ocean. He had six 
birdies in his round. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Salinetti of Lee, Mass.; Ben Curtis of Kent, Ohio; and Gene  
Elliott of West Des Moines, Iowa, were at 71, while five players 
had rounds of 72. Kuchar was among 19 players at 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Stevens of Fort Worth, Texas, had the shot of the day  
with a hole-in-one on the 186-yard fifth hole at Spyglass. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar was in his favorite element Monday, playing with guys who  
love the game and do it for fun. His playing partners were Al 
Falussy Jr., 34, of Dix Hills, N.Y., and Adam Dooley, 23, a scuba 
diving enthusiast from Albany, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Falussy shot a 90 and Dooley had an 81. And Kuchar had to  
overcome a triple-bogey on the 15th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar said he is excited to be playing again in the U.S.  
Amateur, even while peers such as Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia 
battle for riches on the pro circuit. In fact, Kuchar is enjoying 
his amateur status so much he might never turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something special about amateur golf, these  
tournaments, the friendships you make,'' Kuchar said. ``When you 
tee it up in the Open or the Masters as an amateur, there's a 
special feeling about it. There's a sense that this guy loves the 
game and he's not just another one of those money-hungry kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar said last year it was only a matter of time before he  
turned pro, but now he's not so sure. In fact, he drops the name of 
Bobby Jones while talking about the possibility of remaining an 
amateur for a couple more years -- or perhaps for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I thought would be special, pretty neat. I was  
thinking about how I could still play as much golf as possible and 
do business and take care of things financially,'' said Kuchar, who 
will be on the U.S. team for the amateur Walker Cup in Scotland 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the future, turning pro is the most likely thing. But  
staying amateur is still possible. If I turn pro and wish I'd 
stayed amateur, I can't go back.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Owens Slims Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- As a defensive tackle, Rich Owens admits he  
was a big fat flop. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens ate eight to 10 meals a day to gain the weight needed for  
the position the Washington Redskins wanted him to play. But the 
binge left him slow and out of shape at around 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always had to carry a towel around because I was sweating  
all the time,'' he said. ``I couldn't catch my breath, and my feet 
were stuck in the ground. It's hard to get the motor going when 
you're that heavy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later and 25 pounds lighter, Owens is playing  
defensive end for the Miami Dolphins. Coach Jimmy Johnson said 
Owens has regained the speed and quickness that helped him total 11 
sacks for the Redskins in 1996 before they moved him from end to 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rich is having an outstanding camp,'' Johnson said Tuesday.  
``I'm very pleased with him. He's going to be a productive 
defensive end for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, 27, signed a two-year, $2.8 million contract in March as  
an unrestricted free agent, and he strengthens a front four already 
rich in talent. The depth is such that there's no urgency for the 
Dolphins to coax rookie defensive end Dimitrius Underwood into 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a first-round draft choice released last week by the  
Minnesota Vikings after he left them to pursue his faith, was 
claimed off waivers Monday by the Dolphins. Johnson said the 
Dolphins will give Underwood time to sort out his personal 
situation before contacting him. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Underwood, the Dolphins have an abundance of ends.  
There's Jason Taylor, Trace Armstrong, Kenny Mixon, Lorenzo Bromell 
and Owens, who raves about the Dolphins' defensive approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're turning everybody loose and saying, `Get up the field  
and use your quickness,''' he said. ``I love being an athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens also loves eating only three or four times a day. He  
shakes his head recalling the routine with the Redskins when he 
tried to bulk up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd get up about 6 in the morning, have a bowl of oatmeal and  
a piece of fruit and go back to bed. I'd wake up a couple of hours 
later and go have a real breakfast. I'd eat again around 1 o'clock 
-- a couple of sandwiches. Then a few hours later I'd have something 
light. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'd have three dinners. I'd eat at 8, and again at 10, and  
again at 12 before I went to bed. Those were usually sandwiches, 
two or three at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was also the occasional snack. The 6-foot-6 lineman's  
weight climbed from 273 to 285, then 290, then 295. At 298, he 
stopped stepping on a scale. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can imagine my food bill,'' he said. ``I got so sick of  
eating. '' 
</P>
<P>
	1997 turned into a long season for Owens. His sack total fell to  
3 1/2, and the Redskins finished third worst in the NFL in run 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	He dropped the excess weight last year, but his season was ended  
by a knee injury in Washington's second preseason game. Now the 
knee is fine, and a slimmer Owens looks forward to a big year. He 
may move to tackle in long-yardage situations to bolster the pass 
rush, but he'll play end most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to be someplace where I don't have to be big,'' he  
said. ``I'm a very happy player at 275.''

<HEADLINE> Ending a Car Lease Is No Easy Chore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	Q: The lease on my car is about to expire. Is ending a lease as  
easy as beginning one? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Hardly.  
</P>
<P>
	The rules for returning a car at the end of a lease are  
clear-cut, but very involved. One problem faced by many lessees is 
that some of the precise details about returning a car aren't 
always spelled out in the lease document, and are not clarified 
until termination time. 
</P>
<P>
	Some details are clearly stated up front, of course, mainly the  
``termination or disposition'' fee, which generally can total 
several hundred dollars. Over the course of the lease, lessees 
sometimes overlook this final cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Understandably, any past due payments or charges, such as  
property taxes, must also be paid. And, as one termination lease 
puts it, any ``official fees and taxes due in connection with the 
termination of the lease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excess mileage charges will be assessed, but generally speaking,  
the lessor grants no rebate for mileage left unused, even though 
this might make the car more marketable for the lessor. 
</P>
<P>
	The area of greatest controversy might involve the lease clause  
about ``excessive wear and tear,'' which unfortunately may involve 
subjective determinations and require negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	One lease, for example, makes the lessee responsible for any  
dents, scratches or chips, and any peeling or chipping of paints 
that exceeds $100 to repair or refinish. The same standard applies 
to substandard repairs and ``damage from elements'' like sand. 
</P>
<P>
	Also added to charges under this lease are repairs for stains,  
holes, tears, rips or burns that exceed $50. Also, the estimated 
cost to repair or replace parts to meet manufacturers' standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Tire tread is measured. The detail in one common lease calls for  
the cost of replacing ``any tire tread which is less than 4/32 (or 
an eighth) of an inch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, you have the choice or making repairs or leaving them  
for the lessor. If repairs are made by the lessee, the lessor may 
appraise them in accordance with its guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Serial Killer Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAHNVILLE, La. (AP) -- A former taxi driver once suspected of  
killing as many as 15 women has been sentenced to life in prison 
for the only slaying authorities were able to pin on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Ellwood was convicted Tuesday of murdering Cheryl Lewis,  
30, who was one of 26 women, most of them prostitutes, found dead 
in swampy areas around New Orleans from 1991 through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of Ellwood's arrest in 1997, authorities said they  
suspected him in as many as 15 killings, and Jefferson Parish 
Sheriff Harry Lee claimed authorities were searching for at least 
four other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a second murder charge against Ellwood was dismissed  
when prosecutors learned he had an alibi that put him in Ohio at 
the time of a woman's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The case led to four years of work by a task force made up of  
the FBI, New Orleans police and four sheriff's departments. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the FBI cut its ties to the task force and then  
began investigating its former leader, Lt. Sue Rushing of the 
Jefferson Parish sheriff's department, who was accused of hiding or 
destroying evidence that helped convict Ellwood. The FBI said the 
probe was over but would not disclose details. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force is dissolved, and the sheriff's departments  
involved said they will re-examine the case only if new information 
is presented. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 26 victims were women with histories of drug abuse  
and prostitution. Some were transsexuals. Some were strangled, and 
others apparently died of drug overdoses. 
</P>
<P>
	An inmate who had served time with Ellwood, 48, told deputies  
that Ellwood had bragged about killing people and that he ``enjoyed 
the fun of having sex with people who were not in control of their 
bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a prostitute testified that she sold drugs to Ellwood and  
got in his car. She said Ellwood suddenly became very angry and 
said to her: ``You know what I do to bitches like you? I kill 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Cards' Dye Has Condition Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Extensive surgery to repair the right  
arm of Arizona Cardinals offensive lineman Ernest Dye produced a 
pulse on Tuesday, prompting doctors to upgrade his condition to 
serious from critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ernest's situation is day to day, then week to week,'' said  
Dr. Jerry Mohr, one of the surgeon's who operated on Dye for more 
than eight hours Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors reconnected the bone between the shoulder and elbow,  
then went about the precise work of repairing nerves, arteries, 
veins and other tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	After surgery, doctors could detect a pulse in Dye's arm, which  
means blood was flowing to the repaired limb. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their primary concern is to get the blood flowing and maintain  
it,'' Cardinals spokesman Greg Gladysiewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't known how long Dye will have to remain in the hospital,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye, defensive end Carl Simpson and offensive guard Lester  
Holmes were injured when their car overturned as they were driving 
to a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye and Simpson were thrown from the car. Holmes was the only  
one wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was checked for pain in his hip and released. Holmes  
received a severe cut to the forehead and was released from the 
hospital Tuesday afternoon. He returned to his Phoenix home with 
his wife and 3-week-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals owner Bill Bidwell arranged for Dye's mother and wife  
to fly to Flagstaff on Tuesday and they spent much of the day at 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin also visited the players.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was some warmth in his (Dye's) hand,'' Tobin said.  
``That means the circulation and the blood flow was restored, so 
that's good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive line coach George Warhop said Dye was upbeat when he  
met with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't sense he was in any pain,'' Warhop said. ``Ernest is  
a tough guy. They were shaken up. They were just in a huge 
accident. They weren't acting like it was Christmas or anything, 
but they were positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was the latest in a string of setbacks for Dye.  
</P>
<P>
	Dye was the Cardinals' first-round draft pick out of South  
Carolina in 1993, but was plagued by injuries. The 340-pound tackle 
left the team as a free agent in 1997 and signed with the St. Louis 
Rams. He was out of football last year following the deaths of his 
brother and father.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prisoner To Move to Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- An Italian serving a 40-year prison term  
in the United States is to be returned to Rome next week to serve 
out the rest of her sentence in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Her supporters claim the transfer is a goodwill gesture by the  
United States toward Italy following the acquittal of a U.S. Marine 
pilot accused in the deaths of 20 people killed when his plane 
sliced the cables of an Italian ski gondola. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the decision to release Silvia  
Baraldini to the Italians had nothing to do with the gondola case. 
</P>
<P>
	Italians were outraged when Marine Capt. Richard Ashby was  
acquitted in March of involuntary manslaughter charges after he was 
accused of flying too low and too fast when his plane severed the 
gondola cable in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini, 51, was convicted in 1983 of trying to rob a Brinks  
armored truck. She also was convicted of kidnapping for her role in 
the prison breakout of a Black Liberation Army leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Baraldini was part of a Marxist and black  
nationalist group called ``The Family'' accused of crimes dating to 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Watney, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said  
Tuesday she could not immediately confirm details of Baraldini's 
transfer to Rome. The Justice Department said earlier that 
Baraldini was expected to be transferred late this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini's supporters have posted messages on the Internet  
saying she will be transferred from the Federal Correctional 
Institution in Danbury on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini has served 16 years of her sentence. She is scheduled  
for mandatory release in July 2008, based on good conduct credits. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Elizabeth Fink, did not return calls Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Hits Northern Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLINAS, Calif. (AP) -- A moderate earthquake rocked this  
Northern California town Tuesday evening, swaying office buildings 
in San Francisco and rattling homes 50 miles south in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.0 happened at 6:06  
p.m. near the San Andreas Fault, 30 miles northwest of San 
Francisco, said U.S. Geological Survey spokesman Dale Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries or damage were immediately reported.  
</P>
<P>
	The quake rocked cars and made streetlights swing in San  
Francisco. Items fell off shelves, and workers at San Jose 
International Airport felt the control tower shake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually it is more of a rolling. This was like an explosion,''  
said Toby Bisson, a utility operator at the Stinson Beach Water 
District just south of Bolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ground in his backyard rumbled for 10 or 15 seconds,  
frightening his 5-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``She freaked out. She started crying. She said, 'I don't like  
earthquakes' and started running in the house. It took a while for 
her to come down. It was just loud and scary,'' Bisson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Schwartz, executive director of the Audubon Canyon Ranch, a  
1,000-acre wildlife sanctuary in Bolinas, said none of the ranch's 
buildings were damaged and nobody was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so loud we thought a plane crashed nearby,'' Schwartz  
said. The sanctuary is on the edge of the San Andreas fault, and 
the quake sent the birds aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The birds got out of the trees and they were all up in the  
air. The noise and vibrations must have been profound for them, at 
the top of these hundred-foot tall redwoods,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USGS recorded four aftershocks over the next 2 1/2 hours within  
a mile of Bolinas. The first, a light 2.1-magnitude earthquake, 
happened at 6:41 p.m., followed by a 1.7-magnitude quake, one of 
2.0-magnitude and another of 2.2-magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the San Francisco Police Department nor the San  
Francisco Department of Public Works reported any damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Business was running as usual at airports in Oakland and San  
Jose. Officials at San Francisco International Airport did not 
immediately return a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
	No accidents were reported on any of the San Francisco Bay  
area's seven bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolinas is about 17 miles northwest of San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Ike Austin Arrives To Join Wizards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Center Isaac Austin, obtained by the Wizards  
six days ago from Orlando, arrived in Washington on Tuesday a 
little lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Austin said he has lost 15 pounds since July 1 and  
is close to his ideal playing weight of 270 less than two months 
before training camp begins Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin lost 80 pounds prior to the 1996-97 season, then had a  
season with the Miami Heat that saw him named the NBA's most 
improved player. 
</P>
<P>
	While he doesn't have to lose as much weight this summer, he is  
eyeing another turnaround with the Wizards, his sixth NBA team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of reminds me of being back in Miami,'' said Austin,  
who turns 30 Wednesday. ``We had a veteran team. This team kind of 
reminds me about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austin averaged 9.7 points and 4.8 rebounds an outing in 49  
games last season for Orlando. The year before he averaged 12.7 
points per game in 52 contests with Miami and 15.2 points per 
outing in 26 games with the Clippers. He also has played in the NBA 
for Utah and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this to be the last stop,'' Austin said. ``This team  
has a lot of history. This is a great opportunity for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington traded Ben Wallace, Terry Davis, Tim Legler and Jeff  
McInnis to Orlando to get Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards also announced the signing Tuesday of power forward  
Aaron Williams, who spent the past two seasons as a reserve in 
Seattle. Like Austin, the former Xavier standout will be playing 
for his sixth NBA team with Washington.

<HEADLINE> PETA Steps Up Pressure on McDonald's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A group of animal rights activists is  
stepping up public pressure against McDonald's in an attempt to 
pressure the fast food chain to prevent cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as People for the Ethical Treatment of  
Animals gave up on a two year campaign of trying to persuade 
McDonalds to ensure that the animals used for its food are killed 
without prolonged suffering and that chickens are uncaged and 
allowed to roam free. 
</P>
<P>
	The 600,000-member group accused McDonald's of a lack of  
commitment to talks between the two that is ``sad and insulting.'' 
So PETA plans to organize demonstrations, produce leaflets and take 
out advertisements to pressure the company, said Bruce Friedrich, a 
spokesman at PETA headquarters in Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	``McDonald's animals lead short, miserable, painful lives and  
they die violent, bloody, gruesome deaths,'' said Friedrich, PETA's 
vegetarian campaign coordinator. ``We're going to be shouting that 
from the rooftops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A McDonald's spokesman said Tuesday that the Oak Brook,  
Ill.-based company remains committed to animal welfare, with or 
without PETA's input. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's already has made reforms, such as implementing  
training at suppliers' slaughterhouses and changing procedures to 
keep the animals calm before they are killed, spokesman Walt Riker 
said. The company also hired Temple Grandin, an animal welfare 
expert at Colorado State University, as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we're making really good progress,'' Riker said.  
``Unfortunately, PETA apparently seems to be more interested in 
media and criticism. That's their game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PETA also wants McDonald's to sell veggie burgers. Riker said  
some McDonald's restaurants in New York do but there are no plans 
to expand that nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Drought Dries Up Athletic Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) -- As Villanova football players prepare for  
their season-opener, they're stepping all over one of the hardest 
opponents they've ever faced in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The playing field.  
</P>
<P>
	They, and other colleges and high schools in the Northeast are  
practicing on fields as hard as concrete and scorched by one of the 
century's worst droughts. Coaches and athletic directors are 
worried that the rock-hard fields will cause injuries to players as 
they run, tackle and slide during drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the pounding. The grass right now is even harder  
than the turf is,'' said Villanova coach Andy Talley. ``It's not 
the best surface to play on, but you've got to play the hand that's 
dealt to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hard fields prompted officials in the Philadelphia area to  
delay the start of high school football practice for two weeks, 
unless the area receives more rain soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, groundskeepers are brainstorming for unique solutions  
to keep their fields in tip-top condition with no more significant 
rainfall on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	At the University of Maryland, coaches check the fields daily to  
make sure players can use them; Maryland regulations call for 50 
percent less water to be used to water the fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the soil begins to crack, you get potholes that are a  
footing hazard,'' school spokesman George Cathcart said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other worries for returning athletes, said Charlie  
Thompson, head athletic trainer at Princeton University. The 
surface will be harder on all the body's joints since the turf will 
have less of a ``bounce-back cushion'' for athletes who may be 
working through two-a-day practices under the summer sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fields are absolutely solid; it's just dust,'' Thompson  
said. ``It's the worst I've seen it in the 20 years I've been an 
athletic trainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure is perhaps greatest at Penn State's Beaver Stadium,  
where in less than two weeks the third-ranked Nittany Lions play 
host to No. 4 Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	While school officials say the hallowed field will stay green  
and healthy for the Aug. 28 opener, they are turning to unique 
measures to keep it that way, using treated wastewater as well as 
water first used to cool a nearby nuclear reactor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That water is not radioactive. It's not water used in the  
reactor,'' said Bill Anderson, an assistant vice president at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	On the high school level, most officials say it's up to  
individual schools, and not a state athletic association, to 
determine if practices should be delayed or moved. Most high 
schools have started practices for fall sports, or will be 
scheduled to start practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fields are in rough shape right now. When you start running  
athletes on them, that's when you really lose them,'' said John 
Kohler, facilities director for the Lancaster School District. 
</P>
<P>
	His district has trucked in 6,000 gallons of out-of-state water  
at a cost of $132 per watering, to save a newly renovated track and 
field being put down this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, schools say they're worried about the hard  
fields but haven't gotten many calls about it from coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an unusually dry year, and until something happens, you  
usually don't think about it until you have to,'' said Walter 
Eaton, assistant director at the New York State Public High School 
Association.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Try To Atone for Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Two of the nation's largest airlines are trying  
to stem passengers' growing frustration over flight delays and 
cancellations with letters of apology. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters were recently sent to American and United airlines'  
frequent fliers who were affected by problems at O'Hare 
International Airport, with United throwing in an extra 2,500 miles 
for members of its Mileage Plus Premier program, the airlines said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a proactive measure to acknowledge delays we've  
experienced there,'' United spokeswoman Susanna Leyva said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan said such  
letters have been sent several times in the past two years to 
``recognize difficulties that some of our frequent flier passengers 
may have had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither would say how many letters were sent.  
</P>
<P>
	In American's letter, B.J. DeSena, vice president at O'Hare  
International Airport, asked passengers to ``overlook our poor 
performance ... and give us another chance.'' United, meanwhile, 
stressed its commitment to improving service. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyva and Fagan said the letters were not prompted by the recent  
Federal Aviation Administration report that showed showing that 
delays and cancellations for the first six months of this year are 
almost double those of a year ago. During the first five months of 
this year, for example, 23,141 flights were held up at O'Hare, 
compared with 11,464 in the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the increase was accompanied by a rise in the  
number of passenger complaints lodged against airlines-- 6,582 so 
far this year compared with 3,681 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan and Leyva said weather and air-traffic control problems  
were mostly to blame for the delays. The airlines also have blamed 
other infrastructure deficiencies, combined with record passenger 
loads, for the blunders. 
</P>
<P>
	A passenger advocate agrees, at least in part.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to include the FAA and Congress for failing to  
provide sufficient aviation infrastructure to deal with these 
loads,'' said David Stempler of the Air Travelers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But many passengers say corporate greed has caused air carriers  
to skimp on service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is about packing the tin can as much as possible,'' said  
Art Brodie, who travels more than 100,000 miles annually for his 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pay more and more money to get less and less,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Frustration and anger by air travelers also has translated into  
a rise in the number of incidents of passenger misconduct -- 
including violent attacks on airline employees. In 1998 there were 
about 5,000 reports of misconduct, a 26 percent increase over the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole experience stinks,'' said Bob Redmond, a  
pharmaceutical salesman, who says he has run out of patience. 
Redmond regularly shuttles between New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airlines have no credibility. Not a shred,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines is based in the Chicago suburb of Elk Grove  
Village. American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Can Stay Afloat Until Sept. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux doesn't have to close on his  
plan to buy the bankrupt team by the end of the week because the 
Penguins have enough money to stay afloat through the end of 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's line of credit with a French bank runs out Friday,  
but the Penguins can borrow enough money to keep running if 
Lemieux's deal doesn't close by the end of this week, said James 
Walsh, a bankruptcy lawyer representing the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The team could get more money from Societe Generale, the French  
bank that has financed the team since it filed for bankruptcy in 
October, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	More relief for the franchise came Tuesday night, when the  
Allegheny Regional Asset District Board voted 6-1 to earmark sales 
tax revenue to help the city and county pay $16 million in bond 
debt on the Civic Arena, where the Penguins play. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, the Public Auditorium Authority agreed to take  
over debt payments on the Civic Arena owed by the team and the 
arena's landlord, SMG. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is moving in a very positive direction with both  
investors and SMG to bring this deal to completion,'' Lemieux 
spokesman John Brabender said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Leeper, executive director of the Public Auditorium  
Authority, praised the vote, which he said is a ``big step'' toward 
finalizing the deal with Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really translates into about $1 million a year in savings  
to that franchise,'' Leeper said of the Penguins. ``That coupled 
with the SMG commitments ... will really put that franchise on 
stable ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon St. Denis, director of the sports advisory group at SG  
Cowen, the French bank's subsidiary, said lending officials were 
aware that the deal might not be finalized by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do whatever is in the best interest to keep the  
franchise in Pittsburgh and maintain the franchise value,'' St. 
Denis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux needs $50 million in outside private investments to  
finance his takeover. A list circulated to prospective investors 
showed $51.4 million in commitments, but listed $5 million coming 
from a party ``to be announced,'' the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Brabender said that money was in escrow with Lemieux's group and  
represents an actual investor. He was not sure why the investor's 
name had not been listed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Rooney, nephew of late Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art  
Rooney, Sr., is a candidate to run the Penguins' business 
operations when Lemieux's deal closes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he recently  
interviewed with Lemieux. His job title with the team would likely 
be chief operating officer. General manager Craig Patrick would 
continue to run the hockey side of the operation. Lemieux's lawyer, 
Chuck Greenberg, declined comment.

<HEADLINE> State Won't Have to Defend Nichols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A judge ordered the hiring of private  
attorneys at state expense to defend Terry Nichols in the Oklahoma 
City bombing Tuesday after the state public defenders agency said 
it didn't have enough money to represent him. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Robert M. Murphy Jr. agreed Tuesday to let  
the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System withdraw from the case and 
ruled that the state Judicial Fund -- made up of excess court fees -- 
would be used to pay private attorneys to represent Nichols 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Bednar, executive director of public defenders agency, said  
the decision assures money will be available for Nichols' defense 
when he goes on trial on state murder charges, probably in about a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing in the world we want to look like in Oklahoma''  
are rednecks who ``want to kill Terry Nichols and not pay for his 
defense,'' Bednar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature set aside $1 million in 1998 to pay for Nichols'  
defense at his state trial, but the Legislature earlier this year 
withdrew $900,000 of that to help tornado victims instead. Bednar's 
group then asked to withdraw because it couldn't afford to 
represent Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	The Judicial Fund is expected to have about $2.7 million  
available for the trial. Estimates are Nichols' defense could cost 
$5 million over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols is charged in state court with 160 counts of  
first-degree murder in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. 
Murrah Federal Building. He could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols is serving a life sentence in Colorado after being  
convicted on federal charges of conspiracy and involuntary 
manslaughter in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the judge, Nichols asked to keep the public  
defender who had been appointed to him. Murphy said no decision had 
been made but the possibility had not been ruled out.

<HEADLINE> 4 States Want To Share Donor Organs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A critically ill 8-year-old child in  
Minnesota received a liver from a donor in Wisconsin on Tuesday, in 
an example of how a proposed four-state organ-sharing agreement 
would work if approved by federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, Minnesota and North and South Dakota plan to seek  
federal approval of an agreement in which the four states would 
share livers. 
</P>
<P>
	The states have not yet submitted their proposal to the United  
Network for Organ Sharing, the agency that runs the nation's 
transplant system, but in the meantime, officials say they are 
moving ahead with the spirit of the proposed agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, if a state has a liver available and  
another state has a patient with the most urgent need for a 
transplant, that state would share the liver. The deal also calls 
for reciprocity: Minnesota will have to share a liver with 
Wisconsin for a similarly situated patient. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the people of Wisconsin can feel very good today  
about sharing this life-saving liver,'' said Dr. Anthony 
D'Alessandro, a surgeon with the transplant center at the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison. ``And we look forward under this 
`fair-sharing' agreement to the help we can now expect from 
Minnesota when a Wisconsin resident is in need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current U.S. system, donated organs are first offered  
to potential recipients in the designated local area -- which can 
vary from part of a city to several states -- even if a patient is 
in greater need elsewhere. Only if the organ is not placed locally 
is it offered regionally and then nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials have proposed making the system based more on  
patient need, prompting Wisconsin officials to favor some type of 
payback system so that the state did not lose too many livers. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about Minnesota's liver recipient were unavailable. The  
liver came from an 8-year-old girl who died after being hit by a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	The child was not a status one patient, those patients with the  
most urgent need, who would generally receive livers under the 
organ sharing program. But in this case, Wisconsin did not have 
another child in need of the liver, D'Alessandro said.

<HEADLINE> Island Evacuated As Hurricane Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON ISLAND (AP) -- Anticipating a close strike by Hurricane  
Dora, the U.S. Army today was evacuating the last of 1,100 military 
and civilian personnel from this small central Pacific island where 
old chemical weapons are destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials closed tanks and lines in the incinerator used to  
dispose of the toxic chemicals and secured the rest of the weapons 
in storm-proof bunkers as Dora approached the island, part of a 
four-island atoll 825 miles southwest of Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	The center of the storm initially was expected to pass 7 miles  
north of the island late tonight, close enough for National Weather 
Service forecaster Jeff Powell to call it a direct hit. Today, the 
storm was on a path that would put it 60 miles south of the island 
tonight, but that did not amount to a reprieve, the weather service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Johnston Island will be on the bad side of it,'' forecaster  
Hans Rosendal said. ``They will get a lot of wind and rain and wave 
action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Army decided early today to remove the last 200-some workers  
who were not evacuated Monday, said spokesman John Fairbank. 
</P>
<P>
	Evacuees were being flown to Hickam Air Force Base near  
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	Also being evacuated were workers from the U.S. Fish and  
Wildlife Service, which operates a bird refuge on the atoll. 
</P>
<P>
	Dora had maximum sustained wind of about 85 mph with some higher  
gusts, compared with about 105 mph early Monday, Rosendal said. It 
was not expected to weaken any more in the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters predicted waves of up to 12 feet, raising concerns  
about flooding on Johnston Island, which has a high point of only 7 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not worried so much about winds as they are concerned  
about storm surge and seas,'' Powell said.

<HEADLINE> School Requires Computer Literacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Computer literacy is now a requirement  
for incoming students at the University of Texas at Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials are requiring that all incoming students  
demonstrate computer competence in five areas. They are word 
processing, spreadsheets, email, the Internet and online research 
through the school library. 
</P>
<P>
	Students can take a computer literacy test to fulfill the  
requirement, or they can take a course designated by the department 
of their major. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think, if a student can do the basics in any of these  
areas, they have reached a minimum acceptance of computer 
literacy,'' said Dana Dunn, associate vice president for 
undergraduate academic affairs and student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a really good thing. Any employer who hires a  
UTA graduate is ensured a student who has this kind of knowledge,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the requirement has a ``grandfather clause.''  
</P>
<P>
	The policy affects only incoming students who must fulfill the  
requirement before they can graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials decided to add the requirement because computer skills  
are essential in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of  
Colleges and Schools, a national accrediting body for universities, 
has encouraged institutions to develop such policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Trish Nickel has been hired as coordinator of computer testing  
services to launch and oversee the training. 
</P>
<P>
	Many schools are moving in the direction of requiring computer  
literacy, but they ``are struggling to determine what computer 
literacy is and what's the best way to measure it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Incoming students will be required to pay a $45 fee for the  
testing.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Names New Athletic Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- James L. Smith, an athletic department  
official at the University of Memphis, on Monday was appointed 
athletic director at Tennessee State University, which is under 
NCAA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 58, will join Tennessee State on Aug. 30, after 11 years  
as assistant athletic director for administration at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows a four-month investigation by Tennessee State  
into eight allegations of infractions of NCAA rules. The 
allegations dealt with scholarships, recruiting, practice limits, 
monitoring and coach conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee State fired Wayne Bell, the school's NCAA compliance  
coordinator, in June and put head football coach L.C. Cole under a 
pay freeze and recruiting restrictions in July. The school hopes to 
avoid harsher penalties from the NCAA, which has scheduled a 
September hearing on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee State has denied having too little control over the  
football program, and it took no position on allegations that Cole 
gave money and free game tickets to a University of Alabama student 
he was recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith will replace Vivian Fuller, who was fired in December.  
</P>
<P>
	He received a bachelor's degree from Fisk University in 1963, a  
master's degree from Springfield College in 1966 and a doctorate 
from New York University in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith taught at Fisk University, Meharry Medical College,  
Volunteer State Community College and New York's Brooklyn College 
and City University before joining the University of Memphis in 
1988.

<HEADLINE> Suzuki To Sponsor Heisman Trophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First the Rose Bowl, now the Heisman Trophy.  
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Rose Bowl gave in to corporate sponsorship and  
was renamed the Rose Bowl, presented by AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heisman Trophy hasn't gone that far, but it now has a  
big-time sponsor for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	American Suzuki signed a three-year, $1.5 million deal on Monday  
with the Downtown Athletic Club -- the presenter of the trophy -- and 
became the chief sponsor of the award. 
</P>
<P>
	No corporate tag will appear before or after the words Heisman  
Trophy, Rudy Riska, executive director of the Heisman Trophy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The DAC, which emerged from bankruptcy in June, has presented  
the Heisman since 1935. The trophy is awarded to college football's 
top player. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Suzuki signed a three-year, $35 million deal with Time  
Warner in a marketing partnership to promote the Heisman. Part of 
the promotion allows fans to have a voice -- albeit a small one -- in 
who wins. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of 992 sports writers, broadcasters, coaches and former  
Heisman winners vote, and the fans voting at Suzuki dealerships 
will get the 993rd vote. 
</P>
<P>
	DAC president Bill Dockery said the arrangement was not a move  
toward more extensive fan balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to do anything to compromise the integrity of  
the award,'' Dockery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other Heisman promotions are layouts in its major Time  
Warner magazines, including Sports Illustrated, Time and People. 
Also, ``Heisman Vignettes'' will be shown on Time-Warner owned 
Turner Broadcasting outlets, including CNN and CNN/SI. 
</P>
<P>
	`We see it benefiting us in several ways,'' Riska said. ``First,  
it promotes the old-time Heisman winners, it gets the public 
involved and the money will help us expand our programs with high 
school kids.''

<HEADLINE> Pasta King Barilla Opens U.S. Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Deep in the heart of corn country, a new  
factory processes thousands of bushels of grain a day, but it is 
not the commodity for which Iowa is known. It is durum wheat, 
shipped hundreds of miles from the fields of Arizona, the Dakotas 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheat is processed in central Iowa by Barilla, the world's  
largest pasta maker, into 22 different kinds of pasta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parma, Italy-based company announced in 1997 that it had  
chosen Ames for its first U.S. factory. Its new 510,000-square-foot 
plant, mill and warehouse went into full production in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Barilla officials say they were sold on Ames by the Iowa work  
ethic, a central U.S. location, proximity to two major interstate 
highways and a rail line, and $6 million in local and state 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a national search of where to locate the plant and Ames  
really came out on top,'' said Dave Bramow, plant manager. ``With 
the combination of the highway and the rail traffic, it was just a 
real fit for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iowa is really an agribusiness area. And even though it's  
corn, it's still agriculture driven,'' he said. ``To bring wheat 
here, it really wasn't unknown to a lot of people in Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Barilla shipped durum wheat grown in the United  
States and Canada to Italy and other European countries to be 
processed into pasta. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's a much shorter trip to ship that wheat to Iowa, where  
the Barilla plant can be seen for miles by drivers on the 
Interstate. 
</P>
<P>
	Barilla has taken full advantage of the opportunity, painting  
its distinctive red-white-and-blue logo on both sides of its mill, 
a building several stories high flanked by towering silos on one 
end of the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ames plant, an exact duplicate of a new Barilla plant in  
Foggia, Italy, has a warehouse on the other end, from which it 
supplies pasta to wholesalers throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of the plant are the production and packaging  
areas, where water, a few vitamins and semolina -- wheat ground 
finer than flour -- are turned into the company's signature products 
and put into colorful boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is remarkably empty of people. Just 102 workers cover  
shifts that run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A sophisticated 
computer system eliminates much of the need for hands-on work. 
</P>
<P>
	Coils of black computer cables snake throughout the plant,  
allowing production workers in a glass-enclosed computer lab to 
point and click their way through many maintenance checks of the 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty years ago, what now takes about 3 1/2 hours on our  
short-goods line used to take over 24 hours,'' production manager 
Bob Johnson said as he watched automated cutters chop thousands of 
pieces of campanelle pasta, which resemble tiny rosettes. 
</P>
<P>
	The short goods include campanelle and penne pasta, while  
spaghetti and fettuccine are typical long goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant can turn out 54,000 boxes of pasta each hour and about  
200 million pounds each year. Three production lines now are in 
use, with room for another if it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barilla family began its business in Italy in 1877. Barilla  
chairman Guido Barilla, 41, is the fourth generation of his family 
to lead the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Barilla now employs about 7,000 people worldwide and has annual  
sales of more than $2 billion. The company has nine 
pasta-manufacturing plants, with six in Italy, one in Greece, one 
in Turkey and one in Ames. Barilla sells its products in more than 
100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Barilla began shipping pasta to the United States in 1995 and  
began a national advertising campaign in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Gruca, an associate professor of marketing at Iowa State  
University who follows the pasta industry, said Barilla is making a 
strategic move by focusing on U.S. consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only so much growth that you can get in Europe,'' he  
said. ``In the U.S., we eat significantly less pasta, but people 
feel very positively about it. It's considered a healthy food. 
Because of that, the trend is moving up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't really be an international brand unless you're in  
the United States because we're a huge, huge market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruca said Barilla also makes itself over into an American  
company by opening plants in this country, a move that could allow 
it to get around some import restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, companies that  
manufactured dry macaroni, spaghetti, vermicelli and noodles 
shipped out products worth $1.4 billion in 1992, the latest year 
for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido Barilla said during opening ceremonies in June that 90  
percent of U.S. retail outlets, or about 25,000 stores nationwide, 
now carry the company's product. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicos Sophocleous, general manager of Barilla America Inc., said  
the Ames plant should help the company make more inroads in the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on consumption, the U.S. pasta market is second only to  
Italy,'' Sophocleous said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Ex-CIA Chief Defends Lee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investigators targeted nuclear weapons  
physicist Wen Ho Lee as an espionage suspect largely because he is 
a Chinese-American, says the former chief of counterintelligence at 
the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case was screwed up because there was nothing there -- it  
was built on thin air,'' Robert S. Vrooman, a former CIA operations 
officer who retired from Los Alamos in March 1998, told The 
Washington Post in an interview appearing in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though much of the investigation remains classified,  
Vrooman added in a written statement provided to the Post that ``it 
can be said at this time that Mr. Lee's ethnicity was a major 
factor'' and that government agents still do not have a ``shred of 
evidence'' that Lee leaked nuclear secrets to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has denied that Lee's ethnicity  
was a factor in the investigation and Lee's subsequent firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Vrooman made his remarks less than a week after Richardson  
recommended disciplinary action against him for failing to remove 
Lee from the laboratory's top-secret Division X or to deny him 
access to secret information after he came under suspicion of 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Vrooman countered that the decision to allow Lee to keep working  
was made in 1997 by the Energy Department's chief intelligence 
officer, Notra Trulock -- the same official who had identified Lee 
as the government's main suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Los Alamos lab has suspended it's director of  
public affairs after officials learned of a database that rated as 
``pro'' or ``con'' responses to the spy scandal by a number of 
government officials, media figures and academics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvia Brucchi said she authorized subordinates to create a  
``key players'' database in March to help lab executives know ``who 
our friends are,'' according to stories in today's editions of the 
Albuquerque Journal and Santa Fe New Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the ratings were made by another staffer without  
her knowledge and that she only learned of them late last week. She 
declined to name the staffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never asked for, nor authorized anybody to rate any official  
or anybody, period,'' Brucchi told the New Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
	The database of 149 names, biographies, comments and photographs  
contains pro-con designations for 67 people. 
</P>
<P>
	It gave a ``pro'' rating to those who appeared to be skeptical  
of the espionage allegations. Those who appeared to think the 
allegations were serious and that the lab was the source of the 
leaks were given a ``con,'' rating. It also listed some as 
``neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lab director John C. Browne said in a written statement that the  
database was created at the direction of a ``senior public-affairs 
manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The database was never used, and there was no plan for its use  
other than to help track media coverage of the espionage crisis,'' 
Browne said. ``It was never circulated outside the public-affairs 
office, and the laboratory's senior management and the University 
of California were unaware of its existence until the end of last 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking a long public silence, Vrooman told the Post he does  
not believe China obtained top secret information about U.S. 
nuclear warheads from Los Alamos or any other Energy Department 
laboratory. Hew said the data could have been stolen from documents 
distributed to ``hundreds of locations throughout the U.S. 
government'' and private defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the written statement, Vrooman said Lee ``was identified by  
the Department of Energy's Office of Counterintelligence as the 
prime suspect based on an, at best, cursory investigation at only 
two facilities, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a Taiwanese-born nuclear physicist and naturalized U.S.  
citizen, was fired in March for alleged violations of Los Alamos' 
security regulations. He has denied ever passing secrets to China, 
and he has not been charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has not decided whether to charge him  
with transferring classified information from the secure computer 
system at Los Alamos to his more vulnerable desktop computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been an outspoken critic of the flawed investigation  
that identified Mr. Lee as the prime suspect in this case,'' 
Vrooman told the Post. ``I do not agree with Mr. Trulock or with 
the secretary of energy that the information obtained by the 
Chinese came from the Department of Energy. I consider disciplinary 
action against me to be retaliation for opposing them on this 
issue.''

<HEADLINE> Factions of Indian Tribe Face Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT PLEASANT, Mich. (AP) -- Opposing factions of the Saginaw  
Chippewa Indian Tribe faced off at tribal headquarters Tuesday 
without the violence that had been feared by some tribal members. 
</P>
<P>
	Council members removed from power last week by the federal  
government tried Tuesday to enter the building where their 
replacements were meeting. But tribal police blocked the building 
and turned them away. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs last Tuesday took the  
unusual step of intervening to recognize the new tribal council, 
citing the ousted tribal leadership's refusal to step down after 
losing four elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The ousted council claims that Kevin Gover, assistant secretary  
for Indian Affairs with the BIA, does not have the right to select 
leaders. They say he used the results of a tainted primary election 
to choose their replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, members of the ousted leadership council plan to  
go to court in Bay City, where they have filed a federal lawsuit 
charging the BIA with overstepping its authority. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, they continued their struggle to regain power in  
Mount Pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 people on both sides of the debate stood by and dozens  
more working inside pressed against windows as expelled leaders 
asked police to let them in. Supporters of the expelled leaders 
carried signs criticizing the new council and the BIA. 
</P>
<P>
	Ousted Chief Kevin Chamberlain said he was not advocating  
violence, but wanted to know why he couldn't enter his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Jackson, spokesman for the new tribe, said Chamberlain was  
just staging a ``media circus'' by inviting the press to witness 
the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're just dealing with a faction that can't stand losing  
four elections,'' Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Comets Carry On As Perrot Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Amid all the tears shed for dying teammate Kim  
Perrot, the Houston Comets have found a way to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a steely resolve, though, to get through even a routine  
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would be the worst workout that you could have,''  
coach Van Chancellor said Tuesday, the day after the Comets' 
emotional 80-71 victory over Utah in which Cynthia Cooper scored 42 
points. ``Then Cynthia came out here with a spirit, a get-up-and-go 
and it kind of carried over to everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot, who has cancer, remained on life support at the  
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Cooper, her close 
friend, has played with a fervor that not only has inspired her 
teammates but kept them focused. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, she finished two points shy of her career high,  
going 11-of-18 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Her intensity broke once, at the game's end, when she fell  
sobbing into the arms of her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was extremely hard, and I really miss Kim,'' she said  
Monday night, before leaving to visit Perrot in the intensive care 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans wore white ribbons honoring Perrot at the game. Other fans  
wore pink hearts with ``Kim'' inscribed on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston players wore white stickers bearing Perrot's No. 10.  
</P>
<P>
	During the final seconds, fans chanted ``We love you, Kim.''  
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Perrot was diagnosed last January with a type of  
lung cancer that hits younger, non-smokers. The Lafayette, La., 
native was told that the unchecked cancer had spread to her brain. 
</P>
<P>
	She had surgery Feb. 24 to remove a golf ball-sized brain tumor  
and followed up with months of radiation therapy which arrested 
four smaller tumors in her brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot was advised by doctors to undergo chemotherapy to stem  
the cancer growth in her lungs. Instead, she sought treatment in 
Mexico, leaving for Tijuana in late May, then again last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper flew there twice this past month to be with Perrot.  
</P>
<P>
	Perrot's family decided to bring the point guard back to Houston  
when her condition worsened, arriving in Texas last Saturday. Since 
then, friends, family, teammates and Chancellor have taken turns 
staying with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing hard, winning and dreams of a third straight WNBA  
championship remain on the team's mind, but Perrot's plight is 
never far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has an idea of what they want to do and that's to  
win a championship and we're not going to let anything hinder us 
from doing that,'' forward Tammy Jackson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Kim's case, she would want us to come out here and practice  
hard and win the game. What you're supposed to do,'' she added. 
``If we do anything less than that then we're not doing what we're 
supposed to do, and we're hurting the team and we're disappointing 
the person who is hurting.''

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Visits Indiana Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- The Dalai Lama hopes his visit to this  
college town scarred by a deadly hate crime can inspire greater 
peace and harmony in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from using his visit to teach the Kalachakra Initiation --  
a revered Buddhist ritual for world peace -- the 1989 Nobel Peace 
Prize laureate also planned to participate in a panel discussion 
today on youth violence with former FBI Director William Sessions 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have genuine, warm, human feelings. ... Humanity really  
needs that,'' he told about 200 supporters Monday night at a 
$500-a-plate dinner at Indiana University's Tibetan Cultural 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday marked the first day of a nearly two-week visit by the  
Dalai Lama to Bloomington, where today he will began teaching the 
Kalachakra. It will be the 25th time he has led the ritual whose 
name mean ``cycles of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His visit to Bloomington, where his older brother lives, comes  
about six weeks after a white supremacist shot and killed a Korean 
graduate student outside a church in the southern Indiana city. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, during a news conference in Indianapolis, the  
Dalai Lama said schools and media bear some of the responsibility 
for the culture of violence in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools pay great attention to developing intelligence, but  
``not enough attention for development of (a) warm heart,'' said 
the monk. He is the 14th Dalai Lama and as such is considered a 
reincarnation of the Buddha of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the media presents so much violence that some people  
take it for granted as human nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``So everybody has a responsibility, and also everybody has a  
potential to make a contribution for better society,'' he said. 
``So let us try to make common effort for transformation of better 
society, happier society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 5,000 people, some from as far away as Japan and  
Taiwan, are expected to attend daily sessions of the Kalachakra. 
The event is open to non-Buddhists. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony involves the creation of a mandala, a painting  
crafted from colored sand, representing a four-faced god with 24 
arms who subdues violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily admission to the Kalachakra is $50, although students, the  
elderly and Tibetans can get in for $40. The money will go to 
underwrite the cost of the Kalachakra ceremony and the Dalai Lama's 
visit, which organizers said exceeds $2 million.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sheds 12.35 in Afternoon Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed today as a government  
report of a mild increase in consumer prices failed to hearten 
investors. Hewlett Packard, which soared on Monday, dragged 
blue-chips lower amid profit-taking today. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 12.35 at 11,034.44. The index gave up an earlier gain of 
nearly 65 points, leading some analysts to suggest that the market 
remains troubled by worries that the Federal Reserve will raise 
interest rates in an effort to stifle inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were moving between modest gains and  
losses. In early afternoon, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 
2.37 at 1,333.14, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 4.12 at 
2,649.40. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has rallied over the past few days, but on very  
light volume,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities 
America. ``There are some questions about whether this is the start 
of something major, or just a sucker's rally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially rose today after the Labor Department said its  
Consumer Price Index, a closely watched gauge of inflation, rose 
0.3 percent in July. That matched analysts' expectations, and 
raised hopes that the Fed will take a moderate course in setting 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed raised short-term rates in June, and has indicated it  
will do so again if policy-makers determine higher rates would keep 
inflation at bay. The central bank's Open Market Committee will 
meet Aug. 24, and many analysts expect the group to raise rates a 
quarter-percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report suggested that one increase may be enough,  
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest concern before today was that the Fed would keep  
pushing that interest rate lever, raising rates higher and 
higher,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist 
at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``That no longer seems to be the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CPI report helped boost prices in the inflation-sensitive  
bond market. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 6.01 
percent from 6.08 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks, among the first to be affected by  
interest rate fluctuations, rose today. American Express gained 3 1/8 
to 139. 
</P>
<P>
	But those gains were outweighed by some major losses in the  
technology sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett Packard, which helped the Dow to a 73-point gain Monday,  
fell 5 1/16 to 105 3/16 today. After the close of trading Monday, 
the computer maker reported earnings that beat analysts' 
expectations, and many investors chose to take profits today. Also, 
some unpublished estimates had called for even stronger numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip maker Micron Technology fell 2 3/8 to 58 3/16.  
</P>
<P>
	But online brokerage ETrade rose 1 15/16 to 28 13/16 after  
announcing it will offer individual investors access to after-hours 
trading through Instinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 464.10 million 
shares, well ahead of Monday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.11 at 624.00, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.08 at 778.42. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.21 to 433.61.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Bug Might Not Affect Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internet's decentralized structure makes  
it difficult to know precisely how the millions of computers 
connected to it will fare because of the Year 2000 technology 
problem, some of the Internet's top computer experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	But that architecture -- a collection of interconnected but  
mostly independent computer networks -- also means data traffic will 
be able to bypass any local Y2K failures, such as those caused by 
power outages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not likely to see major global outages at all,'' said  
Vint Cerf, an MCI WorldCom Inc. executive who co-invented the 
common ``TCP/IP'' language of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point of the Internet was to be designed in a very  
distributed way, so it would be reliable as a whole even if small 
bits of it were to go down,'' agreed Esther Dyson, interim 
chairwoman of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
Numbers, the group assuming management of much of the Net from the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials met today with experts, including a trade  
group for Internet providers, to discuss the impact of Y2K on 
consumers using the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic core of the Internet appears likely -- extremely  
likely -- to function without problems,'' said John Koskinen, 
chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. But 
because of the loose structure, he added, ``no one can guarantee 
there won't be some glitches and some problems anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cerf, MCI's senior vice president for Internet architecture and  
technology, predicted ``a series of little annoying problems that 
will bug us for most of January.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet and its kindred technologies rely on computers and  
software owned by people and companies worldwide mostly without any 
supervision. That makes it difficult to predict how the vast 
computer network will operate in January, when it is feared that 
some computers won't be able to correctly identify the new year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is about a million autonomous networks and about  
50 million autonomous computers,'' said Tony Rutkowski, an early 
Internet pioneer. ``The question becomes which of those many 
millions of networks and computers will have problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem has been gathering information about the  
Internet's preparations: Unlike some industries, there is no single 
organization in charge and little regulatory oversight by 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Heath, president of the Virginia-based Internet Society,  
said the Internet won't have serious problems systemwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not going to happen,'' Heath said. ``The whole Y2K  
thing is an absolute yawn. I am so unconcerned about it that it's 
hard to build a fire under me at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the Internet's biggest companies are issuing  
dire-sounding warnings to shareholders. Network Solutions Inc., 
which controls two of the 13 central computers that coordinate the 
world's Web addresses, cautioned against ``a failure of or 
interruption to normal business'' if it doesn't prepare adequately. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 11 computers, called ``root servers,'' are largely run  
by volunteers at universities and other organizations worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no responsibility for, nor control over, other  
Internet domain name server operators that are critical to the 
efficient operation of the Internet,'' the company said in a recent 
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ``We do not 
know whether such domain name server operators have hardware, 
software or firmware that is Year 2000 compliant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The root servers are Y2K-ready, according to their  
operators,'' said Barbara Dooley, president of the Commercial 
Internet Exchange Association. ``They are cooperating and have been 
for some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the world's largest Internet provider with more  
than 18 million customers, also said in a recent SEC filing that 
Y2K problems ``could result in interruptions in the work of its 
employees, the inability of members and customers to access the 
company's online services and Web sites or errors and defects in 
the Netscape products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL said it already spent $7 million on repair efforts through  
March and expects to spend a total of $20 million. Spokesman Rich 
D'Amato said the company's Y2K testing is on schedule, ``and to 
date we have experienced very few problems.''

<HEADLINE>  Money Dispute Threatens Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Get ready for the greatest event left in golf.  
</P>
<P>
	The prize for winning next month's matches is not a green  
jacket, a claret jug or even something called the Wanamaker. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a cup.  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it looks like any other trophy, only this has some  
history. The cup was donated by a golf enthusiast in the 1920s who 
wanted to encourage competition between the best players on both 
sides of the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	This is about team. About pride. About patriotism. It is a  
chance every two years for a select group of players to represent 
the Stars and Stripes without getting a dime. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one thing to be staring over Rae's Creek at the 12th green  
on Augusta National, trying to protect a one-stroke lead on Sunday. 
The pressure can be just as great standing over a 6-foot putt with 
your teammates -- your country -- counting on you. 
</P>
<P>
	If that sounds enticing, then book a flight to Scotland.  
</P>
<P>
	The Walker Cup begins Sept. 11.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest fear at the start of the season was that money would  
ruin golf, but not many had the Ryder Cup in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget the $134 million purse on the PGA Tour or the $5 million  
World Golf Championship events that supposedly were going to cause 
players to reduce their schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	The number that ruined golf is $63 million, the estimated  
revenue from the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate is whether the players, those ultimately responsible  
for such revenues, should get a portion of the $23 million in 
profits to give to the charity of their choice -- or whether they 
should just shut up and play. 
</P>
<P>
	But without such a shocking figure, there would be no debate at  
all. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were getting $1 million, that wouldn't change too many  
people's thoughts,'' Fred Couples said last week. ``But $63 million 
is a lot of money for a golf event, I can tell you that. I'd like 
to run it for a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before anyone suggests that U.S. players are greedy, keep in  
mind they are independent contractors whose pay is determined by 
their play. The top two players in the world, Tiger Woods and David 
Duval, each have made over $3 million this year -- 179 baseball 
players make at least that much. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the greed, does anyone really think Woods needs to be  
paid for playing in the Ryder Cup. Can anyone find where Duval ever 
said he wanted to be paid? 
</P>
<P>
	This is not about compensation, it's about control.  
</P>
<P>
	The PGA of America pumps $12.5 million into programs to ``grow  
the game of golf.'' Duval only wonders why a small portion can't go 
to a library or a soccer field in his community. 
</P>
<P>
	The precedent comes from the Presidents Cup, which allocated  
$100,000 to each player for them to designate to a charity of their 
choice. If PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem were in charge of the 
PGA of America, there probably would not have been a Tuesday night 
meeting at Medinah -- or a controversy. He specializes in putting 
out fires, and this one is out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Ryder Cup captain Tom Kite saw the first sparks two years  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the PGA after (Valderrama) they'd better do something  
to fix this situation,'' Kite told Golf World magazine. ``I'm 
surprised they didn't. Something has to happen now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Something already has.  
</P>
<P>
	The Ryder Cup is tainted by money.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Sergio Garcia put on such a show in the PGA  
Championship that the controversy was forgotten, but not for long. 
It will be there next week at the NEC Invitational, the $5 million 
event where Ryder Cup players supposedly get rewarded for making 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Americans win back the cup, they will be perceived as  
greedy. If they lose, they will be crucified. No matter the 
outcome, the Ryder Cup will be remembered for the money -- $63 
million this year, who knows how much in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to stop this is for the Americans to start beating  
the pants off Europe like they did for 50 years, when the Ryder Cup 
was about competition and not cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
	That would keep the PGA of America from raising the price tag on  
corporate hospitality, and it would keep the players from raising 
their eyebrows over where all the money is going. The PGA would 
have less to spend on the growth of golf, but the game has managed 
to survive just fine for 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
	With so much focus on money, and a backlash of disgust by the  
American public, some have suggested rooting for Europe next month 
at The Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's another alternative.  
</P>
<P>
	Go Matt Kuchar! You da man, Tom McKnight! Keep that Walker Cup  
in America. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be the most valuable cup left.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cavs Coach Hired by Turner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Fratello has returned to broadcasting -- for  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cleveland Cavaliers coach, who was fired in June,  
signed a multiyear deal with Turner Sports on Monday.

<P>
	Fratello was an NBA analyst for NBC from 1990-93 and worked for  
Turner during the playoffs from 1994-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``With NBC, I went in not having a full-time background,''  
Fratello said. ``Now I have experiences to fall back on. I have to 
get out the old tapes and try to take the good stuff and apply 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello hasn't ruled out returning to coaching.  
</P>
<P>
	``Down the road, if something is presented to you, you have to  
deal with it at the time,'' Fratello said. ``I would have to 
consider it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello replaces Doc Rivers, who became coach of the Orlando  
Magic. Rivers' primary partner was Kevin Harlan, but Turner said 
Fratello's partner hasn't been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Marv Albert is the likely choice to pair with Fratello  
since they formed the top broadcasting team at NBC for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to work with Marv again,'' Fratello said.  
``He's a special person to me and we've maintained our relationship 
throughout the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert gave Fratello the nickname ``The Czar of the  
Telestrator'' in their first season together and it has stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike's always been very TV-geared,'' Albert said. ``He's quick  
and is great with the telestrator. ... I'm very happy he's back on 
board, but I don't think there's any question that he'll be back 
coaching eventually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello spent the last six seasons with Cleveland and compiled  
a 248-212 mark before being replaced by Randy Wittman. Fratello led 
the Cavs to the playoffs four times, but had just a 2-12 record in 
the postseason and was unable to advance past the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike is a proven commodity as a television broadcaster,''  
Turner executive producer Mike Pearl said. ``His 13 years of 
coaching in the NBA give Mike a unique insight into the game that 
is essential in an analyst. He is the perfect addition to our NBA 
broadcast team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello also coached the Atlanta Hawks from 1983-1990,  
compiling a 324-250 record. He is the 18th NBA coach to win 500 
games.

<HEADLINE> ETrade To Offer After-Hours Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ETrade Group said today it will offer individual  
investors access to after-hours trading through Instinet, the 
biggest market for buying and selling stock when traditional 
exchanges are closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service would make ETrade the biggest online brokerage  
so far to provide its customers with entry to a market that until 
recently was the exclusive province of money managers and 
institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	By teaming with Instinet, a unit of Reuters PLC, ETrade is  
bringing its customers a possibly safer way to take part in a 
volatile market where stock prices can swing wildly due to limited 
demand. Since Instinet already averages 20 million shares a day in 
off-hours trading, there's more likely to be a balance of buy and 
sell orders -- and more price stability. Newer after-hours markets 
like Island ECN don't have such an established base of demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, by contrast with newer trading systems currently limited  
to Nasdaq stocks, Instinet will give ETrade customers after-hours 
access to New York Stock Exchange issues such as the 30 major 
companies in the Dow Jones industrial average and other big names. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's 1.3 million customers will not, however, have  
round-the-clock access to Instinet trading like major investors do. 
</P>
<P>
	The after-hours session, expected to be introduced in September,  
will run for 2 1/2 hours following the regular 4 p.m. close of trading 
on traditional markets like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq 
Stock Market. ETrade's regular commission rates will apply. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by ETrade follows the introduction of limited  
after-hours trading by online brokers Datek and Muriel Siebert, as 
well as an announcement by America Online that the world's biggest 
Internet service will be offering its 18 million members access to 
after-hours trading through Wit Capital later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts worry that individual investors will get hurt by  
the sharp price swings often seen in after-hours trading due to 
limited demand. For that reason, most of the brokers linking up 
with after-hours trading are requiring investors to name a specific 
price at which to buy or sell a stock. But ETrade, more confident 
about the stability of Instinet, is not requiring so-called 
``limit'' orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the new after-hours systems boast major partners, all  
of them trying to get in on the ground floor of a new market they 
hope will be as explosive as online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade and Instinet are both partners in a new trading network  
named Archipelago, along with Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. 
Goldman Sachs also owns a stake in Wit Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, brokerages Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab, and  
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette formed a joint venture with Spear, 
Leeds &AMP; Kellogg to create a new electronic market. Datek's 
after-hours trading is conducted by its Island ECN subsidiary, 
which is partly owned by Waterhouse Investor Services. 
</P>
<P>
	All the impending competition has prompted the NYSE and the  
Nasdaq Stock Market to announce that they'll introduce their 
after-hours trading sessions sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has been moving  
aggressively to become an all-in-one online financial services 
shop. The company recently entered the online banking business with 
the acquisition of Telebanc.

<HEADLINE> Sonics Sign Greg Foster for 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Greg Foster signed a three-year contract Tuesday  
with the Seattle SuperSonics, team president and general manager 
Wally Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sonics free agent forward Aaron Williams agreed to a  
two-year, $2.3 million contract with the Washington Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11 Foster, 30, was a member of Utah's 1997 and 1998  
Western Conference championship teams. He appeared in 20 playoff 
games in both years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg is a playoff-tested center who gives us another big man  
who can run, defend and shoot the ball,'' Walker said. ``His size 
and experience are welcome additions to our front court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster averaged 5.7 points and 3.5 rebounds in 78 games for the  
Jazz in 1997-98. He was originally drafted by the Washington 
Bullets in the second round of the 1990 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, from Texas-El Paso, was born in Oakland, Calif., and was  
a high school teammate of the Sonics' Gary Payton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards' power forward position has been depleted in the  
offseason by the departures of Otis Thorpe, Ben Wallace and Terry 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 28, is the first free agent Washington has signed this  
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity for me to come in there and get some  
minutes,'' the 6-foot-9 forward told The Washington Post. ``That's 
a big part of why I'm coming there. The possibility of playing some 
decent minutes was too hard to pass up. Plus the team is going to 
be a lot better than it was last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams spent the past two seasons with the Sonics, playing an  
average of 11 minutes a game. He averaged 4 points, three rebounds 
and nearly one block per game. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent the previous three seasons with Denver, Vancouver, Utah  
and Milwaukee, playing sparingly.

<HEADLINE> Ripken May Stay Longer on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken was eligible to come off the  
disabled list Tuesday, but it appears as if it will be several more 
days before he rejoins the Baltimore Orioles and resumes his quest 
for his 400th career homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken hasn't played since July 31 because of nerve irritation  
in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of showing a little patience,'' he said.  
``It continues to improve. ... The big concern is that if I start 
back too soon it could drop me back to square one. I was hopeful 
and optimistic ... that I was going to be able to play today. I'm a 
little disappointed with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that, for the moment, Ripken has dismissed back  
surgery as an option. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no indication now that that even has to be  
considered,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second stint on the disabled list this season for  
Ripken, who played in a major league record 2,632 consecutive games 
before voluntarily ending the streak last September. He had never 
been on the disabled list before this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I could will myself through things and you had some  
latitude. With this, I don't have much latitude,'' he said. ``The 
nerve irritation I feel is constant. When that goes away, that'll 
be my sign to start doing stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until that time, Orioles manager Ray Miller will continue to  
alternate Ryan Minor and Jeff Reboulet at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a little irritation there,'' Miller said.  
``Until I see him take ground balls and grab a bat, I can't make 
any predictions (when he'll be back).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken hit his 399th career homer on July 25, then went five  
straight days without a home run. He is also just 32 hits short of 
3,000.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Major Leaguer To Lead Cougars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- Vance Law, a journeyman major leaguer and  
former Brigham Young shortstop, was introduced Monday as the new 
head baseball coach of the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
	Law will succeed his former coach, Gary Pullins, who was  
reassigned as an assistant athletic director in June and served on 
the search committee that selected a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wonderful opportunity,'' Law said. ``With the  
administration's commitment to upgrade the facilities, I hope to 
make this sport self-sufficient so that the people in the community 
will want to support it just like football and basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law played at BYU from 1974-78 before his 11-year career with  
the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago White Sox, Montreal Expos, Chicago 
Cubs and Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, while with the Cubs, he was named to the National  
League All-Star team as a third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Law, who attended Provo High School, said he always hoped to  
coach at BYU. 
</P>
<P>
	``My roots are here,'' he said. ``My blood is blue.''  
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, Law has coached at Provo High, where he compiled a  
64-55 record and led the Bulldogs to a state title in 1997. He also 
served two seasons as an assistant at Utah Valley State College. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides playing baseball, Law was a guard on BYU's basketball  
team from 1975-77. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Vernon, was an All-Star and Cy Young Award winner in  
1960 with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Vernon Law was a BYU baseball 
assistant coach from 1969-79.

<HEADLINE> Court Stays Texas Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- In a case that death penalty opponents  
portrayed as a test of Gov. George W. Bush's ``compassionate 
conservatism,'' an appeals court blocked a mentally ill killer's 
execution Tuesday just four hours before he was to die. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate had said he was unlikely  
to postpone the execution of Larry Robison, who killed five people, 
including an 11-year-old boy and a lover who was beheaded, stabbed 
49 times and sexually mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
	Robison, 42, said recently he was ``like a little kid at  
Christmas'' looking forward to his lethal injection. His lawyers, 
relatives and capital-punishment opponents contended he was 
mentally ill and deserved treatment rather than death. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 5-4 ruling, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the  
state's highest criminal court, blocked Robison's execution and 
sent the question of whether he is mentally competent back to the 
trial court. State and federal courts had rejected other appeals 
challenging Robison's competency. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision effectively put the execution off for weeks, if not  
months. Prosecutors said Robison will be examined by psychiatrists 
selected by his attorneys and state lawyers and the findings will 
be presented to a trial judge in Fort Worth, who then will rule on 
the prisoner's competence. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Browne, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general,  
said it was unclear whether the state could or would appeal the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that mentally ill people could  
be executed as long as they understood the punishment and why they 
were getting it. In a concurring opinion to Tuesday's order, Judge 
Tom Price wrote that because Robison ``has long suffered from 
schizophrenia, he does not understand the nature of the punishment 
to be imposed upon him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision at least temporarily kept Bush from having to  
address calls from capital punishment opponents who demanded the 
governor, who has defined himself as a ``compassionate 
conservative,'' give Robison a 30-day reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the citizens of your state and now all  
American voters are entitled to know just how real and deep your 
sense of `compassion' reaches,'' death penalty opponent William B. 
Moffitt, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers, wrote in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who was criticized for mocking executed killer Karla Faye  
Tucker in a recent interview published in Talk magazine, has never 
issued a reprieve in nearly five years as governor -- a span that 
has seen 98 executions in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 17-0  
against recommending that Robison's sentence be commuted to life. 
That meant that Bush could do no more than grant Robison a 30-day 
reprieve to allow him more time to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, however, indicated he was unlikely to delay Robison's  
execution. He had no immediate comment after the court ruling 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Clinton found himself in a similar situation just weeks  
before the 1992 New Hampshire primary, when as governor of Arkansas 
he allowed a brain-damaged cop killer to be executed. At the time, 
some political observers said Clinton's decision to deny the man 
clemency helped him distance himself from the Democrats' liberal, 
soft-on-crime image. 
</P>
<P>
	Robison, a former construction worker, was to be the fifth Texas  
inmate to receive lethal injection this month and the 21st this 
year. Another execution is set for Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a little kid at Christmas waiting for Santa Claus  
to come,'' Robison said in a recent interview. ``I don't believe in 
death. I'm just leaving this vehicle behind. I'm moving on to new 
territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robison admitted he killed five people in neighboring cottages  
near Lake Worth in 1982. One of the victims was Rickey Lee Bryant, 
31, Robison's lover and roommate, who was shot twice in the head, 
decapitated, slashed eight times and stabbed. Robison said he ate 
the man's testicles. 
</P>
<P>
	His case was considered by many critics an example of the  
problems with the state's treatment of the mentally ill. Before the 
killings, Robison had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, 
but he was not considered violent and had been released from 
several public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, but a jury convicted  
him and sentenced him to death.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Decide Stay of Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush must decide whether  
to postpone tonight's scheduled execution of a murderer or let it 
go ahead in spite of complaints that the case demonstrates problems 
with the state's treatment of the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Robison doesn't deny the rampage 17 years ago in which  
five people were killed and says he's looking forward to his 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real excited about it and glad to be leaving here,'' he  
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But relatives of the 42-year-old and capital punishment  
opponents cite Robison as an example of why mentally ill people 
should be treated for their conditions instead of executed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the rampage, Robison had been diagnosed as a paranoid  
schizophrenic. But he was not considered violent and was released 
from a number of public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals in his case have been exhausted and the Texas Board of  
Pardons and Paroles voted unanimously last week against 
recommending to Bush that the death sentence be commuted to life. 
</P>
<P>
	The only recourse left is for Bush, who is campaigning for the  
Republican presidential nomination, to issue a one-time 30-day 
reprieve, something he never has done in his nearly five years as 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Edwards, a Bush spokeswoman, said the governor would  
announce a decision today. 
</P>
<P>
	The former construction worker from Abilene was arrested Aug.  
11, 1982, in Wichita, Kan., driving the car of 33-year-old Bruce 
Gardner of Lake Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous day, Gardner was one of five people found  
mutilated, shot or stabbed in neighboring cottages near Lake Worth. 
Also killed were Gardner's girlfriend, Georgia Ann Reed, 34; her 
mother, Earline Barker, 55; and Ms. Reed's 11-year-old son, Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	In a cottage next door, authorities found the remains of Rickey  
Lee Bryant, 31, Robison's lover and roommate, who had been shot 
twice in the head, decapitated, and stabbed 49 times. His genitals 
were found in the kitchen sink. 
</P>
<P>
	Robison pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, but a jury  
convicted him of capital murder for Gardner's slaying and sentenced 
him to death. The conviction was overturned because of an error by 
the trial judge, but Robison was retried, convicted and condemned 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Lois, who has been leading a years-long effort to  
spare her son, says neither the public nor juries understand mental 
illness and that he deserves treatment rather than death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of punishment, even death, means nothing to a  
psychotic person,'' she says. ``If we really want to stop these 
most horrendous crimes, and be safe in our homes and on our 
streets, prevention is the only answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capital punishment opponents like Amnesty International and  
religious groups, including representatives of the Vatican, have 
joined her in pleas to the governor, the parole board and others. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that mentally ill people  
could be executed as long as they understood the punishment that 
awaited them and why they were being put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Pipes, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted  
Robison, said the idea that he was insane is an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did diagnose him (as schizophrenic),'' Pipes said. ``But  
there are an awful lot of people diagnosed as schizophrenic that 
aren't killing people.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Story Over Sealed Suit Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge has withdrawn an order blocking the  
Los Angeles Daily Journal from publishing a story about a lawsuit 
that was mistakenly unsealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Reginald Dunn had refused Friday to lift another judge's  
restraining order that would have put the legal newspaper at risk 
of contempt of court if it ran the story. But Dunn reconsidered 
Monday and removed the ban, said Jonathan Levey, a lawyer for the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appellate court had asked for written arguments by  
Tuesday on whether the order violated freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit was filed June 8 in Superior Court and was  
automatically sealed for 60 days under a state law covering certain 
insurance-related cases, the Daily Journal said. The law gives 
prosecutors time to review the private claims and decide if they 
want to join the civil suit or file criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	At the district attorney's request, Dunn extended the seal for  
another 90 days on July 29. But the suit was briefly made public 
last Wednesday ``through inadvertence and clerical error,'' court 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Daily Journal reporter found the suit while reviewing court  
filings and contacted defendants, who said they were unaware of it. 
The newspaper said it was contacted Thursday by a state insurance 
fraud supervisor who confirmed that the state was conducting a 
criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper planned a story Friday, but was blocked by the  
restraining order issued late Thursday by Judge Victor Chavez.

	``Til The Medicine Takes'' (Capricorn Records) -- Widespread  
Panic 

</P>
<P>
	Coming out of the same college town that spawned R.E.M. and the  
B-52s, Widespread Panic has built a devoted following. But on ``Til 
The Medicine Takes,'' the band once hailed as the next Grateful 
Dead refocuses itself and its songs to make itself more appealing 
to pop audiences already familiar with its Athens, Ga., brethren -- 
with frustratingly mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake, the sound -- a cross between the Southern rock  
of the '70s and psychedelia of the '60s -- will be familiar to 
longtime Spreadheads. But while each tune is shortened to managable 
lengths, the album is certainly no hit-single factory. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not necessarily a bad thing, as shown on ``Climb To  
Safety.'' With its harmony, power-chord hook and ragged electric 
piano, the pulsating tale of a scary train ride is the closest 
Widespread Panic can come to even approaching a Top 40 sound while 
retaining its distinctive style. 
</P>
<P>
	At least Widespread Panic can't be faulted for trying something  
new.

	``Rough Harvest'' (Mercury Records) -- John Mellencamp  

</P>
<P>
	What appears on the surface as a throwaway project by one of the  
most prolific artists of the last two decades instead displays new 
weightiness in John Mellencamp's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Using stripped-down arrangements, Mellencamp offers socially  
challenging songs such as ``Love and Happiness'' and ``Jackie 
Brown,'' and the gravel in his voice -- the result of a lot of hard 
touring and even harder living in his early days -- doesn't do any 
harm to ``Minutes to Memories,'' a tale of an old man telling his 
life story on a bus ride through the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that it's all serious. Mellencamp covers ``Under the  
Boardwalk'' and gets the carefree tone just right.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrator Gives York $1.4 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Ottawa Senators defenseman Jason York was awarded  
a one-year, $1.4-million contract by an arbitrator today. 
</P>
<P>
	York, represented by agent Don Meehan at Friday's arbitration  
hearing, was reportedly seeking $2 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators, who notified other teams Monday that York was  
available to be traded, still can avoid following the arbitrator's 
decision by making the player an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	York, who had four goals and 31 assists in 79 games last season,  
was stunned to hear the Senators were trying to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed,'' he told the Ottawa Citizen.

<HEADLINE> Law Would Protect Computer Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A state legislator wants to create a law  
to give Pennsylvania consumers greater legal protection if their 
Apple turns into a lemon or if their IBM is DOA. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. T.J. Rooney says his computer lemon law is the first  
proposal of its kind in the nation. He said he will introduce it 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will tilt the scales in favor of the computer consumers  
who presently have the decks stacked against them,'' said Rooney. 
He would speak only in broad terms about the bill. Rooney is 
expected to announced the bill in detail Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He did say that the bill will closely follow the state's  
existing Automobile Lemon Law. Under that statute, new car dealers 
can be forced to buy back an automobile in certain cases in which a 
defect cannot be properly repaired. Similar protections were 
extended several years ago to those who buy dogs that later become 
ill under the so-called Puppy Lemon Law. 
</P>
<P>
	Most computer buyers spend more than $2,500 on a new system,  
after when adding software and components such as printers and 
scanners, Rooney said, making a computer among their top 
investments, next to a home and car. 
</P>
<P>
	And a growing number of buyers are finding that although most  
machines have warranties, some aren't worth the paper they're 
written on because of manufacturers refusing to back up their 
products, said Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have little or no recourse when dealing with  
products that don't live up to warranties,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is designed to help people like Mike Hilton of  
Bethlehem, whose purchase of a personal computer two years ago has 
turned into ``an endless nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since first plugging it in, ``Basically, every major part has  
been replaced at least once,'' said Hilton, the director of 
investor relations for Air Products and Chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the repairs were covered under warranty, Hilton said  
the computer still doesn't work right and the maker has refused to 
replace it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be something to hold manufacturers accountable  
for their products,'' said Hilton, who contacted Rooney about his 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems like those are increasing as the family computer  
becomes a necessity in most households, said Craig Thor Kimmel, a 
Montgomery County lawyer who specializes in car lemon law cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more people are getting the run-around,'' said Kimmel,  
who helped Rooney draft the legislation. Kimmel said the bill will 
provide uniform rules computer makers and retailers ``have to play 
by.''

<HEADLINE> Spinal Fracture Risk Reduced by Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A drug used to prevent osteoporosis can also  
reduce the risk of spinal fractures by up to 50 percent in women 
who already have the disease, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The research is the largest study to date of raloxifene, the  
latest in a series of drugs that postmenopausal women can take 
instead of estrogen to protect against broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women even who have fractures, who have lost inches, who are  
beginning to get some curvature, can do something about it right 
now to reduce their risk of fractures in the future,'' said Dr. 
Bruce Ettinger of Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in 
Oakland, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Ettinger led the three-year study of 7,705 women in 25  
countries. The findings were published in today's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. The research was funded by Eli Lilly 
&AMP; Co. of Indianapolis, which sells raloxifene as Evista. 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes only a month after data from the same women  
showed that raloxifene appears to lower the risk of breast cancer 
by 70 percent. That is a major advantage for postmenopausal women 
who want the bone-strengthening benefits of estrogen but fear the 
slightly increased risk of breast cancer from long-term use. 
</P>
<P>
	Raloxifene was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in  
1997. It, like other osteoporosis drugs, adds bone mineral density 
early in treatment, and thereafter slows the loss of bone mineral. 
</P>
<P>
	Ettinger said the four approved osteoporosis drugs should not be  
considered competitors, because their benefits and limitations are 
so different. For example, he said: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Alendronate, marketed as Fosamax, is the strongest bone  
builder and is the only drug shown to protect against both spine 
and hip fractures. But it offers no other health benefits and 
causes many women stomach upset. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Estrogen is almost equal to alendronate as a bone builder, and  
research suggests it also protects against heart disease and even 
mental decline for women past menopause. It relieves menopause's 
hot flashes and night sweats but commonly causes breast tenderness 
and a resumption of menstrual bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Raloxifene has about two-thirds the bone-building power of  
alendronate but does not relieve menopausal symptoms and may worsen 
some, such as leg swelling. But it seems to lower ``bad'' 
cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Calcitonin, marketed as Calcimar, is the least powerful of the  
bone-boosters but is offered in an easy-to-take nasal spray. 
</P>
<P>
	``In making a choice of which of these a woman is going to use,  
she needs to think about what else is in the package. Is it 
agreeable? Is it acceptable? Is it easy to use? Is it something 
that can be continued long-term?'' Ettinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some women, for example, may want to take estrogen in early  
menopause, then switch to raloxifene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every older woman needs a drug. Women should have their bone  
density tested or check whether they are losing height, experts 
say. More than an inch of lost height since young adulthood 
indicates osteoporosis, Ettinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study said raloxifene is a  
valuable weapon in the growing arsenal against osteoporosis, which 
afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans and costs $13.8 billion 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Hip fractures cause the most illness and death, but vertebral  
fractures are second in importance, occurring in an estimated 
700,000 Americans yearly, sometimes painlessly at first, said the 
expert, Dr. Felicia Cosman, clinical director of the National 
Osteoporosis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a tremendous impact on quality of life, in terms of  
back pain and abdominal symptoms and reduced breathing and reduced 
mobility and cosmetic deformity and the associated problems with 
the dowager's hump,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, women ages 31 to 80 years old in 25 countries were  
randomly assigned to take a placebo or raloxifene at 60 milligrams 
per day or 120 milligrams per day. All were also given calcium and 
vitamin D supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 6,828 women completed the study, and 503 (7.4  
percent) suffered at least one new spinal fracture within three 
years. That included 10.1 percent of women receiving the placebo, 
6.6 percent of those receiving lower-dose raloxifene (a 30 percent 
reduction in risk) and 5.5 percent of those receiving the higher 
dose (a 50 percent risk reduction).

<HEADLINE> Vegas To Unveil Eiffel Tower Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Even in this gambling Mecca, where megaresorts  
have assumed identities ranging from Rome to Rio, Mandalay to 
Manhattan, Venice to Egypt, the idea seemed a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-create Paris and the Eiffel Tower on the Las Vegas Strip?  
</P>
<P>
	Some scoffed at the idea three years ago when Arthur Goldberg  
announced plans for a new megaresort featuring the icons of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of lights, replicated in the city of neon lights?  
</P>
<P>
	Yet Goldberg's dream comes to fruition Sept. 1 when the $800  
million Paris Las Vegas Casino Resort opens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is to the letter like you'd find it in Paris,''  
Paul Pusateri, resort president, said as he stood in the shadow of 
the Eiffel Tower replica. ``Our goal was to capture the essence of 
Paris and have it present in every aspect of the resort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pusateri recalls meeting with Goldberg, chairman of parent Park  
Place Entertainment Corp., discussing a theme for the new resort 
they planned on a prime 24-acre patch of desert adjacent to the 
company's Bally's Las Vegas Hotel-Casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about Paris?'' Goldberg suggested.  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew as soon as we started research that this was the  
perfect theme,'' Pusateri remembered. ``And it offered the most 
powerful icon in the world, the Eiffel Tower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas may not be running out of themes, but it's stretching  
the limits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decade, the town has seen the emergence of the  
Caribbean-themed Mirage, the medieval Excalibur, the pyramid-shaped 
Luxor, the MGM Grand, pirate-themed Treasure Island, 
Mediterranean-styled Monte Carlo, Gotham knockoff New York-New 
York, Brazilian-themed Rio, Italian-themed Bellagio, two South 
Seas-styled resorts, Mandalay Bay and the Resort at Summerlin, and 
a touch of Venice in The Venetian. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989 the number of hotel rooms has nearly doubled, from  
67,390 to the present 120,000, and the annual visitor count has 
jumped from 18.1 million a decade ago to 30.6 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Powers, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and  
Visitors Authority, sees Paris fueling the current 9 percent 
increase in visitors that began with the opening of Bellagio in 
October, followed by Mandalay Bay in March and The Venetian in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paris is the latest in a series of themed properties that have  
helped to redefine the city,'' Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Ader, a casino analyst for Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., said  
investors on Wall Street had been concerned about overbuilding, but 
no longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's evidence that the Las Vegas market is growing, that  
more people are coming,'' Ader said. ``The Asian economy is 
improving and the airlines are scheduling more flights to the 
city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks that the Paris resort will be a hit.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's in a great location, the price is right, and there's  
already a buzz about it in the tourist and travel community,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Ader said, despite the $800 million price tag, relatively  
speaking it wasn't that expensive. The Bellagio, for instance, cost 
$1.6 billion to build and the Venetian cost $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're doing it in the right way, not spending a lot of  
money, which will deplete shareholder value,'' he said of Paris. 
``I think you can build a great product and not spend everything 
you have in the bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some casino executives were skeptical when Goldberg talked of  
replicating the Eiffel Tower, but the project has become one of the 
city's most striking landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Resort engineers obtained the tower's original architectural  
plans and followed them in minute detail, even bringing back paint 
chips to replicate the color. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a 225-seat gourmet French restaurant on the 11th floor  
of the tower, and an observation deck atop the 542-foot structure. 
Three of the four legs rise from inside an 85,000-square-foot 
casino that offers the aura of a Paris park setting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eiffel Tower is not the only French icon copied at Paris Las  
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Guests arrive on a circular drive featuring a two-thirds replica  
of the Arc de Triomphe. There are also copies of the Paris Opera 
House and The Louvre. And the 2,916-room, 34-story hotel replicates 
the 800-year-old Hotel de Ville, which is now the Paris City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Room rates will run $125 to $230 per night.  
</P>
<P>
	Paris is also accessible from Bally's through an area that was  
once the Celebrity Showroom, home of stars such as Sammy Davis Jr., 
Tom Jones, Barbara Mandrell, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Linked together, Bally's and Paris offer a total of 5,700 rooms.  
</P>
<P>
	On the Paris side, the floor is paved in cobblestones and  
employees greet guests and each other with ``bon jour'' and other 
salutations, the result of ``French cultural training'' given the 
4,200 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the opulent registration area is the 1,200-seat Le Theatre  
des Arts, a showroom that in January will showcase the first 
English adaptation of the hit French musical ``Notre Dame De 
Paris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And off the registration area, on the edge of the casino, a  
reminder of who pays the tab for these elegant new megaresorts. A 
row of slot machines with blinking lights beckons with the words 
``Le Jacque Pot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only in Paris -- Las Vegas, that is, not France.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Leaders May Have Stolen $1B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- More than $1 billion in  
public funds and international aid may have been stolen by top 
Muslim, Croat and Serbian officials in Bosnia, international 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The diversion of public funds emerged in a series of corruption  
reports prepared by the anti-fraud unit of the Office of the High 
Representative, said spokeswoman Alexandra Stiglmayer, confirming a 
report in The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of the High Representative is the international  
agency responsible for carrying out civilian aspects of the Dayton 
peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the money that has been lost is local taxpayers'  
money. The money has been taken from the budgets. The figure is 
probably higher than $1 billion,'' Stiglmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigations were continuing because ``corruption is  
ongoing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The corruption report is a painful one for international efforts  
to rebuild Bosnia. Donor nations have poured in $5.1 billion 
dollars since the end of the war in 1995 to reconstruct 
infrastructure and try to stitch together a viable government on 
all levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Stiglmayer said most of the information in today's Times article  
was correct. ``There are few textual mistakes in it like details, 
figures, numbers. But the overall picture is right,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The article said corruption in Bosnia is so rampant that relief  
agencies and embassies downplay the thefts for fear of discouraging 
international donors. 
</P>
<P>
	The American-led anti-fraud unit named several officials with  
ties to the governing nationalist parties, accusing them of 
profiting from the fraud, the Times said. Although 15 officials 
have been dismissed by the High Representative or have been blocked 
from holding office, most retain authority, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which has not been made public, cites one incident  
in which 10 foreign embassies and international aid agencies lost 
more than $20 million deposited in a Bosnian bank. Only the Swiss 
Embassy has publicly acknowledged the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Times, the OHR's anti-fraud unit is  
investigating 220 cases of alleged fraud and corruption. The 
pilfered funds were meant to help rebuild Bosnia's roads, buildings 
and schools and to provide municipal services in towns across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Alija Izetbegovic, who is the Muslim member of the three-man  
Bosnian presidency, and other top nationalist leaders repeatedly 
have dismissed allegations of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Many key Bosnian leaders were said to be on vacation and could  
not be reached for comment on the reports. The Croat member of the 
three-member presidency, Ante Jelavic, had seen the Times article 
but had no comment, his aide Zeljana Zovko said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the vice president of the country's biggest opposition  
party, the Social Democrats, urged the Office of the High 
Representative to release the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, the Social Democrats have been asking for a  
report on the corruption issue,'' Sead Avdic said. ``It is clear 
that corruption is ongoing in this country and Bosnian citizens 
need to know about all details.''

<HEADLINE> European Share Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European shares closed mostly higher Tuesday, with  
banking and financial services shares gaining support from U.S. 
consumer price data. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Ciba Specialty Chemicals fell 4 percent to 120 Swiss  
francs, however, after the company released weaker-than-expected 
first-half results. The investment bank Paribas said it was 
maintaining its sell stance on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of bad news from Ciba, some observers said the chemical  
sector might have bottomed out in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the U.S. on a steady noninflationary growth path, Asia  
recovering and European economies picking up, we believe the 
recovery in chemicals is at hand,'' said Jeremy Batstone, head of 
research at NatWest Stockbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. July consumer price index showed an increase of 0.3  
percent, which is what the market expected, and that eased some 
concern about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies closed up  
0.5 points at 306.28. The chemicals index was the worst performer, 
with a drop of 1 percent, while the insurance index was the best, 
up 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In France, Paribas rose 2.4 percent and Banque Nationale de  
Paris moved up 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	French regulatory authorities were meeting later Tuesday and  
again next week to decide on the future of all three banks, 
following BNP's six-month battle to gain full control of Paribas 
and Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed up 1.80 points at 
320.82. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index ended up 23.21 points at 
3,747.89, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed up 8.55 points at 
3,679.79. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index closed up 0.05  
percent to 5,259.91 the Paris CAC-40 index rose 0.5 percent to 
4,479.75 and London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index slumped 
1.1 percent to 6,166.40.

<HEADLINE> Jet Makes Belly Landing in Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Eight people escaped injury when a business jet  
landed at McCarran International Airport with its wheels up Tuesday 
evening after the landing gear failed to lock in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet was en route from Cherry Hills, N.J., to Las Vegas and  
carried two pilots, a company president, his wife and their four 
children, McCarran spokesman John Hanks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Names were not immediately released.  
</P>
<P>
	Hanks said the pilot reported the landing gear on the two-engine  
Beech Hawker-Sidley would not lock in place as the craft approached 
Las Vegas, where the family planned to vacation. The plane made two 
passes above the airport control tower to make sure the gear was 
not down, then circled to burn fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanks said the plane landed on its belly and skidded to a stop  
as emergency vehicles followed the craft. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight on board walked away uninjured, Hanks said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mutual funds that focus on technology pose a  
dilemma for investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Should they shoot for the moon and put money in funds that  
invest primarily in volatile Internet stocks? Or should they play 
it safe by investing in broad-based technology funds that may

technology firms, such as Microsoft Inc. and Intel Inc? 
</P>
<P>
	What it basically comes down to is: ``How much emotional risk  
and pocketbook risk is the investor willing to endure?'' said Geoff 
Bobroff, an East Greenwich, R.I.-based mutual fund consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	The two opposing sides of the technology dilemma were never more  
apparent than earlier this month, when Internet stocks, which had 
been slipping gradually for months, suddenly fell, dragging down 
the performances of funds that track them. 
</P>
<P>
	One such fund, Monument's Internet Fund, fell 37 percent between  
mid-April, when many Internet stocks had reached all-time highs, 
and Aug. 4, when it looked like the bottom had fallen out. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the WWW Internet fund, a broader fund whose portfolio  
includes a number of time-tested companies -- such as Microsoft 
Corp., Intel Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. -- fell just 20 percent 
during the same period, according to Morningstar Inc., a Chicago 
firm that tracks mutual fund performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, WWW Internet was considered a ``real laggard when  
Internet stocks were going great guns'' early in 1999, said 
Christine Benz, domestic equity fund editor at Morningstar. 
</P>
<P>
	In the not-too-distant past, the phenomenal rise of unproven  
Internet stocks wouldn't have posed a problem for investors and 
fund managers. The stocks probably would have been ignored, 
according to longtime fund watchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual funds were generally considered long-term investments,  
and consequently the portfolios generally stuck to companies whose 
futures were essentially guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's no longer the case.  
</P>
<P>
	There are now over 7,500 mutual funds to select from, up from  
564 in 1980, according to the Investment Company Institute, an 
industry trade group in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The public's growing appetite for mutual funds has allowed fund  
companies to become creative, spawning numerous funds that focus 
primarily on thin slices of the overall market, such as the 
Internet sector. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the focus of mutual funds become more concentrated,  
investors have increasingly had to decide whether they want their 
investments to grow slowly and steadily, or rapidly and with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobroff said there are several risks inherent to investing in  
narrowly focused stock funds. For instance, investors tend to flee 
sectors all at once, he said, driving down stocks in that sector 
across the board, which means that a mutual fund that is narrow in 
focus will plummet if that group becomes unpopular for whatever 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The downsides can be very dramatic,'' Bobroff said.  
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, Internet stocks are particularly vulnerable to wild  
swings because they are a favorite target of so-called day traders, 
or amateur investors who play the market on the Internet and try to 
make money by buying and selling shares of rapidly moving stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Another advantage to broad-based technology funds is that if  
investors pull their money out of the Internet sector, it is likely 
to be shifted into some other technology sector, said Bobroff, 
which means a broad-based technology mutual fund will hold up 
better if one area of the technology sector falls out of favor.

<HEADLINE> Lehman, Pate Named to Ryder Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- The team is filled, and a week of  
controversy over. Now the real fun begins for Ben Crenshaw and his 
U.S. Ryder Cup squad. 
</P>
<P>
	If Crenshaw thought a week of bickering and posturing that left  
him looking weary and harried was tough, he knows the upcoming ones 
will be even tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll still be losing a lot of sleep this month,'' Crenshaw  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw's picks of Tom Lehman and Steve Pate to complete the  
Ryder Cup team that meets Europe on Sept. 24-26 said a lot about 
the kind of player he wants on the American team that will try to 
break a losing streak dating back to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sick and tired of losing,'' Lehman said. ``I feel an  
urgency to get it right this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Precisely the type of attitude Crenshaw was looking for when he  
named Lehman to the team Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an attitude shared by Pate, somewhat of a surprise  
selection as Crenshaw's second captain's pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very fierce competitor who will walk through a wall for  
you if you ask him to,'' Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Crenshaw was looking for a certain type of player to add to a  
team split apart during the PGA Championship by bickering over 
Ryder Cup play, he got it in Lehman and Pate, who don't figure to 
be complaining much about the $5,000 stipends they get for the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if he can only get Tiger Woods, David Duval, Mark O'Meara  
and Phil Mickelson to keep quiet, he has a chance at a unified 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	With the team now complete, Crenshaw believes the healing  
process has also begun. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing is behind us,'' Crenshaw said. ``Regardless of what  
happened this week and how it happened, we have to be a team. 
Boston is right around the corner. Unification is a big part of 
this, and it's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw will try to unify the team further when team members  
gather Aug. 30 at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., for a day 
of practice on the course that will host the matches Sept. 24-26. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and O'Meara won't be there -- they had prior commitments --  
but the rest of the Ryder Cup squad will get together to try and 
figure out the course in advance of the matches with the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said both Woods and O'Meara have promised to get to the  
course and play it on their own before the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The practice session is very important,'' Crenshaw said.  
``This is a very special place we are playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman, who has a 3-2-2 record while playing on the 1995 and  
1997 teams that lost the cup, predicted a team headed by Woods and 
Duval and featuring the likes of Payne Stewart, Davis Love III and 
Phil Mickelson will be formidable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty stacked team from top to bottom,'' Lehman said.  
``If we can all get focused in the right direction, we'll be tough 
to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw agreed, saying his toughest job will be deciding how to  
pair his players in the matches that precede the singles matches on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have an extremely difficult process of partnering  
these guys,'' he said. ``It's a very well rounded team.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Releases Media Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft on Tuesday released a major  
upgrade of its software designed to play sound and video as it is 
sent in ``streams'' over the Internet. It's the company's latest 
bid to capture some of the customer base held by Seattle competitor 
RealNetworks. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, Windows Media Technologies 4.0, offers the sound  
quality of a compact disc and better video quality than in previous 
versions, said Will Poole, general manager of marketing and 
business development for Microsoft's streaming media division. 
</P>
<P>
	The software allows users to download music from the Internet as  
computer files. It allows greater compression than MP3, a format 
backed by RealNetworks, meaning it creates smaller files and uses 
less computer memory per song. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Music and Warner Music Group are offering digital Internet  
downloads of some artists' music using the Microsoft software. 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks, whose RealPlayer G2 software holds a commanding  
lead in number of users, doesn't view the upgrade as a major 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're always trying to play catch up, and they're always  
three steps behind,'' RealNetworks spokesman Jay Wampold said. 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks' share of streaming media usage runs from 65  
percent to 85 percent, depending on how the market is evaluated. 
Poole estimated that by the end of the year, half of all users 
would be using Microsoft's technology.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is viewed favorably by  
more than two-thirds of blacks overall and by three-of-four blacks 
in the South, according to a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, the Democratic front-runner in the presidential contest,  
was viewed favorably by 69 percent of blacks and unfavorably by 17 
percent, according to a poll released Monday by the Joint Center 
for Political and Economic Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey was viewed favorably by  
41 percent of blacks, unfavorably by 11 percent. Forty-two percent 
said they didn't know enough about him to say. Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, the Republican front-runner, was viewed favorably by 43 
percent and unfavorably by 34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of the presidential contest, the support among blacks  
for Al Gore is significant, especially in the South,'' said David 
Bositis, senior political analyst for the center. Blacks make up a 
large percentage of Democratic primary voters in many Southern 
states, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, two-thirds of blacks considered themselves Democrats  
and about a fourth considered themselves independent, while 5 
percent said they were Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were based on telephone interviews with 900 black  
adults. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 
percentage points.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- With Lamar Alexander out of the  
presidential race, George W. Bush was endorsed Tuesday by 
Alexander's Tennessee campaign manager -- Gov. Don Sundquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundquist is the 22nd governor to back Bush's bid for the  
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gov. Bush is a proven leader who has the unique ability to  
unite people and accomplish success,'' he said at a news conference 
in his Capitol office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundquist had been Tennessee campaign manager for Alexander, who  
dropped out of the crowded GOP presidential primary field Monday 
after a disappointing sixth-place finish in Iowa's straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bush ``is my choice now. Lamar was my choice. I talked  
to him yesterday and he had no problem with this. I've known George 
W. for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush called Sundquist ``a valued colleague and a good, close  
friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after the news conference ended, Sundquist said he  
received a thank-you call from former President Bush, father of the 
Texas governor.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Oxford Union invited Republican  
presidential candidates Steve Forbes and George W. Bush to debate 
in England next October. Forbes said yes Tuesday, but Bush 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students of Oxford would love to see such an event, as  
American politics has become even more popular than British 
politics in Oxford,'' Ben Seifert, president of the Oxford Union 
wrote Forbes. He proposed a debate the week of Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Accepting the invitation, Forbes said, ``We need a real  
discussion about America's role in the new global economy and the 
post-Cold War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the Texas governor would not  
attend. ``In the month of October, you're more likely to find him 
in a place like Londonderry, N.H.,'' she said. New Hampshire holds 
the first-in-the-nation primary.

<HEADLINE> Smith Inks 1-Year Deal With T'Wolves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Joe Smith loves playing alongside Kevin  
Garrett and he likes the direction the Minnesota Timberwolves are 
heading. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely could have gotten a better deal elsewhere, but  
this wasn't about my financial state,'' Smith said Tuesday after 
signing a one-year, $2.2 million contract with the Wolves. ``When I 
came here last year I wanted to put the fun back in the game and be 
on a team that plays hard every night. I found that here. I like 
playing with Kevin and I like playing for Flip Saunders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith said he didn't seek a long-term deal in case things  
don't work out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just protecting myself,'' he said. ``Obviously, this is a  
place I want to be for a long time. But I just want to see what 
happens this year. Last year we had a pretty good season but were 
knocked out in the first round of the playoffs'' by the eventual 
champion San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was my first playoff experience, and that left a bitter  
taste in my mouth,'' said Smith, the No. 1 overall choice in the 
1995 draft when he was selected by the Golden State Warriors. ``I 
thought we could have made something happen in the playoffs and we 
didn't. That made me want to come back this year, sign a one-year 
deal and now let's see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said a major factor in his decision was the chance to play  
alongside Garnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just brings so much excitement to the game,'' Smith said.  
``He tries to make everybody around him better, and that's really 
hard to find nowadays. Usually, the main guy on a team is the main 
guy and he's going to take the shots and get the ball. Kevin wants 
to see other guys do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith acknowledged that it would be nice to sign an extension  
during the upcoming season ``so I don't have to go through this for 
the third summer in a row. But I'm going to be patient and see if 
things work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Smith said, the one-year contract inspires him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing it's a one-year deal weighing on me is going to make  
me go out there and strive that much more,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith appeared in 43 games for the Timberwolves last season,  
averaging 13.7 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks as a replacement 
for Tom Gugliotta. He ranked ninth in the league in offensive 
rebounding with 3.6 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors traded Smith to the Philadelphia 76ers on Feb. 17,  
1998, and he signed with the Wolves as a free agent last season.

<HEADLINE> `Sesame Street' Researcher Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Edward L. Palmer, one of the minds behind  
``Sesame Street'' and other children's educational programs, has 
died of prostate cancer at 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who died Aug. 1 in Ithaca, was among the first people  
hired in 1968 by Children's Television Workshop, parent company of 
``Sesame Street,'' and his research gave the producers insights 
into how to hold preschoolers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer found that children enjoyed watching other children and  
animals, loved music and slapstick, wanted characters to be kind to 
each other and were bored by adult talking heads. That led to the 
development of enormously popular characters such as Big Bird and 
Grover on ``Sesame Street,'' which first aired in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a remarkable contribution both to our company and to  
the field of educational media,'' Shalom Fisch, vice president for 
program research at Children's Television Workshop, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was, to a great degree, the one who figured out how to  
build educational content into television for young children in a 
way that's beneficial and entertaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer earned a doctorate in education from Michigan State  
University. 
</P>
<P>
	He was vice president for research at Children's Television  
Workshop for 16 years and senior research fellow for three. He 
helped develop several programs for adults and three other 
well-known children's shows: ``Electric Company,'' ``3-2-1 
Contact'' and ``Ghostwriter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving Children's Television Workshop in 1987, Palmer  
served as a consultant for Search for Common Grounds, a nonprofit 
peace organization. He worked to create children's programming to 
promote peaceful conflict resolution in war-torn countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer also founded his own media consulting firm, World Media  
Partners, in Philadelphia. He wrote a 1988 book, ``Television and 
America's Children: A Crisis of Neglect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer held several university appointments, including one at  
Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology, where he designed a model for 
evaluating the success of a program in which children and teachers 
observed birds at feeders.

<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Carlos Cachaca, whose graceful,  
bittersweet compositions helped bring samba out of the slums to 
become Brazil's most popular music, died Monday of pneumonia. He 
was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners flocked to his wake at the rehearsal hall of the  
Mangueira samba school, Brazil's best-known carnival group, which 
Cachaca helped to found in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
	Cachaca, whose real name was Carlos Moreira de Castro, began  
composing in 1923, when samba was still largely unknown. He picked 
up his nickname from the cane liquor that animated the late-night 
samba sessions at the Mangueira hill shantytown, or ``favela.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His compositions spoke of life in the favelas, and were  
initially frowned on by much of Brazilian society. Among his 
best-known works was Alvorada -- ``Dawn'' in Portuguese -- written in 
partnership with the composer Cartola. It begins: ``Dawn, on the 
hill, such beauty, no one weeps in sadness, no one feels 
bitterness.''

	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Hugh Casson, the former president of the Royal  
Academy and the artistic mentor of Prince Charles, died Sunday 
after a long illness. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Always modest about his own abilities, Casson headed Britain's  
oldest and most prestigious art society from 1976 to 1984. But he 
first started molding Britain's artistic taste decades earlier upon 
his 1948 appointment as director of architecture for the Festival 
of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Born on May 23, 1910, Casson was educated at St. John's College,  
Cambridge. After graduating, he went to Greece as a Craven Scholar 
at the British School in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to England in 1937 and set up a private  
architectural practice with the late Christopher Nicholson. World 
War II intervened, and Casson served as a camouflage officer in the 
Air Ministry from 1940 to 1944.

affiliated with the New York University medical school, died 
Thursday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Cohlan retired from private practice and as a professor  
of pediatrics at what is now NYU's Tisch Hospital, where he once 
was head of the Department of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1950s, Cohlan discovered the birth-deforming  
effects of too much vitamin A in a pregnant woman's diet. He 
published his findings in 1953 in the journal Science. 
</P>

University of Florida's medical college whose research led to the 
development of a top-selling drug for glaucoma, died Sunday after a 
long illness. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	He gained international recognition for his pioneering  
investigation of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase and its role 
in fluid production and flow in the eyes, brain, spinal cord and 
lymph system. 
</P>
<P>
	His discoveries paved the way for the development of new drugs  
to treat heart and kidney disease, brain fluid disorders, altitude 
sickness and glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest and most visible outcome of his research is an eye  
drop called Trusopt, which was released by Merck &AMP; Co. in 1995.

</P>
<P>
	Pacea, famed for his simple oil paintings in vivid color, was  
inspired by peasant women, shepherds, birds, flowers and other 
symbols of the Romanian countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, he participated in numerous exhibitions in  
cities all over the world. His last exhibition was at Bucharest's 
National Art Museum in 1996.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Tang Tsou, a leading expert on modern China who  
was admired for his strong sense of intellectual curiosity, died 
Aug. 7. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsou was a longtime political science professor at the  
University of Chicago. Born in Guangzhou, China, he came to the 
University of Chicago as a student in 1941. He earned his Ph.D. in 
1951 and retired as the Homer J. Livingston Professor in Political 
Science in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	During his years in Chicago, Tsou developed a reputation as an  
independent thinker. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of his six books, ``America's Failure in China:  
1941-1950,'' Tsou took on leaders in the United States, as well as 
in mainland China and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The professor argued that ``the Nationalist government lost to  
the communists in the Chinese Civil War because the Nationalist 
government was corrupt and riven by infighting,'' said Dali Yang, a 
professor at the University of Chicago.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A TV station and sheriff's detective have  
been cleared by jurors of liability in a defamation lawsuit brought 
by a woman portrayed on the air as the leading suspect in the 
slaying of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Terri Stokes had contended that Anoka County homicide detective  
Tom Johnson, WCCO-TV and the syndicated program ``American 
Journal'' falsely accused her in 1994 of being the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Stokes nor anyone else has been charged in the 1993  
slaying of Dennis Stokes, a 3M Co. executive, who was in bed at his 
home near suburban Forest Lake when he was killed by two shotgun 
blasts to his face. The gun was never found. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was closely watched by attorneys for news  
organizations, who saw it as a challenge to the freedom of an 
officer to express his opinions and the right of news organizations 
to report on comments by public officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson told WCCO-TV and ``American Journal'' in separate 1994  
interviews that he believed Terri Stokes killed her husband. He 
testified during the trial that he still thinks she did it. WCCO's 
report specifically said there was no proof of Stokes' guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the jury ruled in favor of the station, the detective  
and Anoka County, a majority of the jurors voted that Stokes had 
been defamed. However, they decided that the defendants did not 
knowingly make false statements or act recklessly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won the heart of the case, and the heart of the case was  
whether our comments were done with reckless disregard for the 
truth, and they were not,'' said Jan McDaniel, WCCO's vice 
president and general manager. WCCO is owned and operated by 
CBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes' attorney, Joe Friedberg, said Tuesday's verdict  
vindicates Stokes even though she won't get any money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury found that she did not have anything to do with the  
crime,'' Friedberg said. ``If we tried this case for money, we 
lost. If we tried it for vindication, we won,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he doesn't anticipate an appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	New York-based King World Productions, which produces ``American  
Journal,'' settled with Stokes before the trial. Terms weren't 
disclosed.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Politicians Foster Bigotry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sen. John McCain blamed ``sharp and  
intolerant'' rhetoric in American politics for encouraging the kind 
of bigotry that caused a white supremacist's shooting rampage at a 
Jewish community center here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us in public office bear the burden of blame for this  
tragedy,'' the Republican presidential candidate said Monday at a 
lunch sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League less than a week 
after the shooting that left five wounded, including three boys 
ages 5 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our rhetoric is too sharp and intolerant. Our differences are  
defined with too much venom. Partisanship is all-consuming,'' the 
Arizona senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a political climate has bred deep public distrust of  
government and an unraveling of patriotism, he said, and Americans 
are seeking other values to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people quit seeing themselves as part of something  
greater than self-interest, and the bonds of community are severed 
by cynicism, the virtues of shared national purpose give way to the 
temptations of selfishness, bigotry and hate,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not single out officeholders or political fights.  
</P>
<P>
	Pressed in an interview for an example of a conflict that  
exemplified such an acrimonious atmosphere, McCain recalled the 
nomination a decade ago of former Sen. John Tower for defense 
secretary. Tower's reputation as a ladies' man with a fondness for 
drink dogged him, and the Senate refused to confirm him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They basically crucified him on unfounded charges,'' McCain  
said. ``They destroyed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, McCain derided ``easy answers to complicated  
questions'' after shootings like the one at the Jewish community 
center last Tuesday that left five wounded and a Filipino-American 
postal worker dead a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Such attacks lead politicians to blame easy access to guns,  
violence-obsessed media and hate-group Internet sites, McCain said. 
``But despite our common yearning for an instant solution, each of 
us knows that there's no law that will make all this better,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, McCain said recent shooting sprees, such as the  
Jewish center attack and the one that left 15 dead at Columbine 
High School in Littleton, Colo., in April, have altered his views 
on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Issues or proposals that a year or two ago I would reject out  
of hand, I would at least pay attention and consider some of 
them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he favors outlawing cheaply made handguns called  
Saturday night specials, but added any proposal would raise 
questions about how to define such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	He also favors requiring safety locks on certain guns, and said  
he was intrigued by new technology that electronically identifies a 
person handling a gun, allowing only the owner to fire it.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Sign Kicker Norm Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Searching for more consistency on long  
field goals, the Philadelphia Eagles waived placekicker Chris 
Boniol on Tuesday and signed veteran Norm Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles signed Johnson to a two-year deal. Terms were not  
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the league's best kickers, Johnson, 39, is entering his  
18th NFL season after a four-year stint with the Pittsburgh 
Steelers. Johnson has made 348 of 452 field-goal attempts (77.0 
percent) and 613 of 620 extra point attempts (98.3 percent) to rank 
sixth on the NFL's career scoring list with 1,657 points. He hasn't 
missed a point-after kick since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 career postseason games, Johnson has connected on 20 of 26  
field goals and 34 of 35 extra points. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Johnson was 26-of-31 overall and 11-of-14 from 40  
through 49 yards. Boniol was 7-of-20 from 40-49 yards the last two 
seasons with the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Norm, we felt, has proven his consistency and so we decided to  
bring him in and compete with David Akers for that position,'' 
coach Andy Reid said. ``It's an open competition as long as we keep 
Akers here. Obviously, we're bringing Norm in hoping that he is the 
guy.''

<HEADLINE> Two More Prison Escapes in Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Inmates in Pennsylvania prisons were  
ordered confined to their cells around the clock after the escape 
of prisoners just two weeks following the escape of a murderer from 
a different institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison officials said they noticed Monday that convicted  
murderer Michael McCloskey, 43, and arsonist Anthony Yang, 31, were 
missing from the medium-security State Correctional Institution at 
Dallas in eastern Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The escapes came as authorities continued to search for Norman  
Johnston, a four-time killer who broke out of the maximum-security 
State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon on Aug. 2 after 
cutting his way through a cell window and two security fences. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon Monday, Gov. Tom Ridge had ordered the  
lockdown of the entire prison system. Inmates will be confined to 
their cells indefinitely and all recreational and educational 
programs will be canceled. Meals will be served to prisoners in 
their cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unacceptable,'' Ridge said. ``I have directed  
Secretary (Martin) Horn to begin an immediate check of every 
security system at every one of our 24 institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections officials could not immediately say how the two  
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was convicted in 1980 of killing four teen-agers to  
cover up a multimillion-dollar burglary ring he ran with his two 
brothers. The film ``At Close Range,'' starring Sean Penn, was 
based on the case.

<HEADLINE> Outlaws Gang Members Arrested in NC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Eleven members of the Outlaws Motorcycle  
Club of North Carolina were arrested Tuesday on racketeering, 
firearms and drug conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are continuing to place special emphasis on the targeting  
of allegedly violent drug organizations,'' U.S. Attorney Mark 
Calloway said after the arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	An indictment was returned on Aug. 4 by a federal grand jury; it  
remained sealed until the arrests were made Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment charged individuals, described by authorities as  
current or former members of the motorcycle gang, with conspiracy 
to distribute methamphetamine, LSD, cocaine, marijuana and Valium. 
Gang members were accused of possessing and distributing the drugs 
in Mecklenburg County since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the 11 defendants face maximum penalties up to  
life in prison, a $4 million fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were part of an ongoing federal probe named  
``Operation Speedball'' in which 33 people, including those 
arrested Tuesday, have been charged.

<HEADLINE> Firestone Shutdown Blamed on Crisis / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The Firestone Agricultural Tire Co.  
plant near Des Moines is blaming a one-week shutdown on the farm 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Depressed farm income has forced many farmers to cut back on  
equipment purchases, said Harvey Siegelman of the Iowa Economic 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The Firestone shutdown has idled about 1,300 production workers.  
And a union official said plant managers are looking for 234 
volunteers willing to be laid off from Sept. 1 to Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Bianchi, president of United Steelworkers of America Local  
310, said about 50 other union members are already on a temporary 
voluntary layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Bianchi said. ``But I don't know what you do.  
The poor farmers have been taking a beating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most operations at the plant were shut down this week to reduce  
inventory and help bring production in line with reduced demand. 
Production is scheduled to resume Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most laid-off workers can get about 80 percent of their normal  
pay through a combination of state unemployment and supplemental 
pay from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, a division of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., based in  
Nashville, Tenn., makes large and small tires for farm equipment 
manufacturers, including Deere &AMP; Co. of Moline, Ill. The factory 
also makes individual tires sold by retail dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Deere on Tuesday reported that its third-quarter earnings had  
taken a 76 percent plunge from the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Deere announced that its major farm-equipment plants,  
which include factories in Ankeny, Waterloo and Ottumwa, were 
scheduled to be shut down for about 25 percent of the working days 
through Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Deere recently announced retirement incentives for employees at  
its three Iowa factories, said Ken Golden, company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the cause of that is the continuing downturn of the  
ag economy,'' Golden said. 
</P>

<P>
	BELTSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- So far, this corn defies the drought, and  
it has hairy vetch to thank. 
</P>
<P>
	The legume is the key to sustaining the green sweet-corn plants  
that tower six feet above protective organic mulch in a government 
cornfield in Beltsville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Hairy vetch, a legume grown as a cover crop, forms a dense mat  
that lets rain or irrigation water seep in rather than flow across 
fields and erode the soil. The mulch also slows evaporation and 
supplies natural nitrogen fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7,000-acre Beltsville Agricultural Research Center now uses  
hairy vetch to grow much of the corn needed for its livestock. 
Researchers have already developed vetch systems for tomatoes--now 
being adopted by some growers--and are testing similar cover crops 
with peppers, cantaloupes, snap beans and other vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic mulch is vital to the center's program in sustainable  
agriculture--that is, farming in ways both economical and 
environmentally friendly, and relying on renewable resources. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why biodiesel is the newest contribution to Beltsville's  
seven-year-old sustainable farming program. Beginning this month, 
biodiesel, a mix of 20 percent soybean oil and 80-percent regular 
diesel fuel, will power all farm and road crew diesel vehicles on 
the center's 6,000-acre east side. Researchers will compare the two 
fuels for engine performance and wear. The program is part of a 
federal effort to reduce reliance on petroleum while creating new 
markets for U.S. crops.

<HEADLINE> PBS Celebrates Female Songwriters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- These titles have something special in common:  
``Don't Blame Me,'' ``Willow Weep for Me,'' ``My Silent Love'' and 
``Can't We Be Friends?'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are song standards from the 1920s and '30s, but there's  
more. At a time popular song writing was dominated by men, the 
tunes were created by women. 
</P>
<P>
	Those gifted women, lyricist Dorothy Fields and composers Ann  
Ronell, Dana Suesse and Kay Swift, are the subject of ``Yours for a 
Song: the Women of Tin Pan Alley,'' to be seen on PBS at 9 p.m. 
Wednesday as part of the American Masters series. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Women of Tin Pan Alley'' has eye-catching film clips of  
performances by Ella Fitzgerald, Joan Morris with Max Morath, 
Rosemary Clooney, Frank Sinatra, Robert White, Irene Dunne and Fred 
Astaire. One clip shows Fields with Perry Como. Michael Feinstein 
and Betty Buckley are featured in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The show begins with ``I Can't Give You Anything but Love,  
Baby,'' Fields' first hit, written with composer Jimmy McHugh for 
the Broadway revue, ``Lew Leslie's Blackbirds of 1928.'' Fields' 
son, jazz pianist David Lahm, says she had about 450 songs 
published. When she died at 69, a new show with her lyrics was 
running on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Suesse, who also wrote classical music -- two piano concertos  
were commissioned by Paul Whiteman -- is chiefly known for ``You 
Oughta Be in Pictures,'' ``My Silent Love'' and ``The Night Is 
Young and You're So Beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronell was the first woman to compose and conduct for films. Her  
``Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf'' and ``Willow Weep for Me'' 
have endured. 
</P>
<P>
	Swift's still-popular songs are ``Can't We Be Friends?'' ``Can  
This Be Love?'' and ``Fine and Dandy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swift, married three times, also had a long affair with George  
Gershwin, beginning in 1925 or '26, according to Katharine Swift 
Weber, her granddaughter, a novelist who teaches writing at Yale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day she'd leave her fancy townhouse and go across town  
to be rehearsal pianist for `A Connecticut Yankee.' George got her 
that job,'' Weber says. Swift began writing popular music, and so 
did her first husband, James Paul Warburg, a banker. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandfather wrote lyrics for all her songs in that period,  
as Paul James,'' Weber says. ``It has always struck me that my 
grandfather may have thought if he couldn't hold on to his wife, 
maybe Paul James could. My grandparents wrote a Broadway musical, 
`Fine and Dandy,' in 1930, the first Broadway musical with a 
complete score by a woman. They wrote romantic songs; it's a 
touching monument to both of them trying to stay together. But her 
pull to Gershwin was too great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her grandparents divorced in 1935, and shortly afterward  
Gershwin left New York for Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``She sacrificed her career for Gershwin. She was at every  
rehearsal of `Porgy and Bess' and traveled with `Porgy' productions 
after his death,'' says Weber, who would love to see ``Fine and 
Dandy'' revived. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields' son Lahm says his mother's songs, all written for  
Broadway shows or movies, sought ``to bring a plot a step forward 
(and) ... tell an audience more about a character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Fields started writing lyrics, witty verse was in vogue  
around New York, Lahm says. ``The American musical, radio and 
recording were coming alive. Music was something young people were 
excited about because it fit their need to have a world of their 
own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fields showed songwriter J. Fred Coots her song lyrics at a  
party and he introduced her to McHugh, Lahm says. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote for 10 years with McHugh, then went to Hollywood and  
wrote movie musicals. Three of her seven were written with Jerome 
Kern: ``Swing Time,'' ``I Dream Too Much'' and ``The Joy of 
Living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She went back to Broadway and wrote ``Stars in Your Eyes,'' for  
Jimmy Durante and Ethel Merman, with Arthur Schwartz, ``Up in 
Central Park'' with Sigmund Romberg and ``Arms and the Girl'' with 
Morton Gould. She co-wrote the book of ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' as 
well as a TV spectacular, ``Junior Miss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lahm, who writes songs for a cabaret act he does with his wife  
and whose latest CD is of Joni Mitchell songs, remains his mother's 
admirer. 
</P>
<P>
	He says, ``I look up to the sky and say, `Where are you now that  
I really need some help?'''

<HEADLINE> Several Injured in NM Prison Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESTANCIA, N.M. (AP) -- A disturbance at a private prison Tuesday  
forced authorities to call in a SWAT team and led to the injuries 
of three inmates and two guards, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was seriously injured, Sgt. Robert Holguin said. There  
were no escapes. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 75 inmates were involved in the disturbance at the  
prison 55 miles southeast of Albuquerque. Holguin said the inmates 
were contained by 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Holguin did not know what triggered the disturbance.  
</P>
<P>
	The prison is operated by Corrections Corporation of America,  
based in Nashville, Tenn., Holguin said. The CCA did not return 
calls placed by The Associated Press late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison, with 250 employees, houses about 500 inmates, mostly  
federal prisoners. Only about 70 of the inmates are state 
prisoners, Corrections Department spokesman Gerges Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 percent of New Mexico's 4,720 male inmates are housed  
in private prisons operated either in Estancia by CCA or in Hobbs 
or Santa Rosa by Florida-based Wackenhut Corrections Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first year, the Hobbs prison has been the site of three  
inmate stabbing deaths, six nonfatal stabbings, a near-riot and 
incidents of guards allegedly using excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections Secretary Rob Perry last week said the state was  
implementing a management plan for all prisons in New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> FAA Grounds Some Medical Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government this month effectively grounded  
over 20 percent of the helicopters that hospitals use to transport 
critically ill patients, following the fatal crash of a medevac 
chopper near Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emergency airworthiness directive issued Aug. 6, the  
Federal Aviation Administration said older models of the Eurocopter 
BK 117 could not be flown in the United States until the 
helicopters' tension-torsion straps -- four bands in the main rotor 
head -- were replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 choppers were affected. There are an estimated 250 to  
280 medical helicopters in the United States, according to Rocky 
Mountain Helicopters of Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which claims the largest collection of BK 117s in  
the country, initially calculated that the grounding would put 30 
to 40 people daily at risk because medical helicopters transport 
the most seriously injured people. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rocky Mountain and its competitors were largely able to  
substitute helicopters and move around aircraft to compensate for 
the loss of BK 117s, so there was little actual effect on public 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a little uncomfortable as they started this  
(grounding) process that they were prematurely parking a number of 
aircraft on a perceived risk versus a known risk to the patients,'' 
said Karl Poulsen, head of aviation services at Rocky Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	An FAA spokeswoman said the agency did not publicize the  
grounding because it affected only about 60 helicopters, the bulk 
of which were concentrated in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just felt like, for the impact it had on the total fleet,  
it didn't warrant a press release,'' said agency spokeswoman Alison 
Duquette. ``It wasn't like (the order) was grounding every EMS 
helicopter in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BK 117 is a twin-engine helicopter with a boxy fuselage and  
clamshell doors on the rear. Built in Germany by Eurocopter 
Deutschland, there are about 365 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenda Reuland, spokeswoman for American Eurocopter Co. of Grand  
Prairie, Texas, said the helicopters have accumulated over 1 
million flight hours, but only the Texas accident has been 
attributed to the tension-torsion strap. The rotor design has been 
used in Eurocopter models since the 1970s, accumulating over 25 
million flight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA order stemmed from an investigation into the July 17  
crash of a Life Flight helicopter near Houston. Witnesses said 
pieces ``shot out'' of the chopper's rotor head just before it 
crashed, killing the pilot, a paramedic and a flight nurse. There 
were no patients aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the affected helicopters are still on the ground, but  
Eurocopter expects them to return to service by the end of the 
week.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. displayed its latest attempt to  
carve a new niche out of the highly profitable light-truck segment 
Tuesday: a combination sport utility vehicle and pickup called the 
Explorer Sport Trac. 
</P>
<P>
	A prototype of the Sport Trac was first shown at the Detroit  
auto show in January. The similar production version, which goes on 
sale early next year, was unveiled to enthusiastic dealers at this 
week's annual Ford dealers meeting in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sport Trac combines the front end and cab of a four-door,  
five-passenger Explorer SUV with a 4-foot cargo bed. The idea is to 
provide the room and comfort of an SUV with the cargo utility of a 
pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	More such vehicles are in the pipeline from Ford, and other  
automakers plan to follow in the search for the next hit product in 
the increasingly crowded U.S. truck market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's F-150 SuperCrew will arrive next year shortly before the  
Sport Trac. It features a shortened bed from the full-size F-150 
pickup attached to the front end and cab of the large, four-door 
Expedition SUV. Ford's also planning to offer the luxury Lincoln 
Blackwood, which will combine a short pickup bed to the front end 
and cab of the pricey Lincoln Navigator SUV. The Blackwood should 
arrive in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division is considering an  
SUV-pickup hybrid to counter the Blackwood, though no final 
decision or time frame have been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Nissan Motor Co., meanwhile, showed a concept called the  
``SUT,'' for sport utility truck, at the Detroit show. No decision 
has been announced, but a company insider says it's likely to go 
into production as soon as 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of mating pickup beds to other vehicles is nothing new,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, Ford offered the Ranchero, which combined the  
front end of a Falcon compact coupe with a pickup bed. Chevrolet 
competed during that era with the similar El Camino. Then there was 
a pickup version of the Ford Econoline van, which also was based on 
the Falcon chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford expects the Sport Trac to appeal to outdoor sports  
enthusiasts and do-it-yourself homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be powered only by Ford's 4-liter V6 engine, the most  
popular engine offered on the Explorer. It will be available with 
two- or four-wheel drive and standard antilock brakes. The truck 
also can be ordered with an option that extends the bed, as well as 
a lockable cargo cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has not yet announced Sport Trac prices, but it's expected  
to sell for about the same price as a four-door Explorer, 
spokeswoman Wendi Parson said. Prices of the four-door 2000 
Explorer with four-wheel-drive start at $24,565.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Quits Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Former Gov. Lamar Alexander, complaining  
that today's political campaigns are too much about image and not 
enough about issues, says he has run his last race. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, conceding Monday that he could not raise money or  
overcome the star quality of George W. Bush, dropped out of the 
pack chasing the Texas governor for the Republican presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In a parting shot, he lamented that candidates now must spend  
more time raising money and ``holding media events'' than talking 
to voters. ``I think that's unfortunate,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last 35 years, a shoe-leather campaign in Iowa has  
made a big difference. My guess is, unless things change, it won't 
make as much difference,'' he told reporters and supporters at the 
state Capitol. His departure left eight candidates vying for the 
2000 GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he called Bush on Monday morning and told him he  
was finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lamar is a good man who poured his heart into his campaign. I  
know this was a difficult decision for him because I know how 
strongly he believes in strengthening American families and 
revitalizing the spirit of our country,'' Bush said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I applaud his commitment to the issue I believe should be  
America's No. 1 domestic priority, the education of our children. I 
hope Lamar will continue to be actively involved in promoting his 
ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming close to tears, Alexander said he was giving up his  
six-year quest for the GOP nomination after his sixth-place finish 
in Saturday's Iowa straw poll. Bush finished first. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been my last campaign. I've run for president twice,  
just as I've run for governor twice,'' said Alexander, who was 
Tennessee's governor from 1979 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who was president of the University of Tennessee and  
U.S. education secretary, said he would not accept an invitation to 
be vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander devoted much of his news conference to criticism of  
modern political campaigns, which he said are image-driven at the 
expense of the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are not careful, we'll end up with only a race between  
the rich and the already famous,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might have Donald Trump versus Cher in 2004.''  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, 59, did not endorse any of his remaining rivals. Bush  
stands to benefit from Alexander's departure because many Alexander 
supporters could be expected to shift to Bush. Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona and former American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole, who 
finished a strong third in Saturday's poll, also may pick up some 
Alexander backers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor is expected to pick up most of Alexander's  
fund-raising team and perhaps his top adviser in Iowa, former Gov. 
Terry Branstad. Michigan Gov. John Engler, a top Bush operative, 
has been courting Branstad, according to the Alexander officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle and his senior advisers  
rejected any talk that he too might quit, saying they purposely 
spent little money on the straw poll and were prepared for a poor 
showing. The vice president, they said, is determined to emerge as 
the only credible, conservative alternative to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's immediate plans include attending Tennessee Titans  
and University of Tennessee football games, spending time at his 
cabin in the Great Smoky Mountains and, maybe, building a 
treehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to settle back and take a look at life,'' he said.  
``For Honey (his wife) and me this is a different period of our 
lives. For the first time in a long time, we'll have time and we'll 
see how it goes.''

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Surge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures prices overcame a weak opening to surge in  
brisk trading Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures prices  
were higher in reaction to government reports that the condition of 
the corn and soybean crops has deteriorated. Cotton futures were 
fractionally lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures tumbled in early trading, losing 20 cents at  
their lowest before rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was basically surprised to find the buying  
interest,'' said analyst Tim Evans of Pegasus Econometric Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was slightly nervous about the weekly American  
Petroleum Institute inventory report, which is released after the 
close of trading and was been expected to show a decline from last 
week in stockpiles of crude oil and gasoline, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (API data) wasn't expected to be bullish factor in the  
market,'' he said. ``But it turned into a compelling reason to 
buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude for September delivery settled 38 cents higher  
at $21.74 a barrel; September heating oil was 1.47 cents higher at 
56.81 cents a gallon; September unleaded gasoline was 1.32 cents 
higher at 65.44 cents a gallon; September natural gas was 0.008 
cent higher at $2.708 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices rose on the Chicago Board of  
Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices surged at the start of trading in response  
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's rating of the crop as 58 
percent in good to excellent condition, a decline from the previous 
week. There also was concern that below-normal precipitation in 
coming days could further hurt the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices surged early in the day in reaction to  
weather forecasts and the USDA's weekly soybean update, which 
indicates the poor condition of some of the crop could mean a drop 
in the 2.87 billion-bushel-harvest that was forecast Aug. 12. But 
the early gains were trimmed by profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were higher as the market reacted to news Algeria,  
Egypt and Tunisia are in the market for U.S. wheat. The USDA also 
announced the sale of 140,000 metric tons of wheat to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices also got a boost from an unexpected decline in the  
condition of the wheat crop. The USDA estimates 58 percent of the 
crop is in good to excellent condition. Expectations that the dry 
weather will help with the harvest trimmed the early gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery was 1/4 cent higher at $2.69 a  
bushel; September corn was 2 1/2 cents higher at $2.16 1/2 a bushel; 
September oats were 1 3/4 cents lower at 1.07 1/4 a bushel; August 
soybeans were 8 1/2 cents higher at $4.64 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures fell on the New York Cotton Exchange despite the  
a decline in U.S. crop conditions because of the parched landscape 
in the cotton belt. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA reported a major drop in the condition of cotton in  
Georgia and South Carolina. Only 29 percent of the Georgia crop is 
rated fair and 36 percent is good to excellent. The remainder is 
rated poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-seven percent of the crop in South Carolina is rated fair,  
with only 18 percent good. The remainder is in poor or very poor 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	October cotton was 0.02 cent lower at 53.66 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> CBS Wins Ratings Week / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Last week's prime-time fare was typical for  
summer -- mostly repeats and newsmagazines -- but it worked for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Aug. 9 through 15, CBS logged a winning 6.6  
rating and 12 share, according to Nielsen Media Research figures 
released Tuesday. NBC and ABC each had a 6.0 rating and 11 share, 
though ABC had the week's top-ranked program, the AFC-NFC Hall of 
Fame Game. Fox had a 4.4 rating and 8 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating and 4  
share, while UPN remained behind with a 1.7 rating and 3 share. Pax 
TV had a 0.8 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 47-week-old 1998-99 season, CBS remains in first-place  
with an 8.4 rating season-to-date. NBC is runner-up with an 8.3, 
while ABC is 7.5 and Fox 6.3. 
</P>
<P>
	In the evening news derby, ``NBC Nightly News'' last week  
retained the top spot with a 7.3 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World 
News Tonight'' was second with a 6.8 rating and 15 share. ``The CBS 
Evening News'' was third with a 6.1 rating and 14 share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Aug. 9-15, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
household ratings were: AFC-NFC Hall of Fame Game (Cleveland at 
Dallas), ABC, 10.1; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 9.1; ``Friends,'' NBC, 
8.5; tie: AFC-NFC Hall of Fame Showcase, ABC, and ``Dateline NBC: 
Monday,'' NBC, both 8.4; ``20/20: Wednesday,'' ABC, 7.9; ``Touched 
by an Angel,'' CBS, 7.9; tie: ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, and 
``Frasier,'' NBC, both 7.8; ``Law &AMP; Order,'' NBC, 7.6.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 49; Nasdaq Is Up 31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 49 points  
in today's early going. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange 
hold a 2-1 lead over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 31 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up nine points. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street doesn't like surprises, and fortunately, it didn't  
get any this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department's July report on retail inflation came out  
as expected, with an increase of 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sparked a rally in the bond market, and stocks have  
since joined in on the party as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the benign report, many analysts still expect the  
Federal Reserve to boost short-term interest rates next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But any sort of drastic action from the Fed, such as a series of  
rate hikes, now seems much less likely.

<HEADLINE> Cool Weather Blankets Seattle Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Summer months usually offer Seattle residents a  
respite from the region's infamous clouds and rain. Not this year. 
</P>
<P>
	While much of the nation has been suffering through unusually  
hot weather, the Puget Sound area has been having its coolest 
summer since 1956, the National Weather Service says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is depressed knowing it's halfway into August and we  
haven't had a summer, at least psychologically,'' said Ted Buehner, 
a weather service meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
	After some sunny weather in July, August arrived with a barrage  
of thunderstorms. Since then, occasional sun has been bracketed by 
drizzle or just grim gray overcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle has had just two 80-degree days so far this month. Last  
August, there were seven 80-degree days by mid-month. 
</P>
<P>
	Through Sunday, the city had logged 0.82 inches of rain for the  
month, compared with just over a third of an inch of rain all of 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a pretty lousy winter, and people got pretty doggone  
depressed,'' Buehner said. ``Everyone kept saying, `Where's the 
sun?' Then, June was ugly for the most part. ... July was the best 
so far, though a little cooler than normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And August is off to a soggy start. Road crews had to delay  
pouring concrete on a stretch of Interstate 5 express lanes Sunday 
because of the rain.

<HEADLINE> Marine Faces Prison in Vaccine Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYPORT NAVAL STATION, Fla. (AP) -- A sailor who refused to take  
the anthrax vaccine will spend 10 days in jail and receive a bad 
conduct discharge after pleading guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Raymond Kreichelt, the military judge, also sentenced  
Zachary A. Johnson to a reduction in rank. Johnson was sentenced to 
45 days in jail, but 35 days will be suspended under a plea 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 22, had faced up to six months in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, an aviation electronics technician, pleaded guilty  
Tuesday to willfully disobeying a direct order and failing to obey 
a lawful regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe the order to take the vaccine is wrong,''  
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not the first sailor to refuse the vaccine, Johnson is  
the first in the Navy to face a court-martial. Other sailors who 
have refused the vaccine have taken a nonjudicial option known as a 
captain's mast, in which a commanding officer conducts a hearing 
and decides punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a Marine helicopter crew chief was sentenced to 30  
days in confinement and issued a bad conduct discharge for his 
refusal. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine is being given to all 2.4 million members of the  
armed services to protect them against deadly anthrax bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 900,000 service members have been immunized so far. The  
Pentagon says more than 79 have reported adverse effects but all 
have recovered.

<HEADLINE> GPS Receivers Being Reset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some campers, hikers and boaters may be late  
getting home this weekend if they depend only on those handheld 
electronic location devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The time clocks on the popular Global Positioning System will  
reset to zero at 8 p.m. EDT Saturday, potentially confusing some of 
the older receiving units. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally developed for the military, GPS is also used by  
airlines, ships and in businesses and has also become popular with 
recreational boaters and pilots, hikers, campers, hunters and 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	The receivers determine locations by using signals from three or  
more of the 24 satellites in the system. To do this they need the 
exact time, and the system determines time by counting the weeks 
since Jan. 5, 1980 -- up to 1,024. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they reset to zero and start over.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what will happen Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Unless they have been repaired earlier, some receivers may think  
it is Jan. 6, 1980, when the clock resets, according to the 
Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The week counting system helps the satellites account for  
variations in the Earth's orbit and rotation. Receivers not 
programmed to handle the rollover could have problems determining 
location because they would expect the satellites to be in the 
positions they were in 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Most receivers built since 1993 were designed to handle the  
rollover. Older ones can be adjusted either through a new computer 
chip or changes in their software. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice to airlines  
and pilots in June advising of the pending rollover and urging 
checks to ensure navigation systems have been adjusted if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Transport Association, which represents the major  
airlines, says its members are aware of the changeover and expect 
no problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Most likely to have trouble are older, small handheld receivers,  
said FAA spokeswoman Tammy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Units that have not been fixed could experience any of several  
malfunctions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Inability to locate satellites, which would result in receiver  
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	--Delays in locating the satellites.  
</P>
<P>
	--Appearance of correct functioning while displaying inaccurate  
positions, times or dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``GPS broadcasts do contain sufficient data to ensure that  
navigation need not be affected'' by the rollover, the Coast Guard 
reports on its Wide World Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department says the date changes are not expected to  
affect the operation the satellites or the Pentagon's ground 
control center. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of GPS receivers can determine whether their units are  
able to handle the change by providing the manufacturer model 
numbers and other details. 
</P>
<P>
	A list of manufacturers and contacts is available at the Coast  
Guard's Web site: http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/gps/geninfo/y2k/default.htm.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Vols to White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed to the White House  
last year's NCAA football champions from Tennessee. No one was more 
excited to see the victorious Volunteers on Tuesday than fellow 
Tennessean, Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best football team in the entire world!'' the vice  
president gushed during an East Room ceremony that was rife with 
quips about Gore's presidential ambitions and the game the Vols won 
to advance to last year's Fiesta Bowl over Clinton's favorite team, 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols beat the Razorbacks in the closing minutes of a game  
played in the middle of last year's confrontation between the 
United States and Iraq -- a confrontation that didn't hinder the 
president and vice president from keeping close tabs on the game. 
</P>
<P>
	After recounting in detail how the Vols snatched victory away  
from his Razorbacks, Clinton thanked Gore for his work to help win 
re-election in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel deeply indebted,'' Clinton said. ``And all I can say is  
we're even now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore couldn't help noting how successful Southeastern Conference  
teams have been during the Clinton-Gore administration. He also 
pointed out that Tennessee's win over Arkansas occurred while Gore 
was flying aboard the jet usually reserved for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	He was especially tickled when Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer  
accidentally referred to him as ``President Gore'' and when the 
team presented both Gore and Clinton with orange jerseys with their 
names and No. 1 printed on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd just like to say, in 6 1/2 years, this is the first jersey  
I've had that doesn't say No. 2,'' Gore deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stepped to the microphone with a mischievous grin.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most disgusting pander I've ever seen,'' he joked.  
``We're going to be cited by the Federal Election Commission for 
this event.''

<HEADLINE> ETrade To Offer After-Hours Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ETrade Group Inc. plans to offer after-hours  
trading through Instinet, bringing the Internet's second biggest 
pool of investors to the busiest and safest market for buying and 
selling stocks when regular exchanges are closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The service, set to begin next month, would make ETrade the  
biggest online broker so far to let its customers react to 
late-breaking news, a privilege long enjoyed by money managers, 
mutual funds and other ``institutional'' investors. 
</P>
<P>
	While most brokers are expected to offer some form of  
after-hours trading in the near future, the alliance announced 
Tuesday may hasten the latest chapter in an online trading 
revolution that's remaking the way Wall Street does business. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, ETrade's move may force a response from Charles  
Schwab, the top Web broker with 2.8 million active accounts holding 
$250 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab recently formed a partnership with Fidelity Investments  
and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to create a new electronic market. 
The new market would likely provide the forum for after-hours 
trading at those firms, but no formal plans have been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	By offering after-hours trading through Instinet, a unit of  
Reuters Group PLC, ETrade is bringing its customers a safer way to 
take part in a volatile market where stock prices can swing wildly 
due to an imbalance of buy and sell orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinet prices definitely aren't immune to those swings.  
However, thanks to its large base of institutional clients, 
Instinet's after-hours volume already averages 20 million shares a 
day, making it easier to balance the orders on both sides of a 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The magic of getting retail investors the best possible prices  
is to have their orders interact with the institutional order 
flow,'' Douglas Atkin, chief executive of Instinet, said in an 
interview. ``The best way to decrease volatility is to build 
liquidity. We are by far the largest pool of liquidity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Instinet's volume, newer after-hours markets like Island  
ECN may have a harder time stabilizing prices. That's why most of 
the after-hours ventures announced so far are making investors name 
a specific price at which to buy or sell a stock. 
</P>
<P>
	But ETrade, more confident about the stability of Instinet  
trading, is not requiring so-called ``limit'' orders. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's new service also may have an advantage because many of  
the newer after-hours markets only trade stocks listed on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market, while Instinet also handles New York Stock 
Exchange issues such as the 30 companies in the Dow Jones 
industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship with Instinet is exclusive through the end of  
1999, at which time Instinet would be free to strike deals with 
other brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	Like its rivals, ETrade won't be providing its 1.3 million  
customers with the same round-the-clock trading access that 
Instinet gives major investors -- or at least not at first. 
</P>
<P>
	The after-hours session will run for 2 1/2 hours following the  
regular 4 p.m. close of NYSE and Nasdaq trading, about an hour 
longer than the after-hours session offered by Datek on the Island 
ECN system. 
</P>
<P>
	And rather than offering an evening session like the  
post-commute, post-dinner trading planned by rivals such as 
MarketXT, the next step for ETrade may be a pre-market session in 
the morning, Christos M. Cotsakos, chairman and chief executive 
officer of ETrade, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade will charge its regular commission rates for the new  
service, which follows a recent announcement by America Online Inc. 
that the world's biggest Internet service will be offering its 18 
million members access to after-hours trading through Wit Capital 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the new after-hours systems boast major partners, all  
of them anxious to grab a share of a new market they hope will be 
as explosive as online trading. ETrade and Instinet are both 
partners in a new trading network named Archipelago, along with 
Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. Goldman Sachs also owns a stake in 
Wit Capital. Datek's Island subsidiary is part-owned by Waterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	All the impending competition has prompted the NYSE and the  
Nasdaq Stock Market to announce that they'll introduce their 
after-hours trading sessions sometime next year.

<HEADLINE> Planet Hollywood To File Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Theme-restaurant chain Planet Hollywood  
International Inc., partially owned by film stars such as Sylvester 
Stallone, plans to file voluntarily for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection while it attempts to restructure its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the planned reorganization, the company's two largest  
shareholders and a trust for the children of the company's CEO have 
agreed to provide a $30 million cash infusion to help keep the 
international chain of glitzy restaurants going. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident we are taking the necessary steps to  
revitalize our Planet Hollywood operations,'' CEO Robert Earl said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview, Earl said the planned reorganization  
was necessary for Planet Hollywood to get out from beneath the 
burden of the $250 million in debt it is carrying. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl said the company plans to sell off its businesses in order  
to focus on the core Planet Hollywood concept. Though Earl declined 
to get into specifics, Planet Hollywood has been trying to sell its 
nine All-Star Cafes. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy filing is the latest chapter in what has been a  
tumultuous few months for the operator of nearly 80 movie-themed 
Planet Hollywood restaurants. Former president William Baumhauer 
resigned in June, just three months after the company's co-founder 
resigned his board position. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Barish left the company in March, resigning as a board  
member after selling nearly half of his stock. Barish started the 
venture in 1991 with Earl and actors Stallone, Demi Moore, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been trying to cut operating costs by reducing  
corporate overhead, putting in cost-control systems, streamlining 
store-level operations and disposing of nonessential corporate 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those moves, analysts have said aggressive expansion and  
increased competition have hurt the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl acknowledged this, saying some restaurants would shut down.  
</P>
<P>
	In April, the Orlando-based company failed to make a $15 million  
interest payment on $250 million in bond debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, it reported a second-quarter loss of $28.2 million,  
or 26 cents a share, compared to a loss of $1.24 million in the 
year-ago period. Revenue in the three months ended June 27 fell to 
$76.6 million from $105.1 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of customers drawn to the trendy restaurants have  
declined and merchandise sales -- which account for about one-third 
of the company's revenue -- have dropped 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the planned restructuring, to be filed by the end of the  
year, holders of $160 million of the debt will exchange it for 
$47.5 million in cash and $60 million in new bond debt. Those 
creditors would also receive a 26.5 percent stake in the 
restructured company. 
</P>
<P>
	The $30 million investment being made by Saudi Prince Alwaleed  
Bin Talal, wealthy Singapore businessman Ong Beng Seng and a trust 
in which the sole beneficiaries are Earl's children. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the cash infusion, the investors' group will  
receive a 70 percent stake in the company, with the remaining 
shares available to other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the film stars who are currently involved with Planet  
Hollywood will remain on board, Earl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Planet Hollywood, which have been trading in limited  
volume on the New York Stock Exchange, finished unchanged at 75 
cents.

<HEADLINE> CNBC Marketwatch Debuts on NYSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNBC's prime-time stock market program,  
``Business Center,'' was broadcast for the first time Monday from 
its new set on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcast marked something of a victory for CNBC, which is  
battling CNN for viewers in the prime 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. time 
slot in which Business Center squares off against CNN's higher 
rated ``Moneyline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both stations recently announced plans to broadcast shows from  
the floor of the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN has said it will debut a new program called ``Street Sweep''  
sometime in the fall. The show will air daily at 3:59 p.m., one 
minute before the closing of U.S. stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	With a highly recognizable backdrop of walls covered with  
computer trading screens, hosts Ron Insana and Sue Herera were 
forced to speak up a bit Monday to compensate for the wide-open 
acoustics of the trading floor and to be heard over the humming din 
of the Big Board's sleeping computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso joined the hosts for a live, on-air  
interview in which he discussed the exchange's plans to complete an 
initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition between CNBC and CNN has been intense in recent  
months. While CNBC is the leading business network, ``Moneyline'' 
consistently outrates ``Business Center'' and is more attractive to 
advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC expanded ``Business Center'' to an hour earlier this summer  
after popular ``Moneyline'' host Lou Dobbs quit and cut into its 
rival's audience, but CNN has remained in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange first allowed live TV reports from  
the trading floor in 1995, requiring networks to use robotic 
cameras to minimize congestion. Twenty-two television stations are 
now accredited to report from the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Big Board is making space for desks so CNN and CNBC can  
deliver full shows there, although ongoing live shows won't be 
allowed during the midst of trading. The networks will pay a 
nominal production fee.

<HEADLINE> Hallmark Announces Expansion Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Hallmark Cards Inc. on Tuesday announced  
a plan to expand its business in six key areas as it seeks to 
triple the company's revenues in the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine O. Hockaday Jr., president and chief executive officer of  
Hallmark, said the privately held company will continue to build 
and expand its core greeting card business. But it also will expand 
its efforts in five other areas, which Hockaday labeled ``caring 
gift solutions,'' memories, life celebrations, personal development 
and family entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to increase revenues from this year's $3.9 billion  
to $12 billion in 2010, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to build and extend our core greeting card  
business,'' Hockaday said. ``But at the same time we have the 
opportunity to build emerging businesses that will create 
incremental, profitable growth consistent with the Hallmark brand's 
ability to reach a wider range of consumers.''

	After-Hours Trading Coming to ETrade  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Individual investors will now get access to  
after-hours trading on ETrade via Instinet, the biggest market for 
buying and selling stock when traditional exchanges are closed. The 
new service would make ETrade Group the biggest online brokerage so 
far to provide its customers with entry to a market that until 
recently was the exclusive province of money managers and 
institutional investors. By teaming with Instinet, ETrade is 
bringing its customers a possibly safer way to take part in a 
volatile market where stock prices can swing wildly due to limited 
demand. ETrade shares were trading up 1 7/8 at 28 3/4.

	Consumer Prices Rise 0.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a sharp jump in gasoline prices and  
airline fares, consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent in July. 
The Labor Department reported today that July's increase in its 
Consumer Price Index -- the most closely watched gauge of inflation 
-- followed two straight months in which prices remained frozen. 
July's inflation report was right in line with many analysts' 
expectations and was expected to further ease inflation concerns in 
financial markets. The 0.3 percent increase in the CPI was the 
biggest since a 0.7 percent surge in April.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. stock, which shot up  
4 percent yesterday in advance of a strong quarterly profit report 
and gained even more in after-hours trading, slumped today to give 
up those gains. In late afternoon trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, Hewlett-Packard was down 5 3/4, or 5.21 percent, at 104 1/2 a 
share. HP, the world's second largest computer company, yesterday 
credited a 37 percent rise in quarterly profit to its new efforts 
to focus on revenue growth.

government report of a mild increase in consumer prices failed to 
hearten investors. Just before 3 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial 
average was up 8.55 at 11,055.34. The index gave up an earlier gain 
of nearly 65 points, leading some analysts to suggest that the 
market remains troubled by worries that the Federal Reserve will 
raise interest rates in an effort to stifle inflation. Broader 
stock indicators were moving between modest gains and losses.

	Cause of Coke Scare Still Unknown

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Coca-Cola's explanation for the  
contamination of its products in Belgium is highly unlikely, 
although the cause of the health scare remains a mystery, the 
European Commission said in a report issued this week. The report 
was issued yesterday on the EU's Web site, nearly two months after 
dozens of people complained of headaches, nausea and stomach pains 
after drinking Coke products. The complaints led to Coke products 
being withdrawn from stores in France and Belgium, the biggest 
product recall in Coke's history.

	Y2K Bug Might Not Affect Internet

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internet's decentralized structure makes  
it difficult to know precisely how the millions of computers 
connected to it will fare because of the Year 2000 technology 
problem, some of the Internet's top computer experts say. But that 
architecture -- a collection of interconnected but mostly 
independent computer networks -- also means data traffic will be 
able to bypass any local Y2K failures, such as those caused by 
power outages. ``We're not likely to see major global outages at 
all,'' said Vint Cerf, an MCI WorldCom Inc. executive.

domestic product, the total value of its goods and services, shrank 
by a smaller-than-expected 0.76 percent in the second quarter 
compared to a year earlier. Compared to the first quarter, the GDP 
actually grew 0.93 percent in real terms, while the first-half GDP 
shrank 0.42 percent compared to the same period last year.

percent to 120 Swiss francs, however, after the company released 
weaker-than-expected first-half results. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index

<HEADLINE> Giant Iceberg Threatens Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Ice Center issued a warning  
Tuesday that an iceberg almost the size of Rhode Island threatens 
shipping in the ocean between South America and Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
	The iceberg, named B-10A, measures 24 by 48 miles and is in the  
shipping lanes in the vicinity of latitude 58 degrees, 36 minutes 
South, longitude 57 degrees West. 
</P>
<P>
	The iceberg is drifting southeast at about 7 to 9 miles per day,  
and smaller icebergs are breaking off as it moves into relatively 
warmer water. 
</P>
<P>
	A cautionary zone has been established 165 miles in radius  
around the berg, the ice center reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The ice center has been tracking the parent iceberg, B-10, since  
January 1992. In the summer of 1995 it broke into two pieces, the 
larger of which became B-10A. The smaller iceberg drifted west in 
and along the Antarctic ice pack and eventually became too small to 
warrant tracking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suitland, Md.-based National Ice Center provides worldwide  
operational sea ice analyses. It is operated by the Navy, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Coast 
Guard.

Cardinals' 4-3 win. As the game ended, he turned toward the 
visiting dugout and cursed loudly at Francona. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies spokeswoman Leigh Tobin confirmed that Bottalico went  
to the visitor's clubhouse prior to the game Tuesday and apologized 
to Francona. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident is the latest in a developing feud between the two  
teams. It began last summer when the Cardinals signed J.D. Drew -- 
the Phillies' No. 1 draft pick from a year earlier -- to a $7 
million, four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia fans booed Drew loudly -- someone even tossed two  
batteries at him -- during a three-game series last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bottalico was upset when he was traded along with starter  
Garrett Stephenson to St. Louis for outfielder Ron Gant, reliever 
Jeff Brantley and pitcher Cliff Politte. 
</P>
<P>
	After the trade, Gant and La Russa exchanged words. Brantley was  
also critical of the way the Cardinals used him last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephenson left the Phillies on bad terms, exchanging public  
insults in the newspapers with Curt Schilling, even filing a 
grievance against the team that claimed he was sent to the minors 
while he was hurt. The grievance was settled, with Stephenson 
receiving service time but no money.

<HEADLINE> Students Return With Caution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The doors opened, the hallways filled, the  
cliques reunited, the classes began. So it goes each year, when 
students across the country head back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	But is it just like any other year?  
</P>
<P>
	A few months after the Colorado and Georgia school shootings --  
and within weeks of summer shooting incidents seemingly spurred by 
racial or ethnic hatred -- schools nationwide are opening their 
doors warily. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mixed mood,'' said Bruce Hunter of the American  
Association of School Administrators. ``There's a real current of 
optimism running smack into just a dread of potential violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials -- recovering from last spring's shootings in  
Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, Ga., and the prank threats that 
followed -- spent a busy summer installing metal detectors, 
practicing emergency drills, adding security cameras and two-way 
radios, crafting dress codes and bookbag bans and trying to hire 
counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	Students vowed to break the conspiracy of silence about  
dangerous classmates; parents promised to parent; lawmakers 
promised to get tough -- no matter where they stood on gun control. 
On Tuesday, the White House launched a series of television and 
radio public service messages featuring students talking about 
their fears and President Clinton urging parents to talk to young 
children about safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as classes resume across the U.S. this month and next, and  
almost every family faces the issue in school newsletters, 
classroom discussions, assemblies and practice drills, many agree 
fear might just be the biggest threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have more metal detectors and preventing  
bookbags,'' said Maya Hughley, 17, who starts her senior year at 
Joseph Scott High School in Toledo, Ohio, next week. ``Columbine 
had a major impact on schools, but you can't make too big a deal of 
everything. You just have to mentally be prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with increased security, many recent school openings  
included rallies and assemblies to ease community fears. Before 
classes began at Columbine High on Monday, students, teachers and 
staff held a ``Take Back the School'' rally. A U.S. flag that had 
been at half-staff since the April 20 shootings was finally raised. 
</P>
<P>
	In Charlotte, N.C., where schools also opened Monday, parent  
Blanche Penn was reassured of her two children's safety at an 
earlier open house by the district. That, she said, gave her hope 
for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you know how the news media can get everybody hyped  
up,'' she said. ``It's good to know schools are taking every 
precaution that they can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Penn's son was afraid to go to his middle school  
after the Colorado shootings; on Monday he and his sister both went 
back to school happily. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt safe sending our children to school this morning, and  
they came home safe,'' she said. ``There was not a lot of talk 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, elementary school principals reported in a recent  
survey that more parents were asking about their children's safety 
after the spring incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and children also are worried about how school officials  
will treat students who seem different. Though Columbine's 
principal asked students to be more tolerant, given that the gunmen 
had been viewed as social misfits at the school, many other schools 
will welcome back students with increased monitoring of their dress 
and other behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to see a model where children who wear  
trenchcoats or go on the Internet become instantly classified as 
kooks and crazy,'' said Larry Gray, father of 17-year-old Quentin, 
who attends Duke Ellington School for the Arts in Washington. ``A 
lot of these kids are really underestimated and sharp as tacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Barry, a parent and town official in Ludlow, Mass., says  
the tragedies elsewhere have given parents there a new resolve to 
pay more attention to their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``You keep thinking it's never going to happen,'' said Barry.  
``But everybody is trying to stay aware of it. People aren't 
closing their eyes to things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to get back to the basics and you have to get back to  
family atmosphere and family support.''

<HEADLINE> Retailers' Earnings Top Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some of the nation's biggest retailers reported  
better-than-expected earnings Tuesday as the robust U.S. economy 
continued to encourage Americans to shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales at its Target discount stores boosted  
second-quarter profits at Dayton Hudson Corp. by 33 percent from a 
year ago. Profit at J.C. Penney Co. Inc. rose 14 percent, boosted 
by demand for its private-label clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited Inc.'s earnings doubled from a year ago, amid  
strength in its Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant and Intimate 
Brands Inc. chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Depot's profits also rose sharply as consumers continue to  
spend money to fix up their homes, while Tiffany &AMP; Co.'s earnings 
gained as shoppers eagerly spent on luxury items such as jewelry 
and china. 
</P>
<P>
	While the earnings reported Tuesday topped Wall Street analysts'  
expectations, most of their stocks failed to post big gains amid 
concerns that retailers could be hit hard if the robust U.S. 
economy slows its pace in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Results were reported for the quarter ended July 31 for all of  
the companies except for Home Depot, which reported for a quarter 
ended Aug. 1. All stocks trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Dayton Hudson Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis-based retailer earned $224 million, or 48 cents  
a share, in the quarter vs. $172 million, or 36 cents a share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased 9.9 percent to $7.75 billion, compared with  
$7.06 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial  
had expected Dayton Hudson to report earnings of 46 cents a share. 
Dayton Hudson stock was up 31 1/4 cents at $61.56 1/4 in afternoon 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said that its strong performance was driven by its  
Target division, where pretax profit rose 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayton Hudson operates 881 Target stores, 267 Mervyn's  
moderately priced department stores and 64 department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, Dayton Hudson earned $418 million, or 89  
cents a share, compared with $330 million, or 69 cents a share a 
year ago. Sales rose to $14.97 billion from $13.52 billion. 

</P>
<P>
                        *J. C. Penney Co. Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Plano, Texas-based company reported operating earnings of  
about $112 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with $97 million, 
or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates of  
34 cents a share. But Penney's stock was down 50 cents at $42.50 in 
afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $7.3 billion from $6.76 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales at department stores opened at least a year, which is  
considered an industry gauge of performance, rose 1 percent in the 
quarter. The company said that sales of its private-label apparel, 
such as St. John's Bay, were strong, while sales of athletic 
sportswear and basic jeans were weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores increased 10.5 percent  
over the second quarter a year ago. But Penney still said that the 
results at Eckerd were disappointing as the process of integrating 
Eckerd into its business has taken longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalog sales dipped 2.8 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, Penney reported operating earnings of $279  
million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $273 million, or 99 cents 
a share, a year ago. Sales rose to $14.88 billion from $13.81 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	J. C. Penney operates nearly 1,150 J.C. Penney department stores  
and 2,900 Eckerd drugstores. It also operates 23 Renner department 
stores in Brazil. 

</P>
<P>
                          *The Limited Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Columbus, Ohio-based specialty clothing retailer earned  
$60.44 million, or 26 cents a share, compared with $31.8 million, 
or 13 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The healthy second-quarter results further confirmed that the  
giant retailer is on track to turn its business around from the 
slump that began in the early 1990s. In recent years, the company 
has undergone a major restructuring, including closing 300 stores 
and creating a design team for each of its divisions to better keep 
pace with fashion trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 9 percent to $2.27 billion from $2.08 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Limited let Wall Street know that its  
results would be better than the 18 cents a share that the company 
had expected to make in the quarter, and Tuesday's results 
confirmed that. It was the second time this year that the Limited 
has topped analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Limited shares were down 31 1/4 cents at $44.50 in afternoon  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited attributed the profit gain to strong performances at  
the company's Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant and Intimate 
Brands Inc. -- which owns Victoria's Secret and Bath &AMP; Body Works -- 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were calculated as if the Limited's spinoff of  
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch casual apparel chain had occurred at the 
beginning of 1998. Abercrombie became a public company in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, the Limited earned $94 million, or 40 cents  
a share, compared with $52.3 million, or 22 cents a share. Sales 
rose to $4.37 billion from $4.09 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Limited operates 3,373 specialty stores. The company also owns  
about 84 percent of Intimate Brands, which operates more than 1,800 
stores. 

</P>
<P>
                           *The Home Depot    	
</P>
<P>
	Home Depot earned $679 million, or 44 cents a share, for the  
quarter, compared with $467 million, or 31 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted earnings of 
41 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Home Depot shares dropped $1.37 1/2 to $62.62 1/5 in  
afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 28 percent to $10.4 billion from $8.1 billion. Arthur  
M. Blank, president of the Atlanta-based chain, credited the gains 
to increased demand for home improvement items. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, Home Depot reported net income of $1.17  
billion, or 76 cents a share, compared with $804 million, or 53 
cents a share, in the same 1998 period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 27 percent to $19.4 billion from $15.3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Home Depot opened 49 new stores and relocated four others during  
the most recent quarter. By the end of the quarter, it had 846 
stores in the United States, Canada, Chile and Puerto Rico. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Tiffany &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Tiffany earned $23 million, or 31 cents a share,  
for the quarter, compared with $13.5 million, or 19 cents a share, 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results exceeded Wall Street's expectations of 24 cents a  
share, and Tiffany's shares jumped $4.12 1/2 to $50.81 1/4 in afternoon 
trading, just shy of its 52-week high of $51.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 23 percent to $307.1 million from $247.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Kowalski, President and Chief Executive Officer of  
the New York-based luxury goods retailer, said the gains came from 
the company's push to open more stores in the United States and 
abroad. International sales rose 30 percent, while domestic sales 
climbed upward by 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's direct-marketing sales rose 5 percent, fueled  
mostly by customers ordering through catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the fiscal year, Tiffany reported  
net income of $39.1 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with 
$24.6 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 17 percent to $579.3 million from $473.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Experimental Radar Request Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  
rejected a commander's request to use a new missile-defense radar 
to monitor a potential North Korean test, but the Pentagon denied a 
report that the decision was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Gen. Henry H. Shelton  
denied the request by Gen. Richard Myers, commander of the U.S. 
Space Command in Colorado, because he determined the radar would 
not add substantially to the missile monitoring equipment already 
in place aboard U.S. ships and aircraft near Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt that the assets we will have on the scene are  
perfectly adequate to meet the needs,'' Bacon said. ``Second, there 
would have been a cost to deploying the Thaad radar that he didn't 
think was worth spending,'' given the amount of intelligence 
collecting assets the military already planned to have there. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say there are indications North Korea is  
preparing to test-fire a ballistic missile over U.S. and Japanese 
objections. Bacon said it appeared any test launch was ``days to 
weeks'' away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has specially equipped ships in the western Pacific  
to monitor electronic signals from a North Korean missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The radar Myers requested was developed for use with a missile  
defense system called Theater High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad. 
The system is still undergoing testing and has not been used 
against an armed missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Times, which first reported Shelton's decision  
not to send the Thaad radar to Asia, quoted unidentified critics as 
saying the Pentagon bowed to pressure from Clinton administration 
arms-control officials who opposed sending the radar because it 
might upset the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon denied that arms control issues influenced Shelton's  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the chairman's job to evaluate these requests and to  
allocate resources sensibly, and this is the decision that he 
made,'' Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Godwill Games Approaching Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- In six months, this community of about  
3,000 that played host to two Winter Olympics and the Olympic 
Trials will welcome the first Winter Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	After staging the 1932 and 1980 Olympics, some of Lake Placid's  
competition sites suffered from disuse and lack of funding. The 
success of the 1998 Olympic Trials prompted the Olympic Regional 
Development Authority to refurbish venues for the Goodwill Games, 
which run Feb. 17-20. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the improvements is a state-of-the-art luge, bobsled and  
skeleton track slated to open in December and a gondola lift set to 
debut this winter at nearby Whiteface Mountain. The upgrades and 
Lake Placid's Olympic legacy helped convince Turner Broadcasting to 
come to upstate New York for the first winter version of the 
international competition it has staged four times in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an easy choice to come to Lake Placid due to the  
enthusiasm of the people and ORDA, and the support of New York 
Governor (George E.) Pataki,'' Goodwill Games president Mike Plant 
said. ``Ted Turner's thought originally was to use sport to create 
peace and harmony in the world. We have accomplished this through 
elite level athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Turner formula invites world class athletes in a finals-only  
format for prize money. Training takes place Feb. 15-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really excited about these games,'' 1998 Olympic luge  
doubles silver medalist Gordy Sheer of Croton, N.Y., said. ``It 
will be great to compete in the U.S. again. I can't remember the 
last time we had a big race here. We always compete in Europe. Its 
important to have them see a little of what we experience every 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freestyle skier Eric Bergoust of Missoula, Mont., a gold  
medalist at Nagano, Japan last winter, said, ``Lake Placid is my 
home away from home. I have trained here for seven years. This will 
be the biggest event I'll ever compete in in my home country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to bobsled, luge and skeleton, the games will  
feature Alpine, cross-country and freestyle skiing; figure skating; 
Nordic combined; short-track speedskating; ski jumping and 
snowboarding. 
</P>
<P>
	All competition sites are within a 10-mile radius of Lake  
Placid. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner Broadcasting's TNT network plans 16 hours of television  
coverage.

<HEADLINE> Caminiti Returns; Alou Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- While Ken Caminiti is back, Moises Alou  
apparently won't make it back into the Houston Astros' lineup by 
his target date of Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star left fielder has missed the entire season since  
wrecking his left knee in a treadmill accident before spring 
training. He had hoped to join the Astros by the start of next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to put a timetable on a severe injury,''  
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said Monday. ``He had set his 
sights on Sept. 1 for a return, but now it looks like it will take 
longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker hoped Alou could go on a rehab assignment in the  
minors before Sept. 1, when the minor league season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``After Sept. 1, it would be more difficult to get him rehab  
work,'' Hunsicker said. ``We'd have to create some simulated games 
here to try and get him ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time NL Central champions are three percentage points  
behind Cincinnati in the division race. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti was activated Monday and went 0-for-3 with a walk and a  
strikeout in the Astros' 2-0 victory over Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a little sore, but I think I can contribute,''  
Caminiti said. ``It's good to be back out there. It's been a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Caminiti returned, the Astros got another injury. Right  
fielder Derek Bell strained his left groin muscle running out a 
ground ball and was placed on the disabled list this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti was tested quickly. He was forced to make a pair of  
diving catches in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get much of a chance to break in slowly,'' Caminiti  
said. ``They started working on me right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third baseman, who had a strained right calf, went 7-for-20  
in a six-game rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A New Orleans. 
He started Monday night's game again Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The calf is great, everything else hurts,'' Caminiti said.  
``The calf gets a little sore about the fourth or fifth inning, but 
I can run on it. I think it's healthy enough not to cramp up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti, the 1996 National League MVP, was hitting .292 with  
two homers and 17 RBIs in 36 games with the Astros this season. He 
went on the disabled list on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sitting is not my nature,'' he said. ``I went away at the  
right time, when they were doing good. I came back at the right 
time, with them in a little rut right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston lost five of six going into Monday's series opener.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am cautiously optimistic, but only one week in New Orleans  
is like taking six weeks of spring training and condensing it into 
a week,'' Hunsicker said. ``We've got to understand he's had a 
limited rehab and we're going to proceed very cautiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Caminiti plays himself into shape, Bill Spiers will still  
get some playing time at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know my role on this team, so I don't get the least bit  
concerned,'' Spiers said. ``I will find a way to contribute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti is known for his gutsy and acrobatic play at third  
base, but Hunsicker hopes fans don't expect him to be in top form 
right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure a lot of people have high expectations, and they are  
unrealistic,'' Hunsicker said. ``I do think if he can stay healthy, 
he'll be a key addition for us over the next six weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti definitely will add a spark.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has really missed Camy because he's really a gamer,''  
pitcher Scott Elarton said. ``He's not always 100 percent, but he 
always give 110 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Caminiti, the Astros optioned infielder Russ  
Johnson back to New Orleans. When Bell was disabled today, Johnson 
returned to the roster.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Try To Atone for Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Two of the nation's largest airlines are trying  
to stem passengers' growing frustration over flight delays and 
cancellations with letters of apology. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters were recently sent to American and United airlines'  
frequent fliers, with United throwing in an extra 2,500 miles for 
members of its Mileage Plus Premier program, the Chicago Tribune 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In American's letter, B.J. DeSena, vice president at O'Hare  
International Airport, asked passengers to ``overlook our poor 
performance ... and give us another chance.'' United, meanwhile, 
stressed its commitment to improving service. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters follow a recent report by the Federal Aviation  
Administration that found that delays and cancellations in the 
first part of this year were nearly double those of a year ago. 
During the first five months of this year, for example, 23,141 
flights were held up at O'Hare, compared with 11,464 in the same 
period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the increase was accompanied by a rise in the  
number of passenger complaints lodged against airlines-- 6,582 so 
far this year compared with 3,681 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines blame an aging air-traffic control system and other  
infrastructure deficiencies, combined with record passenger loads, 
for the blunders. 
</P>
<P>
	A passenger advocate agrees, at least in part.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to include the FAA and Congress for failing to  
provide sufficient aviation infrastructure to deal with these 
loads,'' said David Stempler of the Air Travelers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But many passengers say corporate greed has caused air carriers  
to skimp on service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is about packing the tin can as much as possible,'' said  
Art Brodie, who travels more than 100,000 miles annually for his 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pay more and more money to get less and less,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Frustration and anger by air travelers also has translated into  
a rise in the number of incidents of passenger misconduct -- 
including violent attacks on airline employees. In 1998 there were 
about 5,000 reports of misconduct, a 26 percent increase over the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole experience stinks,'' said Bob Redmond, a  
pharmaceutical salesman, who says he has run out of patience. 
Redmond regularly shuttles between New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airlines have no credibility. Not a shred,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines is based in the Chicago suburb of Elk Grove  
Village. American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Ford Tests Hydrogen-Powered Engine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is working on a  
hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine that it says could be a 
cleaner-burning alternative to the gasoline engine until automakers 
perfect a fuel-cell powertrain. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a modified version of Ford's 2-liter Zetec four-cylinder  
gasoline engine that promises 25 percent to 30 percent better fuel 
efficiency, Bill Bates, Ford's manager of alternative power 
sources, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to begin road-testing later this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Bates said the hydrogen-powered engine could be an alternative  
until engineers refine the fuel-cell powertrain. Fuel cells produce 
electricity from an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and 
oxygen; the only emission is water. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford says its hydrogen engine would produce no hydrocarbons,  
carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. Emissions of nitrogen oxide 
would meet proposed federal clean-air standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on  
fuel-cell research as government pressure for zero-emission 
vehicles increases. Few experts expect them to become commercially 
viable within the next decade barring major technological 
breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's hydrogen engine can run on either compressed hydrogen gas  
or liquid hydrogen, and the extra cost of the thick, heavy hydrogen 
storage tank should be offset by elimination of the catalytic 
converter and other exhaust treatment systems used on a gasoline 
engine, Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as the world's second-biggest automaker  
showed off its $1.5 million hydrogen filling station at its North 
American research complex in Dearborn. 
</P>
<P>
	The hydrogen engine is one of several alternative power sources  
that Ford is researching. It already has a fuel-cell-powered car, 
the P2000, which uses hydrogen gas. Ford plans to begin producing 
an updated version in small numbers by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG also are working on  
fuel-cell cars with the goal of reaching limited-volume production 
by 2004. Ford officials stressed that fuel cells still have many 
technological and cost hurdles to overcome before they are a 
practical alternative to gasoline engines.

<HEADLINE> Texas A&AMP;M Reinstates RB Hardeman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Running back D'Andre ``Tiki''  
Hardeman, whose grade problems forced Texas A&AMP;M to forfeit a 
victory last season, rejoined the Aggies on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased to announce that Tiki Hardeman has been declared  
eligible and is cleared to compete this fall,'' coach R.C. Slocum 
said. ``He didn't give up, but instead chose to work as hard as he 
could in the classroom and I'm proud of him. I look forward to 
having him on the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardeman, a senior, was declared academically ineligible and  
disqualified for the season last September after already playing in 
two games -- a loss to Florida State and a victory over Southwestern 
Louisiana in which he scored three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said a ``clerical error'' in the A&AMP;M  
registrar's office allowed Hardeman to play despite having 
insufficient grades. 
</P>
<P>
	The school never considered the forfeited victory a loss. This  
year's media guide lists the game as a 28-7 victory and the season 
record as 11-3. 
</P>
<P>
	In his two games last year, Hardeman ran 24 times for 105 yards  
with four touchdowns. He has 1,595 career yards and 23 touchdowns. 
He holds the school record with a 95-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to get back on the playing field,'' Hardeman said.  
``I did my very best. I'm looking forward to helping my teammates 
win this season and I plan to continue making progress toward my 
degree.''

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Warns New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin promised his new prime  
minister a degree of independence, but warned today that he should 
not stray too far from Kremlin policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not divide the presidential office and the Cabinet,''  
Yeltsin told Vladimir Putin, who was confirmed Monday as Russia's 
new prime minister. ``When they were divided, it didn't lead to any 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin -- who has fired four prime ministers in the past 17  
months -- told Putin in remarks broadcast on Russian television: ``A 
prime minister could only lose, and that is natural.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, one of the premiers dumped by Yeltsin -- Yevgeny  
Primakov -- agreed to join a political alliance with Moscow Mayor 
Yuri Luzhkov, a bloc that Yeltsin's administration has sought to 
thwart. 
</P>
<P>
	Luzhkov's Fatherland movement recently united with a powerful  
group of regional governors, and Primakov's addition makes the 
coalition even stronger ahead of parliamentary elections in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	The bloc could serve as the base for a presidential campaign  
next year by either Primakov or Luzhkov, seen as the strongest 
potential contenders, though neither has announced plans to run. 
Both were allies of Yeltsin, but are now at odds with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin hasn't given any reason for firing Putin's predecessor,  
Sergei Stepashin. But the Russian media has speculated that the 
president was unhappy with Stepashin's failure to prevent the new 
political alliance. Putin is expected to take a tougher line 
against the Kremlin's growing number of political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The 68-year-old president's approval rating is in the single  
digits. Meanwhile, Yeltsin has seemed resentful of any Cabinet 
member who appears too independent or becomes too popular in his 
own right. He has frequently reshuffled his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin, who has never been deeply involved in the day-to-day  
running of the government, promised Putin some autonomy in 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall work together, respecting each other and having  
counsel on serious issues,'' he told Putin during a 30-minute 
conversation in front of Russian journalists. ``At the same time, 
I'm allowing independence. It's not necessary to consult me on 
small details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's latest reshuffle has drawn widespread criticism across  
the political spectrum. Parliament leaders said Yeltsin's 
unpredictability was undermining efforts to establish political 
stability and was also damaging the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, parliament's lower house approved Putin on Monday  
rather than risk a confrontation with the president. If lawmakers 
reject the president's candidate three times, Yeltsin is required 
to disband parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin said today that he would run for parliament in St.  
Petersburg, and would seek to build an electoral bloc, the Interfax 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Cabinet is expected to be almost identical to the old  
one, and Yeltsin reappointed the foreign, defense, interior and 
emergency ministers today. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin announced one change -- Justice Minister Pavel  
Krasheninnikov will be replaced by the former Acting Prosecutor 
General Yuri Chaika. Yeltsin has criticized Krasheninnikov for not 
being aggressive enough in investigating the Communist Party's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry investigated anti-Semitic statements made by  
Communist Party officials earlier this year, but there have been no 
prosecutions.
