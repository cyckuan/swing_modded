<HEADLINE>  Ram Fans Don't Know How To Win Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- With a minute to go in their 42-20 win over San  
Francisco, the St. Louis Rams reached the 49ers 1-yard-line. 
</P>
<P>
	Rams coach Dick Vermeil ordered quarterback Kurt Warner to take  
a knee. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boooo!'' went the fans.  
</P>
<P>
	Big problem.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rams are the NFL's only unbeaten team. St. Louis fans are so  
unused to winning -- they had the Cardinals before they got the Rams 
-- that they don't know the etiquette for winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, those coaches over there on the other side are my  
friends,'' Vermeil said after the game Sunday. ``Besides, we have 
to play them again. You don't want to make enemies by running it 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running it up indeed. It had been 17 games and almost nine years  
since the Rams -- both Anaheim and St. Louis varieties -- had beaten 
San Francisco. Yes, San Francisco beat them with Joe Montana and 
Steve Young, but they also beat them with Elvis Grbac and Jim 
Druckenmiller. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Vermeil suggested last week that nobody thought much  
about the streak, he belied that after the game, hugging owner 
Georgia Frontiere, and talking openly about it. 
</P>
<P>
	So did his players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting my entire career to watch our team take a  
knee against that team,'' said defensive tackle D'Marco Farr, 0-10 
against the 49ers entering Sunday's game and knows NFL etiquette 
better than his fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's by far the biggest win of my career,'' said cornerback  
Todd Lyght, who was 0-16 against the 49ers until Sunday. Then, 
there was the man who thinks of himself as Mentor of All Football 
Coaches, San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked into Vermeil's news conference and hugged the St.  
Louis coach, who indeed is a Walsh protege. ``You're going all the 
way,'' Walsh told him and Vermeil blanched. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't say that,'' Vermeil said.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, why not? In a league that's finally achieved total  
parity (after all, the Eagles and Bengals won Sunday) why can't the 
Rams be this year's Falcons? 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil has a quarterback in Kurt Warner, who is ``Field of  
Dreams'' reincarnated in a football uniform -- he was Gateway 
Conference Player of the year at Northern Iowa and starred for the 
Arena League's Iowa Barnstormers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was cut by the Packers, cut by the Bears, then made the Rams  
last year by beating out the well-traveled Will Furrer for the 
third-string spot behind Tony Banks and Steve Bono. He moved up to 
backup when Trent Green, the Rams' $16 million off-season 
acquisition, tore up his knee in the third exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured he'd come along by midseason,'' Vermeil  
acknowledged. ``I thought until then that the rest of the team 
would carry him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uh ...  
</P>
<P>
	Sorry.  
</P>
<P>
	Warner threw five touchdown passes Sunday, four to Isaac Bruce,  
who, finally healthy, looks as good as the 49ers' ``80,'' a guy 
named Jerry Rice. Warner has 14 in four games -- a pace that would 
give him 56 for the season or eight more than the record set by Dan 
Marino in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, let's get serious.  
</P>
<P>
	At some point, Warner will hit a wall -- maybe next week in  
Atlanta, where the Rams' old coach, Rich Brooks, is the Falcons' 
defensive coordinator. They've already seen Warner and lost to him 
35-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the help has to kick in. And yes, there's talent.  
</P>
<P>
	Only eight players remain from the team Vermeil took over at the  
start of the 1997 season. And Bruce, who may be the NFL's best 
receiver, has trouble staying healthy -- he missed most of the last 
two seasons with various nagging injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line that caused the Rams so much trouble during  
5-11 and 4-12 seasons under Vermeil? That's been bolstered by 
free-agent guard Adam Timmerman and by Orlando Pace, the No. 1 
overall pick in 1997 coming into his own at left tackle. And 
Marshall Faulk has done little yet because they let Warner throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 4-yard gain is overrated. Sid Gillman told me that,''  
Vermeil said of the man whom even Walsh admits was a mentor. ``Why 
get 4 yards when you can get 40?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense?  
</P>
<P>
	It's anchored by veterans like Farr and Lyght, has an emerging  
star in end Kevin Carter, another No. 1 lost on losing teams and a 
wonderful 5-foot-10, 250-pound middle linebacker named London 
Fletcher, a free-agent rookie signed last year from John Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Shula went to John Carroll.  
</P>
<P>
	Is that an omen?

<HEADLINE> NASCAR To Race Today After Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Instead of the roar of 750-horsepower  
engines, the overwhelming sound at Lowe's Motor Speedway was the 
pitter-patter of raindrops. 
</P>
<P>
	The steady rain, which began to fall during the early morning  
hours Sunday, forced NASCAR officials to postpone the UAW-GM 
Quality 500 until today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials waited until two hours after the scheduled 1 p.m. EDT  
start to make the call, rescheduling the 500-mile event on the 
1 1/2-mile oval to begin at 11 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time in the 40-year history of the suburban  
Charlotte track that the fall race was postponed. The last Winston 
Cup event postponed by rain was in April 1998, in Martinsville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst part about rain is the sitting around,'' driver Ward  
Burton said. ``You can only play so many card games, tell so many 
jokes and take so many naps. You can only look up at the sky and 
shake your head so many times. 
</P>
<P>
	``NASCAR has the weather radar on the side of their transporter,  
and people will wear out a path to it. That `nice weather for 
ducks' joke gets pretty old pretty quick, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the rain washing the accumulated rubber off the track  
surface, crew chiefs spent some time worrying about their race 
set-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were practicing in bright sunshine and then we had to set  
the cars up for overcast, if we ran Sunday,'' explained Brian 
Whitesell, crew chief for two-time Winston Cup champion Jeff 
Gordon. ``We're just going to have to figure it out (today).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the drivers were happy NASCAR made the decision to  
postpone the start, rather than try to get it started and have a 
rain-shortened event. 
</P>
<P>
	``In April, all we had to go was one more lap and we win the  
race,'' said Jeremy Mayfield, who finished second to Jeff Burton in 
the rain-shortened race in Darlington, S.C. ``Jeff was sitting 
there all torn up, and he couldn't have gone any further. If we'd 
gotten back to green, he was done too, and we felt we were the best 
car out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayfield was third, behind Burton and his brother, Ward, in the  
Darlington race last month, which was also cut short by rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Southern 500, who knows? Jeff was good, but so was Ward  
and so were we,'' Mayfield said. ``The sad part about that is there 
was going to be one heck of a shootout between those three cars at 
the end of that race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the 334-lap race did get under way, Bobby Labonte was to be  
on the pole with Rusty Wallace alongside. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Jarrett, who owns a 251-point margin over Labonte in the  
Winston Cup standings, was to start ninth, while Mark Martin, who 
is third, 25 points behind Labonte, was fourth in the 43-car field.

<HEADLINE> Dell To Focus on Core PC Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp., the No. 1  
seller of personal computers directly to customers, says it will 
stick to its strengths despite Wall Street pressure to vigorously 
branch into areas such as computer services. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dell's financial results are among the strongest in the  
computer industry, its stock price has fallen 16 percent since 
early this year in part due to investor concerns that tumbling PC 
prices will slow galloping revenues and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dell chief executive Michael Dell said Monday that computer  
services, or helping corporate customers set up and maintain their 
computer networks, will remain an adjunct and not a substitute for 
Dell's main business of selling hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can grow in our core business and services will  
enhance that growth,'' he said in a talk before thousands of 
technology managers at the annual Gartner Group computer industry 
gathering here. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's go-it-slow strategy contrasts with moves by IBM,  
Hewlett-Packard Co. and other major Dell rivals to attack the 
fast-growing services business. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies are making very little money or losing money in  
the PC business. IBM last week told employees it's cutting up to 10 
percent of its PC work force after the business lost $150 million 
last quarter. Compaq Computer Corp. also is struggling to turn 
around its business. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dell expects further strong financial results from selling  
PCs due to the company's efficient, oft-copied strategy of selling 
directly to users and eliminating wholesalers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell underscored its iconoclast strategy last month by signing a  
seven-year agreement for IBM to provide technical support to Dell's 
customers -- the Round Rock, Texas company could have instead built 
its services operation from within. 
</P>
<P>
	``I view it very, very differently'' from our competitors,  
Michael Dell said. ``We are profitable in our core hardware 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some analysts say the company is vulnerable to pricing  
pressures, especially since its product line focuses mainly on 
business PCs and isn't as diverse as other companies that sell, for 
instance, lots more computers to home users. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell is moving aggressively to boost sales to home users,  
though. Last quarter, the company more than doubled its sales to 
these consumers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dell said that despite the company's gradual approach, its  
services business should eventually grow from about 11 percent of 
total revenues to as much as 50 percent, though he didn't specify 
when. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's stock price rose 1.4 percent, or 6 1/4 cents to $45.56 1/4, in  
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Launches Telecom Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Computer manufacturer Compaq on Monday announced  
it was forming a new division to provide services to 
telecommunications companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Compaq Telecommunications would bring together  
2,000 Compaq employees currently working in other divisions. Half 
of the staff would be in the United States, and the headquarters 
would be near Dallas, in the so-called ``telecom corridor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq is committed to leadership in telecommunications, and  
the new line of business reflects this,'' said Senior Vice 
President Enrico Pesatori, speaking at the Telecom 99 trade show in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq Telecommunications starts with extensive presence in  
the telecommunications market, and leverages that with the 
company's strong experience in consumer and financie markets,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also unveiled its new telecommunications engine --  
the computer which keeps track of telephone calls and bills 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The system can handle 15,000 transactions per second as well as  
up to 40,000 customer service operators. 
</P>
<P>
	It has a capacity of 111 terabytes. A byte is a small chunk of  
computer data, and a terabyte -- 1 trillion bytes -- is the 
equivalent of 1 million unabridged dictionaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is operating at Compaq's customer service operation  
in Cupertino, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone today recognizes the importance of e-business, but  
it's Compaq that has forged ahead and actually built a full-scale 
working model of how companies can re-engineer themselves to 
actually deliver on the e-business promise,'' said Compaq Chief 
Executive Michael Capellas. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas said he believed the large-scale hi-tech project fitted  
in perfectly well with the company's traditional business of 
high-volume, cheap computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just an added value that we have. It is a natural fit to  
what we have always had traditional high strength in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July Compaq announced it planned to slash up to 8,000 jobs,  
or 12 percent of its workforce, as it struggles to cut costs amid a 
$184 million loss in the second quarter of 1999 brought on by 
computer price wars and slowing sales.

<HEADLINE> Cynthia Cooper Exits USA Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Cynthia Cooper withdrew from the  
USA Basketball women's senior national team Monday because she is 
``unable to fully participate in the team's training program''. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Cooper is a two-time Olympian who helped the  
U.S. win a gold medal in the 1988 Summer Games and two golds in 
World Championship play. She also led the WNBA Houston Comets to 
three consecutive titles while earning league MVP honors twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is with considerable regret that I must withdraw from the  
women's senior national team,'' Cooper said. ``The past several 
months have been very difficult for me emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the importance of the National Team's training  
schedule and for the team to mesh together as a unit for the 
upcoming Olympics. However, at this time I am unable to participate 
fully in the team's training and therefore feel I must excuse 
myself from the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team began training Sept. 7 and claimed team titles at the  
1999 U.S. Olympic Cup and the USA Basketball International 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	It will play 12 games against top NCAA Division I women's teams  
beginning next month.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Persues Underdog Quest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Discipline was so ingrained in Alan Keyes  
that when he transferred from parochial school to public school, it 
took him the entire freshman year to realize that he didn't have to 
wear a uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Even today, as he pursues an underdog quest for the White House,  
the discipline that Keyes learned as a boy is apparent. He's a 
candidate who sticks to his message, telling people not what they 
want to hear but what he thinks they should hear. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and political associates say his passionate conservatism  
is not a recent acquisition and that he is driven to run for 
president by a conviction that his political beliefs are correct 
and that the future of America is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	William Kristol, who roomed with Keyes at Harvard, remembers him  
as being a very good student, very smart, intense and already a 
committed political conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd get intensely interested in something and read about it  
for two or three weeks,'' Kristol said. ``In a way, he was always a 
little more driven than the rest of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marlo Lewis, another college friend, said that intensity carries  
over to Keyes' private life. 
</P>
<P>
	``His mind is always fully engaged and operating at full  
throttle,'' Lewis said. ``Alan doesn't have any time to waste. If 
you're going to have a conversation, it had better be a worthwhile 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes grew up the youngest of five children. His mother was a  
schoolteacher, and his father, an Army sergeant major who served in 
three wars -- World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. They lived a typical 
Army life, moving around the country and to Italy, as his father 
was transferred from base to base. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said Keyes' father was a major influence on him. ``He was  
an exemplar of the military code. That partly explains Alan's very 
deep devotion to the United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes attended parochial schools, but transferred to a public  
high school in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was somewhat more structure and discipline in the  
Catholic schools,'' he told an interviewer several years ago. ``But 
by the time I got to public high school that discipline was 
ingrained. I wore a white shirt, blue tie and blue pants to school 
every day my freshman year before it dawned on me I no longer 
needed a uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Encouraged by a teacher, Keyes entered -- and won the American  
Legion oratorical competition, the first black to do so. He also 
was elected president of the Legion's Boys Nation, and gave 
resounding speeches in support of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes was recruited by Cornell University, and attended the  
Ithaca, N.Y., school during the height of the Vietnam War and the 
black militant movement. 
</P>
<P>
	His disdain for anti-war protests led to him to become a  
Republican, even though his parents were Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristol said Keyes was threatened after he spoke out against the  
1969 black militant takeover of Cornell's student center during his 
freshman year. He eventually left the school, spent a year in 
Paris, and then transferred to Harvard, where he received a 
bachelor of arts degree in 1972 and a doctorate in government 
affairs in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes can still mesmerize a crowd with his fiery oratory.  
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no doubt that the republic is coming apart,''  
Keyes told a national convention of college Republicans at the 
Watergate complex this summer. ``We have destroyed the spirit and 
soul of this nation, and the body is following.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd waited for the ray of hope, the promise that if Keyes  
is elected, the nation can be turned around. They didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said when Keyes prepares for a speech, ``the question he  
always puts to himself is not what do they want to hear but what do 
they need to hear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes, 49, is delivering the same unrelentingly conservative  
message he preached in his first presidential race, in 1996: 
Abortion is at the heart of the moral decay; God is the only answer 
to the nation's problems; any Republican willing to compromise on 
moral issues is worthy only of scorn. 
</P>
<P>
	His opposition to abortion and conviction that America is  
decaying morally because it has turned away from God endear him to 
many members of the Christian right, a mostly white Protestant 
group that might seem an unlikely ally for a black Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	In private, Keyes is an accomplished singer, guitarist and piano  
player. Lewis says he has a great sense of humor. He told one 
interviewer that he likes to relax watching westerns and action 
films or reruns of ``Star Trek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife, Jocelyn, have three children.  
</P>
<P>
	After getting his doctorate from Harvard, Keyes spent 11 years  
with the U.S. State Department. He was vice counsel in Bombay, 
India, when he attracted the attention of Jeane Kirkpatrick by 
coming to her defense when she was criticized at a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kirkpatrick became a mentor and later brought Keyes to the  
United Nations as an ambassador to the U.N.'s Economic and Social 
Council when she was its chief delegate. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes plunged into electoral politics by running for the U.S.  
Senate from Maryland in 1988, when he got 38 percent of the vote 
against incumbent Democrat Paul Sarbanes in the heavily Democratic 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent the next four years as president of Citizens Against  
Government Waste, a national organization devoted to lower taxes 
and less government spending. Tom Schatz, who worked with Keyes and 
replaced him as president, said Keyes ``was the kind of person who 
was clearly in charge,'' but was always willing to listen to other 
people's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Keyes made his second run for the U.S. Senate from  
Maryland, this time running against Democratic incumbent Barbara 
Mikulski. He got just 29 percent of the vote, and Joyce Terhes, 
then state GOP chairwoman, said his campaign suffered from his 
unwillingness to compromise or take advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Any chance he might have had for an upset ended when he decided  
to pay himself a salary of about $8,000 a month out of campaign 
funds, Ms. Terhes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pleaded and cajoled that he not do it. He was completely  
unwilling to compromise on that,'' she said. ``Alan was going to do 
it Alan's way, no question about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference with his wife, daughter and two sons  
standing behind him, Keyes defended the payments as necessary to 
support his family and charged that critics wanted to see his 
children hungry and his family living on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes was involved in more controversy in 1992 when he declared  
that the Republican senatorial campaign committee was racist 
because it would not sink money into his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Terhes said Maryland Republicans were embarrassed and upset  
by the allegation that came when they were in Houston preparing for 
the national convention. The committee sent money to other 
candidates because Keyes had no chance of winning, but ``he 
couldn't fathom that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, Keyes has supported his family with fees from  
speaking engagements and a syndicated radio show, which he halted 
in July, according to campaign spokeswoman Becky Fenger. 
</P>
<P>
	When associates talk about Keyes, certain words keep cropping up  
-- brilliant, a compelling orator, unwilling to compromise or take 
advice, focused on negatives and, above all, passionately committed 
to his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Sauerbrey, Republican national committeewoman from  
Maryland and a supporter of GOP presidential front-runner George W. 
Bush, helped Keyes in both Senate races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unquestionably, Alan Keyes is one of the most articulate  
people that we have running for president,'' Ms. Sauerbrey said. 
But she said he is so focused on what is wrong with the country 
that he doesn't give voters any sense of what he would do to make 
things better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are looking for the Ronald Reagan promise of  
hope and opportunity rather than the lecture that the country is 
coming to an end,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, said Keyes could have  
had a successful career at a think tank, as a college professor, as 
a lobbyist, but ``he was never a go-along and get-along kind of 
guy. He always had a sense of mission.''

<HEADLINE> Italy Seeks Antiquities Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Italian authorities are weary of watching  
coveted antiquities disappear into the hands of American 
collectors, and they are asking the State Department for help. 
</P>
<P>
	On their side in the effort to keep these valued vases,  
figurines and pottery pieces at home is an international accord 
designed to reduce the incentive for pillage. But they are up 
against an art collectors' lobby that is attempting to keep any 
restrictions within certain limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department is reviewing the Italian request and will  
convene a public session on Tuesday to hear the interested parties, 
which include archaeologists, museums and dealers. The session is 
being organized by the department's Cultural Property Advisory 
Committee, which will make its recommendations to the president. An 
early decision on recommendations is not expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported Monday that New York Sens. Daniel  
Patrick Moynihan and Charles Shumer, both Democrats, have 
introduced legislation on behalf of the antiquities market that 
would complicate procedures for imposing restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the senators nor their staffs were available for comment  
on Monday, a federal holiday. A State Department official involved 
in the issue declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Italy are parties to a 1970 U.N.  
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) accord 
on illicit trade in cultural properties. Italy is seeking American 
help because it sees the United States as the primary destination 
for its pillaged artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sources told the Post that the categories covered by  
Italy's still-secret petition embrace virtually every type of 
high-value artifact produced or found in ancient Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	This would include Attic pottery made in Greece and either  
looted by Romans or purchased by them and buried in their tombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome M. Eisenberg, owner of New York's Royal-Athena Galleries  
and the publisher of the antiquities magazine Minerva, told the 
Post, ``Ancient art always traveled. We're concerned with art theft 
but (the scope of the Italian request) is absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In support of their petition, Italian authorities are likely to  
seize on a 1997 case in which a New Yorker, Michael Steinhardt, 
lost his fourth century B.C. antique gold platter when a judge 
ruled it had been imported illegally into the United States from 
Italy. He paid $1.2 million for the platter in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is believed to have been one of the first in the  
nation to order the return of an archaeological item exported in 
violation of Italy's cultural property laws.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Court Issues Stay of Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court issued a stay of  
execution Monday for a child rapist and murderer who was scheduled 
to be the first person executed in the state since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled Robert Glen Coe needed more time to ask the U.S.  
Supreme Court to reconsider a request to hear an appeal of his 1981 
conviction for killing an 8-year-old girl in Greenfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe was to die by injection on Oct. 19. The U.S. Supreme Court  
refused to review his case last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is the only Southern state that hasn't executed anyone  
since the high court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The 
state has 99 men and two women on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe, 43, said that in 1979, he kidnapped Cary Ann Medlin near  
her home, raped and sodomized her, then choked her and stabbed her 
in the throat with a pocket knife. The former auto mechanic told an 
FBI agent that he became enraged when the girl kept saying, ``Jesus 
loves you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coe recanted before his 1981 trial and his lawyers used an  
insanity defense. The jury took an hour to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers have argued that there was no scientific evidence  
linking Coe to the crime, that the confession was unreliable and 
that evidence pointing to another man had been hidden or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Coe's conviction was set aside by a federal judge who  
said the jury was not given proper guidance. But a federal appeals 
court reinstated the conviction.

	FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- At least four women with a history of drug  
use or prostitution have been slain in Flint over the past eight 
months in what investigators say may be the work of a serial 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
	The police and the FBI have formed a task force to investigate.  
It met for the first time Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of all four women were found in or near abandoned  
houses. All were black women in their late 20s or 30s. Police would 
not say how the women died, but The Flint Journal said one had been 
strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	The police vice squad was put on alert to watch for people who  
try to solicit prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent victim was found Friday by a passerby. The first

<HEADLINE> Toronto Loses Sundin to Broken Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Maple Leafs will discover over the  
next six weeks just what kind of a team they really are. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs, who started this year with three straight wins  
after making it to the conference finals last season, have lost 
team captain Mats Sundin with a broken right ankle. The veteran 
center was injured Saturday in a game against Ottawa and is 
expected to be gone for at least 1 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The team got the news on Monday shortly before wasting a 2-1  
third-period lead en route to a 4-2 loss to the previously winless 
Nashville Predators. 
</P>
<P>
	Linemate Steve Thomas called the injury a ``big loss'' to the  
Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the best players in the world,'' Thomas said.  
``Each and every guy is going to have to put out an effort like 
they never have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach-general manager Pat Quinn echoed that sentiment.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know he's our best player, but we still have to play the  
games. Hopefully, we'll still be a very competitive hockey club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn said Nikolai Antropov, the Maple Leafs' No. 1 pick in the  
1998 draft, will be called up from St. John's of the AHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may as well give him a try,'' Quinn said. ``He played a lot  
with Thomas (in pre-season) so that may be a real possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Warriner filled in for Sundin on the Maple Leafs' top line  
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundin, who was leading the Maple Leafs in scoring with three  
goals and four assists, was hopeful he would be back in action 
sooner than six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worst case, I guess it's six weeks,'' Sundin said. ``I hope  
it's shorter. I'll be able to work out. I rode the bike (Monday) 
morning and that didn't bother me. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there had been any movement in the leg immediately after  
the injury, they would have had to do surgery. I think I've been 
fortunate. I haven't had any bad injuries, so I hope this is the 
one time it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maple Leafs team physician Dr. Michael Clarfield said Sundin  
shouldn't have any difficulty in recovering from the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no other ligament damaged and (the ankle) is not  
swollen, so we think he'll come back in good shape,'' Clarfield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundin, 28, was injured when he took a shot off the ankle.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised by it,'' he said. ``It was on a 3-on-2 and  
(Magnus) Arvedsson was going wide and I went wide with him. He 
dropped a pass and I stopped. I think it was (Marian) Hossa, who 
took a one-timer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was initially thought Sundin had only bruised the foot, but  
he couldn't practice Sunday because of the pain and had a series of 
X-rays Monday that revealed the undisplaced fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury ended Sundin's 259-game played streak, which had been  
the second-longest active streak in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a first for everybody. I've been fortunate in my  
career not to get hurt so we'll have to see.''

<HEADLINE> Britain's Blair Shuffles Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair shuffled his  
Cabinet today, reportedly handing the job of running Northern 
Ireland to a controversial ally who resigned as trade secretary 
last year after failing to disclose a huge loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Mandelson, 45, and Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam,  
50, each entered the prime minister's 10 Downing Street office 
separately during the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Television and radio stations, quoting official sources, said  
Mandelson would succeed Mowlam. Formal announcements were scheduled 
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Ireland's main Protestant party quickly welcomed the  
reported change, but the largest Catholic party said it would be 
sorry to see Mowlam go. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuffle was the first significant change in Blair's  
22-member Cabinet since the Labor Party won a landslide election 
victory over the Conservatives in May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The urbane Mandelson epitomizes Blair's centrist New Labor  
policies and was key to masterminding the Labor victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandelson had a meteoric career until newspapers discovered in  
December that he had failed to disclose a $615,500 loan from a 
government official whose business affairs Mandelson's department 
was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandelson used the money to buy a house in London's fashionable  
Notting Hill district. 
</P>
<P>
	The Protestant, pro-British Ulster Unionist Party has accused  
Mowlam of favoring Catholic-based parties, including being too 
lenient with the Irish Republican Army's political ally, Sinn Fein. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be huge relief, particularly among unionists, that  
there is a change in secretary of state at this stage,'' Ken 
Maginnis, a senior member of Protestant Ulster Unionist Party, said 
of Mandelson's reported appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Brid Rodgers of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and  
Labor Party said Mowlam did an excellent job. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had a new, different and very effective approach and there  
will be disappointment she is going. She did a difficult job and 
tried to be fair all round,'' Ms. Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belfast today, a senior law lecturer was appointed as  
Northern Ireland's first police ombudsman, with complete control 
over inquiries into serious complaints against the Royal Ulster 
Constabulary. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuala O'Loan's appointment follows a major review into the  
police complaints system and a separate report outlining 
recommended changes in the predominantly Protestant force.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 12, Indians 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- With Boston counted out and supposedly cursed,  
Pedro Martinez brought the Red Sox all the way back. 
</P>
<P>
	After dropping the first two games of the series, losing  
Martinez and Nomar Garciaparra to injuries, the Red Sox outslugged 
the Cleveland Indians 12-8 Monday night to win Game 5 of their 
first-round playoff and advance to the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez struck out eight in six hitless innings of surprise  
relief and Troy O'Leary twice thwarted the Indians' strategy to 
intentionally walk Garciaparra by hitting two homers and driving in 
seven runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't come out,'' Martinez said. ``As long as I was able  
to throw the ball over the plate, I was going to stay in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the shocking win, the Red Sox earned a shot at their hated  
rival, the Yankees, in the ALCS starting Wednesday night at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too early for manager Jimy Williams to begin worrying  
about pitching matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who we going to pitch?'' he said out loud. ``What day is it?''  
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary, who went 0-for-6 in Game 4, hit a grand slam in the  
third and snapped an 8-8 tie in the seventh with a three-run homer 
as the Red Sox became the fifth major league team to rally from an 
0-2 deficit in a best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, which hasn't won a World Series since 1918, looked done  
after losing Games 1 and 2. And when Martinez pulled himself from 
his start in the opener after four innings with a strained muscle 
in his back, the Red Sox season appeared doomed. 
</P>
<P>
	It got worse for the Red Sox when Garciaparra was unable to go  
in Game 3 because of an injured wrist. But they pounced on 
Cleveland's shaky pitching staff, scoring nine runs in Game 3 
before shattering records with their 23-7 rout in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martinez brought some sanity to a series of atrocious  
pitching, striking out seven to put an exclamation point on one his 
dominating 1999 season. The right-hander, who went 23-4 during the 
regular season, will now get a chance to pitch the Red Sox back to 
the World Series for the first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Indians, who have been waiting since 1948 to win  
a Series, were denied a third straight trip to the ALCS when their 
pitching staff collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thome homered twice and Travis Fryman hit a solo shot for  
the Indians, who will now spend the winter wondering why they could 
never shake an injury bug that plagued them all season. Cleveland, 
which lost Game 3 starter Dave Burba to injury, also watched center 
fielder Kenny Lofton dislocate his left shoulder sliding into first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's off-season could also include the sale of a team  
that has won five straight AL Central titles, but has yet to win 
the biggest one. 
</P>
<P>
	With the score 8-8 in the seventh, O'Leary made the Indians pay  
for electing to walk Garciaparra again. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing loser Paul Shuey, John Valentin singled and, after a  
forceout, Indians manager Mike Hargrove decided to walk 
Garciaparra, who killed Cleveland pitching all season. 
</P>
<P>
	And for the second time, the strategy blew up in Hargrove's  
face, with O'Leary hitting Shuey's first pitch over the right-field 
wall for an 11-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the cushion, Martinez took the Red Sox home from there,  
striking out Omar Vizquel for the final out to give Boston its 
first win in a postseason series since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez crouched at the edge of the mound and was hugged by  
catcher Jason Varitek as the Red Sox poured onto the field to 
celebrate a series that three days earlier they couldn't have 
imagined winning. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary's slam, the first in Boston postseason history, helped  
Boston overcome a 5-2 deficit in the third off starter Charles 
Nagy, who was pitching on three days' rest for the second time in 
his career. Nagy intentionally walked Garciaparra and grooved a 
fastball that O'Leary hit over the wall in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Indians answered against Derek Lowe in the bottom half,  
getting an RBI double from Manny Ramirez, who had been hitless in 
his first 17 at-bats of the series with seven strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome then connected for his second homer of the game, a  
431-foot shot to center that gave Cleveland an 8-7 lead. It was the 
16th career postseason homer for Thome, moving him ahead of Babe 
Ruth into third on the career list, trailing only Mickey Mantle and 
Reggie Jackson, who each hit 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox tied it in the fourth on John Valentin's sacrifice  
fly, and then turned it over to Martinez. The right-hander, who 
could hardly play a game of catch on Saturday, told Red Sox manager 
Jimy Williams before the game they he could pitch if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Embarrassed after getting blown out in Game 4, the Indians came  
out swinging in the first against Bret Saberhagen, who again 
struggled with his control and didn't get out of the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel hit an RBI double, and two outs later, Thome launched a  
477-foot homer. As he approached first, Thome screamed at the ball 
to get out, and it did for his 15th career postseason homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians didn't allow Saberhagen to relax in the second as  
Wil Cordero singled and Fryman homered. Fryman's towering shot was 
initially ruled a double, but after Hargrove complained, the 
umpires waved Fryman around. 
</P>
<P>
	Picking up right where they left off in Game 4, the Red Sox got  
to Nagy for two runs in the first on Garciaparra's second homer of 
the series. Boston's star shortstop missed Game 3 with a nagging 
wrist injury, and was a late addition to Boston's lineup on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The teams combined for 79 runs in the series, three shy of  
the record set in Pittsburgh's seven-game win over the Yankees in 
the 1960 World Series. ... Umpire Durwood Merrill worked first base 
in his last game after a 22-year career in the AL. The 63-year-old 
Merrill said he will retire to his home in Hooks, Texas. ... 
Hargrove, criticized by Cleveland fans and reporters in both cities 
for some of his decisions during Games 3 and 4 in Boston, said 
injuries dictated most of them. Reliever Steve Reed has a strained 
forearm muscle, which limited his use, and Steve Karsay is limited 
as he tried to build his arm back up after an injury.

<HEADLINE> Vanguard Reports After-Tax Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a move aimed at helping investors better  
evaluate the performance of their mutual funds, the Vanguard Group 
is starting to publish the after-tax returns for 47 of its stock 
and balanced funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest mutual fund firm is the first fund  
company to disclose after-tax returns on a broad range of mutual 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vanguard has long recognized the importance of discussing tax  
facts in evaluating mutual fund returns,'' said Joel Dickson, 
Vanguard principal and tax specialist. ``We see the actual 
publication of returns as a next logical step in providing 
investors the information they need to assess how their portfolio 
has performed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The information debuts in Vanguard's U.S. Growth Fund and its  
International Growth Fund's 1999 annual reports being mailed to 
shareholders this week, Dickson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Vanguard, taxes have deducted about 2.5 percentage  
points per year off the return of its U.S. stock mutual funds over 
the past 10 years. Investors in the company's largest portfolio, 
Vanguard Index 500 Fund, saw taxes take away 1.2 points per year. 
On the high end, taxes erased 3.5 points per year from the return 
of actively managed Vanguard Windsor Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard's step may lead other fund groups to start providing  
similar disclosures, but investors should keep in mind that the 
return information is not customized and will vary from person to 
person, said Geoff Bobroff, a fund consultant in East Greenwich, 
R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're proposing to do is a great first step in  
providing information to investors about their investments, but 
it's going to have to be somewhat uniformly applied,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The after-tax figures are calculated based on the highest  
individual federal income-tax rates -- currently 39.6 percent for 
dividends and short-term capital gains distributions and 20 percent 
for long-term capital-gains distributions. State and local taxes 
are not included. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard will present tables showing pretax and after-tax  
figures over one-, five- and 10-year periods. For comparison, the 
returns use calculations by Morningstar Inc. of after-tax returns 
of similar funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningstar calculates that industrywide, mutual funds that are  
set up to minimize taxes lost just 0.22 percentage point of their 
return to taxes in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, while the average 
growth fund lost 1.67 points to taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningstar's data indicated that growth funds' overall  
after-tax performance still was better than tax-managed funds for 
the past 12 months, although tax-managed funds outperformed growth 
funds for both the past three years and the past five years. There 
are relatively few tax-managed funds, however, compared with growth 
funds, and even fewer tax-managed funds existed three and five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving investors more information is a good move but Vanguard  
may be ``preaching to the converted,'' said Daniel P. Wiener, 
editor of The Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get the annual report, you're already a shareholder ...  
you're going to have to work a little harder for it if you're not a 
shareholder,'' he said. ``But it's a good first step. They're going 
to get a lot of kudos for this, and they deserve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The after-tax information, covering 47 of Vanguard's stock and  
balanced funds, will not be available to investors in tax-deferred 
accounts such as IRAs or 401(k)s, Dickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard, based in Valley Forge, Pa., serves 14 million clients  
and manages nearly $500 billion, including the retirement 
investments of The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any information that's useful and provides a better  
representation of returns ... is beneficial,'' Dickson said. 
``Although it's difficult to do an exact evaluation, we know what 
isn't correct -- and that's a zero percent tax rate.''

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Sets Date for Stock Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's government will start selling  
shares later this month that were acquired in a controversial stock 
market intervention in 1998 but it did not immediately announce the 
size of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale announced Monday will last from Oct. 25 to Nov. 4.  
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong spent the equivalent of $15.1 billion on shares when  
it moved into the market in August 1998, at a time when the Asian 
financial crisis was unfolding and local officials were blaming 
speculators for big price plunges in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's shareholding has since increased in value to  
about $25.6 billion as the market bounced back. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong officials say they will package the shares into mutual  
funds and sell them, hopefully without harming prices on the Hong 
Kong Stock Exchange. The fund set up to sell the shares is called 
the Exchange Fund Investment Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Boston's Martinez Saves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pedro Martinez took on an unfamiliar role to  
rescue the Boston Red Sox from an all-too-familiar situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured ace came in from the bullpen to save Boston from  
elimination on Monday night, striking out eight in six hitless 
innings as the Red Sox beat Cleveland 12-8 to earn a chance to play 
the New York Yankees for the American League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
	With Game 5 of their first-round AL playoff series against  
Cleveland tied 8-8 and looking a lot like the previous night's 
slugfest, Martinez started the fourth inning and shut the Indians 
down from there. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw Sandy Alomar a 91 mph fastball for his first pitch and  
retired Cleveland in order in the fourth -- the first 1-2-3 inning 
of the game for the Indians batters. He fanned two in the fifth, 
sixth and seventh innings; Jim Thome, who homered twice before 
Martinez entered the game, struck out looking to start the eighth 
to become Martinez' seventh victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez strained a muscle in his right shoulder in Game 1, an  
injury that seemed to doom Boston's chances of surviving the first 
round of the AL playoffs. But after two consecutive Red Sox 
victories, including Sunday night's 23-7 beating, the teams 
returned to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave Martinez another day to recover -- just enough time, it  
turns out. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't cleared to pitch until he had thrown a dozen warmup  
pitches before the game. By the third, though, he removed any doubt 
that he would be available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ouch!'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said as the ball popped  
into his catcher's mitt. 
</P>
<P>
	After just one minute of catch in right field, the Red Sox ace  
was declared ready for action. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a steady progression of feeling better the last three  
days. So that's a good sign,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams said 
before the game. ``I really think he can pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was the best pitcher in baseball this season, leading  
the major leagues with a 23-4 record and 2.07 ERA while striking 
out a career-high 313 batters. But he left Game 1 after four 
innings because of a strained muscle under his right shoulder 
blade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox lost the first two games of the series, extending  
their postseason futility streak to 18 losses in 19 games. So when 
Martinez could barely pick up a ball before Game 3, it didn't seem 
to matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Boston winning Saturday and Sunday, Martinez's  
condition became an issue again. And though Bret Saberhagen started 
Monday night, the prospect of Martinez coming out of the bullpen 
energized his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's near 100 percent, obviously it would be a tremendous  
boost,'' reliever Derek Lowe said.

<HEADLINE> Brain Shocks May Help Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The former shipbuilder had severe depression  
unrelieved by any of today's therapies, so sick he had trouble even 
leaving his house. Then doctors implanted a pacemaker-like device 
to stimulate a part of his brain thought important for mood -- and 
that very day the man laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was remarkable,'' recalled Dr. Mark George of the Medical  
University of South Carolina, who performed the experimental 
implant. ``I said, 'Are you being forced to laugh or do you feel 
good inside?' He said both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stimulating a nerve that runs from the neck into one of the  
brain's most mysterious regions appears promising enough at 
relieving once-untreatable depression that the government just 
granted permission for a study at 15 hospitals around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment, called vagus nerve stimulation, involves sending  
tiny electric shocks into the vagus nerve in the neck, where it 
then relays messages deep into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 30 depressed patients treated in a pilot study  
-- people who had failed every other treatment -- ``got a very good 
response,'' George said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are not definitive, he cautioned. But he added,  
``Stimulating there really is a wonderful portal into the base of 
the brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, scientists think stimulating this nerve could have even  
more far-reaching effects, such as enhancing memory or treating 
obesity by curbing appetite. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the vagus nerve is what Dr. Mitchell Roslin of  
Brooklyn's Maimonedes Medical Center calls ``one of the information 
superhighways'' between the brain and other organs. It relays 
messages, such as signals to regulate heartbeat, and sends messages 
back to the brain, such as when the stomach is full. 
</P>
<P>
	The nerve also reaches deep into brain regions thought to  
regulate mood and emotion, said Dr. John Rush of the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who heads the pilot depression 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	If the implant truly signals the depressed brain circuits to act  
more normally, it could prove important for some of the estimated 1 
million Americans with depression uneased by conventional therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The stimulator is essentially a brain pacemaker. A generator the  
size of a pocket watch is implanted into the chest. Wires snake up 
the neck to zap the nerve every few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved the  
implant to treat severe epilepsy, a way to signal the brain to 
reduce seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Depression often accompanies epilepsy. Soon after the implants  
began selling, doctors began reporting epilepsy patients who felt 
happier even if the implant failed to reduce their seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly an overlap between emotions and the site  
where people have intractable seizures,'' said Dr. Cynthia Harden 
of Cornell University, author of one of those early studies. 
</P>
<P>
	So manufacturer Cyberonics Inc. funded a pilot study of patients  
with untreatable depression not complicated by epilepsy. Full 
results won't be unveiled until December, but George said about 
half the patients responded well -- prompting the FDA last week to 
approve a new study, beginning early next year at 15 hospitals, to 
prove the effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The vagus nerve might also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Fight obesity.  
</P>
<P>
	Because the nerve signals the brain when someone's stomach is  
full, Roslin implanted Cyberonics stimulators in dogs to see they 
suppressed appetite. For a week, the dogs continued to gulp 
whatever food was in sight. But gradually their appetite dropped, 
until eventually they left half their food uneaten each day and 
lost one-third of their weight. Then Roslin switched off the 
stimulators, and within five days the dogs' appetite and weight 
rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Roslin hopes to begin an implant study in obese New Yorkers  
early next year to see if they get the same effect.	   --Help stroke or head-injury victims' memory recover. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study last year, epilepsy patients scored 36 percent better  
at recalling words read just before their vagus nerve was 
stimulated. The theory: Emotional hormones seem to stimulate the 
vagus nerve to store memories, so maybe the implant could mimic 
that effect in injured patients. 
</P>
<P>
	These potential treatments require much more research to  
determine how to best stimulate the vagus nerve, said George. His 
depressed shipbuilder, for instance, was initially overstimulated 
into a hyper state associated with manic-depression. Later patients 
were better controlled. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the implant is so unique -- and can immediately be  
switched off if someone suffers a side effect -- scientists are 
encouraged.

<HEADLINE> BBC Can't Air George Michael Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- George Michael refused to let the British  
Broadcasting Corp. air footage from his NetAid performance after 
technical glitches marred his show. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael was among dozens of performers to appear at three  
overlapping fundraising concerts Saturday in London, Geneva and New 
Jersey. The events were organized by the United Nations Development 
Program and broadcast live on the Internet, where viewers were 
encouraged to donate money to help the world's impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael's show at London's Wembley Stadium was blighted by  
technical problems that led him to prohibit the BBC from showing 
any part of his performance when the network screened concert 
segments, said Andy Stephens, Michael's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would love to have shown it to his fans, as we are  
completely satisfied with it, and we are disappointed that we were 
not allowed to use it,'' a BBC spokesman said, speaking with 
customary anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens said the technical glitches may be able to be patched  
up for future broadcasts.

<HEADLINE> Packers Defeat Buccaneers 26-23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- A couple of minutes after nearly giving  
the game away, Brett Favre gave himself quite a birthday present. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre, who turned 30 on Sunday, led Green Bay on a last-minute,  
game-winning drive for the third time this season, hitting Antonio 
Freeman with a 21-yard touchdown pass with 1:05 left as the Packers 
beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 26-23. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't think we'd have to do it again,'' said Favre, who  
re-injured his right thumb during the game. ``Three times out of 
three, though -- that's not too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winning pass capped a six-play, 73-yard drive Favre directed  
in 40 seconds against the Buccaneers' top-ranked defense. The 
Packers racked up 452 yards of total offense against Tampa Bay but 
looked to be in trouble when Mike Alstott's 22-yard touchdown run 
with 1:45 to play put the Bucs up 23-19. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre, who wept after the first comeback win and hyperventilated  
after the second, was somber after the latest. His swollen, bruised 
thumb, which was wrapped in ice, ``doesn't look good right now,'' 
he said, though he thought he would be able to play next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers got the ball back at their 27 with 1:40 to play, and  
Favre hit Bill Schroeder with a 42-yard pass down the left 
sideline. Favre got up holding his right arm, but it didn't slow 
him down. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 10-yard draw by Dorsey Levens and a couple of  
incompletions, Favre saw the Buccaneers coming on an all-out blitz, 
and he exchanged a look with Freeman. Favre then threw a 21-yard 
bullet to Freeman, who caught the ball in the end zone while Ronde 
Barber tackled him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the blitz, and my eyes got big,'' Freeman said. ``I  
figured if I beat my man, I was getting the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 13th come-from-behind win for Favre and the 16th time  
he led a game-winning drive. He broke the hearts of the Bucs, who 
were outplayed most of the night before losing their second 
straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have bet my life we'd have stopped them on that drive,''  
said Warren Sapp, who had two of Tampa Bay's five sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre was 22-of-40 for 390 yards and two touchdowns. He hit  
Corey Bradford with a 23-yard TD pass with 12 seconds to play in 
Green Bay's 23-20 win over Minnesota two weeks ago, and he won the 
season-opener against Oakland 28-24 by hitting Jeff Thomason with a 
1-yard scoring pass with 11 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers (3-1) moved into first place in the NFC Central with  
the win, their eighth straight and 33rd in the last 34 games at 
Lambeau Field. Ryan Longwell kicked four field goals for the 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buccaneers (2-3), who haven't won at Lambeau Field since  
1989, were crippled by four turnovers. Trent Dilfer threw three 
interceptions, including one to Darren Sharper with 13 seconds to 
play that sealed Green Bay's win. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre's last-minute heroics erased an embarrassing miscue. With  
4:48 to play, Packers defensive end Keith McKenzie sacked Dilfer, 
forced a fumble and recovered it at Tampa Bay's 19. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the Packers drove to the 4, Favre was chased out of  
the pocket and then was called for intentional grounding when he 
wildly flung the ball away to avoid a sack. After the 22-yard 
penalty, Longwell missed a field goal from 45 yards with 2:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay then drove 65 yards, highlighted by Dilfer's 27-yard  
scramble, to Alstott's touchdown, but the Bucs left Favre too much 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It crushes you,'' said Alstott, who had 87 yards on 14  
carries. ``You're on top of the world one minute, and 1:45 later 
the game's over, and you lost. It's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre hit his two starting wide receivers early and often.  
Schroeder had seven catches for a career-high 158 yards and Freeman 
had seven for 152, giving Green Bay two 100-yard receiving games 
for the first time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder caught a 51-yard pass from Favre on Green Bay's first  
play of the game, and Freeman caught a 19-yard touchdown pass 
moments later to cap a 77-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buccaneers' much-maligned offense struggled, and one  
first-half drive died on a goal-line interception by Green Bay's 
Jermaine Smith. Martin Gramatica kicked three field goals for Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick Dunn, who was injured late in the game, scored on a  
16-yard pass from Dilfer on Tampa Bay's opening play of the second 
quarter, and Gramatica kicked a 36-yarder with 14:28 left in the 
half that tied it 16-16. 
</P>
<P>
	At halftime, the Packers retired former defensive end Reggie  
White's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Favre made his 113th consecutive start, putting him just  
three behind Ron Jaworski for the league record for most by a 
quarterback. ... Favre's 390 yards passing were the third most of 
his career. ... Longwell's miss was his first of the season after 
nine straight successful attempts. ... The Buccaneers scored more 
than 20 points in a game for the first time this season. ... Tampa 
Bay had allowed 794 total yards in its first four games combined. 
... Green Bay has beaten Tampa Bay in 17 of their last 20 meetings.

<HEADLINE> Park's Labor Shortage Problem Fixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- SeaWorld employees in San Diego got a free trip  
on the company tab, but it wasn't to anywhere exotic where they 
could relax. 
</P>
<P>
	The 150 seasonal employees were sent by Anheuser-Busch to one of  
the brewer's other amusement parks, Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, 
Va., to help out during the busy fall season because of a labor 
shortage in that city. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch, which owns 10 parks nationwide,  
spent about $75,000 to fly gift store clerks, ride attendants and 
fast-food workers 3,000 miles to work at the Virginia park from 
mid-September until the end of October. The company also provided 
housing and transportation for the workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sees the trip as an investment in keeping its San  
Diego workers, who would have been laid off when SeaWorld's 
business slowed after Labor Day, and a short-term solution to the 
labor problem in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it will make some of our seasonal employees want to  
come back next year and that's good for us,'' said Pamela Masters, 
SeaWorld's vice president of human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamsburg has an unemployment rate of about 2 percent and  
several tourist attractions, restaurants and hotels. Jobs that pay 
between $5.75 and $12 per hour, like those at Busch Gardens, are 
plentiful, making recruiting difficult, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Masters said the temporary transfer made sense because it  
provided the park skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't have to go out and recruit, nor did they have to  
train workers once they got there,'' said Masters, who came up with 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Wagner, 18, who had never traveled outside Southern  
California before her cross-country trip, said, ``I looked at it as 
a chance to have an experience.''

<HEADLINE> Nasal Strips Marketed for Horses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Winning by a nose could take on a whole new  
meaning with a nasal strip developed to ease the breathing of 
horses during racing and performing. 
</P>
<P>
	CNS Inc., which has sold close to 1 billion Breathe Right nasal  
strips to open up nasal passages of everyone from NFL players to 
snoring spouses, goes to market this month with its Flair equine 
nasal strip. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to turn every horse into a Secretariat,'' said  
Daniel Cohen, CNS chairman and chief executive, ``but a product 
such as this will help the horse perform to its maximum ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strip for humans looks like a small Band-Aid over the bridge  
of the nose. The nasal strip for horses is much larger -- about 4 by 
6 inches -- but has been worn by horses without objection in tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Because a horse breathes only through its nose, the soft outer  
nasal passage tissue can close when the animal inhales hard during 
strenuous exercise. The patented, drug-free strip is attached over 
the horse's nasal passages, where it is held in place by a special 
adhesive. The strip's spring-like action holds the nostrils open so 
the horse doesn't have to struggle for breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``Horses expend tremendous energy and effort simply to breathe  
during highly competitive events,'' Cohen said. ``Because the strip 
reduces the work of breathing, horses experience less physical 
stress during and after heavy exercise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical trials at Kansas State University also indicated the  
strips can reduce pulmonary hemorrhage induced by exercise, a 
condition for which horses commonly are given the drug Lasix before 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Further tests would be needed to determine whether using the  
strips would have any effect on the need for Lasix, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lasix reduces blood pressure. Flair works to reduce the  
pressure swings in the lungs. As a result, the two may work 
synergistically. But that's speculation at this point,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the clinical trials, the strips have been tested  
at private training facilities and in workouts at pari-mutuel 
tracks. It hasn't been used in races, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vince Baker, an equine veterinarian at California's Santa Anita  
Racetrack, tested the strips for comfort on more than 200 horses at 
the company's request. He did not monitor how the strips affected 
the horses physically, but is a believer in the Kansas State 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest fear in horse racing, or for an equine athlete, is  
exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage,'' said Baker. The most 
appealing part of the strips is their potential for protecting a 
horse's health, he said. He didn't expect the strips to improve 
race times. 
</P>
<P>
	The nasal strip has been ruled equipment by regulators in  
California, Kentucky and Florida and can be used in races, Cohen 
said. New York is evaluating it, and the company will present it in 
other states soon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-inventor Ed Blach, a veterinarian in Roswell, N.M., said the  
idea of adapting the nasal strip to horses ``was one of those 3 
o'clock in the morning sit-up inspirations. It came out of 
experience from practice, watching horses perform on the track and 
on tread mills in exercise drills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blach said he and Jim Chiapetta of Minneapolis, the other  
inventor, went through many prototypes. While the horse anatomy is 
quite different from the human anatomy, the function of the strips 
is similar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started with creating something that would fit the horse's  
face'' using what CNS had learned about human breathing and 
modifying it, Blach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actual act of breathing is a bit different. A horse cannot  
breathe through its mouth. But the bottom line is they have a lot 
of similarities,'' Blach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Comments we've gotten from trainers and jockeys is that the  
horse relaxed, seemed more focused on what they're doing,'' Blach 
said. ``It tends to let them do what they do best because they 
don't have to fight to get air.''

<HEADLINE> World Population Hits 6 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The world's population reaches 6 billion  
on Tuesday according to U.N. demographers -- having doubled since 
1960 -- with more than 1 billion young people just entering their 
reproductive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a continuing decline in fertility rates and family  
size, the sheer numbers of the largest ``youthquake'' in history 
guarantee enormous population growth through 2050, U.N. population 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of these more than 1 billion young people, aged 15 to 24,  
live in less developed nations where governments are struggling to 
provide education, jobs and social services -- and they urgently 
need reproductive health information and services, the U.N. 
Population Fund says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether they get services will determine the future course of  
population growth,'' Dr. Nafis Sadik, the fund's executive 
director, said in an interview. ``The decisions they make on the 
size of their family will determine the future levels of fertility, 
and the eventual numbers of the world's population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there is another ``youthquake'' coming, with 1.8 billion  
youngsters under the age of 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's population has doubled since 1960, partly due to  
some very positive developments including increased life expectancy 
and lower infant mortality, Sadik said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been higher if the United Nations, voluntary  
organizations and governments had not started promoting family 
planning and contraceptive use, which has increased from just 10 
percent of women and men in 1969 to 60 percent today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we hadn't done anything there would have been quite a  
different situation today. The population may have been 7 billion 
or 8 billion,'' Sadik said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been many more unwanted children. Infant  
mortality would have been higher, and the average family size, 
which has reduced from six to three children in 30 years, would 
have been much higher,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, 350 million women don't have access to reproductive  
health and family planning services today. And in a world where 
educated women have fewer children, 960 million people are 
illiterate, two-thirds of them women, according to U.N. figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan of action adopted at a 1994 U.N. population conference  
in Cairo estimates the price of stabilizing world population at $17 
billion per year, which the Population Fund says is equivalent to 
world spending on arms for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	At the current pace, humanity is adding about 78 million people  
every year. That's equal to another Great Britain plus New York 
City, the combined population of France, Greece and Sweden, or a 
city the size of San Francisco every three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody knows where the six billionth citizen of planet Earth  
will be born -- and celebrations and ceremonies are being held in 
many countries -- but it's almost certain to be in a developing 
nation. India has the world's largest number of births every year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will officially welcome the  
six billionth baby at a hospital in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, 
where he is making his first postwar visit as U.N. chief. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congo, the government is choosing four babies to symbolize  
the day of six billion and the U.N. Population Fund is giving each 
of them cribs. In Bangladesh, a big parade is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	At U.N. headquarters in New York, a population clock in the  
visitor's lobby will turn to 6 billion. Sadik said a similar clock

<HEADLINE> Galileo Probe Near Jupiter Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within  
380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much 
radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	No problems were reported, however, after the closest-ever flyby  
of Jupiter's innermost large moon took place Sunday at 10:06 p.m. 
PDT, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is looking pretty good,'' he said. ``None of the  
normal things that would have indicated problems have shown up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Io's orbit lies in an area of intense radiation from Jupiter's  
radiation belts. Galileo, which was launched in 1989 and arrived at 
Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995, has in recent months experienced problems 
with its stabilizing gyros and computers as years of radiation from 
the solar system's largest planet have taken their toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio signals streaming back from Galileo did not show any signs  
of major trouble, though. Engineers designed software to help the 
probe figure out big problems from minor glitches and respond 
appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe was to continue sending basic telemetry until 3 p.m.  
today. Science readings and photographs will be sent through 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	Galileo's instruments are studying the chemistry, heat  
distribution, gravity and magnetic properties of Io, the only known 
volcanic solar system object other than Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us the opportunity to do comparisons between a  
non-Earth volcanic system and the Earth,'' Erickson said. ``We 
learn something about both of them in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galileo is scheduled to make an even closer approach of Io on  
Nov. 25, flying within 186 miles of the surface. The spacecraft 
completed its $1.5 billion primary mission in 1997 and will finish 
a $30 million, two-year extended mission in January.

<HEADLINE> 24-Yr. Term Sought for Sheinbein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Presenting a plea bargain, prosecutors  
asked an Israeli court today to sentence Maryland teen-ager Samuel 
Sheinbein to 24 years in prison for the brutal slaying of an 
acquaintance in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Hadassah Naor said she didn't ask for the maximum,  
life in prison, because Sheinbein, 18, was a juvenile when he 
committed the crime and because he confessed, saving the state a 
lengthy trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein's sentencing was set for Oct. 24. The three-judge  
panel at the Tel Aviv District Court was widely expected to accept 
the plea bargain, though it has the discretion to change it. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland prosecutors have complained that the punishment is too  
light. If the Tel Aviv District Court approves the plea bargain, 
Sheinbein would be eligible for parole after serving two-thirds of 
his sentence, or 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein's sentencing will wrap up a case that strained  
Israeli-U.S. relations and prompted Israel to change a law that 
bars the extradition of Israeli citizens to stand trial abroad. 
However, the change came too late to affect the Sheinbein case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein fled to Israel several days after the September 1997  
killing in Maryland and successfully fought extradition to the 
United States, saying he was an Israeli citizen through his father 
who was born in pre-state Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Sheinbein confessed that he bludgeoned to death his  
victim, Alfredo Tello Jr., cut up the body with an electric saw and 
hid the body parts in a nearby garage. Sheinbein's accomplice, 
Aaron Needle, committed suicide in a U.S. jail on the eve of his 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein has shown little emotion in his court appearances in  
Israel. He sat in the dock quietly today, his hands cuffed and his 
eyes cast down. His parents sat in the second row and refused to 
speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Naor told the three judges that after weighing the brutality of  
the crime against Sheinbein's age, she considered 24 years a 
reasonable sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The punishment is severe and considerable and nears the  
maximum punishment set by law,'' Naor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein's confession also weighed in his favor. Naor said that  
if the case had gone to trial, the prosecution would have had to 
bring about 80 witnesses, many from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein could have been given a life term, but Naor said such  
a stiff term has never been imposed on a juvenile in a criminal 
case. The average sentence for a juvenile convicted of murder is 15 
to 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Colts Want Another Replay Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indianapolis Colts president Bill Polian  
said Monday he wants the NFL to re-examine a reversed call in the 
Miami Dolphins' 34-31 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to know what transpired,'' Polian said of Sunday's  
call. ``Why the decision was made. What it was based on. Why it 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was the right standard applied, and should the call have been  
reversed?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 31-27 with less than 2:00 remaining, Miami quarterback  
Dan Marino appeared to have the ball knocked loose by Colts 
defensive end Shawn King. Indianapolis free safety Jason Belser 
fell on the bouncing ball -- and the Colts were prepared to take 
over at midfield with 1:16 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
	But replay officials upstairs called for a review of the play  
and ruled it was an incomplete pass rather than a fumble. Five 
plays later, Marino hit receiver Oronde Gadsden in the left corner 
of the end zone for the game-winning score. 
</P>
<P>
	But while a closer look of the play gave the 3-1 Dolphins new  
life -- it left the 2-2 Colts wondering just what officials had been 
looking at. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian, a member of the NFL Competition Committee, said he isn't  
sure the new high-tech instant replay system he helped construct 
this offseason is being used properly. On Monday, he let the league 
know of his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Colts owner) Jim Irsay and I spoke at some length last night,  
and he reaffirmed to me that in the best interest of ourselves, 
fans, players and coaches, we ought to query the league about what 
happened,'' said Polian, furious with Sunday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	He called director of officiating Jerry Seeman and asked him if  
he was positive the ``incontrovertible visual evidence standard'' 
was being applied correctly. That stipulation of the instant replay 
rule says that no on-field call is to be reviewed by replay 
officials unless television replays clearly show that a mistake was 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	The play was reviewed after multiple replays on the RCA Dome's  
Jumbotron screen seemed to support the original fumble call. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian said he isn't expecting any contrition from the NFL --  
just an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want an apology,'' he said. ``I just want the answer  
to the question. What we want to know is, was the standard applied 
correctly. And if not, why not?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colts coach Jim Mora suggested Monday that the controversial  
play was just one of many questionable calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every week, we are asked by the league office to send in a  
report, after we've looked at the film, regarding calls that were 
and were not made,'' Mora said. ``We do it every week. We want to 
do it. And the report we sent in today was quite extensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Mora refused to pin the loss on officiating.  
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me -- I'm not using that as an excuse,'' he said. ``We  
still could have won the game. And good teams do. They overcome 
obstacles, whether it's weather or anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colts quarterback Peyton Manning agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It sure looked like to me, it was a fumble,'' said Manning,  
who threw for 274 yards and three touchdowns. ``But I'm sure if I 
was playing quarterback, I would have been begging for an 
incomplete pass, just like Dan was. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to win in spite of calls like that. As a player, you  
have to win in spite of all obstacles. There were chances for us to 
do that yesterday, and we didn't do it.''

<HEADLINE> Cynthia Cooper Exits USA Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Cynthia Cooper withdrew from the  
USA Basketball women's senior national team Monday because she is 
``unable to fully participate in the team's training program''. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Cooper is a two-time Olympian who helped the  
U.S. win a gold medal in the 1988 Summer Games and two golds in 
World Championship play. She also led the WNBA Houston Comets to 
three consecutive titles while earning league MVP honors twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is with considerable regret that I must withdraw from the  
women's senior national team,'' Cooper said. ``The past several 
months have been very difficult for me emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the importance of the National Team's training  
schedule and for the team to mesh together as a unit for the 
upcoming Olympics. However, at this time I am unable to participate 
fully in the team's training and therefore feel I must excuse 
myself from the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team began training Sept. 7 and claimed team titles at the  
1999 U.S. Olympic Cup and the USA Basketball International 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	It will play 12 games against top NCAA Division I women's teams  
beginning next month.

<HEADLINE> Berkshire Hathaway Buys Jordan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Jordan's Furniture, a Boston furniture retailer,  
is being sold to a subsidiary of billionaire Warren Buffett's 
Berkskire Hathaway Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the deal announced Monday was not disclosed.  
Jordan's annual sales are approaching $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-store chain is co-owned by Eliot and Barry Tatelman,  
whose grandfather, Samuel Tatelman, incorporated it as a small 
furniture store in 1928 in Waltham. The brothers took over the 
business in the early 1970s, bringing it from eight employees to 
over 1,200 today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's Furniture stores have attracted customers by making  
lavish use of what the brothers, who are in their 50s, call 
``shoppertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, they installed a laser light show and thrill ride  
at their store in Avon, where the stripes in the parking lot are 
painted pink and where shoppers are sometimes offered cookies and 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, they opened a store in Framingham-Natick with a  
Disneyland-style environment. Customers walk onto a replica of 
Bourbon Street and can watch a nine-minute Mardi Gras show, 
complete with life-size robots in the image of jazz greats like 
Louis Armstrong and the brothers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	They have two other stores in Waltham and Nashua, N.H.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's said Monday it was rewarding every employee with 50  
cents for every hour they have worked for the company ``to 
celebrate the excitement of the merger,'' Eliot Tatelman said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers said many of the employees have been with them for  
10 to 20 years. That could mean a bonus of $10,000 to $20,000 for 
each longtime employee.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Pilot Crashes on Purpose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GABORONE, Botswana (AP) -- A disgruntled airline pilot today  
commandeered an Air Botswana plane at the country's main airport, 
circled above and crashed it into two planes on the ground in a 
suicide mission, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, who died in the crash, was apparently alone aboard  
the 42-passenger craft. No other people were injured because 
officials had time to evacuate the tarmac, said a police sergeant 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's other two French-built ATR planes were sitting  
empty near the terminal when the pilot took off without permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was communicating from the air with the tower,'' the  
sergeant said. ``He did it intentionally. He wanted to commit this 
act. He said, `These are my last words: I'm switching off the 
radio,''' before crashing the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the pilot threatened to crash into the Air  
Botswana office building near the airport but changed his mind when 
told there were people inside, South African Press Association 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was angry with management and was not supposed to be  
flying, the officer said, who did not know the nature of the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash crippled the carrier in this sparsely populated  
country in southern Africa, leaving it with only one other 
aircraft, a BAE146, which has been grounded with mechanical 
problems, government flight safety officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Botswana provides internal flights and service to other  
southern African hubs.

<HEADLINE> Bears' McNown Ready for First Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Cade McNown's wait is over, his  
apprenticeship at quarterback with the Chicago Bears is moving 
forward. He'll start his first NFL game Sunday, not necessarily 
because he's ready, but because Shane Matthews won't be. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, the starter the first five weeks, injured his right  
hamstring early in the fourth quarter of Sunday's stunning 24-22 
win at Minnesota as he was scrambling out of bounds. He will 
undergo an MRI on Tuesday and will definitely miss this Sunday's 
game against the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to play but not excited that Shane got hurt. That  
in itself is a terrible thing,'' McNown, the No. 12 pick in April's 
draft, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation now is that I have the opportunity to play a  
lot, and I look forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, who became a father for the second time Monday when  
his wife Stephanie gave birth to a son, arrived at Halas Hall for 
treatment and then headed to the hospital to be with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	He was having one of his best games Sunday, going 19-of-28 for  
two touchdowns, when he was injured on a play in which he wasn't 
even hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears have been phasing in McNown since the season began,  
giving him one series in each of the first three games. He played 
two series the previous week against the Saints and had been in for 
two more against the Vikings before Matthews got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing most of the fourth quarter Sunday, he finished 9-of-14  
and helped preserve the victory with a third-down scramble of 13 
yards. He was 6-of-8 for 69 yards after replacing Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dick Jauron said the Bears would not alter their game plan  
because of the quarterback change, but admitted that McNown's 
ability to improvise added another dimension. 
</P>
<P>
	``He built his reputation and really his draft position on  
creating big plays in college,'' Jauron said. ``So you would expect 
more down-the-field throws from him. He is obviously a very mobile 
guy and you'll see him move around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, with a contract that could pay him $22 million over five  
years, admitted that watching from the sideline has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, you understand why they were doing what they  
were doing. You stand by the coach's decision, and I believe in 
their decision, even though I wanted to be out there,'' McNown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron also could not promise Monday that Matthews would retain  
his job once he returns. It all depends on how well McNown 
performs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears shook up the NFC Central, ending a 10-game road losing  
streak against opponents in their division with their win Sunday in 
the Metrodome. At 3-2, Chicago is one win away from matching its 
victory total in each of the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensively, the Bears intercepted three passes, recovered two  
fumbles and had four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was also a long list of injuries. Besides Matthews,  
place-kicker Jeff Jaeger reaggravated a hip injury and missed three 
field goals and might be out a month. The Bears will bring in 
kickers Cary Blanchard, Jaret Holmes and Chris Boniol for tryouts 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back James Allen is out with a knee sprain. Wide  
receiver Curtis Conway and linebacker Sean Harris have sprained 
ankles and linebacker Rico McDonald a thigh bruise.

<HEADLINE> Spartans Rise to No. 5 in AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Florida State and Penn State survived, Michigan State thrived  
and Georgia took a nosedive. 
</P>
<P>
	Those results created a minor shakeup near the top of this  
week's Associated Press Top 25 college football poll, with the 
Seminoles and Nittany Lions remaining 1-2 for the fourth week in a 
row, the Spartans jumping six places to No. 5 and the Bulldogs 
dropping out of the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (6-0) cracked the top 5 for the first time in 32  
years after its 34-31 win over Michigan on Saturday at East 
Lansing. The Wolverines (5-1) fell seven spots to No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs were beaten 37-20 by No. 6 Tennessee and dropped  
four places to No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-ranked Seminoles (6-0), who beat Miami 31-21, had 63  
first-place votes and 1,743 points from the 70 sports writers and 
broadcasters on the AP panel, while the Nittany Lions, 31-7 winners 
over Iowa, had six first-place votes and 1,678 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska (6-0), a 49-14 winner over Iowa State, moved up one  
spot to No. 3, followed by No. 4 Virginia Tech and Michigan State. 
Rounding out the top 10 were Tennessee, No. 7 Florida, No. 8 
Georgia Tech, No. 9 Kansas State and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech (5-0), which routed Rutgers 58-20, had the other  
first-place vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama was No. 11, followed by No. 12 Mississippi State, No. 13  
Texas A&AMP;M, No. 14 Georgia, No. 15 Marshall, No. 16 Syracuse, No. 17 
Wisconsin, No. 18 Ohio State, No. 19 Texas, No. 20 Purdue, No. 21 
BYU, No. 22 Mississippi, No. 23 East Carolina, No. 24 Miami and No. 
25 Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi and Southern Mississippi, the two new entries this  
week, join Mississippi State in the AP poll, allowing the state to 
join Florida with three teams (Miami, Florida and Florida State) in 
the Top 25 this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota and Southern California dropped out of the Top 25.  
With USC gone, the Pac-10 has no teams in this week's Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top 5 are: Florida  
State, Penn State, Nebraska, Virginia Tech and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Spartans reached the top 5 was a No. 3 ranking  
on Sept. 18, 1967; it's also the first time since finishing the 
1987 season at No. 8 the team has been ranked in the top 10.

<HEADLINE> College Football: At the Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It's halftime.  
</P>
<P>
	Here's a look at who's in and out of the national title race,  
who's hot and who's not, who's breaking through and who's breaking 
down at the midway point of the season: 
</P>
<P>
                           	 *TITLE TALK   	
</P>
<P>
	Florida State and Penn State are in; Michigan and Georgia are  
the latest to drop out of the national title picture. The Seminoles 
and Nittany Lions are ranked 1-2 for the fourth straight week and a 
title showdown matching grand ol' guys Bobby Bowden vs. Joe Paterno 
in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4 would be a fitting grand finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (6-0), playing without suspended star Peter  
Warrick, held off Miami 31-21 on Saturday at Doak Campbell Stadium, 
extending the nation's longest home winning streak to 27 games and 
longest unbeaten streak to 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad to be here after the stuff that happened to us  
last week,'' Bowden said after collecting career win No. 298. 
Warrick, a top Heisman Trophy contender, could also miss next 
Saturday's game against Wake Forest as his legal problems are 
addressed this week following last week's arrest on a grand theft 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (6-0), with a 31-7 victory over Iowa, is one of two  
unbeaten Big Ten teams after Michigan and Minnesota were knocked 
off on Saturday -- the Wolverines losing to No. 5 Michigan State 
34-31; the Golden Gophers to No. 17 Wisconsin 20-17 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles' toughest game should be Nov. 20, when they play  
No. 7 Florida (5-1), a 31-10 winner over LSU, although Bowden still 
has to outcoach his son, Tommy, when he brings the 'Noles to 
Clemson in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions have a tougher road to New Orleans, beginning Saturday  
when No. 18 Ohio State (4-2, 1-1) visits Happy Valley. Then, there 
are games against No. 20 Purdue, Michigan and Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Nebraska (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), ranked No. 3 this week after a  
49-14 blowout of Iowa State. The Cornhuskers, with Eric Crouch 
throwing for two TDs and running for another against the Cyclones, 
appear ready for yet another title run. But they still have games 
against No. 13 Texas A&AMP;M (4-1, 1-1) on Nov. 6 and No. 9 Kansas 
State (5-0, 3-0) the following week -- both in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	Other unbeatens with title hopes include No. 4 Virginia Tech  
(5-0) after a 58-20 rout of Rutgers; Kansas State; and Michigan 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still a few of us hanging around,'' Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
                           	 *WHO'S HOT   	
</P>
<P>
	1. Michigan State (6-0, 3-0 Big Ten): The Spartans finally  
produced the big win that could turn coach Nick Saban into a hero 
after years of fans calling for his ouster. Bill Burke threw for a 
school-record 400 yards and two TDs and Plaxico Burress caught 10 
passes for a school-record 255 yards in the Spartans stunner over 
the Wolverines (5-1, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel more confident in my team than I ever have,'' Saban  
said. ``This is the happiest I've ever seen the players, the 
happiest I've ever seen our fans. I know how much this game means 
to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bring on Purdue, Wisconsin, Ohio State and Penn State.  
</P>
<P>
	2. Mississippi State (6-0, 3-0 SEC): What can you say about a  
team off to its first 6-0 start in 55 years, but surprise, 
surprise. The Bulldogs are the only unbeaten team left in the SEC, 
but still have the tough part of their schedule remaining with 
games against Alabama, Arkansas and state rival Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Syracuse (5-1, 2-0 Big East): The Orangemen have fared better  
through the first half of the season than they did in Donovan 
McNabb's four years as quarterback. With Troy Nunes calling signals 
most of the time, Syracuse is a final-seconds, end-zone completion 
away from being 6-0 (an 18-13 loss to Michigan). The Orangemen are 
at Virginia Tech on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Hawaii (4-2, 2-1 WAC): From a 19-game losing streak -- longest  
in the nation -- to a four-game winning streak in coach June Jones' 
first season. A 38-19 loss to Rice on Saturday night ended the run, 
but Jones has the Rainbow Warriors on their way to a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Maryland (4-1, 1-1 ACC): Last year, the Terrapins won three  
games. The Terps only loss came against No. 8 Georgia Tech, and 
they stayed close for most of three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Honorable mention: East Carolina (5-1); Vanderbilt (4-2).  
</P>
<P>
                            	WHO'S NOT   	
</P>
<P>
	1. The Pac-10 Conference (28-26): No teams in the Top 25 this  
week, and every team has at least two losses. Arizona, a preseason 
No. 4 pick, is 4-2 but was blown out by Penn State and Stanford. 
UCLA improved to 3-3 after a 34-29 win over Oregon on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Notre Dame (3-3): Communication breakdowns cost the Fighting  
Irish two wins, and then Michigan State went out and beat them up 
for loss No. 3. After six games, there were high hopes for five 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Ohio State (4-2, 1-1 Big Ten): Anyone figure the Buckeyes for  
two losses before they played Penn State and Michigan? 
</P>
<P>
	4. Virginia (3-3, 2-2 ACC): Get blown out by powerful Virginia  
Tech, fine. But Saturday's 24-17 OT loss to Duke at 
Charlottesville? Unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Big East entry of Miami (2-3, 0-0); West Virginia (1-4, 0-1)  
and Rutgers (0-5, 0-2). The Hurricanes have dropped three in a row; 
the Mountaineers are out of ammo based on losses to Maryland and 
Navy; and the Scarlet Knights may duplicate 1997's record -- 0-11 -- 
after winning five games in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Honorable mention: Louisville (3-3); LSU (2-3).

<HEADLINE> Giants' Walker Loses Starting Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- San Francisco cornerback Darnell  
Walker, who suffered through a brutal outing in the 49ers' loss at 
St. Louis, lost his starting job Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Secondary coach Greg Brown informed Walker of his demotion  
before Monday's light workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker will be replaced at left cornerback by R.W. McQuarters,  
the team's first-round draft pick in 1998. He started seven games 
last season but finished the year as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	McQuarters, who has played primarily on special teams and as a  
nickel back this season, welcomed the opportunity to get on the 
field full-time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now's my chance. I've got to go out there and make big  
plays,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who was coming back from a hamstring injury, was burned  
for three of Isaac Bruce's four touchdown catches in the Rams' 
42-20 victory Sunday. Walker also drew a pass interference penalty 
when he was beaten by Bruce on another occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just have days like that. You don't expect to have them.  
You don't plan on having them. I just had a day,'' Walker said. 
``Sometimes, stuff happens. I may lose a battle or two, but I'm not 
going to lose the war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, defensive end Marvin Washington faces season-ending  
surgery Tuesday to repair a ruptured quadriceps tendon. He was 
injured Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Travis Jervey, whose recovery from a broken left  
ankle has been clouded by complications, also faces surgery Tuesday 
to remove some calcium deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	Jervey, a free agent from Green Bay, has played sparingly  
because of the continuing problem with his ankle, which he 
fractured 10 months ago. The latest operation will be his third 
since the break but he's hopeful it will finally take care of the 
problem. ``I'm excited to get this thing fixed and give them their 
money's worth,'' Jervey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Craig Newsome sustained his second concussion in as  
many weeks and his status for Sunday's game against Carolina is 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive linemen Derrick Deese, Chris Dalman and Dave Fiore all  
are nursing knee injuries but are expected to play against the 
Panthers. Wide receiver Terrell Owens has a high ankle sprain and 
will spend part of the week in a walking cast but he's going to try 
to go Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Plans Mobile Phones in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's Konka Group and Lucent Technologies Inc.  
have agreed to develop an advanced mobile phone for the Chinese 
market, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	They plan to develop a phone ``characterized by high speed data  
transmission, advanced language and image processing technology, 
and very low energy consumption,'' Xinhua said in a report late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Konka is confident of having 20 percent of the domestic mobile  
phone market in three years,'' Konka Group general manager Chen 
Weirong told Xinhua. 
</P>
<P>
	Konka is one of China's largest makers of home appliances,  
specializing in color televisions for export, and lists B-shares 
for foreign investors on the Shenzhen stock exchange. The 
technology cooperation deal with Lucent, based in Murray Hill, 
N.J., will allow Konka to diversify into the telecommunications 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	China's mobile phone market is growing quickly. Information  
Industry Minister Wu Jichuan told a forum in Geneva that he expects 
mobile phone subscribers to increase from 26 million to about 200 
million within the next decade, Xinhua said.

<HEADLINE> FAA Vindicated in Consumer Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration had the  
authority to certify a stretched version of a Boeing airplane 
without requiring a full-scale passenger evacuation test, an 
appeals court says. 
</P>
<P>
	A consumer group backed by Ralph Nader, the Aviation Consumer  
Action Project, had challenged the FAA's decision, saying its 
reliance on mathematical analysis and a test on a shorter version 
of the Boeing 777 did not adequately ensure the safety of 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
Circuit ruled Friday that the FAA was allowed to change its policy 
about conducting evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's policy is that airplane builders must show new  
plane models can be evacuated within 90 seconds even if half their 
exits are blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the agency said that in cases in which the capacity of  
a plane is increased by more than 5 percent, manufacturers can meet 
that standard with a full-scale test or by submitting data from 
earlier tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said it planned to use such data in certifying the  
Boeing 777-300, the longest commercial airplane in the world, and 
stretched versions of the Airbus A330 and A340. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether this test is met requires a factual determination by  
the FAA, and clearly, as methods of analysis and other 
considerations develop over time, the FAA's response to the test 
can also,'' wrote Judge Laurence H. Silberman on behalf of the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``In 1998, spurred on by injuries to demonstration  
participants, (the FAA) reviewed its policy and concluded that the 
situation had changed such that analysis and testing were now 
sufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing created the 777-300 by stretching its 777-200 with a  
33-foot fuselage section. At 242 feet, 4 inches long, the jet is 11 
feet longer than the biggest Boeing 747. The added length increased 
the aircraft's capacity from 440 passengers to 550. To accommodate 
them, Boeing added two new emergency exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus lengthened its A330/340 aircraft to increase their  
capacity from 361 passengers to 440. The European aircraft maker 
did not add any new emergency exits, deciding instead to increase 
the size of an existing pair of exits. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in July 1998, focused on the 777-300. The FAA  
certified it on May 4, 1998, based on an evacuation test of just 
the new passenger compartment, as well as an analysis of data 
gleaned during a full-scale passenger evacuation of the 777-200.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Downplays Bioterrorism Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials downplayed a report that suggests  
the CIA is investigating whether the recent West Nile-like 
encephalitis outbreak was deliberately triggered by Iraqi 
bioterrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing indicates that this was anything other than a natural  
outbreak,'' Jerome Hauer, the director of the city's emergency 
management office, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said  
there was no evidence to suggest the recent outbreak was anything 
other than ``Mother Nature at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts at the CIA who deal with biological weapons said an  
Iraqi defector had claimed in April that Saddam Hussein was 
developing a strain of West Nile-like encephalitis for use as a 
biological weapon, The New Yorker reports in its Oct. 18-25 double 
issue that hits newsstands today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recalled by the analysts was published April 6 in the  
Daily Mail of London. It was an except from the book ``In the 
Shadow of Saddam,'' written by Mikhael Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramadan claimed that he worked as one of Hussein's body doubles  
and that Hussein had told him of a plan to develop a strain of West 
Nile encephalitis that would kill 97 percent of people in an urban 
environment. The magazine said Ramadan was believed to be hiding 
somewhere in Canada or the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A strain of a West Nile-like virus has claimed the lives of six  
people in the New York area since it was discovered in early 
September. The mosquito-borne virus has infected 54 people in the 
New York metropolitan area -- 39 in New York City, nine in 
Westchester county and six in Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of the strain include fever and headache. In rare  
cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death. The 
elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems are most 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	CDC officials would not comment directly on the report but  
issued a statement saying, ``The investigation is ongoing and, to 
date, the CDC has no evidence that this is anything but Mother 
Nature at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls by The Associated Press to CIA offices in Virginia went  
unanswered this morning.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Orders 12 Airbuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- British Airways plans to buy 12 new Airbus  
Industrie A318 jetliners to replace some of its older Boeing planes 
on short-haul routes, a blow to Boeing Co., which had hoped to win 
a high-profile customer for its new 717 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways, which also took options to buy another 12  
A318s, chose the European consortium's 100-passenger jet ``for its 
superior economics, flexibility and commonality with the rest of 
our short-haul fleet,'' the carrier said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline will pay $412 million for the first 12 airliners.  
</P>
<P>
	Boeing had sought the order as a major-airline endorsement of  
its 106-seat 717, which went into service last month with its first 
delivery to AirTran Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing inherited the 717 -- then called the MD-90 -- from  
McDonnell Douglas when the companies merged two years ago. There 
has been speculation that Boeing will discontinue the plane, as it 
has other McDonnell Douglas jetliner models, if sales do not pick 
up. The 717 is built in Long Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has orders for 115 717s, and Hawaiian Air has said it  
plans to order 13 more. Airbus has orders and commitments for 157 
of its A318s. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts thought Boeing might have had an edge because the  
717 is flying now while the A318 is three years away. The first 
A318 won't come off the production line until 2002, and British 
Airway will get its first aircraft in January 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Boeing last week agreed to buy 34 used Boeing 757s from  
British Airways and reconfigure them into freighters for lease to 
DHL Worldwide Express, which many thought was a prelude to an order 
for 717s. In some instances, the new A318s will replace 757s on 
British Airways routes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big-brand launch customer was going to be British  
Airways,'' said Brian O'Keefe, an analyst with Commerzbank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 717 looks like it is going to be stillborn in the market,  
without good customers,'' he added. The British Airways loss ``is 
very bad for Boeing -- it's a big shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Sean Griffin said Monday that while Boeing  
hates to lose a sales competition, ``we will not go forward with a 
deal that does not return value to our shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffin emphasized Boeing is ``absolutely committed to the (717)  
program and has no plans to kill it.''

<HEADLINE> AFL-CIO Moves Back to Grass Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The slide-show presentation for AFL-CIO state  
directors darkly dubbed it ``the Trifecta that would dust off the 
'Contract With America''' -- Republican George W. Bush in the White 
House, Republican majorities in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to spoil this GOP dream for 2000, the 13-million-member  
labor federation will spend about $40 million on voter education 
and a grass-roots mobilization bearing little resemblance to its 
$35 million ad campaign in 1996, which many AFL-CIO officials now 
concede was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest resources are people and power,'' federation  
President John Sweeney said in an interview today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney rallied that people power soon afterward, with a battle  
cry to 1,000 union activists gathered for the biennial AFL-CIO 
convention: ``It's time to clean out the House!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new focus is on mobilization -- leafleting, voter  
registration, issues education, phone banks and door-to-door 
campaigning. Underlying it are the problems of 1996, a challenge to 
use of union dues in politics, the wide popularity of Bush and a 
belief that a GOP White House and Congress would be disastrous for 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hence the slide show, in which AFL-CIO officials claim that  
Republicans want to ``gut'' workplace safety regulations, the right 
to collective bargaining and more. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Republicans filed a federal complaint accusing ``big  
labor bosses'' of colluding with the Democratic Party and trying to 
buy control of Congress with their TV ads against GOP House 
incumbents. Democrats lost most of the targeted races. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins said this  
year's tactical shift would make little difference. ``The fact is 
that extreme left, big union bosses like Sweeney have been a 
financial I.V. unit to a Democratic party that is on life 
support,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders don't deny their Democratic sympathies, although  
Washington state federation president Rick Bender noted his group 
recently named GOP state Rep. Tom Campbell ``Legislator of the 
Year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It sends a message to Democrats that they can't take us for  
granted. It tells Republicans if they support our issues, we'll 
support them,'' Bender said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 campaign left one lasting lesson. ``We paid a big price  
for giving Republicans the opportunity to attack us as big labor 
union bosses with a silver platter,'' said Gerry Shea, governmental 
affairs assistant to Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we know we can't win that game,'' Shea added, referring to  
television. ``We need to de-emphasize that kind of media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had retaliated with initiatives requiring unions to  
get permission from individual members before using dues money for 
political activities. In California, this took the form of a ballot 
measure, Proposition 226. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the defeat of 226 last year that gave labor an even more  
instructive lesson for the 2000 election, said Gerald McEntee, 
president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a massive TV campaign, ``we did so much better  
spending our money on grass-roots mobilizing,'' McEntee said. ``We 
had 25,000 walking the streets, walking the barrios. We started 
70-30 (percent) behind, then waltzed in to kill the thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several AFL-CIO officials said focus groups validated an  
aggressive issues-education strategy as the only way to beat Bush, 
the Texas governor and GOP presidential front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus groups start off where they think George Bush is a  
good candidate and would make a good president,'' said McEntee. 
``When you unveil and unfold his record at these focus groups it's 
only like 25 minutes and they go, whoop! I mean, they just move to 
the other side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart Acuff of the Atlanta Labor Council already plans to make  
the election a regular topic of union meetings and dispatch 
hundreds of volunteers to hand out leaflets at shopping malls and 
churches starting next September. ``We need to talk to our people 
on the shop floor, in the workplaces,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions are better equipped to battle their foes on this more  
manpower-intensive front than in the crowded TV ad game, where they 
risk being drowned out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we're willing to saturate the airwaves, which we could  
never afford to do, we can't compete on that level -- and they can't 
compete with us and the rank-and-file that we have,'' said Bender. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of whatever political activity an individual union plans,  
each affiliated union is contributing $2 per member between this 
year and next for the AFL-CIO's political drive, said McEntee, who 
chairs the federation's political committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll spend more dollars in the year 2000 election than we've  
ever spent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added: ``Even though we'll have $40 million, we will  
still be outspent by the right-wing, conservative and business 
forces in this country probably by 16 to 1. They kill us with all 
that money.''

<HEADLINE> DuPont Weighs Lycra Plant in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- The U.S. chemical company Dupont Co. is  
considering investing about $260 million in a third Lycra 
manufacturing plant in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont-Singapore spokesman Alan Rego said Monday that Singapore,  
Taiwan, China and Malaysia are being considered for the plant. 
Discussions are at a preliminary stage, Rego noted. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont has already invested about $178 million in two Lycra  
plants in Singapore, opening one just last week. Lycra is a spandex 
fabric used in underwear, swimsuits and athletic apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that we are interested in building another Lycra  
facility in Asia,'' Rego said. ``What isn't so clear is where that 
investment will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont Lycra vice president Steven McCracken was quoted in  
Singapore's Straits Times newspaper Monday as saying that Singapore 
``has a very good chance'' of landing the investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rego said Singapore have the built-in advantage of having two  
Lycra facilities already in operation, which would cut down on the 
cost of building a new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he noted that Singapore ``doesn't have a market'' for  
Lycra, as do Taiwan and China. He said DuPont was also in 
discussions with BASF AG in Malaysia about working jointly on a 
Lycra facility there. 
</P>
<P>
	BASF manufactures tetrahydrofuran, a chemical used in making  
Lycra.

<HEADLINE> Vibraphonist Milt Jackson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Milt Jackson, a jazz vibraphonist who made the  
instrument sing like the human voice as a longtime member of the 
Modern Jazz Quartet, died of liver cancer. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, one of the best improvisers in jazz and an outstanding  
blues player, died Saturday at a Manhattan hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson originally was a singer in a Detroit gospel quartet. In  
the 1940s, he created a new sound by slowing the motor on his 
Deagan Vibraharp's oscillator to a third of the speed of Lionel 
Hampton's. The result was a warm, smoky sound with a vibrato 
approximating his own singing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came closer than anyone else on the instrument to making it  
sound like the human voice,'' vibraphonist Stefon Harris said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He set a precedent that this instrument can speak beautiful  
things and that it's not just percussive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's style came from Charlie Parker, whose rhythmic traits  
he adopted. He was one of the first bona fide be-bop vibraphone 
musicians, and he became a jewel in Gillespie's band. He recorded 
be-bop classics with the band, such as ``A Night in Tunisia,'' 
``Anthropology'' and ``Two Bass Hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, Jackson teamed with Thelonius Monk, recording ``Criss  
Cross'' and ``Straight, No Chaser,'' among others. 
</P>
<P>
	When a pianist in Gillespie's band, John Lewis, decided to form  
a new group, one going beyond soloists with a rhythm section, 
Jackson signed on. In 1952, the Modern Jazz Quartet was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Through 20 years of albums, mostly for Atlantic records, the  
group became one of the first jazz bands embraced by an audience 
much wider than jazz fans. Members choreographed all aspects of 
their presentation, from walking on stage to playing their subdued 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	The band dissolved in 1974 and reunited temporarily for a few  
tours in the 1980s and early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson started teaching himself to play the guitar when he was  
7 and taking piano lessons when he was 11. By high school, he 
played five instruments: drums, guitar, timpani, violin and 
xylophone. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Jackson was 16, he had begun playing the vibraphone  
and was performing with Clarence Ringo and the George E. Lee band. 
He started a jazz quartet, the Four Sharps, after high school and 
two years of overseas military service. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dizzy Gillespie saw the Four Sharps in a Detroit bar, he  
asked Jackson to join the rhythm section of his band in New York.

<HEADLINE> Walks to Garciaparra Set Up Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians feared Nomar Garciaparra  
so much they walked him intentionally twice. They should have 
worried about Troy O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice O'Leary came up after the AL batting champion stared at  
four balls and twice he homered on the first pitch -- a grand slam 
in the third inning and a three-run homer in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Indians decided to walk O'Leary intentionally in  
the ninth. By then it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	The two homers by O'Leary, who doesn't get much attention  
because of his soft-spoken nature, gave the Boston Red Sox a 12-8 
win as they came back from losses in the first two games to take 
the AL division series 3-2 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the biggest night of my life,'' Boston's left fielder  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There haven't been many good ones lately. He had been 2-for-17  
in the series before his first homer and he had tailed off at the 
end of a season in which he hit .280 with a team-high 28 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter. That's all in the past,'' O'Leary said.  
``Tonight's a big night for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox move on to the AL Championship Series against the  
New York Yankees starting Wednesday night in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary's second homer broke an 8-8 tie in the seventh and put  
the Red Sox ahead 11-8. The first had put Boston in front 7-5 in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
	It was understandable for the Indians to risk pitching to  
O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 0-for-5 Sunday night when Boston pounded out 24 hits in  
a 23-7 win at Fenway Park that tied the series. And first base was 
open both times Garciaparra came to the plate before the homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had been handling O'Leary up until tonight,'' Cleveland  
manager Mike Hargrove said. ``There was no way to pitch around 
(Garciaparra) in the first inning because there was a man standing 
on first base. 
</P>
<P>
	``In subsequent times, first base was open so we put him on.''  
</P>
<P>
	The first inning gave the Indians even more reason to pitch to  
O'Leary rather than Garciaparra, who had given Boston a 2-0 lead 
with a homer. O'Leary ended the inning by striking out. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the midst of his second straight horrid division  
series after going just 1-for-16 last year as Cleveland beat Boston 
3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third, after Brian Daubach's double put runners at second  
and third with one out, Hargrove had Charles Nagy walk Garciaparra. 
O'Leary then hit Nagy's next pitch 417 feet into the right-center 
field stands for Boston's first postseason grand slam in its 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``My man Troy!'' an uncharacteristically exuberant general  
manager Dan Duquette said, pouring champagne over O'Leary's head. 
``Got the first grand slam in postseason history. Thatta baby!'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Duquette who claimed O'Leary on waivers on April 14,  
1995, after Milwaukee gave up on him. O'Leary responded by batting 
.308 that season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the score was tied 8-8 when Hargrove faced a decision  
on whether to walk Garciaparra in the seventh. And, despite 
O'Leary's grand slam, the manager still wanted no part of 
Garciaparra. 
</P>
<P>
	So after John Valentin walked and moved to second on Daubach's  
grounder to second baseman Roberto Alomar, Paul Shuey deliberately 
threw four balls to Garciaparra. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walked Nomar a few times. That's a personal challenge,''  
Boston right fielder Trot Nixon said. ``Troy took that to heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been happening all year. Sometimes I respond. Sometimes I  
don't,'' O'Leary said of the intentional walks to Garciaparra. 
``The way I've been swinging, I told myself just make good 
contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't have done much better.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was Troy's day today,'' said Valentin, who just one night  
earlier had two homers and seven RBIs. ``He doesn't get the credit. 
We love him.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Regulators Eye Bank Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that  
regulators are weighing changes to deal with the huge banks being 
formed by mergers that could hurt the economy if they fail. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to bankers, the Federal Reserve chief said  
``significant changes are in the pipeline'' in banking supervision 
by U.S. regulators and their foreign counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes point to a ``multitrack approach'' to oversight of  
banks, since they vary significantly in size, business strategy and 
penchant for risk, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even among the largest banks, no two institutions have exactly  
the same risk profiles, risk controls or organizational and 
management structure,'' Greenspan said in the speech to the 
American Bankers Association's annual convention in Phoenix. Copies 
of his speech to the banking industry's biggest trade group were 
released in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Because banks vary so widely, he said, government oversight  
needs to be ``customized for each (financial) institution: the more 
complex an institution's business activities, the more 
sophisticated must be our approach to prudential oversight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said such flexibility is especially evident in the  
case of ``megabanks'' which, he said, ``create the potential for 
unusually large systemic risks in the national and international 
economy should they fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators such as the Fed must walk a line between exercising  
adequate oversight of such big banks and regulating them 
excessively in a way that smothers innovation and competition, he 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a heavier hand would also blunt the ability of U.S. banks  
to respond to crisis events,'' Greenspan said. ``Increased 
government regulation is inconsistent with a banking system that 
can respond to the kinds of changes that have characterized recent 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big bank mergers have been occurring at an accelerated pace in  
this country, with recent multibillion-dollar consolidations 
including those in which banking giant Citicorp merged with 
brokerage-insurer Travelers Group; NationsBank Corp. and 
BankAmerica Corp. combined; and Banc One Corp. and First Chicago 
joined. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader and  
some lawmakers, have asserted that the mergers have increased the 
likelihood of future taxpayer bailouts of big financial 
institutions that fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond responding to the rise of huge banks, Greenspan said,  
``few changes'' are needed to the current system of regulation for 
the vast majority of banks in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Space Center Workers Feared Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- As Hurricane Floyd churned toward  
Kennedy Space Center, Roger Gillette and Roberta Wyrick barricaded 
themselves in the launch control center, fearing water more than 
wind. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief test conductors, who stayed behind to help defend NASA  
property against the storm, felt certain the space shuttle hangars 
would hold even though they were not designed to withstand Floyd's 
140-plus-mph wind. A storm surge, however, easily could damage the 
four shuttles and numerous space station components awaiting 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Doors to critical buildings were sealed with sandbags, and  
replacement parts for the Hubble Space Telescope and other flight 
equipment were raised off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the space shuttles already were propped 6 feet high and  
shrouded by work platforms in the Orbiter Processing Facility. But 
Atlantis was parked on the floor of the Vehicle Assembly Building. 
Workers placed plastic bags around the landing gear, covered the 
main engines and hoped for the best. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, truckloads of computers were hauled from  
makeshift offices in trailers into the launch control center, and 
the van used to transport astronauts to the pad was driven into the 
Vehicle Assembly Building. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly arrived booster-rocket segments were transported back out  
in railroad cars all the way to the Florida Panhandle. Radios and 
satellite phones were distributed in case the regular phones went 
dead. Finally, the entrance gates to the space center were closed 
and locked. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the waiting game began for Gillette, Wyrick and the 103  
other space center workers who volunteered to stay behind Sept. 14 
to guard against Floyd, a monster storm. For the first time ever, 
NASA considered pulling everyone out; officials ended up paring 
down the crew to be left behind to the bare minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12,400 other employees had evacuated the day before, leaving  
the space center an eerily quiet, boarded-up ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when reality began to set in, at least for Gillette.  
</P>
<P>
	``You start talking about what could happen,'' he said in an  
interview last week. ``Sixteen-foot surge. And you're thinking 16 
feet and then you start measuring up the wall where that is exactly 
and you realize, 'Uh-oh, I need to get on the third floor.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy Space Center is a mere 9 feet above sea level and smack  
on the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	As the wind picked up and the rain pounded down, Gillette and  
Wyrick nervously flipped between The Weather Channel and local news 
broadcasts. It wasn't until almost midnight that they learned Cape 
Canaveral likely would be spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd was moving more toward the north and expected to  
pass some 100 miles offshore, with less severe wind than predicted 
and little if any storm surge. As it turned out, the maximum 
sustained wind at the space center was 66 mph, with gusts up to 91 
mph, well within the limits of NASA's critical buildings. Close to 
3 inches of rain fell. 
</P>
<P>
	At daybreak on Sept. 15, the ride-out crew ventured outside. To  
everyone's relief, damage was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 30 pieces of sheet metal were ripped off the 525-foot-high  
Vehicle Assembly Building and a glass door blew out of the 
adjoining launch control center. At one of the two launch pads, a 
door leading to electrical equipment was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Over at the Orbiter Processing Facility, rain had seeped through  
the ceiling and walls. But workers quickly mopped up the water; 
fortunately, there wasn't much. 
</P>
<P>
	The electricity had gone out now and then, but the mechanics who  
stayed behind to keep the systems running were able to restart 
them. Rising humidity could have damaged the shuttles and space 
station equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette and Wyrick -- and everyone else who works at Kennedy --  
realize how close they came to having their livelihoods washed 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to move down the coast and be able to launch  
again,'' Wyrick said. ``Where else are you going to do this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time since Hurricane Erin in 1995 that the  
space center shut down. Hurricanes Bertha and Fran forced NASA to 
move Atlantis from the launch pad into the hangar in 1996, but no 
evacuation was ordered. None of these compared with Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I worry about the most is that people are going to  
get complacent again,'' said Gillette. ``I don't want one to hit 
just so they can understand what it can do. But I'd like people to 
take a look at what happened at North Carolina. That could be here, 
understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is heeding his words.  
</P>
<P>
	Space agency chief Daniel Goldin has ordered a review of  
building safety and hurricane procedures. Kennedy officials plan to 
bring in outside architects and engineers to evaluate all the 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
	When NASA built its steel-reinforced concrete hangars and launch  
pads in the 1960s and 1970s, it complied with standards set by the 
American Society of Civil Engineers. The structures consequently 
were designed to withstand sustained wind of no more than 105 mph 
to 125 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hurricane Andrew's devastating blow to South Florida in  
1992, the society revised its guidelines to 135 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideas already are kicking around the space center for the next  
time a hurricane strikes. Wyrick, for instance, wonders whether a 
shuttle would be safer atop a mobile launch platform in the Vehicle 
Assembly Building, rather than parked on the floor as Atlantis was. 
</P>
<P>
	As for flying the $8 billion space shuttle fleet to safety atop  
modified 747 jets, forget it, says Jim Comer, a shuttle worker who 
rode out the hurricane in the Orbiter Processing Facility. 
</P>
<P>
	A full day is needed to secure a shuttle on a jet, and that  
doesn't count the time needed to pull out work platforms and button 
up the ship, Comer said. Besides, he noted, with only two modified 
747s and one mating device, there's no way all four shuttles could 
get out in time. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is considering erecting a structure that could take  
Floyd-force wind, so a small team could stay behind no matter how 
bad the hurricane and fan out as soon as the storm passed. But 
other than starting from scratch, there's little that can be done 
to the Vehicle Assembly Building and other shuttle facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about the storm of the century that would have  
to come through to really wipe that thing out,'' Gillette said. 
``If you try to build it for that storm, it would cost 10 times the 
amount of money and what good would it be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you get into something like that,'' he added, ``it's best  
effort, safely.''

<HEADLINE> Packers Defeat Buccaneers 26-23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- A couple of minutes after nearly giving  
the game away, Brett Favre gave himself quite a birthday present. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre, who turned 30 on Sunday, led Green Bay on a last-minute,  
game-winning drive for the third time this season, hitting Antonio 
Freeman with a 21-yard touchdown pass with 1:05 left as the Packers 
beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 26-23. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't think we'd have to do it again,'' said Favre, who  
re-injured his right thumb during the game. ``Three times out of 
three, though -- that's not too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winning pass capped a six-play, 73-yard drive Favre directed  
in 40 seconds against the Buccaneers' top-ranked defense. The 
Packers racked up 452 yards of total offense against Tampa Bay but 
looked to be in trouble when Mike Alstott's 22-yard touchdown run 
with 1:45 to play put the Bucs up 23-19. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre, who wept after the first comeback win and hyperventilated  
after the second, was somber after the latest. His swollen, bruised 
thumb, which was wrapped in ice, ``doesn't look good right now,'' 
he said, though he thought he would be able to play next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers got the ball back at their 27 with 1:40 to play, and  
Favre hit Bill Schroeder with a 42-yard pass down the left 
sideline. Favre got up holding his right arm, but it didn't slow 
him down. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 10-yard draw by Dorsey Levens and a couple of  
incompletions, Favre saw the Buccaneers coming on an all-out blitz, 
and he exchanged a look with Freeman. Favre then threw a 21-yard 
bullet to Freeman, who caught the ball in the end zone while Ronde 
Barber tackled him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the blitz, and my eyes got big,'' Freeman said. ``I  
figured if I beat my man, I was getting the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 13th come-from-behind win for Favre and the 16th time  
he led a game-winning drive. He broke the hearts of the Bucs, who 
were outplayed most of the night before losing their second 
straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have bet my life we'd have stopped them on that drive,''  
said Warren Sapp, who had two of Tampa Bay's five sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre was 22-of-40 for 390 yards and two touchdowns. He hit  
Corey Bradford with a 23-yard TD pass with 12 seconds to play in 
Green Bay's 23-20 win over Minnesota two weeks ago, and he won the 
season-opener against Oakland 28-24 by hitting Jeff Thomason with a 
1-yard scoring pass with 11 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers (3-1) moved into first place in the NFC Central with  
the win, their eighth straight and 33rd in the last 34 games at 
Lambeau Field. Ryan Longwell kicked four field goals for the 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buccaneers (2-3), who haven't won at Lambeau Field since  
1989, were crippled by four turnovers. Trent Dilfer threw three 
interceptions, including one to Darren Sharper with 13 seconds to 
play that sealed Green Bay's win. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre's last-minute heroics erased an embarrassing miscue. With  
4:48 to play, Packers defensive end Keith McKenzie sacked Dilfer, 
forced a fumble and recovered it at Tampa Bay's 19. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the Packers drove to the 4, Favre was chased out of  
the pocket and then was called for intentional grounding when he 
wildly flung the ball away to avoid a sack. After the 22-yard 
penalty, Longwell missed a field goal from 45 yards with 2:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay then drove 65 yards, highlighted by Dilfer's 27-yard  
scramble, to Alstott's touchdown, but the Bucs left Favre too much 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It crushes you,'' said Alstott, who had 87 yards on 14  
carries. ``You're on top of the world one minute, and 1:45 later 
the game's over, and you lost. It's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre hit his two starting wide receivers early and often.  
Schroeder had seven catches for a career-high 158 yards and Freeman 
had seven for 152, giving Green Bay two 100-yard receiving games 
for the first time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder caught a 51-yard pass from Favre on Green Bay's first  
play of the game, and Freeman caught a 19-yard touchdown pass 
moments later to cap a 77-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buccaneers' much-maligned offense struggled, and one  
first-half drive died on a goal-line interception by Green Bay's 
Jermaine Smith. Martin Gramatica kicked three field goals for Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick Dunn, who was injured late in the game, scored on a  
16-yard pass from Dilfer on Tampa Bay's opening play of the second 
quarter, and Gramatica kicked a 36-yarder with 14:28 left in the 
half that tied it 16-16. 
</P>
<P>
	At halftime, the Packers retired former defensive end Reggie  
White's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Favre made his 113th consecutive start, putting him just  
three behind Ron Jaworski for the league record for most by a 
quarterback. ... Favre's 390 yards passing were the third most of 
his career. ... Longwell's miss was his first of the season after 
nine straight successful attempts. ... The Buccaneers scored more 
than 20 points in a game for the first time this season. ... Tampa 
Bay had allowed 794 total yards in its first four games combined. 
... Green Bay has beaten Tampa Bay in 17 of their last 20 meetings.

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins in Wyo. Gay Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Aaron McKinney beat gay college student  
Matthew Shepard on the windswept Wyoming prairie but his judgment 
was clouded by drugs and alcohol, McKinney's attorney said Monday 
as jury selection began in his murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to contest the cause of death or that he died  
as a result of a beating from Aaron McKinney along with Russell 
Henderson,'' lawyer Dion Custis told prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Custis also said he would not point the finger at Henderson,  
McKinney's co-defendant who has pleaded guilty to murder and is 
serving life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would not contend that McKinney was insane, but said  
``his mental state will certainly be a crucial question for you to 
answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Custis' comments marked the first time he has unveiled a  
strategy for defending McKinney, who is facing the death sentence 
if convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, a University of Wyoming freshman majoring in  
political science, died a year ago Tuesday, five days after he was 
lured out of a bar, driven to a remote spot on the freezing 
prairie, lashed to a wooden fence and pistol-whipped into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say McKinney, 22, accompanied by Henderson, also 22,  
instigated the crime to rob the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard of $20, 
but that Shepard may have been targeted because he was gay. 
Henderson is expected to testify for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Custis told the prospects he was concerned about the widespread  
attention stemming from the case, which brought gay-rights issues 
to the forefront. ``I don't think anyone here is going to suggest 
this is a hate crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha warned the juror candidates that they  
must treat both sides fairly, regardless of their prejudices. 
``Whether you're Catholic or Muslim, if you are straight or gay, 
everyone is treated equal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial began, a few anti-gay protesters demonstrated  
outside the courthouse, along with people who came to honor 
Shepard's memory, wearing angel costumes to spread what they said 
was a message of love. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, McKinney talked quietly with his lawyers, looked at his  
notes and smiled occasionally as the attorneys spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney has said he had no idea Shepard was gay and does not  
hate homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing provoked a national debate over hate crimes and led  
to measures across the country adding sexual orientation to 
anti-discrimination laws. However, hate-crime legislation failed in 
Wyoming last winter after lawmakers argued that gays and other 
protected groups would get special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial also opened on the day that gay activists call  
National Coming Out Day and the beginning of Gay Awareness Week. 
The Rev. Jerry Falwell marked the occasion by preaching via 
satellite to gays and lesbians in San Francisco about how to ``come 
out of a sinful lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end the day, 21 prospective jurors had been dismissed,  
including a man reporters saw pass a note to Shepard's mother 
during the lunch break. The man indicated the note expressed his 
condolences. The pool of 256 candidates is about the average size 
for a murder case in Laramie. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's father, William, sat near the back of the room, his  
eyes cast downward. He was accompanied by three supporters. On the 
other side of the aisle, Shepard's parents, Dennis and Judy, sat in 
a back row. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen members of a group called Angel Action, wearing golden  
halos and costumes made of white bedsheets, stood silently in the 
street. Spokeswoman Romaine Patterson, 21, of State College, Pa., 
said the group wanted to send a message of love. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, six followers of the Rev. Fred Phelps, 69, of Topeka,  
Kan., waved signs bearing anti-gay slogans. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents in Laramie appeared to be taking little notice.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know, maybe the town just wants it over,'' said Ben  
Rashford, 23, a University of Wyoming graduate student. ``Laramie 
is not that different than any place else. People like to think 
that but it's not.''

<HEADLINE> Saturn Prepares for New Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) -- Saturn plans to shut down its assembly  
lines in early January to gear up for production of its new sport 
utility vehicle, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant normally is idled over the Thanksgiving weekend and  
for about a week between Christmas and New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn also will halt production for the first two weeks in  
January so that workers can move machinery and make other changes 
needed to add the SUV production. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn has not said when production of the SUV will begin or  
when it will be introduced to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	All employes will still report for work during the down time,  
Saturn spokesman Bill Betts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn's unique contract with the United Auto Workers says the  
plant's 7,200 or so assembly-line workers will spend down time 
during supplier strikes or other production halts doing plant 
maintenance, planning, training and other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown will cost Saturn at least 10 days of production.  
The plant currently builds about 1,000 cars per day. 
</P>
<P>
	The new vehicle is aimed at gaining Saturn a piece of the  
booming SUV market, as demand for the Spring Hill-built S-series 
has sagged. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the basic S-series Saturns fell by 4.7 percent to about  
221,000 vehicles through September, the end of the 1999 model year. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales of the redesigned three-door coupe helped offset  
declines in the sedan and station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Jan. 1, sales of Spring Hill-built models are off 5.8%.  
</P>
<P>
	But total Saturn sales are only down slightly due to demand for  
the new, larger, 2000-model L-series, built in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. auto industry is reporting a 9.7 percent increase in  
sales so far this year.

<HEADLINE> Tommy Lee Surrenders in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Former Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee has  
surrendered to authorities on a warrant charging him with trying to 
incite a racially motivated riot during a 1997 concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was accompanied by his attorney when he surrendered Monday  
to Guilford County sheriff's deputies. He was released on $5,000 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee faces charges of felony rioting and three misdemeanor  
charges of disorderly conduct, assault and inciting a riot. The 
band's bass player, Nikki Sixx, was arrested during a concert in 
Raleigh last month. 
</P>
<P>
	During an October 1997 concert at the Greensboro Coliseum, Sixx  
allegedly directed a racial slur at a black guard and encouraged 
the crowd of 2,500 to attack him. Other guards said Sixx and Lee 
poured a drink onto the guard's head. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard and his employer filed a lawsuit against Sixx and Lee  
last year. That civil trial is scheduled for November.

<HEADLINE> Alabama's Alexander Eyes Heisman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Once considered a long shot for the  
Heisman Trophy, Alabama tailback Shaun Alexander is suddenly very 
much in the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-touchdown performance two weeks ago against Florida  
vaulted Alexander into the race for college football's most coveted 
award. Even though No. 11 Alabama (4-1) was off last week, 
Alexander's name was heard a lot more often when candidates were 
mentioned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's impressive, considering Alexander wasn't much of factor  
Heisman-wise before the season started -- despite the campaign 
Crimson Tide officials had launched for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama has never before touted a player for an award because  
former coach Bear Bryant didn't believe in it. Because of that, the 
highest an Alabama player has ever finished in the voting was 
third, David Palmer in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Alexander chose to return to school for his senior  
season, coach Mike DuBose promised to help him win the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose has done his part by giving Alexander the ball at least  
30 times a game. And the school has created an Alexander Web site 
and sent out a CD-ROM of highlights to Heisman voters. 
</P>
<P>
	They left the rest up to Alexander.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Heisman campaign is more of a `Hey, look over here  
at what they've got,''' Alexander said. ``If I continue to play 
well and we continue to win, it should take care of itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he's living up to his end.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander leads the nation in scoring and is second in  
all-purpose yardage behind Stanford receiver Troy Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a string of five-straight 100-yard rushing efforts, one  
shy of matching the Alabama record, and needs just 519 yards to 
pass Bobby Humphrey as Alabama's career rushing leader with 3,420 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But his best work came in nationally televised wins over  
Arkansas and Florida. Against Arkansas he ran for 165 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The next week against Florida, he scored three rushing  
touchdowns, one receiving touchdown and had 200 all-purpose yards. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, who had his first chance this season to sit back and  
watch some games on Saturday, said he has yet to find a player 
better than Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anyone that is doing as much on and off the field  
then Shaun does,'' DuBose said. ``He's outstanding in all phases of 
the offense. His presence alone makes the 10 guys around him 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander was even impressive in the 29-28 upset loss to  
Louisiana Tech when he ran for 173 and two touchdowns, and scored a 
third on a 76-yard kickoff return. That was the only time he has 
returned a kick all year. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing working in his favor, Alexander thinks, is playing in  
the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're one of the best players in the SEC, you've got to  
have a shot,'' Alexander said. ``If I do something good and 
(Georgia Tech's) Joe (Hamilton) does something good in the ACC, 
I've got to have the advantage because I think the SEC is more 
dominant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll get a chance to prove it the next two weeks when Alabama  
plays at No. 22 Mississippi and then plays host to No. 6 Tennessee. 
Both games will be nationally televised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Heisman is about how you carry your team and what  
you mean to it,'' he said. ``Heisman winners win the big games, so 
we'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Fractured Rib May Sideline O'Neill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the start of the AL championship series  
just two days away, the New York Yankees learned Monday that right 
fielder Paul O'Neill has a fractured rib and might not play against 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill was injured Oct. 2 when he crashed into a low fence  
chasing a foul ball at Tampa Bay, then went 1-for-4 in each of the 
first two games of the AL playoffs against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre benched him for the clincher,  
convinced the injury was hampering O'Neill. The team sent the 
36-year-old outfielder to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center on 
Monday for new X-rays and an MRI, which showed a small fracture of 
the 10th rib on his right side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, I guess, it shows up later,'' O'Neill said in the  
players' parking lot outside Yankee Stadium after returning from 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosters for the championship series must be set by 10 a.m. EDT  
Wednesday, and the Yankees won't make any decisions until then, 
general manager Brian Cashman said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who hasn't played since Thursday, intended to take  
batting practice Tuesday along with running and outfield drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go out and see if it's possible to play,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who hit .285 this season with 19 homers and 110s RBIs,  
is an intense competitor who plays through pain. In 1996, he 
hobbled on a torn hamstring for much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Joe Torre and the medical staff will be able to see  
how debilitating it's going to be,'' Cashman said, adding the 
decision would be based on how O'Neill works out. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill admitted the injury was bothering him.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	If O'Neill can't play for the start of the best-of-7 series  
Wednesday night, the Yankees probably will activate Shane Spencer, 
who wasn't on the roster for the first-round sweep of Texas. 
O'Neill's teammates still hope he'll be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``With him in there, we have a hitter capable of producing a lot  
of runs,'' Darryl Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	To open a spot if O'Neill is questionable, New York probably  
would cut either Clay Bellinger, used mostly as a pinch runner, or 
pitcher Hideki Irabu, who didn't pitch against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after arriving home from Texas, the Yankees were given the  
day off Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a few players showed up at Yankee Stadium, including  
Strawberry, probable Game 1 starter Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez 
and closer Mariano Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera ran wind sprints in the outfield as a bright sun beat  
down on the nearly empty ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to take too much time off,'' he said. ``I want to  
be strong and sharp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Red Sox beat the Indians 12-8 Monday night in the  
decisive fifth game of their first-round playoff, the Yankees said 
they were just happy the other series went the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a 21-inning game tonight,'' Cashman said, ``I'm  
hoping for an extra-inning, rain-delayed slugfest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defending World Series champions, seeking their third title  
in four seasons and 25th overall, project an aura of superiority, 
that they're above it all. And who can blame them? They've won 10 
straight postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to keep the focus on what we do,'' Strawberry  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York was just 4-8 against Boston, including three straight  
losses at Yankee Stadium from Sept. 10-12 that cut its AL East to 
3 1/2 games. The only other teams to win their season series against 
the Yankees were Anaheim and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez, Boston's Game 5 hero, is likely to start the  
third game of the series against New York and be available to start 
a seventh game, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make a difference,'' Rivera said, asked if he'd  
rather play Boston or Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time the Yankees and their traditional  
rival have met in postseason play. New York's win at Fenway Park in 
the 1978 tiebreaker for the AL East is considered a regular-season 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre came to the ballpark, worked out, then spent some time in  
his office, but was uncharacteristically short with reporters, 
declining to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez also wouldn't talk. He allowed two hits in eight  
shutout innings during the playoffs opener and is 3-0 with an 0.41 
ERA in three postseason starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre must decide whether to follow his first-round rotation --  
Andy Pettitte in Game 2 and Roger Clemens in Game 3 -- or try to 
insert David Cone, who didn't get to pitch against Texas because 
the series never got to a fourth game.

<HEADLINE> FedEx CEO Weise Announces Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Theodore L. Weise, chief executive of  
Federal Express Corp., is planning to retire at the end of January 
after 28 years with the world's leading overnight package delivery 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Weise, 55, will be succeeded by David J. Bronczek, 45, a FedEx  
executive vice president with 23 years at the company. Weise denied 
his decision to step aside was prompted by a disappointing earnings 
report last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Weise, who held a number of senior management positions with  
FedEx, became the cargo airline's president and CEO in 1998 after a 
corporate restructuring that created a parent company, FDX Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	FDX, a $17 billion transportation company, is the parent of  
FedEx and several other subsidiaries, including RPS Inc., Viking 
Freight Inc., Roberts Express Inc. and FDX Logistics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ted has been at my side since the very beginning, consistently  
providing invaluable counsel and strong leadership in numerous 
capacities,'' said Frederick W. Smith, chief executive of FDX Corp. 
and founder of Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Schlesinger, a market analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;  
Jenrette of New York, said the change in FedEx management should 
not greatly alter the company's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would appear to me that one old hand retires and another  
old hand takes his place,'' Schlesinger said. ``There shouldn't be 
a material difference in direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weise went to work for FedEx in 1972 when the company still was  
being formed and was creating its system for time-specific, 
cross-country package deliveries. It now delivers some 3 million 
packages to 210 countries each business day. 
</P>
<P>
	Weise said he knew when he became CEO last year that he would  
hold the job for only a couple of years. The retirement has nothing 
to do with the company's disappointing first quarter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time has just come,'' Weise said.  
</P>
<P>
	FDX reported lower-than-expected earnings of 52 cents a share  
last month and warned of possible weakness in the current quarter, 
sending shares of FDX tumbling 12.4 percent. FDX later announced it 
would buy back 15 million shares of its stock to show confidence in 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	After retirement, Weise will continue as a consultant on air  
operations for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Few men or women have enjoyed the privilege, as I have, of  
joining a struggling startup and helping it become one of the 
premier companies in the world,'' Weise said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronczek is currently chief operating officer for FedEx.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dave Bronczek brings considerable international experience,  
strong business acumen and creative strategic thinking to the CEO 
position,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The retirement plans were announced after the close of trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where FDX gained 43 3/4 cents to 
$42.75 a share.

<HEADLINE> Airborne E-Mail Service Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Airshow Inc., a provider of flight information  
systems, unveiled plans Monday to offer in-flight e-mail services 
for corporate jet travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	The service would allow customers to send and receive e-mail to  
an ``AirshowMail'' account that can be accessed either through a 
laptop computer or a special ``cabin management system'' provided 
by Airshow. The company made the announcement at the National 
Business Aviation Association convention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	AirshowMail will be transmitted by radio telephone to planes  
within the continental United States and by satellite 
communications to aircraft traveling internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	To meet narrow bandwidth restrictions and reduce signal  
interference, AirshowMail will compress messages prior to 
transmission. But the company is prepared to ``adapt to higher 
bandwidth technology and faster communication devices as they 
become available,'' said Skip Feher, Airshow's vice president of 
communication services. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will encrypt customers' e-mail to secure privacy  
once messages are forwarded to AirshowMail. Pricing has not yet 
been set, but customers will likely be charged a monthly or annual 
fee. The service is expected to debut in the second quarter of 
2000, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airshow, based in Tustin, Calif., is a subsidiary of Burlington,  
Mass.-based Dynatech Corp. and provides map displays, text-based 
news and other real-time information to some 4,000 corporate 
aircraft.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 House Plans in CD-ROM Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	New houses might look as though they're built with wood or  
bricks, but they're really built with money. And the object is to 
have some of that money left when you're done building. 
</P>
<P>
	That begins with the all-important planning, which is where a  
lot of money can be spent -- sometimes as much as 12 percent of the 
house's total cost. HomeStyles Publishing and Marketing Inc., of 
St. Paul, Minn., has a Windows CD-ROM that might help cut those 
planning costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Holigan's Guide to Your New House CD-ROM is an  
interactive version of the TV show of the same name. The four-CD 
set holds more than 5,000 house plans. 
</P>
<P>
	After ``interviewing'' you, the software lets you search this  
database and then offers plans for you to review -- and, HomeStyles 
hopes, for you to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, plans for a house of almost 2,400 square feet are  
available for $534 for the eight sets of blueprints typically 
needed: one set each for you, local building authorities, the 
plumber and the electrician; and two sets each for both the builder 
and the financial source. Changing or copying the plans violates 
copyright law. For those who want to make changes, there are 
``reproducible'' plans that cost about 10 percent more. 
</P>
<P>
	You can also buy lists of building materials, important for  
estimating overall cost. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be noted that the software doesn't turn you into an  
architect or construction manager, but it's much more economical in 
the broad initial selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The software does offer more than a tool to shill HomeStyles'  
core product, however. There are guides to selecting a builder, 
financing, construction and other serious issues right down to the 
final walkthrough and move-in. It's nicely done, with the look and 
feel of a good Web page, and it's complete with appropriate 
versions of Adobe Acrobat and Quicktime for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements: Windows 95-98-NT 4.0, 120 megahertz Pentium  
and 16 megabytes of RAM (but 200 megahertz and 32 megabytes are 
``highly recommended''). Your CD-ROM drive should be at least a 
quad-speed and the monitor SVGA. 
</P>
<P>
	The software retails for $29.99.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends at High; Dow Off 1.58 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index climbed to a new  
closing high Monday as the promise of strong corporate earnings 
pumped up technology stocks. Broader market indicators ended an 
otherwise quiet session little changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.58 to close at  
10,648.18, having given up an earlier gain of as much as 69 points. 
Traders said the modest performance was expected after last week, 
when the Dow gained almost 377 points in its best performance in 
three months. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 0.81 to 1,335.21. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq rose 29.38 to 2,915.95, surpassing its all-time  
closing high of 2,887.06, set Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks,  
benefited from strong performances from both industry leaders and 
highflying newcomers. Ask Jeeves, the maker of a Web-search service 
that allows users to seek information by asking questions rather 
than typing in keywords, soared 17 7/8 to 68 5/16 after the company 
signed a deal with Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, considered a bellwether for the technology sector, rose  
13/16 to 76 1/2 on speculation it will report strong earnings on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings reports from a wide range of companies are expected to  
drive market activity this week. First Call/Thomson Financial 
expects the companies in the S&AMP;P 500 to report average profit 
growth of 19.4 percent for the recently ended third quarter, the 
strongest quarter since the second quarter of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception of improving earnings momentum is moving the  
market,'' said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., equity strategist at Salomon 
Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical company Abbott Laboratories rose 5/8 to 41 7/16  
after meeting analysts' estimates. Abbott's profits rose 10 percent 
from last year's third quarter, and sales improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the promise of widespread strength in corporate profit  
growth has created a difficult climate for any companies that miss 
analysts' expectations. Knight/Trimark fell 3 39/64 to 26 3/8 after 
saying it expects to report third-quarter earnings between 17 cents 
and 19 cents per share. Analysts had expected the company, a 
securities dealer which focuses on making markets for Nasdaq 
stocks, to earn 30 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	A wide range of cyclical stocks also closed higher. Cyclical  
companies tend to rise and fall along with the broader economy, and 
many are expected to show healthy earnings growth due to the 
economy's strength. Caterpillar picked up 1 13/16 to close at 58 
7/16 and Alcoa rose 1 3/8 to 63. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strong earnings should help the market's bulls get the first  
shot at establishing the trend for the fourth quarter,'' said 
Gregory Nie, technical analyst at First Union Securities in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Acuff cautioned that most companies face fairly easy comparisons  
to profits in the third quarter of 1998, when U.S. businesses were 
hampered by the Asian financial crisis. Acuff also said the 
market's strength may be fleeting if the optimism about technology 
stocks fails to catch on in other sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to see the market broadening out more,'' he said.  
``That could increase odds of some sustainability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday marked the start of the bull market's 10th year. On Oct.  
11, 1990, the Dow closed at 2,365.10, and has risen 350 percent 
since then in the longest bull market in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 791.73 million 
shares, compared with 1.08 billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market was closed Monday in observance of Columbus Day.  
The stock market was open for a full session, but many market 
participants were taking a three-day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.48 to 430.19.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's stock market was closed for a national  
holiday. In Europe, Germany's DAX index slipped 0.1 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 edged 
up 0.01 percent.

<HEADLINE> Union Leader Attacks Republicans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney declared war  
Monday on an ``ugly, anti-poor, anti-working family'' Republican 
congressional majority as all signs pointed to an endorsement of 
Vice President Al Gore by the 13-million-member labor federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement, the AFL-CIO's earliest since its 1983 nod to  
former Vice President Walter Mondale, would almost immediately kick 
into gear a $40-million mobilization meant as much to strengthen 
Gore as to wrest control of Congress from the Republicans and 
topple GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outrage is right here in this hall! It is pounding in the  
heart of every trade unionist in this country as our perverted 
United States Congress continues to boost those who are up and kick 
those who are down,'' Sweeney howled to 1,000 union activists 
gathered for the biennial AFL-CIO convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers would flex their outrage, Sweeney promised, ``by taking  
back control of our government, by electing a working family 
president, and by taking a broom to the House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He slammed the GOP's recently proposed tax cuts and  
balanced-budget plan to delay a tax credit for the working poor. 
Workers should be fired up, Sweeney added, by their success in 1998 
in whittling the Republican majority in the House and sending 
``Speaker Gingrich pouting into early retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins replied  
from Washington: ``The average working class man and woman is of no 
interest to these union bosses in their Gucci loafers and $600 
suits in their downtown Washington luxury office suites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After backroom lobbying by Sweeney that continued into the hours  
just before his keynote speech, the endorsement of Gore appeared 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a firm believer in not counting my chickens until they  
hatch,'' Gore said from the campaign trail, although he had already 
made plans for a victorious acceptance speech at the Los Angeles 
Convention Center on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO officials said Bush's runaway popularity in polls and  
ever-mounting bankroll lent urgency to the endorsement, which frees 
the labor group to begin attacking Bush's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerry Shea, special assistant to Sweeney, said AFL-CIO focus  
group discussions with voters proved to labor chiefs that they 
could turn pro-Bush union voters just by explaining his record. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement scales were decisively tipped when 15 building  
and trade unions voted Monday to follow 1.4 million Food and 
Commercial Workers in giving Gore the early boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Auto Workers, Teamsters and Steelworkers remained  
opposed, saying candidates have not been clear on trade policy and 
union members haven't yet focused enough to pick a favorite. 
Lobbying by rival Bill Bradley had stoked such reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdouts do not represent enough votes to block an endorsement,  
which, under convention rules proposed by Sweeney, must be approved 
by unions representing two-thirds of the AFL-CIO's 13 million 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents were weakened Monday when the 1.3-million-member  
Service Employees International Union decided to wait on endorsing 
Gore, but said it would abstain rather than block ``the way the 
bulk of the AFL-CIO is going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes as planned, votes on Wednesday by the AFL-CIO's  
executive council and full convention would hand Gore an instant 
organizational advantage over Bradley in the nomination race. The 
organization's political director, Steve Rosenthal, said the 
organization would focus efforts on key early states like Iowa, New 
Hampshire, New York, California, Ohio and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley adviser Anita Dunn said Gore's institutional advantage  
is nothing new and the Bradley campaign will continue to campaign 
for labor support. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the AFL-CIO's $35-million campaign in 1996, which was  
almost all TV ads, the 2000 effort will focus intensely on 
leafleting, voter registration, issues education, phone banks and 
door-to-door campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	From its suburban Washington offices, The National Right to Work  
Legal Defense Foundation announced it would provide free legal aid 
for anyone ``who wants to challenge the AFL-CIO's use of their 
union dues.''

<HEADLINE> UAW Wraps Up Auto Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- United Auto Workers got more money and security  
for four years. The automakers got the freedom they sought to 
reduce costs, including shedding workers. 
</P>
<P>
	And both sides avoided costly strikes that could have cut short  
what is shaping as a record sales year for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, contract negotiations between the union and General  
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., and DaimlerChrysler AG were quick and 
peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who currently work for the automakers are all  
winners,'' said John Revitte, a professor at Michigan State 
University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the automakers, ``I doubt they would have signed it if  
they thought it was too much,'' Revitte said Monday. ``They 
probably assumed they could settle a pretty nice contract from the 
worker view, and they wouldn't have any trouble from Wall Street 
because the economy is doing so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern agreement made by the UAW is a four-year contract  
with 3 percent raises each year, a signing bonus of $1,350 and 
improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the UAW, the average DaimlerChrysler and GM worker  
will see gains of more than $29,000 over the life of the deal. 
Estimates are not yet available on the Ford contract agreement 
reached Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average assembly worker at DaimlerChrysler earns $70,000 a  
year, while the average Ford assembler earns about $60,000. The 
figure for GM is not available. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts with DaimlerChrysler, GM and GM's former parts  
unit also include clauses that prohibit the companies from selling 
off or closing factories or parts of their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	All those terms will likely add to the hourly payroll at the  
automakers, which totaled about $22 billion in 1998. Analyst Scott 
Merlis with Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc. in New York said 
the deals would increase labor costs for the automakers about 5 
percent a year, thanks to the increased wages and health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	But automakers might win that increase back and even save some  
costs by cutting jobs through retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The American automakers have been trying to cut costs to improve  
profits and compete better with more efficient foreign companies. 
With contract provisions that make layoffs or firings expensive, 
automakers rely on retirement to shed workers. The average UAW 
autoworker is in his mid-40s and has at least 15 years of 
experience; half of the more than 360,000 UAW workers will be 
eligible for retirement in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts sweeten retirement packages, and allow companies  
to shed jobs through attrition by setting a ratio for how many 
replacements must be hired to offset retirements. When retirements 
are relatively insignificant, the carmakers would only have to 
replace one out of every three retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new contract terms, a factory could lose 24 percent of  
its workers over four years to retirement before an automaker would 
have to replace every additional retiree. 
</P>
<P>
	And automakers have been loath to add new workers, preferring  
instead to fill their needs with overtime. Last year, GM added 500 
hourly workers to its total of about 143,000, but the average GM 
worker put in nearly nine hours of overtime every week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement can be somewhat on the expensive side, but it's  
highly workable and compatible with improved productivity,'' Merlis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW's deal with Ford also allows the automaker to spin-off  
its Visteon Automotive Systems, with 23,500 UAW workers, into a 
separate company. Visteon's current workers would remain Ford 
employees, while future hires would be covered by a Visteon 
contract that mirrors the deal Ford has with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW officials had opposed a spinoff or sale of Visteon, fearing  
it could lead to fewer union jobs and lower pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact remains there will likely be a spinoff, and this  
could be achieved without a long strike, and that the Ford-UAW 
relationship, which has been amicable and enviable, can be 
sustained,'' Merlis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The DaimlerChrysler deal has been approved by workers, while GM  
workers are expected to finish voting on their deal this week. Ford 
local union officials will hear details of their contract 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Plastic Surgery Laws Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Legislation designed to protect  
appearance-conscious Californians from deceptive cosmetic surgery 
ads and plastic surgeons has been signed into law by Gov. Gray 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	One bill bans cosmetic surgery ads that use misleading  
before-and-after photos or make scientific claims that cannot be 
substantiated. Another measure requires physicians who advertise 
that they are ``board certified'' to specify the source of that 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
	That will prevent a gynecologist, for example, from implying in  
ads that he or she is a board-certified cosmetic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	A third bill will require that a physician carry malpractice  
insurance and have at least one staff member present when 
performing plastic surgery in an outpatient facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The laws, signed Sunday, take effect Jan. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis also vetoed a bill that would allow plastic surgery  
patients to check the backgrounds of their surgeons on the 
Internet. The Democrat said the bill would have been too costly and 
might have left consumers with inaccurate information. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills follow a sharp increase in the use of cosmetic surgery  
and in the number of doctors who perform the procedures in their 
offices or clinics, sometimes with little or no specialized 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	The death rate for liposuction, a fat-removal procedure, is as  
high as one in 5,000 nationwide, a state Senate analysis found.

best for his morning show predecessor-turned-rival Bryant Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant will be co-hosting CBS's new ``Early Show,'' set to debut  
at 7 a.m. on Nov. 1 from a new storefront studio in the General 
Motors building across from Central Park. Jane Clayson will be 
Gumbel's co-host. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the guy,'' Lauer said in the Oct. 16 issue of TV Guide.  
``I want nothing but the best for him. I know he feels the same for 
me. I know he's going to put on a quality show. Other than that, 
what can I say except we both have a job to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is feeling neighborly toward Gumbel and his new  
show. In September, a posh Fifth Avenue hotel went to court in a 
bid to stop CBS from using the plaza in front of the General Motors 
Building for the ``Early Show,'' citing potential annoyances.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Trial To Begin in Gay Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson shared  
jobs as roofers. When they partied together, they shared drinks and 
limousine rides. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities say they also shared laughs last October as they  
pummeled the life out of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student 
whose death outraged the gay community and prompted calls for 
stronger hate-crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 22, is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and aggravated robbery, and could face the death penalty if 
convicted. Jury selection for his trial was scheduled to begin 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	His alleged co-conspirator, Henderson, 22, received two life  
sentences after pleading guilty in April to felony murder and 
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, was lured from a bar on Oct. 7, 1998, driven to a  
remote prairie, tied to a fence, pistol-whipped into 
unconsciousness and left to die on the freezing plains. He died 
five days later in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, who has said he had no idea Shepard was gay and he  
does not hate gay people, has pleaded innocent. His trial date 
coincided with several memorials commemorating the one-year 
anniversary of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	A candlelight vigil on Sunday night at the University of Wyoming  
attracted a crowd of 600, including Shepard's parents, Judy and 
Dennis Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We on this campus, in Laramie and in Wyoming, are people of  
peace, of inclusiveness,'' the Rev. Roger Schmit, of St. Paul's 
Newman Center, told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	University President Philip L. Dubois asked each person to light  
a candle that will generate ``a tiny bit of energy along the road 
to a world that rejects prejudice, stereotypes, hatred and 
violence, but their combined force will light a highway of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many signed a ``pledge of nonviolence'' written on 8-foot-tall  
placards, then carried lit candles into a nearby auditorium where 
folksingers Peter, Paul and Mary dedicated a concert to Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldout crowd of 2,000 gave Peter Yarrow a standing ovation  
after a song he performed solo which included the lines: ``Show me 
the gay man, hated and scorned, who was killed just for being the 
way he was born.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yarrow wrote the lyrics after visiting the site where Shepard  
was tied up and beaten. ``My heart broke,'' he said of seeing the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson has been subpoenaed by McKinney's lawyers to testify.  
The defense witness list also includes Henderson's girlfriend, 
Chasity Pasley, 21, and McKinney's girlfriend, Kristen Price, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pasley received up to two years in prison after pleading  
guilty to being an accessory to first-degree murder for helping to 
hide Henderson's bloody clothes. Ms. Price's trial on accessory 
charges was to begin Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Because prosecutors believe McKinney was the main instigator, he  
likely won't be offered a plea agreement, said Denver-based legal 
analyst Andrew Cohen, who has followed the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha has subpoenaed Judy Shepard in an attempt  
``to humanize the victim, to put a face on the name Matthew 
Shepard,'' said Cheyenne prosecutor Jon Forwood, who is not 
involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite common to use a parent to say, `This is the life  
we're talking about,''' Forwood said.

<HEADLINE> College Football: At the Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It's halftime.  
</P>
<P>
	Here's a look at who's in and out of the national title race,  
who's hot and who's not, who's breaking through and who's breaking 
down at the midway point of the season: 
</P>
<P>
                           	 *TITLE TALK   	
</P>
<P>
	Florida State and Penn State are in; Michigan and Georgia are  
the latest to drop out of the national title picture. The Seminoles 
and Nittany Lions are ranked 1-2 for the fourth straight week and a 
title showdown matching grand ol' guys Bobby Bowden vs. Joe Paterno 
in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4 would be a fitting grand finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (6-0), playing without suspended star Peter  
Warrick, held off Miami 31-21 on Saturday at Doak Campbell Stadium, 
extending the nation's longest home winning streak to 27 games and 
longest unbeaten streak to 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad to be here after the stuff that happened to us  
last week,'' Bowden said after collecting career win No. 298. 
Warrick, a top Heisman Trophy contender, could also miss next 
Saturday's game against Wake Forest as his legal problems are 
addressed this week following last week's arrest on a grand theft 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (6-0), with a 31-7 victory over Iowa, is one of two  
unbeaten Big Ten teams after Michigan and Minnesota were knocked 
off on Saturday -- the Wolverines losing to No. 5 Michigan State 
34-31; the Golden Gophers to No. 17 Wisconsin 20-17 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles' toughest game should be Nov. 20, when they play  
No. 7 Florida (5-1), a 31-10 winner over LSU, although Bowden still 
has to outcoach his son, Tommy, when he brings the 'Noles to 
Clemson in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions have a tougher road to New Orleans, beginning Saturday  
when No. 18 Ohio State (4-2, 1-1) visits Happy Valley. Then, there 
are games against No. 20 Purdue, Michigan and Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Nebraska (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), ranked No. 3 this week after a  
49-14 blowout of Iowa State. The Cornhuskers, with Eric Crouch 
throwing for two TDs and running for another against the Cyclones, 
appear ready for yet another title run. But they still have games 
against No. 13 Texas A&AMP;M (4-1, 1-1) on Nov. 6 and No. 9 Kansas 
State (5-0, 3-0) the following week -- both in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	Other unbeatens with title hopes include No. 4 Virginia Tech  
(5-0) after a 58-20 rout of Rutgers; Kansas State; and Michigan 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still a few of us hanging around,'' Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
                           	 *WHO'S HOT   	
</P>
<P>
	1. Michigan State (6-0, 3-0 Big Ten): The Spartans finally  
produced the big win that could turn coach Nick Saban into a hero 
after years of fans calling for his ouster. Bill Burke threw for a 
school-record 400 yards and two TDs and Plaxico Burress caught 10 
passes for a school-record 255 yards in the Spartans stunner over 
the Wolverines (5-1, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel more confident in my team than I ever have,'' Saban  
said. ``This is the happiest I've ever seen the players, the 
happiest I've ever seen our fans. I know how much this game means 
to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bring on Purdue, Wisconsin, Ohio State and Penn State.  
</P>
<P>
	2. Mississippi State (6-0, 3-0 SEC): What can you say about a  
team off to its first 6-0 start in 55 years, but surprise, 
surprise. The Bulldogs are the only unbeaten team left in the SEC, 
but still have the tough part of their schedule remaining with 
games against Alabama, Arkansas and state rival Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Syracuse (5-1, 2-0 Big East): The Orangemen have fared better  
through the first half of the season than they did in Donovan 
McNabb's four years as quarterback. With Troy Nunes calling signals 
most of the time, Syracuse is a final-seconds, end-zone completion 
away from being 6-0 (an 18-13 loss to Michigan). The Orangemen are 
at Virginia Tech on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Hawaii (4-2, 2-1 WAC): From a 19-game losing streak -- longest  
in the nation -- to a four-game winning streak in coach June Jones' 
first season. A 38-19 loss to Rice on Saturday night ended the run, 
but Jones has the Rainbow Warriors on their way to a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Maryland (4-1, 1-1 ACC): Last year, the Terrapins won three  
games. The Terps only loss came against No. 8 Georgia Tech, and 
they stayed close for most of three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Honorable mention: East Carolina (5-1); Vanderbilt (4-2).  
</P>
<P>
                            	WHO'S NOT   	
</P>
<P>
	1. The Pac-10 Conference (28-26): No teams in the Top 25 this  
week, and every team has at least two losses. Arizona, a preseason 
No. 4 pick, is 4-2 but was blown out by Penn State and Stanford. 
UCLA improved to 3-3 after a 34-29 win over Oregon on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Notre Dame (3-3): Communication breakdowns cost the Fighting  
Irish two wins, and then Michigan State went out and beat them up 
for loss No. 3. After six games, there were high hopes for five 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Ohio State (4-2, 1-1 Big Ten): Anyone figure the Buckeyes for  
two losses before they played Penn State and Michigan? 
</P>
<P>
	4. Virginia (3-3, 2-2 ACC): Get blown out by powerful Virginia  
Tech, fine. But Saturday's 24-17 OT loss to Duke at 
Charlottesville? Unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Big East entry of Miami (2-3, 0-0); West Virginia (1-4, 0-1)  
and Rutgers (0-5, 0-2). The Hurricanes have dropped three in a row; 
the Mountaineers are out of ammo based on losses to Maryland and 
Navy; and the Scarlet Knights may duplicate 1997's record -- 0-11 -- 
after winning five games in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Honorable mention: Louisville (3-3); LSU (2-3).  
</P>

<P>
	On Sunday, Bowden said Warrick's arrest on a charge of grand  
theft and his indefinite suspension have ended his Heisman Trophy 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably blown,'' Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
	If Warrick returns to the team, his coach had some advice: ``I  
would tell him to take a very back seat, a very back seat. You go 
out there and play the best you can play and don't even think about 
the Heisman.''

<HEADLINE> TV Stations Begin Y2K Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Southern Company, which provides  
electricity to 3.8 million customers in the southern United States, 
was blindsided recently by an unexpected Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The company conducted a dry run of its computer systems last  
month to predict if any glitches would pop up when the clock turns 
to the year 2000, and alerted the media to its plans. As luck would 
have it, the test coincided with thunderstorms that swept through 
the Atlanta area, knocking out power to thousands of Southern's 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fair enough. Storms happen, and Southern dispatched crews to  
repair its lines. What utility executives didn't expect was to hear 
television reporters wrongly claim the power outages were the 
result of Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern now lives in fear of a different kind of damage to the  
company's reputation if there's a bad storm on Dec. 31, spokeswoman 
Laura Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With some portion of the media, there's a tendency to hype  
things up, to sensationalize them,'' she said, ``and we perceive 
that could be a problem. It's the great unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gillig told her story at a workshop sponsored by the Radio and  
Television News Directors Association in Charlotte, where Y2K 
experts advised local electronic reporters how to cover the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The session made a couple of things clear: It's never too early  
-- and is quickly becoming too late -- to plan coverage effectively. 
And there's no end to the story angles, and the potential pitfalls 
for incautious journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Alloway, director of the National Leadership Task Force  
on Y2K, and author Peter de Jager, whose Web site tracks 
millennium-related bugs, said most problems have been spotted and 
corrected already. About 95 percent of the computer systems won't 
fail at all, Alloway said. But that still leaves plenty of 
potential glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is not stopping on January 1st,'' he said. ``It is  
slowing down a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on what utilities are reporting, Alloway foresees no major  
Y2K-related power outages. Problems are much more likely to appear 
in municipal water systems, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	If they haven't already, journalists should be questioning  
companies throughout their regions about their Y2K preparedness -- 
utilities, transportation authorities, banks, supermarkets, small 
businesses like dry cleaners. Reporters should compile phone lists 
of where company representatives will be on New Year's Eve so they 
can be easily reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your electric utilities are probably going to be fine, but  
have you made the call?'' asked David Bernknopf, director of news 
planning at CNN. ``And have you gotten beyond the answer, `we think 
we have everything under control?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters need to be able to recognize ahead of time which  
problems are Y2K-related and which aren't, like Southern's 
storm-damaged power lines. For example, up to 5 percent of 
automatic teller machines aren't working at any given time, de 
Jager said. Will a live camera crew be standing beside one of them 
and blame a Y2K bug when money doesn't come out on Jan. 1? 
</P>
<P>
	``In about five seconds of reporting, you can precipitate a bank  
run -- unless you do it right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian computer expert plans to spend much of New Year's  
Eve and Day in an airplane, flying from Toronto to London and back, 
partly to show his confidence that air travel will be safe from Y2K 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismissing survivalists as nuts, De Jager said reporters  
shouldn't waste time covering people who are stocking up in 
anticipation of disaster. CNN's Bernknopf, though, said it's 
important to follow the human response to the situation; he's more 
worried about people predicting the end of the world and then 
turning to terrorism to fulfill their own prophecies. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing before a room of reporters, de Jager was contemptuous  
of the profession. He said he expects the media to make Y2K worse 
than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you want to show restraint,'' he lectured, ``you're  
incapable of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a reporter from the Seattle area told how information  
problems go both ways. Steve Krueger of KPLU said he was stunned 
when a half-dozen companies he surveyed flatly refused to reveal 
anything they were doing about Y2K, or even confirm that they were 
conducting tests. The prominent exception was the airplane maker 
Boeing, which replied in meticulous detail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was a public relations man, I would want to tell the  
world that we're on top of this,'' Krueger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The experts urged reporters to keep trying, and even publicly  
embarrass authorities who are keeping silent. ``People are 
surprisingly cooperative on this because they don't want a panic,'' 
Bernknopf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many television and radio stations already have emergency  
staffing plans in place, preparing to have reporters ready 
round-the-clock on New Year's weekend. The experts warned stations 
not to exhaust their staff, because many Y2K problems won't become 
evident until many businesses go back to work on Monday, Jan. 3 and 
for weeks and months to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an event that is going to continue like bad chili for  
a long time,'' de Jager said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Roars, But Bradley Purrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley peers over half-moon  
reading glasses, offering Democratic activists another subdued, 
cerebral speech -- so earnest he borders on grim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes discipline to be positive,'' he says, calling for a  
bloodless primary contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Gore moves from behind his lectern, his fists pumping to the  
tune of partisan rhetoric fed like raw meat to the Democratic 
crowd. ``When Newt Gingrich took over Congress, some walked away!'' 
the vice president says in a veiled attack on Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential race is as much about style as  
substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore roars. Bradley purrs.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Crinkle. Crinkle. Crinkle.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the sound of another hard candy being opened by Bradley too  
close to the microphone. He keeps a steady supply of Vitamin 
C-spiked lemon drops in his pants pockets to ward off a constantly 
dry throat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult job (slurp). How do you make sure you  
have a safety net (slurp) and at the same time allow (slurp) people 
to produce what they want to (slurp) produce?'' Bradley asks. ``I 
tried to achieve the (slurp) balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His lack of style is Bradley's style.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is retooling his image after Bradley's progress in polls  
turned up the heat. Gore's consultants persuaded him to stop 
looking like a vice president and act like a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Drop the fancy signs, the scripted town hall meetings and  
lecterns adorned with the White House seal. Speak without notes. 
Plunge into crowds. Loosen up. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is a seemingly more passionate,sometimes pandering,  
candidate. A no-snore Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know where my heart is. If you don't, I want to talk to  
you. You know what my policies are. If you don't, I want to talk to 
you,'' he tells 500 supporters on the banks of the Des Moines 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing to a black woman in the crowd, he says, ``You know I'm  
for improving race relations!'' Singling out a man with a union 
hat, he shouts, ``You know I'm for labor!'' And gesturing at young 
women, he says: ``You know I'm for a woman's right to choose!'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradley campaign is unprepared for its rush of success.  
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly swarmed by reporters, the candidate demands more  
private meetings with supporters. Three events are wiped off his 
public schedule without the knowledge of communications director 
Anita Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're experiencing growing pains,'' she says with a  
sigh. 
</P>
<P>
	As she spoke, Bradley loped past -- his head and shoulders rising  
out of a pack of reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more fun when nobody was around,'' Dunn said. She's  
serious. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	For months, Gore kept a phalanx of Secret Service agents and  
staff between himself and the media. The new Gore is more 
accessible. 
</P>
<P>
	Are you too timid? a reporter asks.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oooh!,'' Gore says, grinning facetiously. ``A dart.''  
</P>
<P>
	He pulled an imaginary barb out of his shoulder, hands it back  
to the journalists and takes the next question. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is seated at a classroom table, both his hands stuffed  
awkwardly in his pockets. His eyes wander from his small audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope you understand from what I said today that I'm on  
your side,'' he tells community college students, pulling one hand 
out of his pocket to scrape something stuck to the bottom of his 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I jumped the fence and got several of you on the way in,'' the  
vice president shouts to a crowd of 300 supporters in Iowa City. 
``But if I didn't shake your hands, find me before I leave!'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	Kiki Fisckoff stops Bradley in a school hallway to say that  
government shouldn't require motorcyclists to wear helmets. At 
6-foot-5, Bradley looks down on her and blinks. And blinks again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I voted to require them,'' Bradley says with no emotion or  
explanation. ``I thought you should know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New York Knick didn't seem to notice her Knicks  
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was curt,'' Fisckoff says afterward.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Gore grabs an infant, Ann Marie LaSord, from her grandparents  
and plants a big kiss on her cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still about kissing babies, isn't it?'' Fort Dodge, Iowa,  
resident Rollie Pohlman shouts. Gore nods his head, still beaming 
for the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>

	Susan Bordenaro is introduced to Bradley at a Carlisle, Iowa,  
farm. She is a school teacher who supports Gore, but could be 
swayed to Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got three minutes,'' Bordenaro jokes.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley asked one question: ``What grade do you teach?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Ninth through 12th,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's great. Very important,'' Bradley mumbles. He gives her  
a quick peck on the cheek and walks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's supporters say they're attracted by his low-style,  
high-substance pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's refreshing in these days of glitz,'' says Ed Baker, 76,  
after hearing Bradley's farm policy. ``Anybody can speak pretty 
words.''

	Like the rat-tat-tat of a machine gun, Gore spits outpoll-tested

	--''I support a woman's right to choose.''

<P>
	His suit coat off and his shirt sleeves rolled up, Bradley tells  
a group of farmers that he's a can-do kind of guy. And to prove it, 
he grabs his tie and flips it over; a piece of transparent tape

<HEADLINE> Expert Weighs JonBenet Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A top forensic scientist and the  
prosecutor in the JonBenet Ramsey case have reviewed DNA records 
and data and had a long-ranging conversation about the 
investigation into the girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Lee, a veteran of the O.J. Simpson trial and earlier  
consultations on the JonBenet case, said on Fox Television Monday 
that he met with Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said he told Hunter ``it's pretty lonely when you have to  
make a decision like the one you are making,'' and ``when the chips 
fall, you have to justify why you've made such a decision, and face 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury hearing the case is expected to meet Tuesday. The  
panel has an Oct. 20 deadline to issue indictments, issue a report 
or disband without taking action. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter last week hinted that an announcement might be imminent  
in the nearly 3-year-old case. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNA of JonBenet's family members has already been tested,  
and investigators say DNA found on the girl's body did not match. 
Lee said last month that further DNA testing was needed to 
eliminate other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Hunter still has to ``come up with a logical explanation  
for the DNA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was found strangled, bound and beaten in her home on  
Dec. 26, 1996, about seven hours after her mother, Patsy Ramsey, 
called 911 to report the girl was missing. She told police she had 
found a 2 1/2-page note demanding $118,000 for JonBenet's safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parents have been considered suspects, and both have said  
they are innocent.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars, Jets Need To Wake Offenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J (AP) -- It should have been a prime-time  
shootout between two of the NFL's most dangerous offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, tonight's rematch of last January's AFC playoff game  
between the Jacksonville Jaguars and New York Jets just might take 
on a defensive bent. That's pretty much the way things have gone 
for both teams recently: decent defense, disappointing offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, we need to go back to the drawing board,''  
Jaguars guard Ben Coleman said of an attack that ranks 13th overall 
and 20th in passing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This offense should click better than it has,'' added Keenan  
McCardell, who along with Jimmy Smith forms one of the league's 
best receiving duos. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Mark Brunell hasn't approached his usual Pro  
Bowl-caliber play. While the running game, whether it be with Fred 
Taylor, slowed by a hamstring injury, or James Stewart, has been 
staunch, the Jaguars have only five passing plays for 25 yards or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are 3-1 and certainly not playing as well as we'd like to  
on the offensive side of the ball,'' said Brunell, who reportedly 
has been feuding with coach Tom Coughlin; both sides deny it. ``But 
we are 3-1 and very pleased with that. Our goals haven't changed, 
but it's time to focus and concentrate on getting better, and I 
think we will do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They've gotten a whole lot better on defense under new  
coordinator Dom Capers, the former head coach in Carolina and the 
mastermind of Pittsburgh's strong units in the early 1990s. At 
times, in fact, a defense that rarely had a pass rush or made big 
plays in the past has been downright fearsome. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, better than the Jaguars offense.  
</P>
<P>
	``Their defense has been impressive, what they have done,'' Jets  
coach Bill Parcells said. ``When they got the lead, they were 
particularly effective. They have an excellent pass rusher in Tony 
Brackens. They have improved their secondary since last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brackens was a one-man wrecking crew at Pittsburgh last weekend,  
with three forced fumbles, recovering one, 2 1/2 sacks and 11 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really one of the outstanding performances on defense I  
have seen in a long time,'' Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw some fine work from his own defense at Denver on Oct. 3,  
when the Jets got their first victory after three losses. They 
forced six turnovers and never let the Broncos get on track in the 
second half, when the Jets took control. 
</P>
<P>
	That defense might get a boost from regular nose tackle Jason  
Ferguson, expected back from an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like a loss causes you to second-guess,'' linebacker  
Bryan Cox said, ``a win causes you to exude confidence. You can put 
yourself on a roll, that's what winning does, it adds a certain 
amount of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the Jets' confidence rides high when they have the  
ball. But season-ending injuries to quarterback Vinny Testaverde 
and running back-kick returner Leon Johnson and a broken foot 
suffered at the end of the preseason by receiver Wayne Chrebet -- he 
is doubtful to make his return tonight -- ravaged the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rick Mirer is getting more comfortable at quarterback  
and the running game was solid at Denver, New York doesn't have the 
look of a powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nicer if we were 3-1 instead of 1-3,'' Mirer said.  
``There'd be a lot more laughs.''

<HEADLINE> Bauer Takes Shots at Forbes, Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Gary  
Bauer said Monday that rival Steve Forbes should dismiss any 
campaign workers who may have helped spread rumors that Bauer had 
an affair with an aide. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Steve Forbes had character, I think he would fire some  
people,'' Bauer told reporters as he began a three-day bus tour of 
the state. ``(My wife) Carol and I had to go through a miserable 
couple of weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Jarvis, a former Bauer aide who now is an unpaid  
consultant for the Forbes campaign, said two weeks ago that Bauer 
spent ``hours and hours and hours behind closed doors with a young, 
single woman.'' He made no further specific allegations. Bauer has 
denied allegations by former campaign staffers that he had an 
``inappropriate'' relationship with a female campaign aide. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer blamed the Forbes campaign for the remarks, which he  
called character assassination, and said such unfounded attacks 
prevent a serious discussion of the issues. Anyone involved in 
spreading the rumors should be fired, Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spokesman Greg Mueller said no one in the Forbes campaign  
spread the rumors, and that no one would be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had no involvement. Our focus is not Gary Bauer; this is  
a Bush-Forbes race,'' Mueller said. ``Nobody in our campaign is 
going to get fired for something he or she did not do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said Monday the GOP race is narrowing, with Forbes, Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush and himself as the key players. There now are 
eight Republicans seeking the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, a former aide to President Reagan, also said Bush should  
apologize for remarks he made against Republicans in Congress, and 
that Forbes' flat-tax proposal would benefit only the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched Governor Bush give a major speech in which he  
attacked the Republican Congress in the same rhetoric that Ted 
Kennedy or Barney Frank or President Clinton would use,'' Bauer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush recently criticized the House Republicans' plan to alter a  
tax credit for the working poor in order to help balance the 
budget.

<HEADLINE> FSU Players Enter Innocent Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State wide receiver Peter  
Warrick and former Seminole Laveranues Cole on Monday pleaded 
innocent to charges of theft and got a new lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy before his  
arrest, and Coles are accused of paying $21.40 for $412.38 worth of 
clothes with the help of a department store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	They turned themselves in to police Friday after being charged  
with felony theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, 22, was suspended from the team and was on the  
sidelines during Florida State's 31-21 win over Miami on Saturday. 
Under university policy, he would be able to return to the team 
once he takes care of his legal obligations in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, 21, was kicked off the team because he had been on  
probation for earlier academic and legal troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	The first court hearing was Monday, but neither player was  
required to attend and neither did. The innocent pleas were entered 
into the files as a matter of routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Tallahassee lawyer Henry Hunter filed papers  
stating his intention to represent both Warrick and Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	The clerk, 19-year-old Rachel Myrtil, who is also charged, is  
being represented by attorney Richard Greenberg.

<HEADLINE> TCU Added to Conference USA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Conference USA presidents unanimously approved the addition of  
TCU to the league in all sports on Monday, but passed on another 
WAC team from the Dallas-Fort Worth market. 
</P>
<P>
	TCU, a former Southwest Conference member now in the Western  
Athletic Conference, will join C-USA in all sports in 2001, two 
years before current league member South Florida will begin 
competing for the football title, the presidents of the current 
C-USA schools decided. 
</P>
<P>
	With the additions, Conference USA will have 11 football  
schools. Currently, the 4-year-old football league sports two Top 
25 teams for the first time, No. 23 East Carolina and No. 25 
Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	C-USA presidents, however, didn't vote to extend an invitation  
to SMU and commissioner Mike Slive said that decision was based on 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, as we got down to the end of the day, it's a great  
program, but size was an issue. The board decided to take care of 
current members,'' Slive said of SMU during a teleconference from 
New York, where the presidents met. 
</P>
<P>
	Slive refused to discuss the actual voting, but said the  
league's board of directors has finished its work on expansion for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to TCU's addition to the league in all sports, the  
presidents acted on two proposals concerning current C-USA members. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was South Florida, a C-USA member in all sports but  
football, will begin conference football play in 2003, two years 
after it first begins play on the NCAA Division I-A level. The 
other has East Carolina, now a football-only member, joining the 
league in all other sports in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	TCU looked at the move as a step toward more national exposure.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our out-of-state students come from the Midwestern  
corridor of the country, and as a member of C-USA, TCU will gain 
exposure to an extremely high percentage of the nation's 
population, the media centers and large urban areas of the Central 
and Eastern time zones,'' athletic director Eric Hyman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to 11 football-playing teams, C-USA will expand its  
men's and women's basketball leagues to 14 teams each. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 football members will leave C-USA one team short of being  
able to stage a league championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of how many football schools was certainly a topic  
of conversation, but the board was comfortable at this point of 
staying at 11, and not going to 12,'' Slive said. ``That's not a 
driving force in our thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league's football teams -- Army, UAB, Cincinnati, East  
Carolina, Houston, Louisville, Memphis, Southern Miss and Tulane -- 
are playing six league games this year, and that number was already 
scheduled to increase to seven in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Slive is not sure how the addition of two teams will affect  
future football scheduling, but indicated the league was not ready 
to switch to divisions in football. 
</P>
<P>
	In basketball, the league has two six-team divisions. Each  
division will likely increase by one. 
</P>
<P>
	While East Carolina and Army are currently football-only members  
of C-USA, DePaul, Marquette, NC-Charlotte, Saint Louis and South 
Florida are league members in basketball and other sports except 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	TCU's departure leaves the WAC, which was a 16-school league the  
last two years until eight members defected to form the Mountain 
West Conference, with eight schools as Nevada joins next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel that the loss of one university, no matter who  
it is, is a death blow by any means,'' senior associate 
commissioner Jeff Hurd said. ``We still consider ourselves a viable 
division one conference and we'll explore what options we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Nevada joining the conference next season, TCU's exit would  
leave the conference with eight teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might stay at eight teams,'' Hurd said. ``There are several  
eight team conferences around the country, it could be that eight 
is the number or we'll go beyond that,'' and try to get other teams 
to join the conference.

<HEADLINE> German Wins Nobel for Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Dr. Guenter Blobel of The Rockefeller  
University in New York won the Nobel Prize for medicine today for 
protein research that shed new light on diseases including cystic 
fibrosis and the early development of kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
	Blobel, 63, a native of Germany, was cited for the discovery  
that proteins contain chemical signals that act as zip codes, 
telling the cell where the protein should go. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of human hereditary diseases are caused by errors in  
these signals and transport mechanisms,'' the Nobel Assembly said 
in announcing the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blobel's research has also contributed to the development of a  
more effective use of cells as 'protein factories' for the 
production of important drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 prize announcement said his work had several  
implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``One example is the hereditary disease primary hyperoxaluria,  
which causes kidney stones at an early age. In some forms of 
familial hypercholesterolemia, a very high level of cholesterol in 
the blood is due to deficient transport signals. Other hereditary 
diseases, e.g., cystic fibrosis, are caused by the fact that 
proteins do not reach their proper destination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blobel, a cellular and molecular biologist, discovered in the  
early 1970s that newly synthesized proteins have an intrinsic 
signal that is essential for directing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the next 20 years Blobel characterized in detail the  
molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. He also showed 
that similar 'address tags' or 'zip codes' direct proteins to other 
intracellular organelles (compartments within a cell),'' the 
Academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners of the Nobel Prize in physics and chemistry are to be  
announced Tuesday, followed by economics Wednesday and the peace 
prize Friday. All the prize announcements are in Stockholm, except 
for the peace prize, which is announced in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden will present the literature,  
science and economic prizes, this year worth $960,000, on Dec. 10, 
the anniversary of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel's death in 
1896. The peace prize will be presented on the same day in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	The science awards tend to be for breakthroughs that often pave  
the way for major advances in fighting disease and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Americans won the Nobel Prize in medicine last year for  
discovering that the body uses nitric oxide gas to make blood 
vessels relax and widen -- a finding that helped lead to the 
development of Viagra and could also pay off in treatments for 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery by Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Dr.  
Ferid Murad also triggered research that could lead to new 
treatments for cancer and septic shock. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy, founded in 1786, has 18 members, although one spot  
is vacant and three members don't participate. Academy members, 
former recipients and a select group of literature and language 
professors and specialists in the field may suggest candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes are funded by a trust set up in Nobel's will.

<HEADLINE> Monarch Butterfly Population Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The numbers of monarch butterflies,  
those delicate orange-and-black-winged creatures one devotee 
compares to ``flying jewelry,'' have taken flight across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a shrinking habitat and natural and man-made threats, it  
has been a good year for monarchs, even as the butterflies prepare 
for their long journey to Mexico and California, where they'll wait 
out the harsh winters of their northern range. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a good year for butterflies in general, and we're  
looking forward to a prolonged fall so we can enjoy the show,'' 
said Donald Lewis, a professor of entomology at Iowa State 
University. ``There's been good moisture to keep the plants 
growing. The caterpillars need various and specific species of food 
plants during the summer. So when we have good growing conditions 
over a wide area, the food plants do well and the caterpillars do 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis also noted that the summer's rains -- while abundant -- were  
for the most part not accompanied by vicious thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Butterflies are not fragile critters, but they do need some  
gentleness in their environment, which often means absence of 
spectacular storms, especially at the time when the butterflies are 
reproducing and the tiny caterpillars are establishing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The butterflies, whose wingspan can range up to nearly 5 inches,  
feed on milkweed nectar. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyewitness accounts corroborate Lewis' statement that 1999 has  
treated butterflies well. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, one couple near Lake Rathbun reported seeing roughly  
3,000 monarchs on Sept. 17. A few days later, as many as 25,000 
were spotted off the Massachusetts coast. It was by far the largest 
sighting in the nation in September, according to the North 
American Butterfly Association. 
</P>
<P>
	During the summer, the butterflies range from southern Canada  
south through all of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The bumper crop of butterflies seems to defy the findings of a  
study earlier this year by Cornell University, which claimed pollen 
from a popular genetically engineered corn hybrid kills monarch 
caterpillars in laboratory tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Bt-corn, which was supposed to kill only pests such as the  
European corn borer while having no effect on insects such as 
honeybees and ladybugs, produces pollen containing crystalline 
endotoxin. When the corn pollen is dispersed by the wind, it lands 
on other plants, including milkweed, the exclusive food of monarch 
larvae, commonly found around cornfields. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the market leader in Bt-corn,  
said it did not test the product on monarch caterpillars because 
they do not naturally feed on corn pollen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of Bt having an impact on monarchs when 30  
percent of our market is using it, I think it suggests very little 
risk,'' Pioneer spokesman Doyle Karr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Glassberg, president of the North American Butterfly  
Association, said caution must be exercised when introducing new 
variables into the ecosystem. But he also said he thought the 
danger was overstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are a lot more dire threats than that to  
monarchs,'' he said. ``In the Midwest, mowing roadsides and using 
herbicides is probably much more devastating, actually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 25 million acres across North America will be  
planted with Bt-corn this year, Pioneer said. This represents about 
30 percent of the 1999 corn acreage. 
</P>
<P>
	The monarchs may also find another problem when they reach their  
winter home in the western oyamel-fir forests of Mexico, 
particularly the central western Mexican state of Michoacan, the 
habitat where tens of millions of butterflies reside. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists have been warning that excessive logging and  
forest fires damaged the sanctuary. Also blamed are climatic 
changes caused by El Nino and a drought that left the fir trees 
vulnerable to bark-destroying beetles last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results have been alarming, as Mexican government figures  
show that masses of butterflies covered 42 acres two years ago, but 
shrank to 32 acres last year and only 13.5 acres in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of the monarchs on the North American  
continent go down to these Mexican sites, so if anything were to 
happen to these, the mass migrations and so forth would clearly be 
in jeopardy,'' Glassberg said. ``It's speculative whether they 
would be able to survive someplace else, whether they would all die 
off. It would obviously have a major effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the monarchs would go extinct in this area, but  
there would clearly be a tremendous diminution in numbers,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Blazers' Grant Out for Season Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUALATIN, Ore. (AP) -- Brian Grant can only run at about  
half-speed, and you could barely slide an envelope under his 
sneakers on a jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, the Portland Trail Blazers see that as significant  
progress for their power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, recovering from offseason surgery on his left knee, won't  
play in Tuesday's exhibition game against the Seattle SuperSonics 
in Corvallis. He hopes to be in uniform when the Blazers open the 
regular season at Vancouver on Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't really tell you if it'll happen or not, but we're  
making very, very good progress from last week,'' Grant said after 
Monday's practice. ``I've started doing more stuff on the court, 
some jogging up and down, a lot more jumpers instead of standing 
still, and moving around. So that's a big step for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant had soreness in his knee throughout the playoffs, which  
ended when the Blazers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the 
Western Conference finals. His return was delayed two weeks ago by 
an upper respiratory infection that required hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant wants to play, but doesn't want to risk re-injuring the  
knee. His teammates agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's hard for him being injured because the one thing  
about being injured -- because I've been through it before too -- is 
that you don't feel like you're part of the team,'' point guard 
Damon Stoudamire said. ``When he gets ready, he'll come back. I 
just hope he doesn't try to come back too soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said he's bound to be sluggish when he returns.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even when I get back, it won't be like I'll be the Brian that  
you guys saw at the end of the season, where I was really sharp,'' 
he told reporters. ``I'll probably miss a lot of little layups and 
get tired a lot, because I didn't go through this week of 
conditioning like they did. The stuff I do is good, but it's 
nothing like playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant sat out Sunday's scrimmage, played before about 6,000 fans  
at Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of the 6-foot-9 Grant and 6-11 backup center Kelvin  
Cato, who was traded to Houston along with five other Blazers for 
Scottie Pippen, left the Blazers with a lack of big men, so they 
signed free agent center Joe Kleine last week to a one-year, $1 
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Kleine played well in the scrimmage, scoring 14  
points and grabbing 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was by no means the best I can do, or the best the team can  
do,'' said Kleine, who had offers from other teams but jumped at 
the chance to back up Arvydas Sabonis with the Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a serious contender, and the guys on their team are  
all good guys,'' Kleine said. ``There's just lot of unselfish 
people, and I know from experience that being around those types of 
people make basketball a lot more enjoyable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Dunleavy said he was impressed by the Blazers' energy  
in the scrimmage but not with their level of conditioning. He said 
none of the starters in Tuesday's exhibition -- Stoudamire, Pippen, 
Sabonis, Steve Smith and Rasheed Wallace -- will play more than 30 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important part is to get conditioning, to get guys  
playing with each other and keep everybody healthy,'' Dunleavy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy said he likely will trim the camp roster of 19 players  
beginning this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Fans Fork Over $5M at Elvis Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Elvis fans paid $277,000 for one of his classic  
cars and $113,000 for one of his capes, forking over a total of $5 
million for the King of Rock 'n' Roll's memorabilia during a 
three-day auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was significantly more than we expected,'' Arlan Ettinger,  
president of Guernsey's Auction House, said above the din of 
bidders and curious fans Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1956 Lincoln Continental in which Presley dated the late  
actress Natalie Wood drew the top bid of $250,000 plus $27,000 in 
auction commissions, Ettinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bejeweled aloha cape that Presley wore in one of his last  
television shows drew a bid of $98,000 plus a 15 percent 
commission, Ettinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of sunglasses with an EP monogram fetched $37,500 plus  
commissions and his personal .9 mm handgun drew $115,000. A blue 
police light that Presley used to plop atop his car and stop 
unsuspecting motorists drew $31,000. A green jumpsuit sold for 
$75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will go to Memphis-based Elvis Presley Enterprises.  
The primary goal of the auction was to establish a building fund 
for the creation of Presley Place, a transitional housing 
development in the Tennessee city where Presley once lived with his 
parents in a subsidized housing project. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction was sanctioned by Presley's sole heir, his daughter,  
Lisa Marie. The items were culled from the Presley estate, much of 
it in archives that have been kept at Presley's Graceland mansion 
since his death 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of bidders were on hand each day at the auction site,  
the MGM Grand Hotel, and hundreds more bid on items via fax or on 
the Internet. Some 2,000 pieces were on the block. 
</P>
<P>
	The interest in the auction was evident Saturday when an auction  
worker mistakenly produced a Christmas tree-shaped television 
antenna that once sat atop the Graceland mansion. The antenna had 
been shipped here by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not supposed to be in the auction, but was brought here  
mistakenly,'' Ettinger said. ``In the spirit of the moment, we went 
ahead and put it up for bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The antenna sold for $1,725.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real piece of Graceland, not just some document,'' Sue  
Fergerstrom of Springfield, Mo., said, laughing. ``And when he 
tries to contact me, I'll have better reception.''

<HEADLINE> Four Teens Escape Rapist Captors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Four out-of-state teen-age girls were abducted at  
gunpoint and brought to Michigan, held for more than two weeks and 
repeatedly raped by as many as a dozen boys and young men, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five suspects were taken into custody, including three teen-age  
boys and a 20-year-old man, police said Monday. Police Inspector 
Fred Campbell said more arrests would follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims and suspects are Laotian-Americans and members of  
the Hmong ethnic group. Campbell would not confirm a Detroit Free 
Press report that the suspects were gang members. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims are 14, 15, 16 and 17, and are mostly from the  
Sheboygan, Wis., area, Campbell said. He said the girls finally 
escaped last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old escaped last Tuesday when she saw a passing  
police officer. She identified some of her assailants by names such 
as El Dog and Cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had guns and they beat me up several times,'' police  
quoted her as saying. ``People were in and out of the house all day 
and night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two suspects -- Ladsamee Lee, 20, and Vang Yee Leng Chang, 17 --  
pleaded innocent to rape and other charges Sunday and were jailed 
on $1 million bond. Three juvenile suspects are scheduled be 
arraigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's wife, Yer Xiong, said her husband is a gang member but  
said he ``didn't know anything about these girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband told me it was not him who did it ... and I believe  
him,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 2004 Politics Cloud Calendar Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- While some people are complaining that  
it's still too early to worry about next year's election, the 2004 
political season already is casting its shadow on a fight between 
Iowa and New Hampshire over the 2000 voting calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	The quadrennial wrangling over primary and caucus dates is an  
exercise in posturing and bluffing, aimed at getting the attention 
from candidates and the media that comes with holding the nation's 
first tests of presidential candidates' political strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa and New Hampshire traditionally have banded together to  
guard their early position, with Iowa's first-in-the-nation 
caucuses leading off and New Hampshire following eight days later 
with the nation's opening primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're squabbling and could risk losing it all.  
</P>
<P>
	It began when New Hampshire set its primary Feb. 1, the day  
after Iowa's Jan. 31 caucuses. That surprised everyone, because 
most assumed the primary would be Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, officials have sought to pressure New Hampshire to  
relent and move to Feb. 8, but they are now giving up on that in a 
delicate minuet that almost certainly will see the Iowa caucuses 
move to Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairwoman Kathy Sullivan will  
make her case before a national party rules committee this week, 
but she said the squabble with Iowa has angered many who are 
looking for an excuse to jumble the lineup of caucuses and 
primaries that launch the presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced that this will hurt us in the long term,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some national party leaders agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``If this flap between New Hampshire and Iowa had not occurred,  
then there would have still been a discussion as to whether or not 
Iowa or New Hampshire should retain their first-in-the-nation 
status,'' said Tom Sansonetti, chairman of the Republican National 
Committee's Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now, as a result of what has happened and from the  
comments I've received in just the last 10 days, I'd say the 
chances for New Hampshire and Iowa losing their first-in-the-nation 
status have increased markedly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few days of squabbling, officials in both states appear  
to be looking to put the best face on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who initially refused to consider  
changing dates, relented Monday and said holding the caucuses on 
Jan. 24 would be fine as long as the requisite logistics can be put 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just need to be sensitive to making sure Iowa puts its  
best foot forward,'' Vilsack said. ``If (Iowa) can do that on Jan. 
31, fine. If it can do that on Jan. 24, fine, whatever they 
decide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Iowa and New Hampshire officials should have a  
quiet conversation about avoiding such disputes in the future. One 
Iowa Democratic official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
conceded that ``the damage has been done'' and said officials are 
seeking a quick way out of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because national Democratic Party officials next month  
will begin talking about primary and caucus calendars for the 2004 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Vilsack said it's crucial that Iowa and New Hampshire band  
together and offer assurances that the ongoing bickering will not 
be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get that kind of consensus out of this, then maybe  
Iowa and New Hampshire would be in a stronger position to make the 
case that they should serve as the nation's first primary and first 
caucus,'' Vilsack said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a fight every four years for the honor to be first, as  
other states seek some of the attention paid to Iowa's leadoff 
caucuses and New Hampshire's initial primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The attention gives a huge boost to both political parties in  
the two states, creates something of a cottage industry with 
millions of dollars being spent by candidates and the media and 
helps polish the image of the two states in the national limelight. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Vilsack argued that Iowa should worry about the  
immense logistical details involved in switching the date -- 
everything from providing hotel rooms to party-run centers for 
tabulating the votes.

<HEADLINE> US Gymnasts Barely Make Medal Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- Twice it came down to the very last  
routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanessa Atler clinched a place for the United States women's  
team in the World Gymnastics Championships medal round with a 9.762 
in the floor exercises Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, John Roethlisberger appeared to do the same for the men  
with a 9.525 on the high bar Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	His performance was enough to move the Americans ahead of  
Ukraine and Germany into third place, with 1997 silver medalist 
Belarus and defending bronze medalist Russia among the teams yet to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
	The top six teams advance to the medal round, and a fifth-place  
standing at this point would have been troublesome to the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Japan moved into second place in the men's  
standings with 226.382 points, well behind three-time defending 
champion China's 230.546. The Americans had 224.594, Ukraine 
224.322, Germany 224.245, and Romania 223.831. 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger gained the chance for the decisive high-bar  
routine after teammate Blaine Wilson's 9.562 and Chris Young's 
9.550. Sean Townsend managed only 8.762 and Yewki Tomita 8.450. The 
top four scores count toward the team total. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was solid all day, scoring 57.048, including a 9.625 on  
the parallel bars, and stood fifth among individuals with 19 of 46 
teams still to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Yang Wei, who had a 9.8 in the vault, led individuals  
with 57.649, while teammate Huang Xu had 57.299, and Bulgaria's 
Jordan Jovtchev and Japan's Yoshihiro Saito were tied at 57.074. 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, like Wilson a four-time national champion, did  
not compete in all six events. But he also had a 9.650 on the 
pommel horse, a 9.237 on the rings and a 9.212 on the parallel 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
	For the American women, Atler was not even aware of their  
perilous position when she went into her final floor exercise 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth best score of the qualifying round in that  
event, and enough to lift the Americans into fifth place, behind 
defending champion Romania, Russia, Ukraine and China. They also 
were safely into the top 12 that qualify for next year's Olympics 
in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans encountered problems on the uneven bars, an event  
where falls cost the 17-year-old Atler the national championship 
this year and last. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, she made no mistake, scoring 9.475, while U.S.  
champion Kristen Maloney faltered, falling the wrong way out of a 
handstand. The mistake wasn't apparent to the audience, but she 
scored only 8.975. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same event, Jamie Dantzscher managed only 8.312 as she  
lost her grip on the lower bar at one point. Elise Ray recouped 
vital points with a .600, and later contributed 9.612 in the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney and Atler both scored 9.612 on the balance beam, and  
Maloney had 9.750 on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's competition ``just got all the jitters out,'' said the  
17-year-old Atler, who stood seventh in individual standings with 
38.367. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all really inexperienced, we were all really nervous,''  
Atler said. ``Now that we've got it done, and we know what it's 
like, we can just go out there and have fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atler said she wasn't aware of the importance of her final floor  
exercise, and Maloney added: ``We didn't really look at the 
scoreboard. We wanted to focus on our routines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always get a little nervous, especially being second to the  
last and last on every event. ... But I know I can hit for our 
team,'' Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the four best scores from five gymnasts in each event  
count toward the total, Atler's 7.762 on the floor made a 
difference of 0.625 to the U.S. score, which was just 0.313 ahead 
of sixth-place Australia and 0.594 better than non-qualifier Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The medal round comes Tuesday, and coach Kelly Hill said, ``We  
have time now to work out the glitches and we will be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Atler in the 36 who will compete for the individual  
all-around title were Ray, 12th in qualifying with 37.848, and 
Maloney, 16th with 37.768. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's team finished sixth in the last World  
Championships in 1997, down sharply from its 1996 Olympic gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It is competing without Jennie Thompson, third place finisher in  
the U.S. championships. She reinjured her left ankle in practice 
here, and was replaced by 16-year-old Morgan White.

<HEADLINE>  Cowboys' Irvin Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Michael Irvin lay motionless on the Veterans  
Stadium turf, his teammates gathered in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was hospitalized overnight with swelling in his spine  
after a scary neck injury in the Dallas Cowboys' 13-10 loss to the 
Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said today that Irvin was expected to  
be released from the hospital this afternoon and would fly back to 
Dallas. His condition will be better known after he visits a spine 
specialist Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurer said it's too early to tell when Irvin would play again,  
but ``we're optimistic he'll be back this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin will wear a collar-style neck brace for about a week.  
He'll be stiff and sore as he awaits the swelling to go down and 
fluid that has built up to drain. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurer said Irvin did have some limited motor skills immediately  
after the injury, but he could use his hands and feet before 
leaving the field strapped to a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Once word reached the Dallas locker room that Irvin was able to  
move his arms and legs, his teammates expressed their anger at fan 
reaction that was boorish and outrageous even by Philadelphia 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Incredibly, many fans cheered while Irvin lay on the artificial  
turf for about 15 minutes late in the first quarter. It was enough 
to anger even a player on the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know our fans pride themselves on being tough, but that  
wasn't tough,'' said Eagles receiver Charles Johnson, whose 28-yard 
TD reception from Doug Pederson was the game-winner with 67 seconds 
left. ``That was just plain ignorant. ... I was embarrassed to 
stand on the sideline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people need to grow up,'' an angry Emmitt Smith said.  
``Some people need to grow up and find some inner peace, because 
there is no peace in watching somebody suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, a five-time Pro Bowl selection and vocal member of the  
best Dallas teams this decade, caught an 8-yard pass from Troy 
Aikman with 5:16 left in the first. He tried to shake a tackle from 
Bobby Taylor and was hit on the head by safety Tim Hauck as he hit 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As Taylor tackled Irvin, Hauck's shoulder pad collided with the  
side of Irvin's helmet -- a clean hit that twisted Irvin's head 
awkwardly as it hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was taken to the spinal unit at Thomas Jefferson Hospital,  
where an MRI showed swelling in the spinal cord in two places near 
the base of the skull and a herniated disc. He had movement in his 
feet and hands, team doctor Robert Vandermeer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin hasn't missed a game due to injury since the 1990 season,  
but Vandermeer reacted angrily when asked if Irvin could play next 
week. Vandermeer said he didn't know if the injury was 
career-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so, but I don't know,'' Vandermeer said. ``We'll  
have to evaluate him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Jerry Jones, who rode in the ambulance with Irvin,  
said it was ``way too speculative'' to say how serious the injury 
was. The hospital barred a reporter from entering, and would 
release no information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that he needed me, because I knew his family would want  
me to be there to give them information,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who moved his fingers and appeared to be talking as he  
lay on his back, was fitted with a neck brace and loaded onto a 
stretcher as his teammates circled in prayer across the field. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Cowboys' prayer group broke up, Sanders nervously  
circled his fallen teammate while medical staff attended to him. As 
Irvin was loaded into the ambulance, ``He said that he was going to 
be OK and he gave me the old Michael Irvin smile,'' said Sanders, 
disgusted by the cheers from Philadelphia fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ignorance and stupidity, but I expect that,'' Sanders  
said. ``That's one of the sick things about our game, that people

</P>
<P>
	Vandermeer said the herniated disc probably was an old injury  
that wasn't caused by the collision. 
</P>

	The catch was the 750th of Irvin's career, tying Charlie Joiner  
for ninth in NFL history.

<HEADLINE>  Cowboys' Irvin Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Michael Irvin lay motionless on the Veterans  
Stadium turf, his teammates gathered in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was hospitalized overnight with swelling in his spine  
after a scary neck injury in the Dallas Cowboys' 13-10 loss to the 
Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said today that Irvin was expected to  
be released from the hospital this afternoon and would fly back to 
Dallas. His condition will be better known after he visits a spine 
specialist Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurer said it's too early to tell when Irvin would play again,  
but ``we're optimistic he'll be back this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin will wear a collar-style neck brace for about a week.  
He'll be stiff and sore as he awaits the swelling to go down and 
fluid that has built up to drain. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurer said Irvin did have some limited motor skills immediately  
after the injury, but he could use his hands and feet before 
leaving the field strapped to a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Once word reached the Dallas locker room that Irvin was able to  
move his arms and legs, his teammates expressed their anger at fan 
reaction that was boorish and outrageous even by Philadelphia 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Incredibly, many fans cheered while Irvin lay on the artificial  
turf for about 15 minutes late in the first quarter. It was enough 
to anger even a player on the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know our fans pride themselves on being tough, but that  
wasn't tough,'' said Eagles receiver Charles Johnson, whose 28-yard 
TD reception from Doug Pederson was the game-winner with 67 seconds 
left. ``That was just plain ignorant. ... I was embarrassed to 
stand on the sideline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people need to grow up,'' an angry Emmitt Smith said.  
``Some people need to grow up and find some inner peace, because 
there is no peace in watching somebody suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, a five-time Pro Bowl selection and vocal member of the  
best Dallas teams this decade, caught an 8-yard pass from Troy 
Aikman with 5:16 left in the first. He tried to shake a tackle from 
Bobby Taylor and was hit on the head by safety Tim Hauck as he hit 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As Taylor tackled Irvin, Hauck's shoulder pad collided with the  
side of Irvin's helmet -- a clean hit that twisted Irvin's head 
awkwardly as it hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was taken to the spinal unit at Thomas Jefferson Hospital,  
where an MRI showed swelling in the spinal cord in two places near 
the base of the skull and a herniated disc. He had movement in his 
feet and hands, team doctor Robert Vandermeer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin hasn't missed a game due to injury since the 1990 season,  
but Vandermeer reacted angrily when asked if Irvin could play next 
week. Vandermeer said he didn't know if the injury was 
career-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so, but I don't know,'' Vandermeer said. ``We'll  
have to evaluate him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Jerry Jones, who rode in the ambulance with Irvin,  
said it was ``way too speculative'' to say how serious the injury 
was. The hospital barred a reporter from entering, and would 
release no information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that he needed me, because I knew his family would want  
me to be there to give them information,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who moved his fingers and appeared to be talking as he  
lay on his back, was fitted with a neck brace and loaded onto a 
stretcher as his teammates circled in prayer across the field. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Cowboys' prayer group broke up, Sanders nervously  
circled his fallen teammate while medical staff attended to him. As 
Irvin was loaded into the ambulance, ``He said that he was going to 
be OK and he gave me the old Michael Irvin smile,'' said Sanders, 
disgusted by the cheers from Philadelphia fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ignorance and stupidity, but I expect that,'' Sanders  
said. ``That's one of the sick things about our game, that people 
can actually cheer upon a man's injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vandermeer said the herniated disc probably was an old injury  
that wasn't caused by the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch was the 750th of Irvin's career, tying Charlie Joiner  
for ninth in NFL history.

<HEADLINE> Army Official Sees Stronger Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army of the 21st century will have to  
change, with every unit ready to help in rescue, humanitarian and 
combat operations, the service's civilian chief said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with lagging recruitment and increased emphasis on  
airpower in both U.S. defenses and recent operations abroad, Army 
Secretary Louis Caldera defended the continued need for a strong 
ground force. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged the demand for much faster response to a  
variety of post-Cold War challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that the Army must change and must continually  
evolve to meet the changing needs of the nation,'' Caldera said at 
the annual convention of the Association of the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting the tone for the meetings, the organization's president,  
retired Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, declared the Army 
``over-committed, under-resourced and underpaid.'' AUSA, organized 
to promote Army goals, includes active and retired military members 
as well as defense industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said that although recruitment lagged this year, the  
Army experienced record retention and re-enlistment rates, with 
increased funding and pay levels. He said intensified recruitment 
efforts are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	To meet the new challenges of terrorism, drug-trafficking,  
organized crime, weapons of mass destruction and other threats, the 
Army must be able to respond more rapidly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new timetables of this new world dictate that to be the  
relevant force of choice for the nation for emergency response, for 
deterrence by putting soldiers on the ground or for war-fighting, 
we have to get their faster,'' Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing a restructured Army, he said, ``We must be a  
full-spectrum force in which every unit is capable of contributing 
along every point of the spectrum from humanitarian system to 
high-intensity conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that although ground troops were not engaged in combat  
during the Kosovo conflict, the forces played a huge role in 
preparing for the air war and are deeply engaged in the postwar 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real goals of Operation Allied Force are only now on their  
way to being achieved because of the hard and dangerous work that 
our peacekeeping and our civil-society-building soldiers are now 
doing,'' Caldera said.

<HEADLINE> Anaheim Angels Get Two Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Reliever Pep Harris and infielder Justin  
Baughman, both sidelined for the 1999 season after undergoing 
surgery, were designated for assignment Monday by the Anaheim 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 27, underwent reconstructive surgery on his right elbow  
last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Baughman, 25, was recovering from surgery to repair multiple  
fractures of his lower left leg, an injury sustained Nov. 7, 1998, 
while he was playing with Los Mochis of the Mexican League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels also assigned pitcher Steve Mintz to Triple-A  
Edmonton.

<HEADLINE> Vikes' Moss Mum on NBA Possibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy  
Moss declined to address reports Monday that he wants to play 
basketball in addition to football. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders said in Phoenix that  
agents for Moss contacted him about playing for the NBA squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really athletic, he was a great high school player,''  
Saunders said, but expressed some doubt. ``But he hasn't played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In August, Moss expressed interest in trying his hand at pro  
basketball. Moss was twice named West Virginia's Mr. Basketball 
while at DuPont High in Rand, W.Va. Moss, who is 6-foot-4, was 
offered scholarships in football and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about his basketball aspirations Monday, Moss  
declined comment. His agents were out of the office for Columbus 
Day, and Vikings general manager Tim Connolly also refused to talk 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a two-sport career could be complicated, but nothing is  
impossible, Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As good an athlete as he is,'' Saunders said, ``I'll never say  
never, knowing that he is such a great athlete.''

<HEADLINE> Coffee Up 7 Pct. on Brazil Drought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures jumped 7 percent Monday on New York's Coffee,  
Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange on heightened fears of crop damage from the 
extended drought in parched Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, natural gas futures soared as the cold-weather  
season drew nearer in the northeastern United States, and hog 
futures fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices are bouncing back after hitting their lowest level  
since early 1994 on Oct. 1, when investors were anticipating a big 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Now those assumptions have been revised as a dry spell shows no  
signs of ending. Showers occurred in some coffee regions over the 
weekend, but rainfall amounts were less than expected and forecasts 
say central Brazil will remain dry through much of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought, coming at a time when moisture is key to a good  
crop, has increased talk of severe soil deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that quite a lot of traders were reassessing the  
situation and saying, 'Hey, it might be more serious than had been 
believed,''' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst for Prudential 
Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have had sub-optimal rainfall in Brazil for an awfully  
long time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After soaring 9 percent in frantic trading soon after opening,  
reaching the highest level since early September, coffee for 
December delivery rose 5.85 cents for the day to close at 90.95 
cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	In light Columbus Day trading on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange, natural gas futures moved higher after forecasts said a 
cold snap could head into northern New England, increasing heating 
fuel consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil and other energy futures also were higher.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude futures, reeling from a 16 percent decline last week  
attributed to increased OPEC production, rallied after initially 
extending their slide to $20.55 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. Energy Department official said it was unlikely  
the United States will sell crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve to counter rising heating oil prices, despite President 
Clinton's comment last week that he was considering such a sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for November delivery rose 37 cents to $21.27 a  
barrel; November heating oil rose 1.16 cents to 54.88 cents a 
gallon; November unleaded gasoline rose 1.11 cents to 60.26 cents a 
gallon; November natural gas rose 13.3 cents to $2.825 per 1,000 
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude rose 53 cents to $21.23 a  
barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on  
signals that retail demand isn't keeping up with output. 
</P>
<P>
	December lean hogs fell .43 cent to 44.87 cents a pound;  
February pork bellies fell 1.83 cents to 62.02 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Tuesday morning  
amid waning expectations that Japan's central bank will take 
significant action to stem the yen's rise. Tokyo stock prices 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded at 106.42 yen, 1.04 yen below its level of  
107.46 yen late Friday in Tokyo and below 106.68 yen late in New 
York on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 42.57 points,  
or 0.24 percent, to 18,104.75 at the end of the morning session 
Tuesday. The index closed down 74.37 points, or 0.41 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo financial markets were closed Monday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was weaker amid diminishing  
expectations that the Bank of Japan, which is holding a policy 
board meeting Wednesday, will increase the domestic money supply as 
a way to slow the ascent of the yen, which has soared in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has regained some ground against the Japanese  
currency since last month when finance ministers from major 
countries expressed concern about the yen's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gains have been limited due to market skepticism about  
the ability of the Bank of Japan to take steps to bring the yen 
back down. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial authorities fret that too steep a rise in the yen  
could derail a budding economic recovery here by reducing demand 
for Japanese goods abroad as a stronger currency makes them more 
expensive. Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst economic 
downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 113.32 yen at late  
morning, below 114.68 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, the Nikkei average opened slightly stronger  
following gains in high-technology shares on Wall Street and on 
hopes for the government's new economic stimulus package. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's new economic stimulus package, currently being  
hammered out among political leaders, is expected to total more 
than $94.3 billion with about $46.9 billion in direct fiscal 
stimulus. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.58  
points to close Monday at 10,648.18. Spurred by a rise in the 
semiconductor sector, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index 
rose 29.48 points to 2,916.05, surpassing its all-time closing high 
of 2,887.06, set Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 12.67 points, or 0.83 percent, to finish the 
morning session at 1,543.50. The TOPIX closed up 5.79 points, or 
0.38 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7850 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7650 percent. Its price 
fell 0.17 point to 99.26.

<HEADLINE> KGB Spy List Reaches Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Giving in to pressure to make public a list of 261  
Italians who allegedly spied for the KGB, Italy's government turned 
the documents over to a parliamentary commission on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the commission is to work in secrecy, the move is  
considered a first step toward making the documents public. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's conservative opposition has criticized Premier Massimo  
D'Alema's center-left government for trying to keep the documents 
secret to protect members of the former Communist Party who are now 
in the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents -- written by KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin, who  
fled to Britain in 1992 -- were allegedly given to Italy by Britain 
in 1996. Italy's premier during that period, European Union 
President Romano Prodi, said he was never informed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, promising not to cover up the truth, the government  
turned the documents over to prosecutors in Rome for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Premier Silvio Berlusconi's conservative forces insist  
the names should be made public immediately. Many center-left 
politicians also back publication of the names. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has promised to do so, but only after prosecutors  
and the parliamentary commission evaluate the credibility of the 
documents. News reports said the documents were not original, but 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents reportedly include the names of government  
officials, journalists and diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Back In It; Is Pedro Next? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There's only one comeback that could top what the  
Boston Red Sox have done this October -- Pedro Martinez taking the 
mound in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, who pulled himself out of the series opener with a  
strained back muscle, said he wants to pitch in Monday night's 
decisive game at Jacobs Field even if it's just in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to wait,'' Martinez said after the Red Sox evened the  
series at 2-2 on Sunday night with a 23-7 thrashing of the 
Cleveland Indians. ``If the results are from one day to the other 
like today, I have no doubts whatsoever that I'll be in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Martinez could hardly play a game of catch as he  
tested the sore muscle under his right shoulder blade for the first 
time since leaving after four innings of Game 1. He came away 
discouraged, and it appeared baseball's most dominant pitcher might 
have to call it a season. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said his shoulder improved dramatically on Sunday and  
came away from a pregame workout encouraged he had gotten much 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still tingling, but you never pitch perfect,'' said  
Martinez, who went 23-4 during the regular season. ``I just hope 
the way I threw for eight minutes today I can throw for eight more 
from the mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox will start Bret Saberhagen in Game 5 against  
Cleveland's Charles Nagy, reprising the matchup of Game 2 pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen lasted just 2 2-3 innings as Cleveland pounded Boston  
11-1 to take a 2-0 lead in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't throw that many innings the last time out,'' he said.  
``So hopefully tomorrow maybe I won't be feeling as good and I'll 
be able to calm down a little bit and stay within myself and make 
some better pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen knows that with the season on the line, Martinez  
might try to get the Red Sox to the ALCS. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pedro is very determined to pitch,'' Saberhagen said. ``So I  
would guess he is going to pitch sometime soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox fans hope it's tonight. They began chanting, ``We want  
Pedro, We want Pedro'' in the fifth inning of Sunday night's 
blowout. 
</P>
<P>
	As it happens, the Indians couldn't have a better pitcher  
starting Game 5 than Nagy. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander with the self-deprecating sense of humor and  
wicked sinker is 10-1 in his career against Boston with a 3-0 mark 
in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie is a big-game pitcher,'' reliever Steve Karsay said.  
``I've been saying that all year and now we've got him going in the 
biggest game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy's seven solid innings in Game 2 went overlooked when the  
Indians pounded the Red Sox 11-1. Now, his performance will be 
scrutinized pitch by pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bartolo Colon, shelled in Game 4, Nagy will be pitching on  
three days' rest. He said the short turnaround might have some 
advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a different type of pitcher than Bartolo,'' he said.  
``He's a power pitcher so when he gets more rest, he's stronger out 
there. Myself, I'm a sinker ball guy. That's what they say, anyway. 
The less rest you have, the better your sinker's going to be. We'll 
see.''

<HEADLINE> 5,000 House Plans in CD-ROM Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	New houses might look as though they're built with wood or  
bricks, but they're really built with money. And the object is to 
have some of that money left when you're done building. 
</P>
<P>
	That begins with the all-important planning, which is where a  
lot of money can be spent -- sometimes as much as 12 percent of the 
house's total cost. HomeStyles Publishing and Marketing Inc., of 
St. Paul, Minn., has a Windows CD-ROM that might help cut those 
planning costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Holigan's Guide to Your New House CD-ROM is an  
interactive version of the TV show of the same name. The four-CD 
set holds more than 5,000 house plans. 
</P>
<P>
	After ``interviewing'' you, the software lets you search this  
database and then offers plans for you to review -- and, HomeStyles 
hopes, for you to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, plans for a house of almost 2,400 square feet are  
available for $534 for the eight sets of blueprints typically 
needed: one set each for you, local building authorities, the 
plumber and the electrician; and two sets each for both the builder 
and the financial source. Changing or copying the plans violates 
copyright law. For those who want to make changes, there are 
``reproducible'' plans that cost about 10 percent more. 
</P>
<P>
	You can also buy lists of building materials, important for  
estimating overall cost. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be noted that the software doesn't turn you into an  
architect or construction manager, but it's much more economical in 
the broad initial selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The software does offer more than a tool to shill HomeStyles'  
core product, however. There are guides to selecting a builder, 
financing, construction and other serious issues right down to the 
final walkthrough and move-in. It's nicely done, with the look and 
feel of a good Web page, and it's complete with appropriate 
versions of Adobe Acrobat and Quicktime for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements: Windows 95-98-NT 4.0, 120 megahertz Pentium  
and 16 megabytes of RAM (but 200 megahertz and 32 megabytes are 
``highly recommended''). Your CD-ROM drive should be at least a 
quad-speed and the monitor SVGA. 
</P>
<P>
	The software retails for $29.99.

<HEADLINE> Boston's Martinez Saves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pedro Martinez took on an unfamiliar role to  
rescue the Boston Red Sox from an all-too-familiar situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured ace came in from the bullpen to help Boston avoid  
elimination on Monday night, striking out eight in six hitless 
innings as the Red Sox beat Cleveland 12-8 to earn a chance to play 
the New York Yankees for the American League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I got in. That's all I needed. I wouldn't come out,''  
Martinez said after breaking free from the celebration that 
surrounded him on the Jacobs Field mound. ``I wasn't going to let 
go. I wasn't going to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Game 5 of their first-round AL playoff series against  
Cleveland tied at 8 and looking a lot like the previous night's 
slugfest, Martinez started the fourth inning and shut the Indians 
down from there. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw a 91 mph fastball to Sandy Alomar on his first pitch  
and retired Cleveland in order in the fourth -- the first 1-2-3 
inning of the game for the Indians batters. 
</P>
<P>
	He fanned two each in the fifth, sixth and seventh innings. Jim  
Thome, who homered twice before Martinez entered the game, struck 
out looking leading off the eighth, becoming Martinez' seventh 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pedro was hot today,'' Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel said.  
``It didn't matter if he had a bad shoulder or a bad whatever. He 
showed you what he has: a great heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was the best pitcher in baseball this season, leading  
the major leagues with a 23-4 record and 2.07 ERA while striking 
out a career-high 313. But when he strained a muscle in his right 
shoulder in Game 1, it seemed to doom Boston's chances of surviving 
the first round of the AL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	After two consecutive Red Sox victories, though, including  
Sunday night's 23-7 beating, the teams returned to Cleveland for a 
decisive fifth game. And that gave Martinez just enough time to 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that he had no chance,'' said pitching coach Joe  
Kerrigan, who played catch with Martinez before Saturday's game, 
when the pitcher could barely pick up a ball. 
</P>
<P>
	But they gave it another try on Sunday, and Martinez felt  
better. On Monday, he threw a dozen warmup pitches before the game; 
by the third, he removed any doubt that he would be available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ouch!'' Kerrigan said as the ball popped into his catcher's  
mitt. 
</P>
<P>
	With that, the Red Sox ace was declared ready for action. But,  
just to be sure, Kerrigan called over to the bullpen three times 
during the game to make sure Martinez was still healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the most heroic, gutsy performances I've ever  
seen,'' Kerrigan said. ``Here's a guy that wasn't supposed to pitch 
tonight except for an inning or two. And here he is throwing 100 
pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the questions surrounding Martinez' health, the Red  
Sox started Bret Saberhagen in Game 5. Saberhagen is a two-time Cy 
Young Award winner -- as Martinez will almost be when the awards are 
announced next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't even pick up a ball two days ago, and was almost  
in tears,'' Saberhagen said. ``He's just the most unbelievable 
pitcher I've ever seen.''

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Delays Polar Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- Poor visibility in Antarctica  
early Tuesday delayed a U.S. flight to the South Pole to rescue a 
polar research station's doctor who has a lump in her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Air National Guard Hercules LC-130 cargo planes had been due  
to fly to the coast of Antarctica on Tuesday but high winds and 
swirling snow meant the mercy mission will have to wait until 
Wednesday before flying to McMurdo, on the northern coast of 
Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
	When the planes arrive in McMurdo, they must wait until the  
temperature at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station rise above 
minus 58 degrees before flying there to rescue Dr. Jerri Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
	A replacement doctor for the station and a team of medics to  
treat Nielsen are on one of the planes, which are fitted with skis 
to allow them to land on the ice at Amundsen-Scott base. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, 44, is the only physician among 41 researchers at the  
Amundsen-Scott base. She discovered a lump in her breast earlier 
this year but could not be rescued because of the harsh polar 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	A daring July flight airdropped medical supplies to Nielsen, and  
she is believed to have been treating herself with chemotherapy 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Air National Guard Capt. Chris Sander said the plane had been  
grounded for at least a day by the poor weather. 
</P>
<P>
	They now hope to leave early Wednesday, but that departure is  
also in doubt because low clouds were forecast for Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible the flight could be delayed until Oct. 22, when  
the first flights of the summer were due to go to McMurdo. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're going to do everything that we can to get in there  
as soon as possible,'' Sander said.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures were mixed early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade, with the U.S. and Canadian holidays 
keeping trading to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was expected to be light throughout the day due to  
Columbus Day and Canadian Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans were both under pressure from ideal harvesting  
conditions in the Midwest, although rain in the southern and 
central sections over the weekend was thought to have slowed 
progress. The corn harvest is about 40 percent complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat continued last week's decline, falling to new contract  
lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3/4 cent to $2.54 per bushel;  
December corn fell 1/4 cent to $1.98 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 3/4 
cent to $1.09 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1/2 cent to $4.92 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures were sharply lower at the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while beef futures were little changed. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle were unchanged at 69.82 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .15 cent to 81.10 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs fell .97 cent to 45.90 cents a pound; February

<HEADLINE> More Radioactive Leakage in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A ventilator at the site of Japan's worst-ever  
nuclear accident spewed small amounts of radioactive particles into 
the air for 12 days before it was turned off, the operator said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The ventilator leak at the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant  
northeast of Tokyo was discovered Friday, but the operator waited 
until today to turn off the exhaust fan and seal over the opening, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were discussing how to cope with the situation, because the  
level of radioactivity outside the plant was low,'' said Shinji 
Saeki, an official with operator JCO Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The ventilator had been running since the major accident on  
Sept. 30, in which at least 49 people were exposed to radiation and 
three plant workers were hospitalized. Residents surrounding the 
plant were forced to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	Saeki said that radioactive iodine 131, measuring twice the  
safety limit, was detected last week in the opening of the exhaust 
vent. Radioactive iodine can cause thyroid disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A monitor 50 yards away from the plant, however, detected iodine  
131 at just 0.01 the safety level. 
</P>
<P>
	Saeki said the leak did not endanger people living near the  
plant. Today, JCO sealed up the windows and doors of the plant, in 
Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation into the Sept. 30 accident has centered on the  
plant's stunningly lax safety standards. Critics also have blamed 
JCO and authorities for not warning residents sooner of the danger, 
and of failing to adequately protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's accident occurred when workers at the plant failed  
to follow guidelines for handling radioactive materials and set off 
an uncontrolled atomic reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	JCO has been under intense scrutiny for apparently ordering  
workers to skip crucial security steps to save time, and media have 
speculated that the company's operating license will be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident, which followed a string of smaller incidents at  
Japanese nuclear facilities, has driven fears about the country's 
atomic safety to new heights.

<HEADLINE>  Suharto Corruption Probe Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's top legal officer dropped  
a corruption investigation against ex-President Suharto today, a 
move that raised fears of renewed student protests just nine days 
before a new head of state is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismudjoko, Indonesia's acting attorney general, said his  
investigation uncovered some irregularities but not enough evidence 
to show that Suharto had violated the law to enriched himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not sufficient evidence to continue the  
investigation,'' Ismudjoko, who like many Indonesians uses only one 
name, said after presenting his report to President B.J. Habibie, 
Suharto's hand-picked successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie promised to crack down on corruption after he took power  
16 months ago. He repeatedly denied accusations that he would 
protect his old boss, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for 32 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to let Suharto off the hook could damage Habibie's  
already dim chances of staying in power on Oct. 20, when the 
700-member People's Consultative Assembly chooses the next leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie did not immediately comment on the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Many assembly members have demanded that the government  
prosecute Suharto, who was forced to quit in May 1998 after a wave 
of student protests and bloody riots. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, students have regularly clashed with security  
forces. They have demanded that Suharto be tried, and they have 
rejected the attorney general's investigation as a whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Habibie's Golkar Party is to announce whether it  
will continue to back him as its sole candidate for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politically, this is a major factor. It could damage Habibie's  
candidacy,'' said Marzuki Darusman, who heads an anti-Habibie 
faction within Golkar. 
</P>
<P>
	Reformers condemned the decision and warned that the world's  
fourth most populous nation should brace itself for more trouble on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are going to be angry that Suharto has been let  
off,'' said Hendardi, who heads the Indonesian Legal Aid 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected this. No one in this country is brave enough to  
put Suharto on trial,'' said Tenten Masduki, of Indonesian 
Corruption Watch, an anti-graft group. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto, 78, has been accused of siphoning millions of dollars  
of public funds through charity foundations during his autocratic 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president, who was recently treated in a Jakarta  
hospital after suffering a stroke, has denied any wrongdoing. He 
also rejected accusations that his family has stashed away a 
fortune in foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew all along this case would be dropped,'' said Danny  
Kailimang, a member of Suharto's legal team. ``We respect the 
attorney general's office for making a professional decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Suharto children remain under separate investigations  
for corruption, and his youngest son, Tommy, is currently on trial 
over a multimillion dollar land deal. A verdict is expected as 
early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismudjoko said he had investigated the finances of seven  
foundations headed by Suharto, but focused on the two largest, 
Supersemar and Dahmais. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation focused on a scheme set up by Suharto under  
which his foundations received regular, legally required, donations 
from state institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found that the foundations had lent the funds to  
various commercial corporations. Although irregular, such 
transactions were not illegal because their profits ultimately were 
returned to the foundations and used for charitable work, Ismudjoko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law says that as long as the profit is used for social  
interests, it is not wrong for the foundation to lend it to 
commercial interests,'' Ismudjoko said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not specify what commercial interests had borrowed the  
money. However, opponents of Suharto claim the funds were milked as 
an easy source of credit to fuel the business empires of his six 
superrich children. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismudjoko said the case against Suharto could be reopened if new  
evidence of corruption was unearthed.

<HEADLINE> Fla. State Spreads Ball Vs. Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Fans checking the statistics from  
Florida State's 31-21 victory over Miami might have wondered if 
they were reading the right summary. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's first three touchdowns were scored by a track  
star, a reserve running back and a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
	The track star, Germaine Stringer, a speedy, little-used  
fifth-year senior with just 12 catches before Saturday, caught 
three passes for 80 yards, including a 48-yard TD 3:47 into the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The backup running back, Jeff Chaney, had a 3-yard TD run with  
4:20 left in the first quarter. The walk-on, Ryan Sprague, scored 
the first touchdown of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was important being able to spread the football around,''  
Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke said after throwing for 332 
yards and two touchdowns, finding 11 different receivers along the 
way. ``We were going to find out what kind of team we were and I 
think we showed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Florida State's defense woke up early in the second quarter,  
shutting down Miami the final 40 minutes of the game as the 
Seminoles shook off the effects of star receiver Peter Warrick's 
legal troubles to win for the fifth straight time over longtime 
nemesis Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspended indefinitely after his arrest on a grand theft charge,  
the All-American wide receiver went on national TV moments before 
Saturday's kickoff and apologized. Then Warrick watched his 
teammates have all the fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't stop the show,'' said senior wideout Ron Dugans, who  
caught five passes for 80 yards. ``Football is a team game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprague's 18-yard touchdown catch that tied the game at 21 was  
his first at any level of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say it was just another catch, but it wasn't,''  
Sprague said. ``It was a great feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Dugans came through with a key 54-yarder that set up Travis  
Minor's clinching 2-yard touchdown with 9:55 left in the game. 
Minor had 146 yards on 25 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	It was easy to tell that many of the Seminoles were tired of the  
fuss over Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to talk about Peter at all,'' Weinke said. ``This  
football team showed up and played and won. They got the job 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked Florida State (6-0) has not only beaten Miami (2-3)  
five straight, but hasn't lost at home in 44 games, winning their 
last 27 at Doak Campbell Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad to be here after the stuff that happened to us  
last week,'' said Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, who won his 
298th game, and improved his record with the Seminoles to 11-13 
against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miami was a lot better than I thought they were,'' Bowden  
said. ``They came here with more firepower than I thought. They 
were very well prepared for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami scored its points in the first half, with Kenny Kelly  
throwing TD passes of 8 yards to Reggie Wayne and 80 and 14 yards 
to Santana Moss. The Hurricanes finished with 448 yards, but were 
held to 166 in the second half by a defense that almost gave away 
the game in the opening 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly completed 27 of 41 passes for 370 yards. Moss finished  
with nine catches for 180 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden gave Weinke credit for taking a leadership role usually  
reserved for Warrick, who coined this year's theme that appears on 
the front of the Seminoles' practice T-shirts: ``TEAM -- It's not 
about me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked serious when he was practicing,'' Bowden said. ``He  
was stepping forward and making statements that I hadn't seen him 
making, such as `Let's do this!'''

<HEADLINE> Jaguars 16, Jets 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The student, Tom Coughlin, finally  
beat the teacher, Bill Parcells. It wasn't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
	In a snoozer of a Monday night game, Coughlin's Jacksonville  
Jaguars downed Parcells' New York Jets 16-6. It was the first time 
Coughlin, who was an assistant under Parcells with the Giants and 
credits the current Jets coach with boosting his career, defeated 
his mentor in four NFL tries, including two playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars, whose vastly upgraded defense has allowed just 52  
points, never let New York (1-4) get going. Not that Jacksonville 
(4-1) did much offensively, either. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter with the way Tony Brackens, Carnell Lake and  
the Jaguars' defenders were performing. Not even an eight-minute 
delay to repair a tear in the artificial turf -- which is in its 
final year at Giants Stadium -- bothered them. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third time this season, the Jaguars, who had four sacks,  
held an opponent without a touchdown. And in reversing their 
playoff loss to New York in January, the Jags handed the Jets their 
fourth loss, as many as they had in all of 1998. New York has only 
one victory and, already, dim prospects for making the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville, meanwhile, appears to have a playoff-caliber  
defense to go with what normally is a high-powered -- but lately has 
been a sputtering -- attack. On the Jets' last real chance, Kevin 
Hardy stopped Curtis Martin for no gain on fourth-and-1 at the New 
York 45. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the Jets gained 226 yards, 51 coming on the last,  
desperation drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hollis kicked three field goals and James Stewart had a  
3-yard TD run for all the Jacksonville points. John Hall made two 
field goals for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville showed no signs of its recent offensive struggles  
on its first possession, marching 61 yards on 13 plays to Stewart's 
scoring run. Stewart, playing for injured starter Fred Taylor 
(hamstring) was involved in eight of the plays on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
	That was it early for either team as the punters took center  
stage. Tom Tupa sent a 54-yarder that was downed on the 
Jacksonville 1. So Bryan Barker returned the favor with a team 
record 83-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets reached Jacksonville territory on two straight series,  
but their inability to adequately protect quarterback Rick Mirer 
kept stymying drives. When Mirer's pass to Quinn Early deflected 
off the receiver's hands and then off teammate Keyshawn Johnson's 
to safety Blaine McElmurry for his first NFL interception, the 
Jaguars took over at their 46. 
</P>
<P>
	A 33-yard completion to Keenan McCardell on which he turned  
around cornerback Aaron Glenn set up Hollis' 32-yard field goal for 
a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Jets responded thanks to a 43-yard kickoff return to  
midfield by Dwight Stone. Mirer got enough time to find Johnson for 
16 yards before the drive stalled and Hall made a 33-yard field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollis' 44-yarder, set up by Brunell's 31-yard third-down  
completion to Reggie Barlow, opened the second half. Hall hit from 
42 with 8:53 left, and when the Jets defense stopped the Jaguars 
twice more, well, so what? New York's injury-riddled offense 
couldn't go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollis capped the scoring with a 21-yard field goal with 1:46 to  
play.

	Gore Counting on Labor Endorsement  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore, having already secured the  
endorsement of the Food and Commercial Workers Union, is all but 
assured the nod from the other members of the AFL-CIO, campaign 
directors for the Democratic presidential nominee said. ``The UFCW 
endorsement makes it look very good,'' said campaign chairman Tony 
Coelho. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who has made clear his 
desire for the Gore endorsement, also sounded satisfied that the 
votes are all moving his way. The United Auto Workers, Teamsters, 
Electrical Workers, and, perhaps, the Machinists, remained 
uncertain votes, labor and political operatives said.

	Internet Plan Spurs Privacy Fear  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Engineers designing a new way to send  
information across the Internet want to include a unique serial 
number from each personal computer within every parcel of data, an 
idea that privacy advocates fear could lead to tracing of senders' 
identities. Critics warn the move could potentially strip away a 
measure of anonymity enjoyed by computer users who dial into 
Internet providers. The proposal by the Internet Engineering Task 
Force would include the unique serial number for each computer's 
network connection hardware as part of its expanded new Internet 
protocol address. The IETF's top engineers say the ``privacy 
concerns are overrated.''

	Peacekeepers Deny Killing Policeman  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- International peacekeepers today blamed  
anti-independence militants for provoking bloodshed on the East 
Timor border that has heightened tensions between the foreign 
forces and the Indonesian military. The peacekeepers denied the 
Indonesian army's claim that a squad of Australian troops killed 
one Indonesian policeman and wounded four in yesterday's clash and 
that the incident happened in Indonesian-controlled West Timor. If 
Indonesian police had been directly involved, it would have been 
the first clash between international troops and Indonesian forces 
since the deployment of the foreign peacekeepers to East Timor on 
Sept. 20.

	LONDON (AP) -- NATO's incoming leader says strengthening European  
security forces and increasing the number of troops available for 
deployment will be one of the alliance's top priorities. George 
Robertson, who takes over as secretary-general this week, noted 
that the alliance is stretched to the limit after deploying 40,000 
troops in Kosovo. Robertson, 53, currently Britain's defense 
secretary, is scheduled to take over the NATO helm Thursday. He 
replaces Javier Solana, who is ending his four-year term a few 
months early to take up the new European Union post of foreign 
policy coordinator.

	AMA Says Its Union Will Not Strike  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association says when it  
launches its new physicians' union later this year, there will be 
no strikes and no recruiting of doctors. The AMA House of Delegates 
voted in June to form a union for doctors because of complaints 
that insurance companies prevent them from prescribing the best 
care, overload them with paperwork and cut their compensation. But 
most of the nation's 650,000 doctors are ineligible to join a union 
because they are self-employed. Federal antitrust laws ban 
collective bargaining by the self-employed.

	Disabled Lobsterman Returns to Sea

	SOUTH BRISTOL, Maine (AP) -- Fourteen months after a highway  
crash killed his cousin and left Danny Reed a quadriplegic, the 
20-year-old Reed has returned to sea as skipper of a 36-foot boat 
designed and equipped to accommodate his disability. Five 
generations of Reed's family gathered for the launching of the new 
craft built around a high-tech helm seat donated by a New York 
businessman, also a longtime lobsterman. Danny began lobster 
fishing when he was 15, but his days at sea appeared to have ended 
on Aug. 29, 1998, when the pickup truck in which he was riding with 
his cousin veered into a ditch and rolled over.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin is  
expected to be released from the hospital today after undergoing 
observation following a neck injury he sustained in a game against 
Philadelphia yesterday. Irvin was injured in the first quarter when 
he caught a pass, then tried to shake a tackle and was hit on the 
head by safety Tim Hauck as he hit the ground. He was hospitalized 
with swelling in his spine. Cowboys doctors said his condition will 
be better known after he sees a spine specialist. Dallas' trainer 
said it's too early to tell when Irvin would play again, but 
``we're optimistic he'll be back this year.''

<HEADLINE> IEA Reports Weaker OPEC Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Iran, Iraq and several other OPEC members boosted  
their crude oil output in September, increasing global supplies at 
a time when wealthy nations are consuming less oil than expected, a 
respected survey said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, possible signs of a softer market -- and cheaper  
petroleum prices -- are offset by an anticipated strong growth in 
demand for heating oil this winter, the International Energy Agency 
disclosed in a monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was compiled before last week's sharp reversal in  
world oil prices, when profit-taking and fears of weakening OPEC 
resolve triggered a 16-percent plunge in prices for crude contracts 
for future delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	David Knapp, the economist who edited the survey, said the  
sudden drop in prices did not change the agency's conclusions. 
Speaking by phone from his Paris headquarters, he predicted that 
global markets would remain firm on the back of an expected 3 
percent rise in fourth-quarter demand to 77.2 million barrels per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA is part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  
Development, a group of the world's most developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Knapp said the biggest surprise in the report was that oil  
inventories in industrialized countries actually increased from 
June to September. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts challenged the IEA's data, calling it  
puzzling and inconsistent. Peter Hitchens of London brokerage 
Williams De Broe said the IEA's finding on oil inventories was a 
``glaring error,'' and he noted alternative surveys that showed 
decreases in oil stockpiles in the United States, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But these analysts concurred with the IEA's basic conclusion  
that the market was still firm despite the recent drop in crude 
prices and a lower level of compliance with OPEC output quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices peaked last week in New York at a 33-month high of  
dlrs 25.12 per barrel, then tumbled to dlrs 20.90 late Friday, in 
their largest single-day loss since the end of the Persian Gulf 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, November contracts for U.S. benchmark West Texas  
Intermediate closed higher Monday at dlrs 21.27 per barrel. In 
London, November contracts for North Sea Brent were trading late 
Monday at dlrs 21.23 per barrel, up 53 cents per barrel from 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. gasoline prices dipped about half a cent nationwide as a  
result of the cheaper crude, said Trilby Lundberg, director of the 
Lundberg survey of 10,000 gasoline stations across the United 
States. The weighted average nationwide on Friday was dlrs 1.3288, 
down .53 cents per gallon from a Sept. 24 survey. 
</P>
<P>
	However, last week's price volatility was a ``blip,'' said Peter  
Gignoux, who manages the petroleum desk in London at U.S. 
investment bank Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is OPEC falling apart at the seams? No. Have they lost the  
will to make the production cuts stick? No,'' Gignoux said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price of crude had built up such a head of steam that if  
it didn't have a pause, the price would have been shooting toward 
dlrs 30 a barrel now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Mark Redway blamed the price reversal on speculators who  
had bet that OPEC would stick to its quotas. When market sentiment 
changed, they panicked and closed out their long positions, causing 
a sharp retreat in prices, said Redway of London-based brokerage 
Greig Middleton and Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA reported that OPEC was 86 percent compliant with the  
production cuts agreed that its members agreed to in March and 
reconfirmed in September. OPEC's compliance rate for August was 94 
percent, revised upward from 92 percent, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Given OPEC's record of cheating on quotas, analysts agreed that  
the group's compliance rate was still good even at its reduced 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran led the increase in production, pumping an additional  
190,000 barrels of oil per day in September. Iraq boosted output by 
60,000 barrels daily, while Saudi Arabia, OPEC's No. 1 producer, 
pumped an additional 50,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria, which had been hampered in recent months by domestic  
unrest in its oil-rich South, expanded daily production by 50,000 
barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	In total, OPEC produced 26.43 million barrels a day last month,  
up 420,000 barrels from August, the IEA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the recent higher prices, everyone tries to sneak in a  
few more barrels,'' said Hitchens of Williams De Broe. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet last week's plunge in prices could work to the advantage of  
OPEC and other oil producers, by highlighting the fragility of the 
market and providing an incentive for renewed discipline, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cigar Craze Over, Analysts Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two years ago, cigars were all the rage.  
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by glossy magazines touting stogies as an accessory of  
the hip elite, sales skyrocketed. In 1996, sales of premium, 
hand-rolled cigars jumped 67 percent. In 1997, they leapt another 
30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigar night at the Mansion Hill Inn, which boasted the longest  
continuously running cigar night in the country, couldn't compete 
with the dozens of restaurants and bars offering their own 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``EVERYBODY was doing a cigar event,'' Steve Stofelano, Jr. said  
of his restaurant's 1996 decision to stop offering theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	But indications now are that the fad is fading out, and fast.  
</P>
<P>
	Across the Hudson River in Troy, J. Cabrella Inc., a  
two-year-old cigar shop, has filed for bankruptcy, citing more than 
$71,000 in obligations to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Love of the Leaf, a shop five miles north in Loudonville,  
snuffed its operation months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearance deals are the norm at cigar shops across the region.  
</P>
<P>
	And in bars and restaurants, cigar nights aren't the draw they  
once were. Stofelano decided to offer one this past Father's Day. 
It was a wonderful night, he said, but he had to struggle to get 30 
guests. And the ones who came were the old regulars, not the young 
and trendy. 
</P>
<P>
	For them, cigars have come and gone. ``Everybody, if you will,  
has been there, done that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same story 200 miles west in Rochester, where  
restaurateur Ziad Wehbe isn't bothering to replenish cigar stocks 
at Oasis Mediterranean Bistro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone cares about them any more,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The ``cigar great awakening'' was bound to crash, said Gerald  
Celente of Trends Research Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y. The boom 
was marketing-driven, rather than consumer-driven, and reality 
couldn't sustain the imagery. Especially among women. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unfeminine, and they stink,'' he said. ``Despite all  
the hype and the glossy advertising, women were never going to 
become cigar smokers en masse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And cigar smoking has a heavy ``repulse factor,'' that makes  
cigar smokers a nuisance at parties and restaurants, Celente said. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, analysts predict a 10 percent fall in sales of premium  
cigars. Three cigar companies -- JR Cigar Inc.; General Cigar 
Holdings and Dimon Inc., showed quarterly revenues down 
significantly from the same period in 1998. Holt's, another cigar 
company, saw its stock downgraded by Prudential Bache. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is there's a limited market out there, and its  
saturated,'' Brown Brothers Harriman Analyst Roy Burry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cigar business crested in 1964, when Americans were smoking  
9 billion yearly. By 1992, government health warnings had caused 
the industry to fall some 77 percent, to 2.1 billion cigars yearly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, suddenly, things changed. There was a 14.6 percent jump in  
sales in 1994, followed by a 31 percent rise in 1995. In 1996, 
sales of premium, hand-rolled cigars jumped 67 percent. In 1997, 
they leapt another 30 percent. The Cigar Association of America 
didn't compile figures for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was seen as one of life's affordable little luxuries, like  
fine wines and single malt scotches,'' Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The soaring economy didn't hurt. Imports poured in from some 18  
countries, and new outlets continued to sprout. Prices climbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the newest ones were too late, said Lee Zyniecki.  
Zyniecki, who has owned Edleez Tobacco for 19 years, is somewhat of 
an icon among tobacconists locally and nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will never go back to what it was during the bonanza. All  
these people were gung-ho. Now that's come back down,'' she said. 
What's left are the ones who have been smoking cigars all along, 
and these customers tend to be loyal to vendors who know about the 
business and can obtain good cigars when no one else can. 
</P>
<P>
	``The craze is over,'' said Norman Sharp, president of the Cigar  
Association of America.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with  
key market indicators losing ground in Hong Kong, Indonesia, 
Thailand and South Korea while rising in Malaysia, Australia and 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the financial markets were closed for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell in Hong Kong in anticipation of the government  
announcement of plans to sell the stock it acquired when it propped 
up the market last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 119.70 points, or 0.9  
percent, closing at 12,992.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the close of trading, officials said the  
government will start selling the shares in an offering from Oct. 
25 to Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said they will package the shares into mutual  
funds and sell them, hopefully without harming prices on the Hong 
Kong Stock Exchange. The fund set up to sell the shares is called 
the Exchange Fund Investment Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale would be the government's first attempt to divest  
itself of the shareholdings amassed last August, and which are now 
worth more than $25.64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors sold banking and property stocks, which make up  
the bulk of the government shares, in anticipation that the new 
fund will allow investors to buy the shares at a discount to 
current market prices, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares closed lower. The Jakarta market's Composite  
Index fell 0.7 percent, or 4.177 points, to 584.060. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai stock prices closed lower, led by losses in banking stocks.  
The Stock Exchange of Thailand or SET index fell 4.14 points, or 
1.05 percent, to 388.88. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices also fell in Seoul, pushed down by a fall in  
semiconductor stocks due to a decline in global chip prices. The 
Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 5.02 points, or 0.5 percent, 
to 834.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares close higher, boosted by a plan to merge  
Malaysian banks. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite index 
rose 3.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 747.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's remarks  
during the weekend that the government wouldn't be too rigid in 
determining the number of banks in the merger fueled speculations 
that it could be increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the initial plan, Malaysian 58 financial institutions will  
be fused into six banking groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian stock market also closed higher, boosted by a  
strong performance from blue-chip industrial companies, noticeably 
in the finance and telecommunications sectors. The Sydney's All 
Ordinaries Index rose 29.3 points, or 1.0 percent, to 2,926.4. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, share prices closed higher, supported by technology  
and financial stocks. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
rose 54.13 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,607.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's Straits Times Index rose 7.74 points, or 0.4  
percent, to 2,122.23, the shares in the broader market were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower. The NZSE-40  
Capital Index slipped 5.29 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,060.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares closed mixed. The Philippine Stock Exchange

<HEADLINE> Barak Approves Settlement Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak has approved a  
decision to build 2,600 new apartments in West Bank settlements, 
his office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Palestinian peace negotiator, Yasser Abed Rabbo,  
accused Barak of ``giving a green light to settlement activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians hope to establish a state in the West Bank and  
Gaza Strip and say Israel is pre-empting the outcome of peace 
negotiations by expanding the settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli peace activists have said the pace of settlement  
building under Barak is faster than under his hard-line 
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Barak's Cabinet ministers, however, said the prime  
minister would dismantle seven of 42 settlement outposts set up on 
outlying West Bank hilltops in the past year as part of a land grab 
by settlers. Barak said later that he was reviewing the legal 
status of the settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, a government committee on settlements met for the  
first time since Barak took office in July to review construction 
projects approved under Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee decided that the bids for 2,600 new homes in the  
settlements, issued in recent months by Housing Minister Yitzhak 
Levy, ``were publicized legally and are in tandem with government 
policy,'' a statement from Barak's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy is the leader of the National Religious Party, a patron of  
the settlement movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Abed Rabbo said the move will make it more difficult for the two  
sides to negotiate a final peace agreement by a September 2000 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minimum acceptable to us'' is that Barak remove the 42  
hilltop outposts, Abed Rabbo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also has debated the fate of those outposts, set up by  
settlers who say they want to seize as much land as possible to 
prevent it from being transferred to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak said Monday that the settlers were sent to the West Bank  
and Gaza Strip by successive Israeli governments and ``deserve to 
be there and to be defended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Barak said he would not allow settler leaders to set  
policy and would review which among the 42 outposts were set up 
illegally. ``This is exactly what we are going to make sure of, 
that no one can take private political initiatives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Minister Yossi Sarid, a dovish committee member, said  
seven of the outposts will be dismantled in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Haaretz newspaper on Monday quoted Barak as telling the  
committee that he has ``a lot of respect for the settlement 
movement'' and that he respects decisions made by Netanyahu's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new government will not allow illegal settlement  
activity, Barak added. 
</P>
<P>
	``The takeovers (of land) weaken the settlements and don't  
strengthen us prior to the struggle over the final borders as part 
of the permanent arrangement'' with the Palestinians, Barak said. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will discuss overall settlement policy at a later  
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Gore Counting on Labor Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore finally appeared to  
nail down an endorsement by the AFL-CIO as more union votes moved 
his way today and labor federation President John Sweeney declared 
the matter paramount to beating ``ugly, anti-poor, anti-working 
family'' Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will endorse a candidate who shares our outrage, who shares  
our vision and our values and who will, above all, champion the 
concerns of working families,'' Sweeney said in a keynote address 
opening the biennial convention of his 13-million-member 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney did not mention Gore by name, but has for months been  
pressing for this week's convention to produce a Gore endorsement. 
In a nod to Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic 
presidential nomination, Sweeney said both Democrats ``are right on 
our issues more than they are wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The House of Representatives is controlled by an ugly,  
anti-poor, anti-working family majority,'' Sweeney said. The 
AFL-CIO would express its outrage next year, he added ``by taking 
back control of our government, by electing a working family 
president, and by taking a broom to the House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins said  
Monday: ``The average working class man and woman is of no interest 
to these union bosses in their Gucci loafers and $600 suits in 
their downtown Washington luxury office suites. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Sweeney to force an endorsement of Al Gore this soon shows  
just how little these bosses care about the wishes of their rank 
and file,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor endorsement deal appeared sealed after 15 building and  
trade unions voted today to follow 1.4 million Food and Commercial 
Workers in giving the vice president's uphill presidential campaign 
an early boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The building and trade unions -- many of whom, including the  
Electrical Workers, were long holdouts on the question of endorsing 
Gore now or later -- approved a motion to vote ``yes'' after a pitch 
by Sweeney at their morning huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Diegel, political director of the Electrical Workers union,  
said all signs looked like ``it's going to happen'' for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation endorsement, to be finalized in Wednesday votes  
by the executive council and full convention, would hand Gore an 
instant organizational advantage over Bradley in the nomination 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll start now, meeting with state federations in Iowa, New  
Hampshire, New York, California, Ohio, Michigan -- a bunch of the 
early primary states -- to put in place the mechanisms for 
mobilizing union members. We know how to produce a vote,'' said 
AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Food and Commercial Workers board began to tip the  
long-uncertain scales when it unanimously voted Gore's way on 
Sunday, after a direct appeal by Sweeney, who for months has been 
committed to an October endorsement of Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UFCW endorsement makes it look very good. Now we just work  
on the rest of them to get them to endorse or abstain,'' said 
campaign chairman Tony Coelho, as he arrived late Sunday to lobby 
any holdouts at the AFL-CIO convention that opened today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney also sounded satisfied. ``More and more people are  
realizing that it's really not early,'' he told a reporter on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.3-million-member Service Employees International Union  
decided against endorsing Gore at this convention, but would likely 
abstain rather than oppose ``the way the bulk of the AFL-CIO is 
going,'' said political director Matt Witt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is in no way a boost of or slap at anybody,'' Witt said.  
Rather, the SEIU is going to follow its own schedule of 
deliberating an endorsement and voting in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Auto Workers, Teamsters and, perhaps, the Machinists,  
remained uncertain votes, labor and political operatives said. But 
these unions do not represent enough votes to block an endorsement, 
which, under convention rules proposed by Sweeney, must be approved 
by unions representing two-thirds of the AFL-CIO's 13 million 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive council -- made up of presidents of the AFL-CIO's  
largest unions -- and the full convention of some 700 delegates vote 
on Wednesday. Gore made plans for a victorious acceptance speech at 
the Los Angeles Convention Center after those votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's unanimous endorsement of Gore by the board of the  
United Food and Commercial Workers followed back-to-back calls to 
UFCW President Doug Dority from Gore and Bradley. Labor officials 
said the urgent, personal calls were typical of the intense 
lobbying that has gone into this high-stakes endorsement and the 
army of grassroots campaign volunteers that it carries. 
</P>
<P>
	As late as Saturday night, Dority, a Gore supporter, was  
nonetheless leaning toward the view that ``an endorsement a couple 
of months'' may be the best way to have an impact after building 
greater consensus, said Greg Denier, Dority's senior assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Another call from Gore, and Dority was tipped to the vice  
president's position. Before Sweeney arrived to press Gore's case 
at a private Sunday-morning meeting of the UFCW board, Dority asked 
his board to join him in supporting an early nod to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Denier explained that the news media had driven the stakes so  
high that the UFCW didn't want a ``no'' vote to be misinterpreted 
``as weak support for Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes as planned it will be one of the earliest  
presidential endorsements by the AFL-CIO since it gave then-Vice 
President Walter Mondale the nod in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Ram Fans Don't Know How To Win Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- With a minute to go in their 42-20 win over San  
Francisco, the St. Louis Rams reached the 49ers 1-yard-line. 
</P>
<P>
	Rams coach Dick Vermeil ordered quarterback Kurt Warner to take  
a knee. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boooo!'' went the fans.  
</P>
<P>
	Big problem.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rams are the NFL's only unbeaten team. St. Louis fans are so  
unused to winning -- they had the Cardinals before they got the Rams 
-- that they don't know the etiquette for winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, those coaches over there on the other side are my  
friends,'' Vermeil said after the game Sunday. ``Besides, we have 
to play them again. You don't want to make enemies by running it 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running it up indeed. It had been 17 games and almost nine years  
since the Rams -- both Anaheim and St. Louis varieties -- had beaten 
San Francisco. Yes, San Francisco beat them with Joe Montana and 
Steve Young, but they also beat them with Elvis Grbac and Jim 
Druckenmiller. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Vermeil suggested last week that nobody thought much  
about the streak, he belied that after the game, hugging owner 
Georgia Frontiere, and talking openly about it. 
</P>
<P>
	So did his players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting my entire career to watch our team take a  
knee against that team,'' said defensive tackle D'Marco Farr, 0-10 
against the 49ers entering Sunday's game and knows NFL etiquette 
better than his fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's by far the biggest win of my career,'' said cornerback  
Todd Lyght, who was 0-16 against the 49ers until Sunday. Then, 
there was the man who thinks of himself as Mentor of All Football 
Coaches, San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked into Vermeil's news conference and hugged the St.  
Louis coach, who indeed is a Walsh protege. ``You're going all the 
way,'' Walsh told him and Vermeil blanched. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't say that,'' Vermeil said.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, why not? In a league that's finally achieved total  
parity (after all, the Eagles and Bengals won Sunday) why can't the 
Rams be this year's Falcons? 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil has a quarterback in Kurt Warner, who is ``Field of  
Dreams'' reincarnated in a football uniform -- he was Gateway 
Conference Player of the year at Northern Iowa and starred for the 
Arena League's Iowa Barnstormers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was cut by the Packers, cut by the Bears, then made the Rams  
last year by beating out the well-traveled Will Furrer for the 
third-string spot behind Tony Banks and Steve Bono. He moved up to 
backup when Trent Green, the Rams' $16 million off-season 
acquisition, tore up his knee in the third exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured he'd come along by midseason,'' Vermeil  
acknowledged. ``I thought until then that the rest of the team 
would carry him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uh ...  
</P>
<P>
	Sorry.  
</P>
<P>
	Warner threw five touchdown passes Sunday, four to Isaac Bruce,  
who, finally healthy, looks as good as the 49ers' ``80,'' a guy 
named Jerry Rice. Warner has 14 in four games -- a pace that would 
give him 56 for the season or eight more than the record set by Dan 
Marino in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, let's get serious.  
</P>
<P>
	At some point, Warner will hit a wall -- maybe next week in  
Atlanta, where the Rams' old coach, Rich Brooks, is the Falcons' 
defensive coordinator. They've already seen Warner and lost to him 
35-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the help has to kick in. And yes, there's talent.  
</P>
<P>
	Only eight players remain from the team Vermeil took over at the  
start of the 1997 season. And Bruce, who may be the NFL's best 
receiver, has trouble staying healthy -- he missed most of the last 
two seasons with various nagging injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line that caused the Rams so much trouble during  
5-11 and 4-12 seasons under Vermeil? That's been bolstered by 
free-agent guard Adam Timmerman and by Orlando Pace, the No. 1 
overall pick in 1997 coming into his own at left tackle. And 
Marshall Faulk has done little yet because they let Warner throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 4-yard gain is overrated. Sid Gillman told me that,''  
Vermeil said of the man whom even Walsh admits was a mentor. ``Why 
get 4 yards when you can get 40?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense?  
</P>
<P>
	It's anchored by veterans like Farr and Lyght, has an emerging  
star in end Kevin Carter, another No. 1 lost on losing teams and a 
wonderful 5-foot-10, 250-pound middle linebacker named London 
Fletcher, a free-agent rookie signed last year from John Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Shula went to John Carroll.  
</P>
<P>
	Is that an omen?

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls in Thin Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Monday as  
traders anticipated little action from the Bank of Japan this week 
to stem the yen's rise. The dollar also fell against most other 
major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was light as Japanese markets were closed for a national  
holiday and U.S. banks and bond markets were closed in observance 
of Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.68 yen,  
down from 107.56 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes are diminishing that the Bank of Japan, which is holding a  
meeting Wednesday, will take strong action such as increasing the 
money supply as a way to slow the ascent of the yen, which has 
soared in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has gained back some ground against the yen after  
finance ministers from major countries expressed concerns about the 
yen's rise late last month. But the gains have been limited due to 
market skepticism about the ability of the Bank of Japan to bring 
the yen back down. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0648, up from $1.0622 late Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4987 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5022, and 1.4730 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4715. The British 
pound rose to $1.6529 from $1.6520. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8370 German 
marks, down from 1.8412; 6.1610 French francs, down from 6.1752; 
and 1,818.61 Italian lire, down from 1,822.80.

<HEADLINE> Aging Probe Makes Jupiter Flyby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The aging and glitch-prone Galileo spacecraft  
successfully flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, overcoming 
huge doses of radiation and a computer problem just hours before 
the approach. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe made the closest-ever flyby at 10:06 p.m. PDT Sunday,  
said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled that the spacecraft handled this flyby so well,  
particularly because it had to endure such a strong dose of 
radiation from Jupiter,'' he said Monday. ``It appears everything 
went well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an extended mission, Galileo's instruments are  
studying the chemistry, heat distribution, gravity and magnetic 
properties of Io, Jupiter's innermost large moon and the only known 
actively volcanic solar system object besides Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us the opportunity to do comparisons between a  
non-Earth volcanic system and the Earth,'' Erickson said. ``We 
learn something about both of them in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Success was not guaranteed. Just 19 hours before the flyby, a  
memory error in a computer caused the spacecraft to enter a safe 
mode, and engineers worked up until two hours before the close 
approach to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Had attempts to recover failed, no science data or images would  
have been returned from the spacecraft 327 million miles from 
Earth, said Nagin Cox, deputy chief of the engineering flight team. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox was at home about 3 a.m. Sunday when she received the news  
of the error from JPL's flight control center. She quickly canceled 
plans to take part in her best friend's wedding and instead drove 
to JPL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing that occurred to me is that we're in that  
window where we have a chance to recover if we start acting right 
away,'' she said. ``We went through a period of a few hours where 
we were trying to get information on what had happened while we 
simultaneously put into motion the recovery plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours after the problem cropped up, engineers determined  
that it stemmed from a memory error, likely the result of the 
spacecraft's long exposure to high levels of radiation near the 
giant gaseous planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours of programming paid off, and the spacecraft is believed to  
have captured about 75 percent of the images and science data from 
the flyby. 
</P>
<P>
	Galileo has sent mission engineers and controllers scrambling on  
several occasions since its 1989 launch, which itself was delayed 
for years by the 1986 Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists overcame the failure of the probe's main antenna to  
open properly and a malfunction of its tape recorder. Galileo still 
achieved 70 percent of its science goals during its $1.5 billion 
primary mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe is scheduled to make an even closer approach of Io on  
Nov. 25, flying within 186 miles of the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995, completed its  
primary mission in 1997 and will finish a $30 million, two-year 
extended mission in January.

<HEADLINE> Co. Funds Davids Against Goliaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When a David goes after a Goliath like  
Microsoft or General Motors and wins, the victor rarely gets the 
spoils -- at least not right away. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations usually appeal big-money damage awards, dooming the  
little guy to what could be years of costly legal battles unless he 
or she is willing to settle for much less. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legal system doesn't really work in this country unless  
both sides have money,'' said Alan Zimmerman, president of Law 
Finance Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Now there's a way to even the odds.  
</P>
<P>
	Zimmerman's San Francisco-based company provides upfront cash to  
plaintiffs facing appeals after being awarded at least $250,000 at 
trial. It doesn't get involved in how the case is handled or how 
the money is spent -- it just collects part of any final award or 
settlement. If the plaintiff loses the appeal, no money is owed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Jeff Shaw in Valparaiso, Ind., used Law Finance in 1997  
when he represented a waitress whose 4-year-old son died in an 
apartment fire. Shaw proved there were no working smoke detectors 
in the home and won a $1.75 million award from the landlord's 
insurer, which immediately appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw and his client received $198,000 from Law Finance and  
promised to pay the company twice that much if they won the appeal. 
Eventually, the woman settled, paid off Law Finance and had enough 
money left over to buy a house. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is for the benefit of the small guy, including the  
small lawyer's office that doesn't have the financial wherewithal 
to ride out these kinds of appeals,'' Shaw said. ``It's just the 
way of the world. Big money is always going to be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert Smith of Philadelphia called Law Finance ``a blessing.''  
</P>
<P>
	He alleged age discrimination when he failed to receive an  
airport job for which he was qualified, instead receiving a 
lower-paying job with fewer responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 65, received free legal services during the trial, but  
after a jury awarded him nearly $1 million in damages, Smith no 
longer qualified for aid even though he left the courtroom with 
just $2 in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Naively, he assumed he would receive his award fairly quickly.  
But his employer appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured that within 30 days I'd have a million dollars in my  
pocket. If they send you to jail, you go right away,'' he reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Law Finance analyzed the case and Smith's chances of winning an  
appeal, and decided to give him $100,000. Smith said his eventual 
settlement was more than enough to repay Law Finance, pay his 
lawyer and fix up his house. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 percent of Law Finance's work involves personal  
injury cases. The rest run the gamut from discrimination to civil 
rights violations to insurance fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears to be the only company in the country that does this  
type of work, and though it may seem like a gray area, the business 
is on solid ethical ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're talking about right now is not whether the practice  
is proper, but whether the price is too high,'' said David Luban, a 
legal ethics expert at Georgetown University Law Center. ``It 
doesn't bother me that this company is out there doing this. I'd 
feel better if there were a few others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Simon, who teaches professional standards at Stanford  
University Law, says Law Finance simply neutralizes a bias in the 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad that justice isn't free but I'm not sure there's  
any solution to that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmerman and Michael Blum, CEO of Law Finance, have about 60  
years of experience as attorneys between them. Zimmerman practiced 
in New York and California before founding his own firm and a 
financial services company. Blum was a civil trial attorney before 
founding a computer company. 
</P>
<P>
	Formerly known as Judgment Purchase, Law Finance has been doing  
business for about five years. While it won't reveal its annual 
income, Zimmerman said in September that the company's pending 
cases and those it was considering totaled in the tens of millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we weren't successful we wouldn't be in business,'' he  
said.

	Cheaper Internet Devices Predicted  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The boom of the Internet will be further fueled by  
newer, cheaper browsing devices appearing on the market as well as 
by industry investments that will greatly expand transmission 
capacity, government and business leaders said yesterday. Wu 
Jichuan, Chinese minister of information industry, told the global 
meeting that China had made great strides in expanding its 
telecommunications networks, but that much work remains to be done 
to give more Chinese access to the Internet and other services. 
Industry leaders at the United Nations-sponsored Telecom 99, the 
biggest gathering yet of information technology industries, noted 
that products such as the new WAP-based mobile phone may be part of 
the solution for China and other developing countries. The cellular 
phone, using the ``Wireless Application Protocol,'' allows the user 
to see information from the World Wide Web in the phone's small 
display window.

	Lucent Plans Mobile Phones in China  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's Konka Group and Lucent Technologies Inc.  
have agreed to develop an advanced mobile phone for the Chinese 
market, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. They plan to 
develop a phone ``characterized by high speed data transmission, 
advanced language and image processing technology, and very low 
energy consumption,'' Xinhua said in a report late yesterday. Konka 
is one of China's largest makers of home appliances, specializing 
in color televisions for export, and lists B-shares for foreign 
investors on the Shenzhen stock exchange.

	Colt's To Exit Retail Gun Business  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Colt's Manufacturing Co., inventor of the  
six-shooter, plans to stop taking orders for most of its retail 
handguns so it can limit its liability in lawsuits, according to 
published reports. The company plans to reduce dramatically the 
number of commercial weapons it makes and focus instead on selling 
mainly to the military, law enforcement agencies and collectors, 
who account for the bulk of its business. Colt's 144-year-old 
retail gun business effectively will be stopped and the company 
will cancel seven product lines, partly because it is having 
trouble paying suppliers, an unnamed senior Colt's executive told 
The New York Times in today's editions.

	Spending on Machine Tools Falls  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spending on machine tools in August fell 1.5  
percent from the previous month and was down 11 percent from the 
year-ago August, according to a study by two industry groups 
released today. Companies spent an estimated $435 million for 
machine tools in August, the Association for Manufacturing 
Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association 
said in a joint statement. That fell well short of the $442 million 
for July and the $489 million spent in August 1998. Year to date, 
machine tool consumption is down 35 percent from the same period a 
year ago, totaling $3.6 billion.

aging Boeings on short haul routes. British Airways said it has put 
an option on another 12 Airbus A318s. The British carrier said in a 
statement that it chose the Airbus jet, which is powered by Pratt 
and Whitney engines, ``for its superior economics, flexibility and 
commonality with the rest of our short haul fleet.''

	Russia Makes IMF Loan Payment  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government made an $83 million payment  
to the International Monetary Fund, the Finance Ministry said in a 
statement today. Russia is the IMF's biggest debtor, with more than 
$15 billion in outstanding loans. The country's latest loan with 
the IMF, an 18-month $4.5 billion arrangement, has been delayed 
following allegations of money laundering in Russia. Russian 
officials have said payments due to the IMF through the end of the 
year would be unaffected by any delay in loan disbursements. The 
latest payment was made Friday, the ministry said.

	SINGAPORE (AP) -- The U.S. chemical company Dupont Co. is  
considering investing about $260 million in a third Lycra 
manufacturing plant in Asia. DuPont-Singapore spokesman Alan Rego 
said today that Singapore, Taiwan, China and Malaysia are being 
considered for the plant. Discussions are at a preliminary stage, 
Rego noted. DuPont has already invested about $178 million in two 
Lycra plants in Singapore, opening one just last week. Lycra is a 
spandex fabric used in underwear, swimsuits and athletic apparel.

	Hong Kong Sets Date for Stock Sales  
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's government will start selling  
shares later this month that were acquired in a controversial stock 
market intervention in 1998 but it did not immediately announce the 
size of the sale. The sale announced today will last from Oct. 25 
to Nov. 4. Hong Kong spent the equivalent of $15.1 billion on 
shares when it moved into the market in August 1998, at a time when 
the Asian financial crisis was unfolding and local officials were 
blaming speculators for big price plunges in Hong Kong. 

</P>
<P>
	Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Illinois State's QB Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAL, Ill. (AP) -- Illinois State quarterback Kevin Glenn tore  
a ligament in his left knee in Saturday's win over Indiana State 
and will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Todd Berry said Monday that tore the ACL and the  
5-foot-10, 190-pound junior from Detroit is expected to undergo 
surgery in two or three weeks and be ready for spring practice next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn led the Gateway Conference in passing yardage per game,  
total offense and pass efficiency last season. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, he was 110-of-174 (63.2 percent), passing for 1,200  
yards and 10 touchdowns. He was intercepted only twice. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Redbirds (5-1, 3-0), whose only loss was to  
Minnesota and who are ranked sixth in the Div. I-AA poll, play at 
independent South Florida (4-2), which is ranked 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said he will decide after this week's practices whether  
senior Ryan Speilman (8-of-19, 84 yards) or freshman Dusty Burk 
(22-of-33, 174 yards) will start against South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``The injury took everybody off guard and took the wind out of  
our sails,'' Berry said. ``This is obviously going to change our 
offense, it has to. When you have a player like Kevin, who makes 
such a dramatic impact, the team becomes bulletproof.''

<HEADLINE> Fans Fork Over $5M at Elvis Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Elvis fans paid $277,000 for one of his classic  
cars and $113,000 for one of his capes, forking over a total of $5 
million for the King of Rock 'n' Roll's memorabilia during a 
three-day auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was significantly more than we expected,'' Arlan Ettinger,  
president of Guernsey's Auction House, said above the din of 
bidders and curious fans Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1956 Lincoln Continental in which Presley dated the late  
actress Natalie Wood drew the top bid of $250,000 plus $27,000 in 
auction commissions, Ettinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bejeweled aloha cape that Presley wore in one of his last  
television shows drew a bid of $98,000 plus a 15 percent 
commission, Ettinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of sunglasses with an EP monogram fetched $37,500 plus  
commissions and his personal .9 mm handgun drew $115,000. A blue 
police light that Presley used to plop atop his car and stop 
unsuspecting motorists drew $31,000. A green jumpsuit sold for 
$75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will go to Memphis-based Elvis Presley Enterprises.  
The primary goal of the auction was to establish a building fund 
for the creation of Presley Place, a transitional housing 
development in the Tennessee city where Presley once lived with his 
parents in a subsidized housing project. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction was sanctioned by Presley's sole heir, his daughter,  
Lisa Marie. The items were culled from the Presley estate, much of 
it in archives that have been kept at Presley's Graceland mansion 
since his death 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of bidders were on hand each day at the auction site,  
the MGM Grand Hotel, and hundreds more bid on items via fax or on 
the Internet. Some 2,000 pieces were on the block. 
</P>
<P>
	The interest in the auction was evident Saturday when an auction  
worker mistakenly produced a Christmas tree-shaped television 
antenna that once sat atop the Graceland mansion. The antenna had 
been shipped here by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not supposed to be in the auction, but was brought here  
mistakenly,'' Ettinger said. ``In the spirit of the moment, we went 
ahead and put it up for bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The antenna sold for $1,725.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real piece of Graceland, not just some document,'' Sue  
Fergerstrom of Springfield, Mo., said, laughing. ``And when he 
tries to contact me, I'll have better reception.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Vindicated in Consumer Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration had the  
authority to certify a stretched version of a Boeing airplane 
without requiring a full-scale passenger evacuation test, an 
appeals court says. 
</P>
<P>
	A consumer group backed by Ralph Nader, the Aviation Consumer  
Action Project, had challenged the FAA's decision, saying its 
reliance on mathematical analysis and a test on a shorter version 
of the Boeing 777 did not adequately ensure the safety of 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
Circuit ruled Friday that the FAA was allowed to change its policy 
about conducting evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's policy is that airplane builders must show new  
plane models can be evacuated within 90 seconds even if half their 
exits are blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the agency said that in cases in which the capacity of  
a plane is increased by more than 5 percent, manufacturers can meet 
that standard with a full-scale test or by submitting data from 
earlier tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said it planned to use such data in certifying the  
Boeing 777-300, the longest commercial airplane in the world, and 
stretched versions of the Airbus A330 and A340. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether this test is met requires a factual determination by  
the FAA, and clearly, as methods of analysis and other 
considerations develop over time, the FAA's response to the test 
can also,'' wrote Judge Laurence H. Silberman on behalf of the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``In 1998, spurred on by injuries to demonstration  
participants, (the FAA) reviewed its policy and concluded that the 
situation had changed such that analysis and testing were now 
sufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing created the 777-300 by stretching its 777-200 with a  
33-foot fuselage section. At 242 feet, 4 inches long, the jet is 11 
feet longer than the biggest Boeing 747. The added length increased 
the aircraft's capacity from 440 passengers to 550. To accommodate 
them, Boeing added two new emergency exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus lengthened its A330/340 aircraft to increase their  
capacity from 361 passengers to 440. The European aircraft maker 
did not add any new emergency exits, deciding instead to increase 
the size of an existing pair of exits. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in July 1998, focused on the 777-300. The FAA  
certified it on May 4, 1998, based on an evacuation test of just 
the new passenger compartment, as well as an analysis of data 
gleaned during a full-scale passenger evacuation of the 777-200.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Killed in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A staffer working for the U.N.  
civilian mission in Kosovo was shot and killed Monday night after 
his first day on the job, U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The staffer was shot on the main street of the capital,  
Pristina, on his way to dinner after arriving for duty earlier in 
the day, spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He was believed to be the first U.N. staffer killed since the  
United Nations began running Kosovo in June after NATO's 11-week 
bombardment of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials were withholding the staffer's name pending  
notification of his family, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the U.N. police force in Pristina, who asked for  
anonymity, said the man, apparently a Bulgarian national, was shot 
near the Grand Hotel, where many employees of international 
organizations stay while working in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	One officer said it appeared the shooting occurred after the man  
had begun talking to an ethnic Albanian woman, but stressed the 
circumstances of the killing were still unclear and under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect escaped on foot, apparently helped by other locals  
crowding the street, which is closed to car traffic for several 
hours each evening, the police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Almeida e Silva said the staffer had a job in the civilian part  
of the U.N. mission in Kosovo -- not in any military or police 
operation. He was in civilian clothes at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	While the United Nations has been taking charge of administering  
Kosovo, NATO is still largely in charge of keeping the peace in the 
province, with support from U.N. police. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence has continued to flare, primarily revenge attacks  
between ethnic Albanians and the Serb minority still remaining in 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 28, two rifle-propelled grenades exploded in an outdoor  
suburban market packed with Serbs, killing two people and injuring 
dozens of others. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched its air campaign to compel Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic to end the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians 
seeking more independence for the province.

<HEADLINE> Gore Mingles With Arizona Hardhats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- As he awaited a major labor federation's  
endorsement, Vice President Al Gore took his campaign straight to 
the rank and file on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very grateful for all the working men and women who have  
helped me in this campaign,'' Gore said at a construction site 
where he mingled with several hardhats who greeted him with 
applause and handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore added that they deserve a $1 increase in the national  
minimum wage. Legislation that would make an increase possible is 
pending in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Harvey, a unionized electrician, beamed as Gore greeted the  
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he supports organized labor, we're for him,''  
Harvey said of Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	An endorsement, expected this week, by the 13-million-member  
AFL-CIO is crucial to Gore's bid to win the Democratic presidential 
nomination over challenger Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he was certain of the AFL-CIO's support, Gore  
said: ``I'm hopeful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore later took his pledge to support ``working families'' to  
the Las Vegas Strip, home to a powerful contingent of heavily 
unionized hotels and casinos. He hoped to raise $200,000 at a 
$1,000-a-plate fund-raiser Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore told some 100 party faithful who greeted him at Harrah's  
hotel-casino that he will ``bring change that works for working 
families,'' including an expansion of access to health care for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Gore sought to boost his support among another group --  
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore met with about 45 mostly poor, Hispanic pupils and their  
teachers at one of the area's oldest elementary schools shortly 
after arriving in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Congress to approve money to build more schools,  
hire more teachers, reduce class sizes and upgrade dilapidated 
schools. He also said teachers deserve a raise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here because it is my belief that education is the most  
important priority for the future,'' Gore said, repeating his 
remarks in Spanish for the bilingual, sixth-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also criticized the GOP-controlled Congress for not fully  
funding the Clinton administration's $12.4 billion plan to hire 
100,000 teachers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also promised in Las Vegas to bring ``revolutionary  
improvements'' to public schools and decried proposals to use 
public money to send children to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been for vouchers and I never will be for  
vouchers,'' he said. ``And I don't want to blow the surplus on that 
scheme.''

<HEADLINE>  Russia: Hand Over Chechen Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said  
today that Chechnya needs to hand over suspected ``terrorists'' 
before there can be any talks on ending the fighting in the rebel 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov offered a peace plan  
Sunday, saying he would crack down on renegade warlords if Russia 
pulls its troops from Chechen territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen militants operating beyond Maskhadov's control invaded  
the neighboring region of Dagestan in August and are suspected in a 
wave of apartment bombings in Russia last month. The violence 
prompted Russia to send its troops into Chechnya two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I view (Maskhadov's plan) in a positive light but I would  
change the priorities,'' Putin said, according to the Interfax news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, the terrorists guilty of attacking peaceful villages in  
Dagestan and bombing attacks on apartment houses ... must be 
extradited,'' Putin said. ``Give us the men whose hands and arms 
are stained with blood and we will be prepared for full-scale 
talks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian and Chechen forces clashed over the weekend along the  
Terek River, which cuts across the northern third of Chechnya and 
has effectively become the front line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chechens said they inflicted heavy casualties and now hold  
the villages of Chervlyonnaya and Chervlyonnaya-Uzlovaya on the 
north side of the river, just 15 miles from the Chechen capital 
Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a small victory, but it gives us self-confidence,'' said  
Chechen commander Said-Magomed Chupbulayev. 
</P>
<P>
	Battles were also reported in western Chechnya.  
</P>
<P>
	The Russians moved into Chechnya to establish a security zone  
that will prevent Chechen militants from invading other regions in 
southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Russians have moved cautiously and have not  
attempted to storm the Chechen capital. The Russians have not said 
what they plan to do next, but have not ruled out an assault on 
Grozny, a bombed-out city that has not yet recovered from the 
previous Chechen war. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Chechens ... ask us to liberate Grozny from the bandits, we  
will do so,'' Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in a television 
interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his peace proposal, Maskhadov called for Russia to end ``all  
combat actions'' immediately and said the two sides should observe 
the basic principles outlined in a 1997 peace accord signed 
following the 1994-96 war, which gave Chechnya effective 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov pledged ``not to allow the creation and functioning  
... of any illegal armed forces,'' the Chechen leader said through 
his spokesman, Selim Abdulmuslimov. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maskhadov has been unable to rein in the warlords and  
restore order to Chechnya since winning election as Chechnya's 
president in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed deploying peacekeepers in the Caucasus Mountains  
region of southern Russia to prevent further raids, with Chechen 
soldiers taking part in the contingent. However, the plan did not 
specify whether forces from Russia would be allowed to patrol 
inside Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov, a former Soviet army colonel, is considered a  
moderate, and has stressed the need for economic relations with 
Russia, while insisting that Chechnya must be independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen militants have denounced him for being too willing to  
cooperate with Russia, and in turn, the Russians have criticized 
him for not bringing the militants under control.

<HEADLINE> Braves Face Another Hurdle in LCS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Excuse the Braves if they feel like they've been  
down this road before. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating New York five times in the final two weeks of the  
regular season and cruising to the division title, Atlanta finds 
those same Mets standing in the way of its first trip to the World 
Series since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to life in the wild-card era.  
</P>
<P>
	``This series is 0-0,'' Chipper Jones said, looking ahead to the  
start of the NL championship series Tuesday night at Turner Field. 
``The first team with four wins is going to the World Series. 
They're riding a lot of momentum, and we've been playing good 
ourselves for the last month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta reached its eighth straight LCS by defeating the Houston  
Astros in the opening round, finishing off the triumph with a 7-5 
victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	About the time the Braves were popping champagne corks at the  
Astrodome, Todd Pratt hit a 10th-inning homer against Arizona to 
send the New York Mets to their first LCS since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta dominated New York during the regular season and won the  
East by seven games. But those standings don't mean a thing now, as 
the Braves learned two years ago when they lost to wild-card 
Florida in the championship series after finishing nine games ahead 
of the Marlins in the division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had four tons of bricks on our backs two years ago,'' John  
Smoltz said. ``It consumed some of us. Now, who cares if we're the 
team of the decade? They're going to forget these 10 years some 
day. All we care about is we've got a chance to win again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta beat the Mets 9-3 in the season series, winning five of  
six games in the final two weeks to seemingly knock New York out of 
the postseason. But the Mets swept their final series, beat 
Cincinnati in a wild-card playoff and knocked off 100-game winner 
Arizona in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys never gave up,'' Atlanta's Brian Jordan said.  
``They stuck together as a team and right now they're on a high. 
We're on a high, too, so it should be a great series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves are expected to stick with the same rotation they  
used in the opening round, which means Greg Maddux (19-9) will 
start Game 1 on Tuesday night at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Millwood (18-7), who had a one-hitter and a save against  
the Astros, will go in Game 2 Wednesday, followed by Tom Glavine 
(14-11) and Smoltz (11-8) when the series shifts to Shea Stadium 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing Game 1 in the best-of-5 division series, the Braves  
won three in a row over the Astros -- including a 12-inning, 5-3 
victory Friday that will be remembered for many years if Atlanta 
goes on to win its second World Series title of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston was on the verge of winning the pivotal third game,  
loading the bases with no outs in the 10th. But John Rocker escaped 
the jam -- largely due to a brilliant defensive play by shortstop 
Walt Weiss -- and Jordan's two-out, two-run double clinched the 
victory in the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the Braves have been defying the odds all year. They  
lost cleanup hitter Andres Galarraga and closer Kerry Ligtenberg 
before opening day, then overcame season-ending injuries to Javy 
Lopez, Rudy Seanez and Odalis Perez to win more games than any team 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year is special,'' said Smoltz, who won the deciding game  
against the Astros. ``We won 103 games. There is no way we thought 
we could go that. I can't tell you how many times this season that 
I thought we had lost and we came back to sneak out a victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why the businesslike Braves celebrated Saturday  
like little kids, swilling champagne, playfully dousing teammates 
and puffing on victory cigars after beating the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a team,'' Jones said, ``that goes out there every day  
and plays on sheer will and pride and knows that great things are 
going to happen.''

<HEADLINE> World Population Nears 6 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The world's population reaches 6 billion  
on Tuesday according to U.N. demographers, and more than 1 billion 
young people just entering their reproductive years will determine 
how quickly the next milestone is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a continuing decline in fertility rates and family  
size, the sheer numbers of the largest ``youthquake'' in history 
guarantee enormous population growth through 2050, U.N. population 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of these more than 1 billion young people, aged 15 to 24,  
live in less developed nations where governments are struggling to 
provide education, jobs and social services -- and they urgently 
need reproductive health information and services, the U.N. 
Population Fund says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether they get services will determine the future course of  
population growth,'' said Dr. Nafis Sadik, the fund's executive 
director. ``The decisions they make on the size of their family 
will determine the future levels of fertility, and the eventual 
numbers of the world's population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there is another ``youthquake'' coming, with 1.8 billion  
youngsters under the age of 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's population has doubled since 1960, partly due to  
some very positive developments, including increased life 
expectancy and lower infant mortality, Sadik said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been higher if the United Nations, voluntary  
organizations and governments had not started promoting family 
planning and contraceptive use, which has increased from just 10 
percent of women and men in 1969 to 60 percent today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we hadn't done anything, there would have been quite a  
different situation today. The population may have been 7 billion 
or 8 billion,'' Sadik said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been many more unwanted children. Infant  
mortality would have been higher, and the average family size, 
which has reduced from six to three children in 30 years, would 
have been much higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, 350 million women don't have access to reproductive  
health and family planning services today. And in a world where 
educated women have fewer children, 960 million people are 
illiterate, two-thirds of them women, according to U.N. figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan of action adopted at a 1994 U.N. population conference  
in Cairo, Egypt, estimates the price of stabilizing world 
population at $17 billion per year, which the Population Fund says 
is equivalent to world spending on arms for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	At the current pace, humanity is adding 78 million people every  
year. That's equal to a city the size of San Francisco every three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody knows where the six billionth citizen of planet Earth  
will be born -- and celebrations and ceremonies are being held in 
many countries -- but it's almost certain to be in a developing 
nation. India has the world's largest number of births every year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan planned to officially welcome  
the six billionth baby at a hospital in the Bosnian capital, 
Sarajevo, where he is making his first postwar visit as U.N. chief. 
The first child born there on Tuesday was to be designated the 
symbolic six billionth baby. 
</P>
<P>
	A 29-year-old first-time mother gave birth to a baby boy at two  
minutes after midnight Tuesday, making him the designated six 
billionth baby, said Dr. Idris Bukvic, pediatrics chief at 
Sarajevo's hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Bukvic said the mother, Fatima Nevic, gave birth to the 8-pound  
boy after a seven-hour labor. Mother and baby were fine, he said. 
Mrs. Nevic and her husband, Jasminko, are from the Bosnian town of 
Visoko. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congo, meanwhile, the government is choosing four babies to  
symbolize the day of six billion, and the U.N. Population Fund is 
giving each of them cribs. In Bangladesh, a parade was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	China planned a ceremony Tuesday in the Great Hall of the People  
in Beijing, a folk performance and special TV shows. China, the 
world's most populous country with a population of 1.25 billion, 
uses a controversial one-child policy to try to keep its population 
from growing. 
</P>
<P>
	At U.N. headquarters in New York, a population clock in the  
visitor's lobby was to turn to 6 billion. Sadik said a similar 
clock would be given to the baby in Sarajevo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deports Saudi Bombing Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Saudi dissident who reneged on a deal to  
cooperate with U.S. investigators was deported to Saudi Arabia to 
face charges of helping in an attack that killed 19 U.S. airmen, 
the U.S. and Saudi governments announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hani al-Sayegh left the United States on a U.S. government  
aircraft late Sunday evening from Atlanta, where he had been 
detained for the last two years. Accompanied on the flight by FBI 
and immigration service agents, he arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 
on Monday, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Riyadh, Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef told the Saudi  
Press Agency, ``The suspect is now in the hands of Saudi justice 
and he will be interrogated just like any other suspect. He will be 
tried according to Islamic law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Nayef said his government has ``specific evidence and  
information that confirm the involvement of al-Sayegh in the unjust 
terrorist act in the city of Khobar about three years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sayegh is suspected by Saudi authorities of driving a car in  
June 1996 that signaled an explosives-filled truck when to pull up 
beside the Khobar Towers complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, where 
U.S. airmen and their families lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sayegh, 30, says that he was not involved in the bombing and  
that he and his 28-year-old brother, Mohammed, have been tortured 
in Saudi jails. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government said it does not have evidence it can use in  
U.S. courts to charge al-Sayegh in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, U.S. circuit courts here and in Atlanta turned down  
his last-minute appeals to delay deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed that as a politically active opponent of the Saudi  
monarchy he would be tortured there in violation of the United 
Nations Convention on Torture, which both countries have signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said she received assurances from  
the Saudis he would not be tortured and would receive a fair trial. 
U.S. authorities were promised access to him in Saudi Arabia to 
make certain he was not tortured. 
</P>
<P>
	The government told the appellate courts that the deportation  
was a political question to be resolved by Reno and Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright and was not within court jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, al-Sayegh's family was having trouble finding him a  
lawyer in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still looking,'' his wife, Hakima al-Qatri, said Monday  
by telephone from her home in the eastern Saudi city of Qatif. 
</P>
<P>
	She said al-Sayegh spoke with her and their two children,  
Sukeina, 7, and Mustapha, 5, last week. His daughter asked him to 
bring back a Barbie doll. His son asked for a motorized 
remote-control car, al-Qatri said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked me to buy the presents for them and tell them it was  
a gift from their father,'' she said. ``Hani said, `Don't worry 
about me. We'll be together soon. I am innocent, and God will take 
care of things.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi lawyers said al-Sayegh's case is politically sensitive  
and, unless the authorities asked for their services, they do not 
dare get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Qatri has not seen al-Sayegh since July 1996, when they all  
lived in Iran. That year, al-Sayegh went to Kuwait, while his wife 
and children visited relatives in Saudi Arabia. Al-Sayegh later 
moved from Kuwait to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	There, he cut a deal with U.S. officials that called for him to  
plead guilty to participating in an unrelated plot against 
Americans in Saudi Arabia that was never carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1997, Canada expelled al-Sayegh for alleged terrorist  
activity. Reno allowed him into the United States solely for 
prosecution under the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon arrival, he reneged on the deal, claiming he had not  
understood it, knew nothing about the Khobar attack and was out of 
Saudi Arabia when the bombing occurred.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Lofton Shoulder Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Sports Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland center fielder Kenny Lofton  
dislocated his left shoulder during Monday night's fifth and 
deciding game of the AL division series against Boston and was 
admitted to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton was hurt in the fourth inning when he hit a ground ball  
to first baseman Mike Stanley and slid head first in an attempt to 
beat the throw to pitcher Pedro Martinez, covering at first. After 
Lofton was called out, he lay face down on the ground for several 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton, who had two stints on the disabled list this season with  
hamstring injuries, got slowly to his feet and was helped off the 
field by Indians assistant trainer Jim Warfield, who had his hand 
under Lofton's left elbow for support. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton was replaced in center field in the top of the fifth by  
Dave Roberts with the score 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians said Lofton's shoulder had been popped back into the  
socket. He was expected to spend the night at Lutheran Hospital and 
the undergo X-rays that would determine if there was additional 
damage to his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez entered the game to start the fourth, his first  
appearance since straining a muscle beneath his right shoulder 
blade during last Wednesday night's series opener at Jacobs Field.

<HEADLINE> German Wins Nobel for Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Dr. Guenter Blobel of The Rockefeller  
University in New York won the Nobel Prize for medicine today for 
protein research that shed new light on diseases including cystic 
fibrosis and early development of kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
	Blobel, 63, a native of Germany, was cited for discovering that  
proteins carry signals that act as zip codes, helping them find 
their correct locations within the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Some hereditary diseases are caused by errors in these signals  
and the associated transport mechanisms, the Nobel Assembly said in 
announcing the prize. The work has helped scientists use cells in 
laboratories to churn out drugs, and has had an ``immense impact'' 
on studies of the cell, the assembly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blobel was not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The prize announcement said Blobel's work explained the  
molecular roots of several genetic diseases. They include primary 
hyperoxaluria, which causes kidney stones at an early age, as well 
as some forms of inherited high cholesterol and illnesses like 
cystic fibrosis that occur when proteins fail to reach their proper 
positions within a cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Blobel, a cellular and molecular biologist, discovered in the  
early 1970s that newly made proteins carry the signals. During the 
next 20 years, he illuminated the details of how the signals work. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical mammalian cell contains about a billion protein  
molecules. Some are building blocks for the cell, while other act 
as enzymes, encouraging chemical reactions. The proteins are 
continually being destroyed and replaced, so newly made proteins 
must find their way to their proper posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralf Pettersson, professor of molecular biology at the  
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, dramatized the importance of the 
signals Blobel discovered by displaying an aerial picture of New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without an address, anybody who lands in this mash-mash of  
houses or streets would get lost,'' Pettersson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klas Kaerre, another Karolinska professor, said Blobel's  
research laid the basis for using biotechnology to produce drugs 
like insulin, growth hormone and a substance used during 
chemotherapy that helps the production of bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Proteins are long, folded chainlike molecules made up of  
building blocks called amino acids. The signals Blobel found are 
particular sequences of amino acids found either at one end of a 
protein or within it. 
</P>
<P>
	Specific signals determine whether a protein will end up in a  
specific compartment of a cell, lodge in the cell wall or be 
exported from the cell. Blobel's work also solved the mystery of 
how proteins enter the tightly sealed compartments of the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners of the Nobel Prize in physics and chemistry are to be  
announced Tuesday, followed by economics Wednesday and the peace 
prize Friday. All the prize announcements are in Stockholm, except 
for the peace prize, which is announced in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden will present the literature,  
science and economic prizes, this year worth $960,000, on Dec. 10, 
the anniversary of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel's death in 
1896. The peace prize will be presented on the same day in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	The science awards tend to be for breakthroughs that often pave  
the way for major advances in fighting disease and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Americans won the Nobel Prize in medicine last year for  
discovering that the body uses nitric oxide gas to make blood 
vessels relax and widen -- a finding that helped lead to the 
development of Viagra and could also pay off in treatments for 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery by Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Dr.  
Ferid Murad also triggered research that could lead to new 
treatments for cancer and septic shock. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy, founded in 1786, has 18 members, although one spot  
is vacant and three members don't participate. Academy members, 
former recipients and a select group of literature and language 
professors and specialists in the field may suggest candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes are funded by a trust set up in Nobel's will.

<HEADLINE> Fed Regulators Eye Bank Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regulators are weighing changes to deal with  
the huge banks being formed by mergers that could hurt the economy 
if they fail, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told bankers 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said in a speech that ``significant changes are in the  
pipeline'' in banking supervision by U.S. regulators and their 
foreign counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes point to a ``multitrack approach'' to oversight of  
banks, since they vary significantly in size, business strategy and 
penchant for risk, the central bank chief said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even among the largest banks, no two institutions have exactly  
the same risk profiles, risk controls or organizational and 
management structure,'' Greenspan said in the speech to the 
American Bankers Association's annual convention in Phoenix. Copies 
of his speech to the banking industry's biggest trade group were 
released in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Because banks vary so widely, he said, government oversight  
needs to be ``customized for each (financial) institution: the more 
complex an institution's business activities, the more 
sophisticated must be our approach to prudential oversight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said such flexibility is especially needed in the case  
of ``megabanks'' resulting from mergers which, he said, ``create 
the potential for unusually large systemic risks in the national 
and international economy should they fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators such as the Fed must walk a line between exercising  
adequate oversight of big banks and regulating them excessively in 
a way that smothers innovation and competition, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a heavier hand would also blunt the ability of U.S. banks  
to respond to crisis events,'' Greenspan said. ``Increased 
government regulation is inconsistent with a banking system that 
can respond to the kinds of changes that have characterized recent 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim McLaughlin, director of regulatory affairs for the bankers'  
group, said afterward the Fed chairman's speech ``has gotten the 
industry thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An outline of the changes being mulled by U.S. and foreign  
regulators was released for public comment in June by an 
international group of bank supervisors based in Basel, 
Switzerland. But Greenspan's speech put the issue in clearer 
perspective, McLaughlin said by telephone from Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said U.S. bankers support Greenspan's push for federal  
regulators to consult with the industry on developing new standards 
for banks to disclose details of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Big bank mergers have been occurring at a rapid pace in this  
country, with recent multibillion-dollar consolidations including 
those in which banking giant Citicorp merged with brokerage-insurer 
Travelers Group; NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica Corp. combined; 
and Banc One Corp. and First Chicago joined. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader and  
some lawmakers, have asserted that the mergers have increased the 
likelihood of future taxpayer bailouts of big financial 
institutions that fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond responding to the rise of huge banks, Greenspan said,  
``few changes'' are needed to the current system of regulation for 
the vast majority of banks in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke, who oversees  
nationally chartered banks, told the bankers' group that regulators 
see some signs of risk spreading in the banking industry despite 
high earnings and hefty assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been particularly concerned with the high degree of  
reliance some banks are placing on optimistic assumptions about 
future cash flows,'' Hawke, who spoke after Greenspan, was quoted 
as saying by Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Federal Reserve warned banks and directed its  
examiners to watch for signs that risky bank loans are piling up. 
The central bank took the action a day after Fed Governor Laurence 
Meyer warned that some banks may be counting too much on the 
economic boom continuing.

<HEADLINE> Informal Lives Threaten Living Room </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The living room is dying.  
</P>
<P>
	Long a model of stuffy grace and fancy furniture, the  
traditional living room -- employed rarely and off-limits to 
children and pets -- has all but disappeared from American homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Its replacement? A zone that gets daily use in the form of  
Internet browsing, television watching, eating, drinking, 
exercising or conducting business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of this room that is set apart that you only use when  
you have guests, like our parents did 50 years ago -- people are not 
planning those in their home,'' said Ann Platz, an Atlanta interior 
designer. ``They are really trying to find rooms they have multiple 
functions for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decorators say the technology-saturated 1990s have made media  
rooms the current darling, with people packing in computers, 
stereos, big-screen televisions, CD players, home satellite systems 
and video games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The younger generation wants to buy all those electronic  
gadgets and you need a space to put them in. The living room goes 
away,'' said Atlanta interior designer Hugh James, who has seen the 
less-than-subtle shift away from living rooms over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill and Tricia McCutchen got rid of their living room in their  
last move, their third in 18 years. The couple instead hang out in 
a sunroom that adjoins their large kitchen in Roswell, an Atlanta 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did away with it because we never used it,'' Mrs. McCutchen  
said. And with the couple's children out of the house, the two 
``kind of live in the kitchen,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all boils down to lifestyles,'' she said. ``People just  
don't entertain formally any more -- don't have time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The traditional living room has morphed into entertainment  
centers, libraries, home offices, exercise areas and private space 
for older people who have moved in with their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the time I find that people who request a formal  
living room are using it for a piano,'' said John Slappey, a real 
estate agent in Buford who plans to install a pool table in his 
living room. ``I've got a formal living room and it's got furniture 
in there that's just collecting dust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Living rooms once were the domain of people engaged in more  
structured, less manic lifestyles, where guests were entertained 
formally, books were read and drinks were sipped by a fireplace. 
Such a space doesn't accommodate the way people live anymore, Ms. 
Platz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in a fast-paced world, and we drive into McDonald's.  
It's kind of instant living,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Living rooms also have become physically less distinct since  
homeowners have begun knocking down walls separating kitchens from 
dining areas, and dens from living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find that clients like this open flow of space. It's all  
just coalescing, one room into another,'' said Hilary Imes, an 
interior designer in San Clemente, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The change also has been spurred by the way people entertain.  
``People are not doing high tea anymore,'' said Dan Bawden, 
president of the Greater Houston Builders Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's dinner parties are more likely to involve casually  
dressed company having cocktails and grazing in the kitchen than 
dressed-to-the-nines guests sipping martinis in a living room 
before sitting down for dinner, Ms. Platz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The living room's transformation has been accompanied by bigger  
homes over the last 20 years. The average single-family home has 
increased from 1,645 square feet in 1975 to 2,190 square feet last 
year, according to the National Association of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
	That jump also has led to huge differences in the amount of  
space people want in particular rooms, builders report. 
</P>
<P>
	Walk-in closets are in, as are large bedroom suites, behemoth  
bathrooms and kitchens with big food-preparation islands. The 
breakfast nook has expanded exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
	Those desires lead to cuts elsewhere. The living room is usually  
first to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``They give you their wish list and very seldom does it include  
a dedicated living room with living room furniture,'' said Paul 
Davidson, president of Davidson/Kopp Group, a Georgia company that 
builds $300,000-plus homes. ``You just don't hear people say they 
want a living room anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, old habits die hard: About 89 percent of new homes are  
built with a living room, even though most aren't used as the 
formal spaces builders designate, said Andrew Kochera, an economist 
with the home builders association in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the majority of the houses in America, eventually that  
living room is going to go away and become a 
library-slash-office,'' predicts Ron Becker, president-elect of the 
International Furnishings and Design Association.

<HEADLINE> Police: Man Threw Wife Over Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A man has been charged with murdering  
his wife by throwing her off the towering Dames Point Bridge after 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas H. Groover, 38, was arrested Sunday after the body of  
Teresa Groover, 32, was found floating near Blount Island, near 
downtown Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the two began arguing at a lounge. On the way home,  
he stopped the car on the bridge and they continued the argument. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, he pushed her over the rail of the bridge and she  
landed on an apron used by maintenance workers, police said. He 
then pushed her off the ledge, 160 feet into the St. Johns River, 
said Sgt. Andy Joiner. 
</P>
<P>
	Groover reported his wife missing but was brought in for  
questioning when her body was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Groover admitted throwing his wife off the bridge.  
</P>
<P>
	Groover, charged with murder, was being held without bond in the  
county jail.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. is 6th in Gymnastics Standings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- John Roethlisberger's final high bar  
routine today at the World Gymnastics Championships earned 9.525 
points and seemingly clinched a spot in the medals round for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States stood sixth with 224.594 points, while  
three-time defending champion China was far ahead with its 230.546 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia was second with 227.083, followed by Belarus with  
226.557, Japan with 226.382, South Korea with 225.319 and the 
United States. The top six teams advance to the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia was 11th with 217.645, and was likely to be pushed out  
of the top 12 teams that qualify for next year's Olympics in 
Sydney. But if it makes the top 18, it still can send two men to 
compete for individual medals. The Australian women advanced to 
Tuesday's medal round. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Japanese gymnasts scored below 9 on the high bar,  
including Naoya Tsukahara (8.600), the 1997 individual bronze 
medalist. But the team performed well in the other events, and 
Yoshihiro Saito was solid throughout, moving into a third-place tie 
in the individual standings with 57.074 points, with 19 of 46 teams 
still to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Yang Wei, who scored 9.8 on the vault, led with 57.649.  
Teammate Huang Xu had 57.299, and Bulgaria's Jordan Jovtchev tied 
Saito's 57.074. 
</P>
<P>
	American Blaine Wilson scored just behind Saito and Jovtchev,  
gaining 57.048 points including 9.562 on the high bar that helped 
set the stage for Roethlisberger's decisive routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize it was that close until I got down. I'm glad  
I didn't,'' said the 29-year-old Roethlisberger, who like Wilson is 
a four-time U.S. champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two guys (on the high bar) had a little trouble, and  
that just puts the pressure on,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women advanced into the top six with their final  
routine, as Vanessa Atler scored a 9.762 in the floor exercises 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Romania led the women's qualifying with  
154.394 points. Also reaching the finals were Russia, 153.576; 
Ukraine, 151.970; China, 151.720; the United States, 151.001, and 
Australia, 150.688.

<HEADLINE> IEA Reports Weaker OPEC Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Iran, Iraq and several other OPEC members boosted  
their crude oil output in September, increasing global supplies at 
a time when wealthy nations are consuming less oil than expected, a 
respected survey said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, possible signs of a softer market -- and cheaper  
petroleum prices -- are offset by an anticipated strong growth in 
demand for heating oil this winter, the International Energy Agency 
disclosed in a monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was compiled before last week's sharp reversal in  
world oil prices, when profit-taking and fears of weakening OPEC 
resolve triggered a 16-percent plunge in prices for crude contracts 
for future delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	David Knapp, the economist who edited the survey, said the  
sudden drop in prices did not change the agency's conclusions. 
Speaking by phone from his Paris headquarters, he predicted that 
global markets would remain firm on the back of an expected 3 
percent rise in fourth-quarter demand to 77.2 million barrels per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA is part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  
Development, a group of the world's most developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Knapp said the biggest surprise in the report was that oil  
inventories in industrialized countries actually increased from 
June to September. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts challenged the IEA's data, calling it  
puzzling and inconsistent. Peter Hitchens of London brokerage 
Williams De Broe said the IEA's finding on oil inventories was a 
``glaring error,'' and he noted alternative surveys that showed 
decreases in oil stockpiles in the United States, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But these analysts concurred with the IEA's basic conclusion  
that the market was still firm despite the recent drop in crude 
prices and a lower level of compliance with OPEC output quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices peaked last week in New York at a 33-month high of  
dlrs 25.12 per barrel, then tumbled to dlrs 20.90 late Friday, in 
their largest single-day loss since the end of the Persian Gulf 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, November contracts for U.S. benchmark West Texas  
Intermediate closed higher Monday at dlrs 21.27 per barrel. In 
London, November contracts for North Sea Brent were trading late 
Monday at dlrs 21.23 per barrel, up 53 cents per barrel from 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. gasoline prices dipped about half a cent nationwide as a  
result of the cheaper crude, said Trilby Lundberg, director of the 
Lundberg survey of 10,000 gasoline stations across the United 
States. The weighted average nationwide on Friday was dlrs 1.3288, 
down .53 cents per gallon from a Sept. 24 survey. 
</P>
<P>
	However, last week's price volatility was a ``blip,'' said Peter  
Gignoux, who manages the petroleum desk in London at U.S. 
investment bank Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is OPEC falling apart at the seams? No. Have they lost the  
will to make the production cuts stick? No,'' Gignoux said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price of crude had built up such a head of steam that if  
it didn't have a pause, the price would have been shooting toward 
dlrs 30 a barrel now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Mark Redway blamed the price reversal on speculators who  
had bet that OPEC would stick to its quotas. When market sentiment 
changed, they panicked and closed out their long positions, causing 
a sharp retreat in prices, said Redway of London-based brokerage 
Greig Middleton and Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA reported that OPEC was 86 percent compliant with the  
production cuts agreed that its members agreed to in March and 
reconfirmed in September. OPEC's compliance rate for August was 94 
percent, revised upward from 92 percent, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Given OPEC's record of cheating on quotas, analysts agreed that  
the group's compliance rate was still good even at its reduced 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran led the increase in production, pumping an additional  
190,000 barrels of oil per day in September. Iraq boosted output by 
60,000 barrels daily, while Saudi Arabia, OPEC's No. 1 producer, 
pumped an additional 50,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria, which had been hampered in recent months by domestic  
unrest in its oil-rich South, expanded daily production by 50,000 
barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	In total, OPEC produced 26.43 million barrels a day last month,  
up 420,000 barrels from August, the IEA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the recent higher prices, everyone tries to sneak in a  
few more barrels,'' said Hitchens of Williams De Broe. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet last week's plunge in prices could work to the advantage of  
OPEC and other oil producers, by highlighting the fragility of the 
market and providing an incentive for renewed discipline, he added.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Plans N. Texas Telecom Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. announced the formation of a  
new telecommunications unit on Monday, unveiling a powerful new 
data system as part of the struggling company's bid to lessen its 
dependence on the personal computer market. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by Michael D. Capellas, Compaq's new president  
and chief executive, came during a keynote address at Telecom 99, a 
major trade show this week in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will reorganize its telecom operations under a new  
unit based in the ``Telecom Corridor'' in the north Dallas suburb 
of Plano, Compaq spokesman Alan Hodel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Compaq Telecommunications will bring together 2,000  
Compaq employees currently working in other divisions. Half of the 
staff would stationed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry S. Schwartz, previously general manager of Compaq Telecom  
Network Solutions, will serve as the new group's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's new telecom engine for tracking telephone calls and  
billing customers can handle 15,000 transactions per second as well 
as up to 40,000 customer service operators. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, the world's largest personal computer maker, expanded  
its telecom operations two years ago when it bought Tandem 
Computers Inc. Compaq also makes network systems for automatic 
banking, securities trading and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the company announced plans to cut up to 8,000 jobs  
after price wars and slowing sales left the computer maker with a 
$184 million loss in the second quarter and forced the ouster of 
top management. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodel said Compaq is relying on telecom and other large-scale  
computing customers to help get the company back on track. Compaq 
now derives more than half of its revenue from large-scale, non-PC 
products designed to drive networks and other large operations.

<HEADLINE> Calif. To Set Nursing Staff Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill  
requiring hospitals to meet minimum staffing levels for nurses, a 
move hailed by a nurses group as the first of its kind in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The text of the nursing law does not specify minimum  
nurse-to-patient ratios, but instead requires the state Department 
of Health Services to set those standards. Davis said he signed the 
bill with the understanding implementation will be delayed until 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the state sets nurse-patient ratios only for critical  
care units and for intensive care units for newborns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most significant days in the history of  
nursing,'' said Kay McVay, president of the California Nurses 
Association. The group said the bill ``will make California the 
first state in the nation to require safe hospital staffing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Health industry lobbyists had strenuously opposed the bill,  
arguing that hospitals should make staffing decisions and that 
state intervention would only drive up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also will bar hospitals from assigning unlicensed  
workers to perform certain procedures, including administering 
medication, and it will prohibit hospitals from shifting nurses 
trained in one unit to another unit without adequate preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis vetoed a related measure that would have increased nursing  
home patient-staff ratios and training requirements. The governor 
said the new requirements would ``place a significant burden on the 
state,'' which pays through Medi-Cal for tens of thousands of 
patients in long-term care nursing homes.

<HEADLINE>  Peacekeepers Deny Killing Policeman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- International peacekeepers today blamed  
anti-independence militants for provoking the bloodshed on the East 
Timor border that has heightened tensions between the foreign 
forces and the Indonesian military. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers denied the Indonesian army's claim that a squad  
of Australian troops killed one Indonesian policeman and wounded 
four on Sunday and that the clash took place in 
Indonesian-controlled West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	If Indonesian police had been directly involved, it would have  
been the first clash between international troops and Indonesian 
forces since the deployment of the foreign peacekeepers to East 
Timor on Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers were sent to the territory after militiamen and  
their allies in the Indonesian army launched a wave of terror after 
East Timor's overwhelmingly vote for independence in an Aug. 30 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian military, police and government officials today  
repeated accusations that the Australian-led force is using 
brutality and is illegally entering Indonesian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said the  
Indonesian military and the peacekeepers have formed a team to 
investigate the shooting. ``Both sides have no interest in 
worsening the situation,'' he told reporters in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dili, East Timor's capital, Australian Col. Mark Kelly, the  
chief of staff of the international forces, maintained that about 
40 Australian soldiers were fired on by the militia force on 
Sunday. They shot back, wounding two militiamen. There was no 
deaths, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group that was first seen to engage international troops  
were wearing T-shirts and militia garb,'' said Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian soldiers and police were accompanying the militants  
at the time and ``were probably involved in the incident,'' but 
didn't appear to fire shots themselves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said no Australians were wounded.  
</P>
<P>
	The fighting occurred in a remote area of hamlets on the border  
that separates West and East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard said his country is  
seeking urgent talks with Indonesian officials to prevent further 
border clashes in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Melbourne, Australia, East Timorese independence leader Jose  
Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao accused Indonesian forces of provoking 
the clash ``to see how much the Australian troops are ready to 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said senior peacekeeping officers met with Indonesian  
military and police commanders in Dili on Sunday to demand an 
explanation for the attack, which he said occurred on the East 
Timor side of the border. During the talks, ``both sides agreed the 
incident occurred in East Timor,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't seem to be the case in the Indonesian capital.  
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Sudrajat, a military spokesman, said the police were  
only guarding the West Timorese border when the peacekeepers opened 
fire on them. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said, ``I think this 
incident is truly to be deplored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a break in the Parliament, legislators from four  
different parties, including two opposition ones, condemned the 
peacekeeping forces for Sunday's fighting and urged Indonesian 
forces to attack them when they violate the country's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incident makes it very clear that there is no goodwill by  
the peacekeeping forces toward Indonesia. The Indonesian military 
has to ... shoot those that violate Indonesian territory. Once we 
tolerate them, they will trample on our sovereignty,'' said Slamet 
Effendi Yusuf, a lawmaker of the ruling Golkar Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Two anti-Australian protests also took place outside the  
country's embassy in Jakarta. In one, 150 students chanted slogans 
such ``Australians are dogs!'' and ``Australia, go to hell!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clash was the third firefight involving the peacekeepers in  
the last week, and some fear the upsurge in violence means that 
Indonesian-trained militants have launched a guerrilla campaign to 
partition East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two militiamen were killed Wednesday and another was shot to  
death Saturday in separate clashes with peacekeepers near the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Sunday's clash an Indonesian police officer in  
Motaain said police belonging to a mobile brigade unit had fired 
warning shots to let the Australians know they wrongly had crossed 
over to the western side of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
Australians shot back, killing a policeman and wounding two others. 
Witnesses told The Associated Press they saw the dead man's body in 
a hospital in the nearby town of Atambua.

<P>
	The fighting occurred in a remote area of hamlets on the border  
that separates West and East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard said his country is  
seeking urgent talks with Indonesian officials to prevent further 
border clashes in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Melbourne, Australia, East Timorese independence leader Jose  
Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao accused Indonesian forces of provoking 
the clash ``to see how much the Australian troops are ready to 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said senior peacekeeping officers met with Indonesian  
military and police commanders in Dili on Sunday to demand an 
explanation for the attack, which he said occurred on the East 
Timor side of the border. During the talks, ``both sides agreed the 
incident occurred in East Timor,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't seem to be the case in the Indonesian capital.  
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Sudrajat, a military spokesman, said the police were  
only guarding the West Timorese border when the peacekeepers opened 
fire on them. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said, ``I think this 
incident is truly to be deplored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a break in the Parliament, legislators from four  
different parties, including two opposition ones, condemned the 
peacekeeping forces for Sunday's fighting and urged Indonesian 
forces to attack them when they violate the country's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incident makes it very clear that there is no goodwill by  
the peacekeeping forces toward Indonesia. The Indonesian military 
has to ... shoot those that violate Indonesian territory. Once we 
tolerate them, they will trample on our sovereignty,'' said Slamet 
Effendi Yusuf, a lawmaker of the ruling Golkar Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Two anti-Australian protests also took place outside the  
country's embassy in Jakarta. In one, 150 students chanted slogans 
such ``Australians are dogs!'' and ``Australia, go to hell!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clash was the third firefight involving the peacekeepers in  
the last week, and some fear the upsurge in violence means that 
Indonesian-trained militants have launched a guerrilla campaign to 
partition East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two militiamen were killed Wednesday and another was shot to  
death Saturday in separate clashes with peacekeepers near the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Sunday's clash an Indonesian police officer in  
Motaain said police belonging to a mobile brigade unit had fired 
warning shots to let the Australians know they wrongly had crossed 
over to the western side of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
Australians shot back, killing a policeman and wounding two others. 
Witnesses told The Associated Press they saw the dead man's body in 
a hospital in the nearby town of Atambua.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Sprewell Rejoins Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell's teammates want an  
explanation, even though the fans seem ready to forgive and forget. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was back on the court Monday for the New York Knicks  
after his unexcused, underexplained absence from the first week of 
training camp, but the scars in the locker room from his seven days 
of selfishness were not yet healed. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy addressed the team and told them the matter  
merits more discussion, and the rest of the players wondered 
whether Sprewell would stand before them and take the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some discussion should take place out of respect,''  
tri-captain Allan Houston said. ``We want to hear something from 
him, but we're not going to pull teeth. I'm not going to lose sleep 
by him not coming forward, but we would like to hear from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Knicks heard instead were the roars of some 8,000 fans  
when Sprewell took the court for warmups and threw down a tomahawk 
dunk on his first touch in the layup line. 
</P>
<P>
	A windmill jam came next, followed by two more dunks in a  
36-minute scrimmage and a couple of brief bursts of the lightning 
quickness that makes Sprewell such a dangerous offensive weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	As he sat on the bench next to Van Gundy, Sprewell even turned  
and grinned at a fan who yelled ``You gotta start Spree, Jeff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while Sprewell remained nonchalant and remorseless about his  
absence, it remained an issue that could potentially splinter the 
team into pro-Latrell and anti-Latrell factions. That was why Van 
Gundy, acutely aware that the Knicks were a fractured unit last 
season, told his team it should air its grievances now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell should address the team about his explanation, because  
there is no excuse. He knows that,'' Van Gundy said. ``And it 
should generate a discussion of what the team wants this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weak teams give in to adversity, so it's much bigger than this  
one thing. On any problem, are we going to confront issues and 
problems? Or are we going to grumble about it on the back of the 
bus within our own little groups?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said he had spoken privately with a couple of his  
teammates, a few of whom greeted him with hugs in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those who did not find the time to embrace him was Marcus  
Camby, one of Sprewell's better friends on the team last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely have to sit down and talk so we can hear his  
explanation,'' Camby said. ``There were probably people down there 
(at training camp in Charleston, S.C.) who were (upset) that he 
wasn't there doing two-a-days, but now that he's here don't hold 
your tongue. Everybody had something to say when he wasn't here. 
Now that he's here, let's see if those same people step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will depend on whether Sprewell decides to stand up and  
address the team. He has already explained to the coach, the 
general manager and the media that he missed training camp because 
he decided to drive from Oakland, Calif., to Milwaukee to see his 
newborn son, Billy, and to pick up some things before continuing on 
to New York, where he arrived Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to a couple guys individually, but I really  
haven't decided how to handle this,'' Sprewell said. ``I don't know 
if I want to sit them all down at once and do it. I'm not a guy 
that likes giving speeches, but I'll talk to the guys. For me, it's 
not as big of an issue as people are making it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell shot 6-for-10 in the scrimmage and scored 18 points.  
John Wallace had 20 points, Houston added 17 and Mirsad Turkcan had 
14. The scrimmage was free to the public, with most of the crowd 
was comprised of students enjoying a day off because of the 
Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	As young as the crowd was, it showed how hip it was to recent  
Knicks history by booing newly acquired center Andrew Lang -- the 
player who committed a hard foul on Patrick Ewing in December, 
1997, causing him to break his wrist.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox, Indians Tied 8-8 in 5th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The return of Pedro Martinez, a severe shoulder  
injury to Kenny Lofton and five homers highlighted the first six 
innings as Cleveland and Boston were tied 8-8 in Monday night's 
deciding fifth game of their AL division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams picked up where the Red Sox left off in their 23-7  
win Sunday night, in which Boston had 24 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians outhomered the Red Sox 3-2 in the first three  
innings as they took an 8-7 lead. Jim Thome hit two homers, giving 
him four in the series. That moved into third place in postseason 
homers with 16, two behind Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Fryman also homered for Cleveland, while Nomar  
Garciaparra hit a two-run homer and Troy O'Leary hit a grand slam 
for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner moves on to face the New York Yankees in Wednesday's  
opener of the best-of-7 AL championship series at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's slugfest settled down when Cleveland's Sean DePaula  
entered the game in the top of the fourth and Martinez came in to 
start the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, baseball's best pitcher this year, hadn't pitched  
since last Wednesday, when he left Cleveland's 3-2 win after four 
innings of Game 1 with a strained muscle beneath his right shoulder 
blade. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first three innings Monday, he struck out four and  
allowed no runs, no hits and two walks. DePaula pitched the fourth, 
fifth and sixth, allowing no runs, no hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton left in the top of the fourth with a dislocated left  
shoulder when he slid head first after first baseman Mike Stanley 
fielded a grounder and flipped to Martinez, covering first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's center fielder was called out and lay face down on  
the ground for several minutes before being helped off the field by 
assistant trainer Jim Warfield. Dave Roberts replaced Lofton in the 
top of the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret Saberhagen and Charles Nagy, both starting on three days'  
rest for the first time this season, didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen, the MVP of the 1985 World Series when he pitched a  
complete-game victory for Kansas City in Game 7, left trailing 5-2 
with no outs in the second. Nagy, 3-0 in his postseason career 
against Boston, left with an 8-7 lead with a runner on second and 
no outs in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox went ahead 2-0 in the first when Garciaparra's homer  
scored Brian Daubach, who had singled after going 0-for-6 Sunday 
night at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians quickly erased the lead with three runs in the  
bottom of the inning. Lofton singled, stole second and scored on 
Omar Vizquel's double. Two outs later, Thome hit a 477-foot homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland made it 5-2 in the second when a single by Wilfredo  
Cordero and a homer by Fryman chased Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was Boston's turn as it took a 7-5 lead with five runs  
in the third. A walk to Trot Nixon, a single by Jose Offerman and a 
fielder's-choice grounder by John Valentin produced the first run. 
Daubach doubled and Garciaparra was walked intentionally, loading 
the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Then O'Leary, 0-for-5 on Sunday and 2-for-17 in the series, hit  
Nagy's first pitch for the second grand slam of the series, 
Boston's first in postseason play. Thome hit one in Cleveland's 
11-1 win in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians regained the lead in the bottom of the third against  
Derek Lowe when Robert Alomar and Manny Ramirez hit back-to-back 
doubles and Thome hit his second homer. Ramirez, whose 165 RBIs 
were the most in the majors since 1938, had been 0-for-17 in the 
series before the double. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston tied the game in the fourth when Darren Lewis' leadoff  
double knocked out Nagy. DePaula then walked Offerman and Lewis 
wandered off second. As he rushed back, catcher Sandy Alomar's 
throw to second went into center field, allowing Lewis to reach 
third. Lewis scored the tying run on Valentin's sacrifice fly.

<HEADLINE> Plenty of Atlanta Tickets Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Empty seats are becoming an October tradition at  
Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves once again are having a tough time selling  
tickets to the National League championship series, which opens 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a nasty rivalry brewing against the New York Mets,  
more than 8,000 tickets were available Monday afternoon for Game 1 
at the 50,062-seat ballpark. Nearly 10,000 tickets remained for 
Game 2 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the fans are taking for granted that we're going to make it  
to the World Series, the Mets may have something to say about 
that,'' Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a new complaint. Former Braves outfielder David Justice  
ripped 
</P>
<P>
	fans in 1995 for not making enough noise during the World Series  
against Cleveland. But it seems to be getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves drew only 39,119 fans to the first game of the  
division series against Houston -- nearly 11,000 short of capacity 
and the smallest crowd ever in Atlanta's 44-game postseason 
history. The second game wasn't much better, with only 41,913 in 
the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	David Teske, a fan from Jonesboro, said the 4 p.m. EDT game  
times against Houston hurt attendance. It's hard for working fans 
to attend afternoon games on the weekdays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fans see the empty seats as a symptom of the Braves'  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fans are getting a little complacent,'' said Vicki  
Reidy of Newnan, who bought tickets for Game 1 on her lunch break 
Monday. ``They're used to winning, and they like to wait until the 
end before they show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lukewarm support in the playoffs follows what may have been  
one of the Braves' most exciting seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	With Andres Galarraga recovering from cancer and Javy Lopez  
still out with a knee injury, the Braves managed to fight off the 
hard-charging Mets in the final week of the season. They won more 
than 100 games for the third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I was a little spoiled playing in St. Louis the last  
few years,'' Braves right fielder Brian Jordan said. ``Those are 
true baseball fans. Win, lose or draw, they were always there. To 
come here and be in the postseason and not have sellouts is 
surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braves officials still thought tickets for Game 1 will sell out  
by Tuesday. Paul Adams, director of tickets sales, said 2,500 
tickets sold Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Atlanta fans are going to rise to the occasion,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Fortt, a New York Yankees fan who lives in Atlanta, said  
he wasn't going to any playoff games because of the expensive 
tickets. Reserved seats are $45, and box seats are $60. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leetha Hayes of Chamblee said the Braves don't have the same  
magic they had in 1991, when they went from worst to first in a 
single season and extended the World Series to seven games beforing 
losing to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a fan at one time when they had Deion (Sanders) and Fred  
McGriff,'' she said. ``After they traded them away, it hasn't been 
the same.''

<HEADLINE> Disabled Lobsterman Returns to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BRISTOL, Maine (AP) -- The spinal cord injury that put  
Danny Reed in a wheelchair didn't crush his desire to be a 
lobsterman. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen months after a highway crash killed his cousin and left  
Reed a quadriplegic, the 20-year-old Reed has returned to sea as 
skipper of a 36-foot boat designed and equipped to accommodate his 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shawna Beth, named for Reed's fiancee, was built at the  
Farrin Boat Yard in Walpole and was lowered into the water last 
week at this fishing village. 
</P>
<P>
	Five generations of Reed's family gathered for the launching of  
the gleaming white-and-blue fiberglass craft built around a 
high-tech helm seat donated by a New York businessman, also a 
longtime lobsterman. 
</P>
<P>
	The project was overseen by retired lobsterman Philip Reed, who  
initially had doubts about his grandson's insistence that he would 
return to lobstering. But Danny's unwavering determination won the 
elder Reed over. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a natural-born lobster fisherman,'' he said. ``This is  
the only thing that's keeping him going. This is giving him 
something to look forward to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobster fishing has been a way of life for Reed's family. Danny  
began hauling traps at age 15. He later went out on his own as 
skipper of his father's boat. 
</P>
<P>
	But his days at sea appeared to have ended on the night of Aug.  
29, 1998, when the pickup truck in which he was riding with his 
cousin, Shane Simmons, 17, veered into a ditch and rolled over as 
the two headed home from a fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, the driver, was killed, and Reed faced months of  
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed visited several boatyards before meeting late last year  
with Bruce Farrin, who was impressed with the young fisherman's 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wound up playing it by ear,'' said Farrin, who had never  
before undertaken such a project. 
</P>
<P>
	The project's key element was the custom-made, motor-driven  
chair that Reed can move in multiple directions: front and back, 
side to side and up and down. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the limited range of motion in Reed's arms,  
boatbuilders positioned the seat to allow him access to a pod of 
electronic engine controls that enable him to steer the boat and 
operate its throttle. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed also has another set of controls in the arm of the chair.  
And on a calm, sunny day, he can edge his shoulder outside the 
cabin and steer from the control station outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-point harness is designed to hold him securely in the  
chair, even in choppy seas. 
</P>
<P>
	The seat was built by Stidd Systems Inc., of Greenport, N.Y.,  
which has pioneered the development of ergonomic marine seating for 
the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Stidd's president, Walter Gezari, worked with Philip Reed to  
design his grandson's chair -- but soon realized that the $10,000 
cost was beyond the Reed family's budget. He decided to make the 
chair a gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm grateful to Danny for having given us the opportunity to  
do something that makes us feel this good,'' said Gezari. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen people were on hand Tuesday for the launching of the  
Shawna Beth and the dockside lobster picnic that followed, 
including Reed's 91-year-old great-grandmother, Mildred Reed, and 
his nephew Ethan, a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed and his father, Danny Sr., plan to fish about seven months  
of the year, between June and December or January, setting up to 
800 traps in the waters of Muscongus Bay. They also plan to take 
the Shawna Beth further out to sea to fish for tuna. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawna Beth Maker cracked a champagne bottle across the bow  
minutes before the boat that bears her name hit the water. The 
couple have set a July 15 wedding date. 
</P>
<P>
	After the boatbuilders finished their last adjustments, Farrin  
and Maker carried Reed out of his wheelchair, over the gunwale and 
into the seat from which he will pilot his new boat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good,'' he said, reaching forward to the controls.

<HEADLINE> Colleges Mull Telling on Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- When it comes to college, Mom and Dad  
often pay the bills and Junior has the fun, partying without having 
to worry about a scolding for staying out too late or drinking too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Junior may have to start worrying.  
</P>
<P>
	Congress amended federal confidentiality laws last year to give  
universities the option of telling parents when students under 21 
violate campus codes on drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Some schools -- including the University of Delaware, Indiana  
University, Penn State and most colleges in Virginia -- have already 
put notification policies in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Others -- like the huge University of California system -- have to  
deal with strict state privacy laws that prevent them from telling 
parents about student misbehavior unless the student's safety is 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	But most colleges and universities across the country --  
including the University of Illinois -- are still debating whether 
to take advantage of the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nationally, campuses find themselves in a dilemma. The public  
expectation is that students will graduate with good grades, get 
good jobs and do so in a safe environment,'' said Nancy Schulte, 
the coordinator of drug education services at George Mason 
University in Virginia who has also served on national alcohol task 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities are trying to balance taking care of students,  
knowing that they also have to establish their own independence and 
take responsibility for their own actions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	As administrators work to shape the University of Illinois'  
policy, they know where students stand on parental notification -- 
firmly against it. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent advisory referendum asked the university's students if  
the college should notify parents of students who break alcohol and 
drug codes. More than 5,800 students voted against the idea and 
1,211 voted for it -- the highest turnout for a student election in 
at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students have a right to live here free of the possibility of  
having their mommy and daddy called,'' said student government 
president Jeff Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law is absolutely a violation of the privacy of  
students,'' he said. ``If they are worried about underage drinking 
there are other methods that need to be exhausted first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, administrators have contacted parents only when  
drinking or drug use led to death or serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Five alcohol-related deaths on campuses in Virginia led Sen.  
John W. Warner from that state to push the amendment last year that 
cleared the way for colleges to notify parents of any drug or 
alcohol infraction by an underage student. 
</P>
<P>
	At the most basic level, universities have to decide when to put  
in a call to a mother or father. Every time an underage student is 
caught with a beer? Only when a student drinks so much that he ends 
up in the hospital? Or some fuzzy point in between? 
</P>
<P>
	At the University of Delaware, administrators decided to share  
with parents all information concerning students who had been found 
guilty of violating campus code -- from sexual assault to academic 
dishonesty to underage drinking. Under the policy, students with 
three alcohol or drug violations are suspended from campus. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two years since the get-tough procedures have been in  
place, the University of Delaware has seen dramatic improvements in 
what once was a serious problem with campus alcohol abuse, said Tim 
Brooks, the university's dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandalism in residence halls is down, along with the number of  
alcohol overdoses that led to hospitalization, the number of 
students who binge drink and the campus judicial caseload. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said some parents handle the problem just by talking to  
their children, while others have insisted their son or daughter 
get counseling or enter a rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents really appreciate what we are doing. As a whole,  
parents are very concerned about their sons' and daughters' 
potential for alcohol and drug abuse. They really want to know if 
something is going on, and if it is they want to be part of the 
team to try to rectify the situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the Washington,  
D.C.-based American Council on Education, said most colleges and 
universities are still trying to decide how to handle the option of 
parental notification. 
</P>
<P>
	``This provision gives institutions another arrow in their  
quiver in dealing with alcohol and drug abuse on campus,'' he said. 
``Only time will tell how much it helps.''

<HEADLINE> Four Teens Escape Rapist Captors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Four out-of-state teen-age girls were abducted at  
gunpoint and brought to Michigan, held for more than two weeks and 
repeatedly raped by as many as a dozen boys and young men, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five suspects were taken into custody, including three teen-age  
boys and a 20-year-old man, police said Monday. Police Inspector 
Fred Campbell said more arrests would follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims and suspects are Laotian-Americans and members of  
the Hmong ethnic group. Campbell would not confirm a Detroit Free 
Press report that the suspects were gang members. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims are 14, 15, 16 and 17, and are mostly from the  
Sheboygan, Wis., area, Campbell said. He said the girls finally 
escaped last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old escaped last Tuesday when she saw a passing  
police officer. She identified some of her assailants by names such 
as El Dog and Cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had guns and they beat me up several times,'' police  
quoted her as saying. ``People were in and out of the house all day 
and night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two suspects -- Ladsamee Lee, 20, and Vang Yee Leng Chang, 17 --  
pleaded innocent to rape and other charges Sunday and were jailed 
on $1 million bond. Three juvenile suspects are scheduled be 
arraigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's wife, Yer Xiong, said her husband is a gang member but  
said he ``didn't know anything about these girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband told me it was not him who did it ... and I believe  
him,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Test Ban Vote Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are weighing whether to postpone a  
certain-to-fail vote on a global nuclear test ban treaty after 
President Clinton bowed to Republican demands and put his request 
for a delay in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I firmly believe the treaty is in the national interest,''  
Clinton wrote to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. But he recognized he lacked the 
two-thirds vote needed for U.S. ratification. ``Accordingly, I 
request that you postpone consideration of the Comprehensive Test 
Ban Treaty on the Senate floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans called his letter Monday a first step toward  
possibly postponing the vote scheduled for today but sought further 
assurances the issue wouldn't come up again during this 106th 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate rejection the treaty would be a humiliating defeat for  
Clinton, who was the first world leader to sign the 1996 pact. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should be an easy call,'' Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware,  
the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a 
statement. ``The president has asked for a delay. Most Democrats 
and many Republicans support a delay. It's clearly in our national 
interest to put off this vote without any further wrangling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By putting his request in writing, Clinton met one demand of his  
Republican opponents. The letter was silent on their insistence 
that Clinton promise not to revive it during the 2000 election 
season, but White House officials rejected that request. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though there are campaigns under way in the United  
States, we have to take into account the larger national 
interest,'' said National Security Council spokesman David Leavy. 
``It would be irresponsible for the president to limit his tools in 
dealing with something as sensitive as nuclear testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said the letter was ``merely  
a first step,'' and noted that Lott, joined by Sen. Jesse Helms, 
R-N.C., Foreign Relations Committee chairman, has asked for 
agreement that the treaty not come before the Senate again before 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Lott will discuss this reversal by the White House  
with his fellow senators on Tuesday,'' Czwartacki said. ``Now there 
must be agreement reached in the Senate that it not come up 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms called Clinton's letter ``a step in the right direction''  
but insufficient. ``It must be made clear that this (treaty) is 
dead and that the next president will not be bound by its terms,'' 
he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services  
Committee, called the letter ``a significant step forward'' and was 
working with Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to build support 
in both parties for postponing the vote until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	A Warner aide said the two senators hoped to have a letter  
supporting the delay signed by a majority of senators from both 
parties on the desks of party leaders today. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty would impose a blanket international ban on all  
nuclear test explosions. Supporters estimate they are 15 to 20 
votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for Senate 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact has been signed by 154 nations, including the United  
States, but ratified by only 51. It will not go into effect if the 
United States fails to ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the treaty would lock in U.S. superiority gained  
in over 1,000 nuclear tests during the Cold War, while failing to 
ratify the pact could open the door to additional nuclear tests by 
India and Pakistan or other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the treaty is not verifiable and would not stop  
the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran. Further, they argue 
it would harm efforts to maintain the safety and reliability of the 
U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sent the signed treaty to the Republican-led Senate two  
years ago, but leaders refused to move on it before now. The only 
hearing on it was held last week by the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that proceeding to a vote under these circumstances  
would severely harm the national security of the United States, 
damage our relationship with our allies and undermine our historic 
leadership over 40 years ... in reducing the nuclear threat,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Clinton acknowledged he lacked the needed votes,  
suggested he wouldn't mind delaying ratification.

<HEADLINE> Union Leader Attacks Republicans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney declared war  
Monday on an ``ugly, anti-poor, anti-working family'' Republican 
congressional majority as all signs pointed to an endorsement of 
Vice President Al Gore by the 13-million-member labor federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement, the AFL-CIO's earliest since its 1983 nod to  
former Vice President Walter Mondale, would almost immediately kick 
into gear a $40-million mobilization meant as much to strengthen 
Gore as to wrest control of Congress from the Republicans and 
topple GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outrage is right here in this hall! It is pounding in the  
heart of every trade unionist in this country as our perverted 
United States Congress continues to boost those who are up and kick 
those who are down,'' Sweeney howled to 1,000 union activists 
gathered for the biennial AFL-CIO convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers would flex their outrage, Sweeney promised, ``by taking  
back control of our government, by electing a working family 
president, and by taking a broom to the House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He slammed the GOP's recently proposed tax cuts and  
balanced-budget plan to delay a tax credit for the working poor. 
Unions should be fired up, Sweeney added, by their success in 1998 
in whittling the Republican majority in the House and sending 
``Speaker Gingrich pouting into early retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins replied  
from Washington: ``The average working class man and woman is of no 
interest to these union bosses in their Gucci loafers and $600 
suits in their downtown Washington luxury office suites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union delegates seated at rows and rows of long tables cheered  
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt's call for help putting 
Democrats in control in Washington ``so that we can get people -- 
union or non-union -- to have a fair shake in this country for their 
hard work and their productivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After backroom lobbying by Sweeney that continued into the hours  
just before his keynote speech, the endorsement of Gore appeared 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a firm believer in not counting my chickens until they  
hatch,'' Gore said from the campaign trail, although he had already 
made plans for a victorious acceptance speech at the Los Angeles 
Convention Center on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO officials said Bush's runaway popularity in polls and  
ever-mounting bankroll lent urgency to the endorsement, which frees 
the labor group to begin attacking Bush's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerry Shea, special assistant to Sweeney, said AFL-CIO focus  
group discussions with voters proved to labor chiefs that they 
could turn pro-Bush union voters just by explaining his record. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement scales were decisively tipped when 15 building  
and trade unions voted Monday to follow 1.4 million Food and 
Commercial Workers in giving Gore the early boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Auto Workers, Teamsters and Steelworkers remained  
opposed, saying candidates have not been clear on trade policy and 
union members haven't yet focused enough to pick a favorite. 
Lobbying by rival Bill Bradley had stoked such reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdouts do not represent enough votes to block an endorsement,  
which, under convention rules proposed by Sweeney, must be approved 
by unions representing two-thirds of the AFL-CIO's 13 million 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents were weakened Monday when the 1.3-million-member  
Service Employees International Union decided to wait on endorsing 
Gore, but said it would abstain rather than block ``the way the 
bulk of the AFL-CIO is going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes as planned, votes on Wednesday by the AFL-CIO's  
executive council and full convention would hand Gore an instant 
organizational advantage over Bradley in the nomination race. The 
organization's political director, Steve Rosenthal, said efforts 
would begin right away in key states with early nominating 
contests, such as Iowa, New Hampshire, New York, California, Ohio 
and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley adviser Anita Dunn said Gore's institutional advantage  
is nothing new and the Bradley campaign will continue to campaign 
for labor support. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the AFL-CIO's $35-million campaign in 1996, which was  
almost all TV ads, the 2000 effort will focus intensely on 
leafleting, voter registration, issues education, phone banks and 
door-to-door campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	From its suburban Washington offices, The National Right to Work  
Legal Defense Foundation announced it would provide free legal aid 
for anyone ``who wants to challenge the AFL-CIO's use of their 
union dues.''

<HEADLINE> Arthur Miller-Based Opera Premieres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- ``Eddie never knew he had a destiny.''  
</P>
<P>
	So goes one of the most moving lines from William Bolcom's new  
opera, ``A View from the Bridge,'' making its world premiere 
Saturday at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	And tellingly, the line is delivered by the chorus, rather than  
one of the principals. For in Bolcom's recasting of Arthur Miller's 
acclaimed tragedy, the chorus is an all-important character. It's 
the collective soul of the Sicilian-American community in Red Hook, 
Brooklyn, in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	``A View from the Bridge'' is a rare thing: an Italian-American  
tragedy with no role for the Mafia. The gunmen in the wide-brimmed 
fedoras and bulky overcoats are from a far more ominous 
organization -- the Immigration and Naturalization Service. At a 
time of grinding poverty in Italy and prejudicial U.S. immigration 
quotas, ratting on a ``submarine'' (illegal immigrant) is Red 
Hook's unforgivable sin. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy in ``A View'' lies in how stevedore Eddie Carbone  
comes to commit that sin and the retribution he meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has called ``A View'' his most operatic play, and this  
production proves it. 
</P>
<P>
	As Eddie, baritone Kim Josephson has one of the meatiest, but  
oddest, roles in recent opera. He's the unquestioned star, but he 
doesn't have a single full-fledged aria. Neither Bolcom's music nor 
the libretto by Miller and longtime Bolcom collaborator Arnold 
Weinstein permits Eddie even a trace of lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
	But Josephson shines in the role, letting the audience see what  
a singing Robert De Niro might be like. He has the half-swagger, 
half-waddle of a true dockworker, and when he and his co-workers 
erupt into a doo-wop quartet over an ``accidentally'' split-open 
case of Scotch, it almost seems improvised. 
</P>
<P>
	Josephson, under the skilled direction of Frank Galati,  
convincingly portrays Eddie's gruff, but genuine, love for his job, 
his community and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, that family includes his wife's 17-year-old  
orphan niece, Catherine. Eddie's love for her is so overprotective 
and jealous that it constitutes platonic incest. And when Eddie 
agrees to hide two ship-jumpers who are cousins of his wife, the 
family tensions hit critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, Bolcom suggests the overcrowding of Eddie's tiny  
apartment through stretches of oppressive silence, or the simple 
ticking of a metronome. And, as in Miller's original play, he 
underlines Eddie's jealousy with recurring snatches from the old 
pop standard ``Paper Doll'' ('' ... those flirty, flirty guys with 
their flirty, flirty eyes ...''). 
</P>
<P>
	As Rudolpho, the younger of the two ``submarines,'' tenor  
Gregory Turay has most of the opera's lyrical passages. His biggest 
aria, the Gershwinesque ``New York Lights,'' would seem destined to 
enrich the repertoire of cabaret singers. It's Rudolpho's song of 
love to America, and to the girl who's showing America to him, 
Catherine. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine is sung by soprano Juliana Rambaldi, and her only full  
aria, curiously, is a defense of Eddie to her new lover. Rambaldi 
brings a needed innocence and coltish grace to the role, but, then 
again, most female singers would seem coltish if they had to share 
the stage with Catherine Malfitano, who plays Eddie's wife, 
Beatrice. 
</P>
<P>
	Malfitano's voluptuousness brings an added shiver to one of the  
opera's key lines: ``Eddie, when am I gonna be a wife again?'' And 
the soprano, who starred in Bolcom's previous work for the Lyric, 
``McTeague,'' has several of the most effective arias. 
</P>
<P>
	The most powerful aria, though, is ``I sailed on a ship called  
Hunger,'' sung from a jail cell by bass-baritone Mark McCrory, who 
plays Rudolpho's freakishly strong older brother, Marco. It is the 
only passage that has no counterpart in Miller's original play, and 
the words were added by the playwright at Bolcom's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Baritone Timothy Nolen sings the part of Alfieri, the lawyer,  
who served as narrator in Miller's stage version. In the opera, 
Alfieri leads the chorus and is the commentator -- the educated man 
who is powerless to stop either Eddie's fateful telephone call to 
the immigration office or his inevitable death. 
</P>
<P>
	Musically, Bolcom's deft use of instrumental color keeps the  
orchestral accompaniment effective throughout, and rarely 
obtrusive. He is also proving himself a master of the difficult art 
of fitting operatic music to the natural rhythms and stresses of 
American English. 
</P>
<P>
	And those rhythms and stresses get their due in the  
Miller-Weinstein libretto. This is not the Brooklynese of the 
B-movies and sitcoms, it's the language as it was spoken by these 
people at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``A View from the Bridge'' will have eight more performances  
before it closes Nov. 5.

<HEADLINE> 'Double Jeopardy' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy'' won the box office battle  
of marital betrayal films. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ashley Judd-Tommy Lee Jones movie about a vengeful woman  
striking back at her double-crossing husband was the No. 1 film for 
the third straight weekend, taking in $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy'' edged ``Random Hearts,'' which debuted in  
second place with $13.1 million. ``Random Hearts'' stars Harrison 
Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas as unlikely lovers thrown together 
after their cheating spouses are killed in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Superstar,'' with Molly Shannon in a big-screen story about  
her ``Saturday Night Live'' character Mary Katherine Gallagher, 
opened in fifth place with $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three Kings,'' the tale of American soldiers on a treasure  
hunt at the end of the Gulf War, dropped one spot to third place 
with $11.7 million in its second weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Another take on infidelity, the dark family satire ``American  
Beauty,'' remained strong with $9.2 million for fourth place. The 
film went into wider distribution at 1,226 theaters, up about 500, 
and averaged $7,504 a screen, compared with $4,652 in 2,913 
theaters for ``Double Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy,'' which has grossed $65.8 million in 17 days,  
and ``Random Hearts'' competed for the adult date crowd. Both 
movies drew well with men and women and played strongly to 
movie-goers 25 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	With more of an action edge, ``Double Jeopardy'' had the  
advantage over ``Random Hearts,'' a slow-paced melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
	``That thriller aspect is what is bringing people into the  
theaters,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie-ticket sales. ``Whereas 
'Random Hearts' had more of a romance angle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A two-hour, 11-minute character study, ``Random Hearts''  
received generally poor reviews describing it as dull. 
</P>
<P>
	Unusual for Ford, who's known for action-adventure films that  
appeal mainly to men, the movie drew a bigger female audience, said 
Ed Russell, executive vice president for publicity at Sony 
Pictures, which distributed ``Random Hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Harrison Ford has so much appeal with every audience,'' said  
Robert Bucksbaum, a box-office analyst with Reel Source Inc. ``It's 
incredible that he can do so well with romance when his main forte 
is action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruce Willis ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' remained in the  
top 10 for the 10th straight weekend. The film was No. 6 with $6.1 
million and has grossed $242.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $13.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Random Hearts,'' $13.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Three Kings,'' $11.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``American Beauty,'' $9.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Superstar,'' $9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $6.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Blue Streak, $5.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Drive Me Crazy,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. (tie) ``Elmo in Grouchland,'' $2.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Retired AP Newsman Dies at 73 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- John White, a correspondent for The  
Associated Press in Olympia for 23 years, died Monday at 73. 
</P>
<P>
	White had been diagnosed with lung cancer last summer.  
</P>
<P>
	He reported on the activities of five governors, covered  
countless sessions of the Legislature and directed AP news coverage 
in southwest Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always asking hard questions and never accepting an  
obtuse answer from any of us,'' Democratic Gov. Gary Locke said. 
``He was constantly keeping everyone off guard and even in his 
early departure from us, he was keeping us off guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Co-Speaker Clyde Ballard, a Republican recalled times when  
White was the only reporter on the House floor for an all-night 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved it when he would raise his pen up real high so  
everyone could see it, when our debates were blazing and everyone 
was talking so they could be in the AP story, John would make a big 
point of putting his pen down. His point was that he was through 
writing down notes -- and people stopped talking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A press center near the Capitol that is occupied by The AP and  
other news organizations bears White's name. 
</P>
<P>
	White joined The AP in Boise, Idaho, in 1963. He transferred to  
the Portland, Ore., bureau in 1967 and, later that year, was named 
correspondent in Fresno, Calif. He came to Olympia in 1971, and in 
1973 he was named correspondent of the capital bureau. He retired 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Evelyn, said, ``His favorite story of all was the  
eruption of Mount St. Helens'' in 1980. The family plans to spread 
his ashes around the mountain, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife and five children.

<HEADLINE> Russia Makes IMF Loan Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government made an $83 million payment  
to the International Monetary Fund, the Finance Ministry said in a 
statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the IMF's biggest debtor, with more than $15 billion  
in outstanding loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's latest loan with the IMF, an 18-month $4.5 billion  
arrangement, has been delayed following allegations of money 
laundering in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have said payments due to the IMF through the  
end of the year would be unaffected by any delay in loan 
disbursements. The latest payment was made Friday, the ministry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A second installment of $640 million on the current loan was  
expected in September but is unlikely to be delivered to Russia 
before November at the earliest, officials have said.

<HEADLINE> Fans Fork Over $5M at Elvis Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Elvis fans paid $277,000 for one of his classic  
cars and $113,000 for one of his capes, forking over a total of $5 
million for the King of Rock 'n' Roll's memorabilia during a 
three-day auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was significantly more than we expected,'' Arlan Ettinger,  
president of Guernsey's Auction House, said above the din of 
bidders and curious fans Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1956 Lincoln Continental in which Presley dated the late  
actress Natalie Wood drew the top bid of $250,000 plus $27,000 in 
auction commissions, Ettinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bejeweled aloha cape that Presley wore in one of his last  
television shows drew a bid of $98,000 plus a 15 percent 
commission, Ettinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of sunglasses with an EP monogram fetched $37,500 plus  
commissions and his personal .9 mm handgun drew $115,000. A blue 
police light that Presley used to plop atop his car and stop 
unsuspecting motorists drew $31,000. A green jumpsuit sold for 
$75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will go to Memphis-based Elvis Presley Enterprises.  
The primary goal of the auction was to establish a building fund 
for the creation of Presley Place, a transitional housing 
development in the Tennessee city where Presley once lived with his 
parents in a subsidized housing project. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction was sanctioned by Presley's sole heir, his daughter,  
Lisa Marie. The items were culled from the Presley estate, much of 
it in archives that have been kept at Presley's Graceland mansion 
since his death 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of bidders were on hand each day at the auction site,  
the MGM Grand Hotel, and hundreds more bid on items via fax or on 
the Internet. Some 2,000 pieces were on the block. 
</P>
<P>
	The interest in the auction was evident Saturday when an auction  
worker mistakenly produced a Christmas tree-shaped television 
antenna that once sat atop the Graceland mansion. The antenna had 
been shipped here by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not supposed to be in the auction, but was brought here  
mistakenly,'' Ettinger said. ``In the spirit of the moment, we went 
ahead and put it up for bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The antenna sold for $1,725.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real piece of Graceland, not just some document,'' Sue  
Fergerstrom of Springfield, Mo., said, laughing. ``And when he 
tries to contact me, I'll have better reception.''

<HEADLINE>  Taiwan Mourns Quake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINKOU, Taiwan (AP) -- Thousands gathered at a sports arena in  
this Taipei suburb today to mourn for the more than 2,000 people 
killed by Taiwan's worst earthquake in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	On a stage dimly lit in blue light, many of the island's top  
leaders one-by-one faced a 40-foot-tall memorial to the dead and 
bowed three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Rows of military officials in formal uniforms watched from the  
stands along with lawmakers in dark suits and members of Buddhist, 
Taoist and Christian charity organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief speech to the audience of more than 6,000, President  
Lee Teng-hui said the Sept. 21 quake caused losses that will be 
difficult to recover and left a ``wound in the hearts of all 
countrymen that will be impossible to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many lost their homes in the earthquake. They lost their  
closest family members and friends,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Lien Chan then spoke about the 2,312 people  
killed in the 7.6-magnitude tremor that devastated large parts of 
central Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we can't see you, we feel your presence, your eternal  
presence,'' Lien said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the great quake, we lost our loved ones. It's in rebuilding  
that we achieve rebirth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, a newspaper reported on a new study that estimated  
half the people killed in the quake might still be alive if 
builders had followed construction codes. The study, done by 
National Chiao Tung University's engineering department, said 
inspections of toppled buildings turned up persistent evidence of 
contractors diverging from blueprints or ignoring safe practices, 
the study said, according to the United Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, builders routinely ignored requirements that walls  
and supporting columns of tall buildings be constructed 
independently of each other, the report said. That significantly 
reduced their strength, causing collapses.

<HEADLINE> Illinois State's QB Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAL, Ill. (AP) -- Illinois State quarterback Kevin Glenn tore  
a ligament in his left knee in Saturday's win over Indiana State 
and will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Todd Berry said Monday that tore the ACL and the  
5-foot-10, 190-pound junior from Detroit is expected to undergo 
surgery in two or three weeks and be ready for spring practice next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn led the Gateway Conference in passing yardage per game,  
total offense and pass efficiency last season. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, he was 110-of-174 (63.2 percent), passing for 1,200  
yards and 10 touchdowns. He was intercepted only twice. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Redbirds (5-1, 3-0), whose only loss was to  
Minnesota and who are ranked sixth in the Div. I-AA poll, play at 
independent South Florida (4-2), which is ranked 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said he will decide after this week's practices whether  
senior Ryan Speilman (8-of-19, 84 yards) or freshman Dusty Burk 
(22-of-33, 174 yards) will start against South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``The injury took everybody off guard and took the wind out of  
our sails,'' Berry said. ``This is obviously going to change our 
offense, it has to. When you have a player like Kevin, who makes 
such a dramatic impact, the team becomes bulletproof.''

<HEADLINE> Baffert Wins Jockey Club Gold Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While it was not surprising that trainer Bob  
Baffert saddled a winner at Belmont Park, most bettors were caught 
off guard when it turned out to be River Keen. 
</P>
<P>
	One race after Baffert's star 3-year-old filly Silverbulletday  
finished second to Beautiful Pleasure as the 4-5 favorite in the 
$500,000 Beldame, River Keene surprised everyone. River Keene, a 
12-1 shot, took the lead on the turn and won the $1 million Jockey 
Club Gold Cup on a track made sloppy by day-long rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert watched both races on television from California, where  
he won the Oak Leaf on Saturday with unbeaten 2-year-old filly 
Chilukki and finished second in the Norfolk Stakes with 2-year-old 
colt Forest Camp at Santa Anita. Another Baffert 2-year-old colt, 
Captain Steve, won the Breeders' Futurity Sunday at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	River Keen, who paid $26 despite winning the Woodward Sept. 18  
at Belmont, was never worse than second in the 1 1/4-mile Gold Cup and 
he won by 3 1/4 lengths over favored Behrens, who lost his second 
straight race after having won four straight stakes. Almutawakel, 
the Dubai World Cup winner and Woodward runner was third, with 
3-year-olds Stephen Got Even fourth and Lemon Drop Kid fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the debut against older horses for Stephen Got Even and  
Lemon Drop Kid, winner of the Belmont Stakes and Travers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never expect anything like this,'' said owner Hugo  
Reynolds, who claimed the 7-year-old River Keen for $100,000 on 
Dec. 4. ``If you did, everybody would be at the claiming box every 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	River Keen, a winner in 2:01 2-5 with Chris Antley, is headed  
for the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 6, as are Behrens and 
Lemon Drop Kid. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday's second loss in 10 starts this year and third  
in 17 career races came in her debut against older fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Beautiful Pleasure, ridden by Jorge Chavez, won her second  
straight stakes on a sloppy track. Silverbulletday likes to come 
from off the pace, but she was in trouble quickly when the 
4-year-old Beautiful Pleasure broke on top and opened a 6-length 
lead just past the half-mile pole. 
</P>
<P>
	At the wire, Beautiful Pleasure was 4 3/4 lengths ahead of  
Silverbulletday, with Catinca third. The time for the 1 1/8 miles was 
1:47 1-5. Beautiful Pleasure was worth $6.80, $2.50 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday and another top 4-year-old filly, Banshee  
Breeze, beaten by Beautiful Pleasure at Saratoga, will get another 
crack at Beautiful Pleasure in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. 
</P>
<P>
	In another Grade I stakes Sunday, Surfside gave up the lead to  
Darling My Darling turning for home, then fought back for head 
victory in the $400,000 Frizette, for 2-year-old fillies, a race 
won by her dam, Flanders, in 1994. Both are contenders for the 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. Surfside paid $5.90, $2.80 and 
$2.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Positioning themselves on Saturday as contenders in Breeders'  
Cup races were Greenwood Lake and Val's Prince. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwood Lake ($15.50), ridden by Jean-Luc Samyn, rallied from  
9 lengths off the lead with a little more than a quarter-mile 
remaining and won the 1 Champagne for 2-year-olds by 2 1-2 lengths 
over Chief Seattle in 1:43 3-5 for 1 1-16 miles on a fast track. 
</P>
<P>
	Val's Prince ($8.10), ridden by Jorge Chavez, won his second  
straight Grade I stakes on the grass with a one-length victory over 
France-based Dream Well in the $600,000 Turf Classic. The winning 
time for the 1 1/2 miles on a firm turf course.

<HEADLINE> Ski Gondola Pilot Out of Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot whose jet clipped a ski  
gondola cable in Italy, killing 20 people, has been released from a 
military prison after serving a shortened sentence on a lesser 
charge, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was convicted  
of obstruction of justice in May. He was sentenced to six months in 
prison and ordered dismissed from the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was released last week and has remained in Jacksonville,  
the home of Camp Lejeune, where he was based, lawyer Frank Spinner 
said Monday. Ashby was released early for good behavior, Spinner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby has not yet been dismissed from the military, Spinner  
said. The dismissal order still must be approved by the Marine 
officers managing the cable car case, Spinner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was acquitted in March of 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter for the deaths of the passengers aboard the gondola on 
Feb. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby testified he took a personal videotape out of his North  
Carolina-based EA-6B Prowler after making an emergency landing at 
the NATO air base at Aviano, Italy. He testified the navigator, 
Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, asked for help swapping tapes after the 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer was sentenced to dismissal from the Marine Corps  
after he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Veto 4 Spending Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disputes over hiring teachers, helping U.S.  
allies and regulating oil and mining companies have prompted 
President Clinton to threaten to veto four spending bills as this 
year's budget fight nears its defining battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet recent history and political maneuvering over Social  
Security are combining to complicate the veto fights further. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Clinton and congressional Republicans are separated by  
about $10 billion to $20 billion -- about the same magnitude as most 
end-of-session spending fights since the GOP took over Congress in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's tug-of-war, however, is complicated by the GOP's  
stated refusal to pay for extra spending from the Social Security 
surplus. For decades, both parties have used that as a till to find 
needed billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Having lost their coveted 10-year, $792 billion tax cut to a  
Clinton veto and broken their pledge to heed two-year-old spending 
limits, GOP leaders have made shielding Social Security a badge of 
honor during the runup to next year's congressional elections. If 
that promise holds up -- which many doubt -- it is unclear where the 
money needed for a bipartisan spending compromise would come from. 
</P>
<P>
	Compounding the problem is a sense among many nervous  
Republicans that Clinton bested them in the government shutdowns of 
1995 and 1996 and the budget-balancing and spending deals of 1997 
and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans have been through playing hardball and they got  
beat, and they've been through compromise and they got beat,'' said 
Dan Palazzolo, a University of Richmond political scientist. 
``There's a lot of ambiguity about what the proper step should 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven days into fiscal 2000, Clinton has signed just five of  
the 13 annual spending bills that pay for government operations. 
Three other fiscal 2000 measures -- covering defense, veterans, 
housing, science, agriculture and environment -- seem likely to be 
completed by Congress and signed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves five other bills.  
</P>
<P>
	To keep their price tags at levels Republicans want, GOP leaders  
are considering across-the-board cuts in all 13 bills ranging from 
$3 billion to $8 billion. Lacking support for other ideas, GOP 
leaders say such cuts are fair, but the administration calls the 
plan a meat-ax approach that would hurt needed programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has already vetoed the bill covering the District of  
Columbia. GOP leaders say they will remove some items Clinton has 
objected to, covering city council members' salaries and fees paid 
to lawyers suing the schools. But the bill still would prohibit the 
medical use of marijuana and needle distribution to drug addicts, 
and is likely to continue drawing administration objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other bills face veto threats:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $300 billion-plus measure covering the departments of Labor,  
Health and Human Services, and Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version is about the same size as Clinton's request,  
the House roughly $5 billion smaller. Both would cut the $1.4 
billion Clinton wants to continue his seven-year drive to hire 
100,000 extra elementary school teachers, and would give states 
more leeway in using the money. Congress also would provide less 
than Clinton wants for after-school programs, adult literacy, 
preventive health and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $35 billion bill for the departments of Commerce, Justice and  
State, $2 billion less than Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress would provide little of the $1.3 billion Clinton sought  
to help communities hire tens of thousands of police officers. 
Instead, the bill would shift resources to school safety and other 
programs. Lawmakers also would provide less than Clinton wants for 
the FBI, civil rights enforcement, high technology assistance to 
companies and back dues owed to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $14 billion measure for the Interior Department, $1 billion  
less than Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate would provide about one-third of the nearly  
$800 million Clinton wants to buy state and federal park lands 
under his ``lands legacy'' program. Clinton opposes Senate 
provisions that would prevent the government from increasing 
royalties paid by oil companies drilling on federal lands, and 
would ease restrictions on waste dumping by mining firms on public 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $12.7 billion foreign aid bill, $2 billion less than Clinton  
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide none of the $500 million Clinton  
requested for first payments for Israel and the Palestinians to 
carry out the peace accord negotiated last year at Wye River, Md. 
It also would provide less than he wanted for international debt 
relief, the Peace Corps and efforts to reduce the nuclear threat 
from North Korea and other countries.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Internet Auction Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Memorabilia from the Yankee Clipper -- a private  
man on and off the field -- soon may be only a mouse click away. 
</P>
<P>
	A Charlotte businessman who bought Joe DiMaggio's personal  
collection of signed baseballs, jerseys and other mementos of his 
legendary career, plans to auction thousands of the items on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	From autographed baseballs cards to bats, balls, uniforms and  
prints, Ralph Perullo will offer a portion of DiMaggio's personal 
collection for sale in an online auction on eBay Oct. 20-29. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being totally candid, I have no idea what to expect,'' said  
the lifelong New York Yankee fan who acquired the extensive 
collection in June. ``But I'm giving it my best shot. If you're 
ready to buy something from Joe DiMaggio's personal memorabilia, 
now is the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items to be sold include 361 signed baseballs, which  
equal the number of DiMaggio's career home runs. Some have his 
uniform No. 5 and others have the number 55, referring to his order 
of entrance into the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have put a dent in the collection,'' Perullo said in an  
interview last week. ``I've been holding back some items that have 
not been offered to the public before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the summer, Perullo purchased more than 10,000 signed items  
and more for a price he would only describe as being ``in the 
millions.'' DiMaggio died March 8 at age 84. The sale was finalized 
in June with Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio was an intelligent businessman along with being a  
great ballplayer,'' Perullo said at the time. ``When he would sign 
baseballs for a show, he always kept 50 or so for himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perullo, 58, still has trouble believing he owns the collection  
of one of the game's greatest players. He remembers going to Yankee 
Stadium with his father as a young child to watch DiMaggio play in 
the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided to go with eBay after meeting with several other  
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a strong participant with eBay because I'm a card  
collector,'' he said. ``I've purchased a lot through them and I've 
enjoyed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stevens, program manager at eBay, said his company was  
excited about the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Few sports celebrities reach the status of becoming an  
American icon like Joe DiMaggio,'' he said in a statement released 
by Perullo's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Perullo said he's anticipating good things in the wake of the  
recent auction of the Barry Halper Collection at Sotheby's Holdings 
Inc., that raised nearly $22 million. One of the biggest prices was 
the $239,000 paid by actor-comedian Billy Crystal for one of Mickey 
Mantle's gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	Halper, a New Jersey businessman and a part owner of the  
Yankees, has one of the most extensive collections of sports 
memorabilia. ``Barry Halper has raised the bar considerably,'' 
Perullo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perullo had a conversation with Halper when he attended the  
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry offered me some free advice, ``Don't fall in love with  
anything,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Perullo already was smitten with a signed bat with the No.  
56 -- commemorating DiMaggio's 1941 hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's one item I would keep, that would be it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Corruption Probe Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's top legal officer dropped  
a corruption investigation against ex-President Suharto today, a 
move that raised fears of renewed student protests just nine days 
before a new head of state is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismudjoko, Indonesia's acting attorney general, said his  
investigation uncovered some irregularities but not enough evidence 
to show that Suharto had violated the law to enriched himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not sufficient evidence to continue the  
investigation,'' Ismudjoko, who like many Indonesians uses only one 
name, said after presenting his report to President B.J. Habibie, 
Suharto's hand-picked successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie promised to crack down on corruption after he took power  
16 months ago. He repeatedly denied accusations that he would 
protect his old boss, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for 32 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to let Suharto off the hook could damage Habibie's  
already dim chances of staying in power on Oct. 20, when the 
700-member People's Consultative Assembly chooses the next leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie did not immediately comment on the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Many assembly members have demanded that the government  
prosecute Suharto, who was forced to quit in May 1998 after a wave 
of student protests and bloody riots. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, students have regularly clashed with security  
forces. They have demanded that Suharto be tried, and they have 
rejected the attorney general's investigation as a whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Habibie's Golkar Party is to announce whether it  
will continue to back him as its sole candidate for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politically, this is a major factor. It could damage Habibie's  
candidacy,'' said Marzuki Darusman, who heads an anti-Habibie 
faction within Golkar. 
</P>
<P>
	Reformers condemned the decision and warned that the world's  
fourth most populous nation should brace itself for more trouble on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are going to be angry that Suharto has been let  
off,'' said Hendardi, who heads the Indonesian Legal Aid 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected this. No one in this country is brave enough to  
put Suharto on trial,'' said Tenten Masduki, of Indonesian 
Corruption Watch, an anti-graft group. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto, 78, has been accused of siphoning millions of dollars  
of public funds through charity foundations during his autocratic 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president, who was recently treated in a Jakarta  
hospital after suffering a stroke, has denied any wrongdoing. He 
also rejected accusations that his family has stashed away a 
fortune in foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew all along this case would be dropped,'' said Danny  
Kailimang, a member of Suharto's legal team. ``We respect the 
attorney general's office for making a professional decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Suharto children remain under separate investigations  
for corruption, and his youngest son, Tommy, is currently on trial 
over a multimillion dollar land deal. A verdict is expected as 
early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismudjoko said he had investigated the finances of seven  
foundations headed by Suharto, but focused on the two largest, 
Supersemar and Dahmais. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation focused on a scheme set up by Suharto under  
which his foundations received regular, legally required, donations 
from state institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found that the foundations had lent the funds to  
various commercial corporations. Although irregular, such 
transactions were not illegal because their profits ultimately were 
returned to the foundations and used for charitable work, Ismudjoko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law says that as long as the profit is used for social  
interests, it is not wrong for the foundation to lend it to 
commercial interests,'' Ismudjoko said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not specify what commercial interests had borrowed the  
money. However, opponents of Suharto claim the funds were milked as 
an easy source of credit to fuel the business empires of his six 
superrich children. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismudjoko said the case against Suharto could be reopened if new  
evidence of corruption was unearthed.

<HEADLINE> Two N.C. Schools Rely on Trailers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Students at two elementary schools ruined  
by Hurricane Floyd's floodwaters returned to school today for the 
first time in more than three weeks, stepping into trailers that 
will be their classrooms for at least the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	About 700 students from Pattillo A+ Elementary School and  
Princeville Montessori School, a magnet school, were hugged by 
teachers and then escorted into dozens of trailers at two sites in 
this flood-ravaged community on the Tar River. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's ready,'' said Susie Morris, grandmother of kindergarten  
student Montrizes Morris, as she walked the boy to a temporary 
classroom for Princeville Montessori students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's his first time going to school. I guess it's like  
starting over,'' she said as she watched the students, many in rain 
slickers because of threatening skies, carry their lunch bags and 
backpacks into their new classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	At the new Pattillo site, next to Martin Middle School, a sign  
on the chain-link fence read, ``Pattillo A+ Elementary School, 
Learning for All ... Whatever It Takes!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, which drenched eastern North Carolina in 20 inches of  
rain Sept. 16 and killed at least 49 people, caused the Tar River 
in Tarboro to rise 24 feet above flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
	It inundated the entire community of Princeville, a town of  
1,900 founded by ex-slaves after the Civil War, and submerged much 
of Tarboro as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of Edgecombe County's 8,000 students returned to school  
Oct. 4, but more time was needed to set up the mobile homes as 
classrooms for the two uninhabitable schools, county schools 
spokeswoman Diane LeFiles said. She said the county eventually 
plans to use 60 mobile classrooms, each costing $5,000 to set up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to have the children back in permanent schools by  
next fall,'' LeFiles said, but added that it could be longer.	   Bill Alexander, the cultural arts teacher at Princeville, today 
stood beside a bright-pink sign, helping direct traffic and showing 
parents where to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big day,'' Alexander said. ``I'm glad to get things  
back to a routine. I think it will be a good thing for the 
community to get all the schools back again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Pattillo, teachers in purple knit shirts greeted the fourth-  
and fifth-graders with hugs and led them into the Martin school's 
auditorium for an orientation. Later, they planned to walk them 
across the street to their new classrooms.

<HEADLINE> TV Stations Begin Y2K Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Southern Company, which provides  
electricity to 3.8 million customers in the southern United States, 
was blindsided recently by an unexpected Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The company conducted a dry run of its computer systems last  
month to predict if any glitches would pop up when the clock turns 
to the year 2000, and alerted the media to its plans. As luck would 
have it, the test coincided with thunderstorms that swept through 
the Atlanta area, knocking out power to thousands of Southern's 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fair enough. Storms happen, and Southern dispatched crews to  
repair its lines. What utility executives didn't expect was to hear 
television reporters wrongly claim the power outages were the 
result of Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern now lives in fear of a different kind of damage to the  
company's reputation if there's a bad storm on Dec. 31, spokeswoman 
Laura Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With some portion of the media, there's a tendency to hype  
things up, to sensationalize them,'' she said, ``and we perceive 
that could be a problem. It's the great unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gillig told her story at a workshop sponsored by the Radio and  
Television News Directors Association in Charlotte, where Y2K 
experts advised local electronic reporters how to cover the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The session made a couple of things clear: It's never too early  
-- and is quickly becoming too late -- to plan coverage effectively. 
And there's no end to the story angles, and the potential pitfalls 
for incautious journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Alloway, director of the National Leadership Task Force  
on Y2K, and author Peter de Jager, whose Web site tracks 
millennium-related bugs, said most problems have been spotted and 
corrected already. About 95 percent of the computer systems won't 
fail at all, Alloway said. But that still leaves plenty of 
potential glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is not stopping on January 1st,'' he said. ``It is  
slowing down a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on what utilities are reporting, Alloway foresees no major  
Y2K-related power outages. Problems are much more likely to appear 
in municipal water systems, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	If they haven't already, journalists should be questioning  
companies throughout their regions about their Y2K preparedness -- 
utilities, transportation authorities, banks, supermarkets, small 
businesses like dry cleaners. Reporters should compile phone lists 
of where company representatives will be on New Year's Eve so they 
can be easily reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your electric utilities are probably going to be fine, but  
have you made the call?'' asked David Bernknopf, director of news 
planning at CNN. ``And have you gotten beyond the answer, `we think 
we have everything under control?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters need to be able to recognize ahead of time which  
problems are Y2K-related and which aren't, like Southern's 
storm-damaged power lines. For example, up to 5 percent of 
automatic teller machines aren't working at any given time, de 
Jager said. Will a live camera crew be standing beside one of them 
and blame a Y2K bug when money doesn't come out on Jan. 1? 
</P>
<P>
	``In about five seconds of reporting, you can precipitate a bank  
run -- unless you do it right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian computer expert plans to spend much of New Year's  
Eve and Day in an airplane, flying from Toronto to London and back, 
partly to show his confidence that air travel will be safe from Y2K 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismissing survivalists as nuts, De Jager said reporters  
shouldn't waste time covering people who are stocking up in 
anticipation of disaster. CNN's Bernknopf, though, said it's 
important to follow the human response to the situation; he's more 
worried about people predicting the end of the world and then 
turning to terrorism to fulfill their own prophecies. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing before a room of reporters, de Jager was contemptuous  
of the profession. He said he expects the media to make Y2K worse 
than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you want to show restraint,'' he lectured, ``you're  
incapable of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a reporter from the Seattle area told how information  
problems go both ways. Steve Krueger of KPLU said he was stunned 
when a half-dozen companies he surveyed flatly refused to reveal 
anything they were doing about Y2K, or even confirm that they were 
conducting tests. The prominent exception was the airplane maker 
Boeing, which replied in meticulous detail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was a public relations man, I would want to tell the  
world that we're on top of this,'' Krueger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The experts urged reporters to keep trying, and even publicly  
embarrass authorities who are keeping silent. ``People are 
surprisingly cooperative on this because they don't want a panic,'' 
Bernknopf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many television and radio stations already have emergency  
staffing plans in place, preparing to have reporters ready 
round-the-clock on New Year's weekend. The experts warned stations 
not to exhaust their staff, because many Y2K problems won't become 
evident until many businesses go back to work on Monday, Jan. 3 and 
for weeks and months to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an event that is going to continue like bad chili for  
a long time,'' de Jager said.

<HEADLINE> Boston's Martinez OK'd To Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pedro Martinez wasn't excused from sick bay  
until he had thrown a dozen warmup pitches. By the third, though, 
he removed any doubt that he would be available Monday night for 
Game 5 against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ouch!'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said as the ball popped  
into his catcher's mitt. 
</P>
<P>
	After just one minute of catch in right field before the final  
game of Boston's first-round playoff series against Cleveland, the 
Red Sox ace was declared ready for action -- if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a steady progression of feeling better the last three  
days. So that's a good sign,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams said. 
``I really think he can pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was the best pitcher in baseball this season, leading  
the major leagues with a 23-4 record and 2.07 ERA while striking 
out a career-high 313 batters. But he left Game 1 after four 
innings because of a strained muscle under his right shoulder 
blade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox lost the first two games of the series, extending  
their postseason futility streak to 18 losses in 19 games. So when 
Martinez could barely pick up a ball when he tested his shoulder 
before Game 3, it didn't seem to matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Boston winning Saturday and Sunday to even the  
best-of-5 series, Martinez' condition became an issue again. And 
though Bret Saberhagen was the Red Sox starter Monday night, the 
prospect of Martinez coming out of the bullpen energized his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's near 100 percent, obviously it would be a tremendous  
boost,'' reliever Derek Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	An even bigger boost would be Martinez pitching Game 1 of the  
American League championship series against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best-case scenario would be that we win today without  
Pedro,'' Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said before the game. 
``We'll utilize common sense. But it's time to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was made after Martinez played catch for a few  
minutes with Kerrigan before the game. Wearing a practice jersey 
with the sleeves cut, Martinez threw 12 pitches, gradually moving 
farther away from his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the ballpark was not yet open to fans, a worker at  
Jacobs Field yelled out, ``Go, Pedro!'' -- getting a smile and a 
wave in response. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martinez' biggest smile came when he was done throwing, and  
Kerrigan game him a secretive thumbs-up. Heading back to the 
dugout, Martinez crossed paths with bullpen coach John Cumberland. 
</P>
<P>
	``How is it?'' Cumberland asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in,'' he said, giving the bullpen coach a high five.  
</P>
<P>
	Indians manager Mike Hargrove said he was trying not to be  
distracted by the developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go out and beat the Red Sox, no matter who's  
pitching,'' he said. ``If Pedro is pitching, if he's healthy, 
that's a whole different story. But we still have to beat the Red 
Sox.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Output Limits Said Weakening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Iran, Iraq and several other OPEC members boosted  
their crude oil output in September, increasing global supplies at 
a time when wealthy nations are consuming less oil than expected, 
according to a respected survey released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, possible signs of a softer market -- and cheaper  
petroleum prices -- are being offset by an anticipated strong growth 
in demand for heating oil this winter, the International Energy 
Agency disclosed in a monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was compiled before last week's sharp reversal in  
world oil prices, when profit-taking and fears of weakening OPEC 
resolve to keep oil production under control triggered a 16 percent 
plunge in prices for crude contracts for future delivery on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	David Knapp, the economist who edited the survey, said the  
sudden drop in prices did not change the agency's conclusions that 
the markets are still strong. Speaking by phone from his Paris 
headquarters, he predicted that global markets would remain firm on 
the back of an expected 3 percent rise in fourth-quarter demand to 
77.2 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA is part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  
Development, a group of the world's most developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Knapp said the biggest surprise in the report was that oil  
inventories in industrialized countries actually increased from 
June to September. Iran led the increase in production, pumping an 
additional 190,000 barrels of oil per day, while Iraq boosted 
output by 60,000 barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts challenged the IEA's data, however,  
calling it puzzling and inconsistent. Peter Hitchens of London 
brokerage Williams De Broe said the IEA's finding on oil 
inventories was a ``glaring error,'' and he noted alternative 
surveys that showed decreases in oil stockpiles in the United 
States, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But these analysts concurred with the IEA's basic conclusion  
that the market was still firm despite the recent drop in crude 
prices and a lower level of compliance with OPEC output quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices peaked last week in New York at a 33-month high of  
$25.12 per barrel, but had tumbled to $20.90 by late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, November contracts for U.S. benchmark West Texas  
Intermediate were trading slightly lower Monday at $20.85 per 
barrel. In London, November contracts for North Sea Brent were 
trading late Monday at $20.47 per barrel, down 23 cents per barrel 
from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Mark Redway blamed the price reversal on speculators who  
had bet that OPEC would stick to its quotas. When market sentiment 
changed, they panicked and closed out their long positions, causing 
a sharp retreat in prices, said Redway of London-based brokerage 
Greig Middleton and Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's price volatility was a ``blip,'' said Peter Gignoux,  
who manages the petroleum desk in London at U.S. investment bank 
Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is OPEC falling apart at the seams? No. Have they lost the  
will to make the production cuts stick? No,'' Gignoux said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price of crude had built up such a head of steam that if  
it didn't have a pause, the price would have been shooting toward 
$30 a barrel now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. gas prices, which have on the rise for the past six months,  
enjoyed at least a temporary reprieve as a result of the cheaper 
crude, said Trilby Lundberg, director of the Lundberg survey of 
10,000 gasoline stations across the United States. The weighted 
average nationwide on Friday was $1.3288, down .53 cents per gallon 
from a Sept. 24 survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA reported that OPEC was 86 percent compliant with the  
production cuts agreed that its members agreed to in March and 
reconfirmed in September. OPEC's compliance rate for August was 94 
percent, revised upward from 92 percent, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Given OPEC's record of cheating on quotas, analysts agreed that  
the group's compliance rate was still good even at its reduced 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	In total, OPEC produced 26.43 million barrels a day last month,  
up 420,000 barrels from August, the IEA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the recent higher prices, everyone tries to sneak in a  
few more barrels,'' said Hitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet last week's plunge in prices could work to the advantage of  
OPEC and other oil producers, by highlighting the fragility of the 
market and providing an incentive for renewed discipline, he added.

<HEADLINE> Man Falls Overboard in L. Superior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE HARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- A man was being treated for  
hypothermia after falling overboard from a freighter and swimming 
about 4 1/2 miles to shore in the chilly waters of Lake Superior. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon arriving on shore early Monday, he fell asleep for a while  
and then knocked on a nearby door for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Richards, 28, of Willoughby Hills, Ohio, was in fair and  
stable condition Monday night, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 8 p.m. Sunday, Richards slipped under a fence while he  
was trying to tighten some loose barrels on the 698-foot S.S. 
Buckeye, an iron ore freighter that was headed to Silver Bay 
Harbor, Minn. He fell about 30 to 50 feet in the 46-degree water, 
which had waves estimated at 6 to 8 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given last night's conditions (Richards) overcame amazing  
odds,'' Mark Dobson, Coast Guard operations duty officer, told The 
Mining Journal of Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew members last saw him on the ship near Copper Harbor, Mich.  
Ninety miles later, they noticed he was gone when he did not report 
for watch, the Coast Guard said. They called the Coast Guard just 
before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter and two rescue boats were sent to look for  
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
	But he had decided to swim to shore when he realized no one had  
seen him fall. He was not wearing a life jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	When he reached land in Eagle Harbor, he fell asleep for an  
undetermined amount of time, officials said. Richards reached a 
nearby home at about 3:40 a.m., and the resident called the 
sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards was sitting on the man's front steps slumped against  
the railing when Sheriff's Deputy William Luokkanen arrived. 
Richards was alert enough to answer questions, but was ``in and 
out'' of shock, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was able to give me his name, the name of the ship and what  
had happened at what time,'' said Luokkanen, who took Richards to 
the hospital. ``This is a story to tell the grandkids about.''

<HEADLINE> 2nd Trial To Begin in Gay Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A year after the beating death of Matthew  
Shepard, the man accused of instigating the attack chatted quietly 
with his attorneys today as jury selection got under way in his 
death-penalty trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron McKinney smiled occasionally and briefly looked at his  
notes as prosecutor Cal Rerucha outlined how a jury will be chosen. 
Rerucha reminded prospective jurors they must set aside passion and 
treat both sides fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's father, William McKinney, along with three other  
family members or friends sat behind the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, a gay college student, died a year ago Tuesday after a  
beating that sparked national outrage. As McKinney's trial got 
under way, small groups of anti-gay protesters and people dressed 
as angels demonstrated outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing golden halos and costumes made of white bedsheets, the  
17 angels stood silently in a street near the courthouse. 
Representing Angel Action, Romaine Patterson, 21, of State College, 
Pa., said her colleagues wanted to send a message of love. 
</P>
<P>
	They faced a half dozen protesters from Kansas who waved signs  
with anti-gay slogans. The Rev. Fred Phelps, 69, of Topeka, Kan., 
said his followers wanted ``to insert a little sanity and truth 
into this mad orgy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At midmorning, eight prospective jurors had been dismissed for  
reasons such as military duty, medical problems or job issues. That 
left 51 prospects in today's pool. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 22, is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and aggravated robbery. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	His alleged co-conspirator, Russell Henderson, 22, received two  
life sentences after pleading guilty in April to felony murder and 
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, was lured from a bar on Oct. 7, 1998, driven to a  
remote prairie, tied to a fence, pistol-whipped into 
unconsciousness and left to die on the freezing plains. He died 
five days later in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, who has said he had no idea Shepard was gay and does  
not hate homosexuals, has pleaded innocent. His trial date 
coincided with several memorials commemorating the first 
anniversary of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	A candlelight vigil Sunday night at the University of Wyoming  
attracted 600 people, including Shepard's parents, Judy and Dennis 
Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We on this campus, in Laramie and in Wyoming, are people of  
peace, of inclusiveness,'' the Rev. Roger Schmit, of St. Paul's 
Newman Center, told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	University President Philip L. Dubois asked each person to light  
a candle that will generate ``a tiny bit of energy along the road 
to a world that rejects prejudice, stereotypes, hatred and 
violence, but their combined force will light a highway of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many signed a ``pledge of nonviolence'' written on 8-foot-tall  
placards, then carried candles into an auditorium where folksingers 
Peter, Paul and Mary dedicated a concert to Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldout crowd of 2,000 gave Peter Yarrow a standing ovation  
after a song he performed solo with the lyrics: ``Show me the gay 
man, hated and scorned, who was killed just for being the way he 
was born.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yarrow wrote the lyrics after visiting the site where Shepard  
was tied up and beaten. ``My heart broke,'' he said of seeing the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson has been subpoenaed by McKinney's lawyers to testify.  
The defense witness list also includes Henderson's girlfriend, 
Chasity Pasley, 21, and McKinney's girlfriend, Kristen Price, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pasley received up to two years in prison after pleading  
guilty to being an accessory to first-degree murder for helping to 
hide Henderson's bloody clothes. Ms. Price's trial on accessory 
charges was to begin Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Because prosecutors believe McKinney was the main instigator, he  
likely won't be offered a plea agreement, said Denver-based legal 
analyst Andrew Cohen, who has followed the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Rerucha has subpoenaed Judy Shepard in an attempt ``to humanize  
the victim, to put a face on the name Matthew Shepard,'' said 
Cheyenne prosecutor Jon Forwood, who is not involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite common to use a parent to say, `This is the life  
we're talking about,''' Forwood said.

<HEADLINE> Motorcycle Racing Champion Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENTON, Ohio (AP) -- A motorcycle racing champion and his wife  
were found shot to death in their home, and police are 
investigating it as a double homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the bodies of Scott Grigaliunas, 39, and Becky  
Grigaliunas, 42, in their living room Friday. A family friend had 
called police after Mrs. Grigaliunas didn't show up for work. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no motive or suspects in the slayings, Chief John  
Vermillion said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grigaliunas was a four-time national champion in International  
Drag Bike Association events. In the sport, two bikers race 
side-by-side down a quarter-mile straightaway at up to 200 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Grigaliunas was the first drag bike racer to attract Honda Motor  
Co. as a sponsor. He was also twice voted rider of the year by the 
association's 1,500 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was probably the most well-respected sportsman rider in our  
membership, in that he was not only a successful racer, but he was 
an advocate for our sport,'' Leigh Ann Min, the association 
president, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grigaliunas won a double championship last month at the IDBA  
All-Motorcycle Weekend at Red River Raceway in Shreveport, La.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Veto 4 Spending Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As this year's budget battle nears a climax,  
President Clinton is threatening to veto four spending bills. He 
and Congress are at odds over such issues as hiring teachers and 
police officers and regulating oil and gas companies that use 
federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides are separated by about $10 billion to $20 billion  
-- about the same magnitude as most end-of-session spending fights 
since Republicans took over Congress in 1995. Though substantial, 
the funds at stake amount to about 1 percent of the near $1.8 
trillion federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's tussle, however, is complicated by the GOP's stated  
refusal to pay for extra spending from the Social Security surplus. 
For decades, both parties have used that till to find needed 
billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Having lost their coveted tax cut to a Clinton veto, GOP leaders  
want to cast themselves as defenders of the huge pension system -- 
and are daring the president to do otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please work with us to guarantee the retirement security of  
our seniors and the quality of life of Americans before we give 
even more money to other nations,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., and other GOP leaders said after Clinton threatened to veto 
a foreign aid bill he said was too small. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to be seen as the champion of education and other  
popular programs, and has begun tweaking Congress for not doing its 
work. Eleven days into fiscal 2000, he has signed just five of the 
new year's 13 spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're still drawing a paycheck up there,'' he said last  
week. ``And it's a little larger than it was before a bill that I 
signed. And I don't think they ought to make themselves into a 
lame-duck Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to a measure that gave members of Congress a 4.6  
percent pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Three fiscal 2000 measures -- covering defense, veterans,  
housing, science, agriculture, and environment-- seem likely to be 
completed by Congress and signed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves five other bills as the remaining battleground.  
</P>
<P>
	To pay for them, GOP leaders are considering across-the-board  
spending cuts ranging from $3 billion to $8 billion. Lacking 
support for other ideas, GOP leaders say such cuts are fair, but 
the administration opposes the plan as a meat-ax approach that will 
hurt needed programs. 
</P>
<P>
	One remaining bill, covering the District of Columbia, has  
already been vetoed. GOP leaders say they will remove some items 
Clinton has objected to covering city council members' salaries and 
fees paid to lawyers suing the schools. But the bill would still 
prohibit the medical use of marijuana and needle distribution to 
drug addicts, and is likely to continue drawing administration 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other bills face veto threats:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $300 billion-plus measure covering the departments of Labor,  
Health and Human Services, and Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version is about the same size as Clinton's request,  
the House is roughly $5 billion smaller. Both would provide less 
than the $1.4 billion Clinton wants to continue his seven-year 
drive to hire 100,000 extra elementary school teachers, and would 
give states more leeway in using the money. Congress also would 
provide less than Clinton wants for after-school programs, adult 
literacy, preventive health and other social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $35 billion bill for the departments of Commerce, Justice and  
State, $2 billion less than Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress would provide little of the $1.3 billion Clinton sought  
to help communities hire tens of thousands of police officers. 
Instead, they would shift resources to school safety and other 
programs. Lawmakers also would provide less than Clinton wants for 
the FBI, civil rights enforcement, high technology assistance to 
companies and unpaid United Nations dues. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $14 billion measure for the Interior Department, $1 billion  
less than Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate would provide about one-third of the near  
$800 million Clinton wants to buy state and federal park lands 
under his ``lands legacy'' program. Clinton opposes Senate 
provisions that would prevent the government from increasing 
royalties paid by oil companies drilling on federal lands, and 
would ease restrictions on waste dumping by mining firms on public 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $12.7 billion foreign aid bill, $2 billion less than Clinton  
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide none of the $500 million Clinton  
requested for first payments under the Wye River accord between 
Israel and the Palestinians. It also would provide less than he 
wanted for international debt relief, the Peace Corps and efforts 
to reduce the nuclear threat from North Korea and other countries.

<HEADLINE> Walks to Garciaparra Set Up Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians feared Nomar Garciaparra  
so much they walked him intentionally twice. They should have 
worried about Troy O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary hit a grand slam and a three-run homer on the first  
pitch after each of those walks Monday night as Boston beat 
Cleveland 12-8 to cap its amazing comeback after losing the first 
two games of the best-of-5 division series. Entering Game 5, 
O'Leary was 2-for-16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox move on to the AL Championship Series against the  
New York Yankees starting Wednesday night in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary's second homer broke an 8-8 tie in the seventh and put  
the Red Sox ahead 11-8. The first had put Boston in front 7-5 in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
	It was understandable for the Indians to risk pitching to  
O'Leary. He hit .280 with 28 homers, but for the second straight 
season he tailed off sharply down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he went 0-for-5 Sunday night when Boston pounded out 24  
hits in a 23-7 win at Fenway Park that tied the series. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the midst of his second straight horrid division  
series. The left fielder was just 1-for-16 last year as Cleveland 
beat Boston 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The first inning gave the Indians even more reason to pitch to  
O'Leary rather than Garciaparra. The AL batting champion had given 
Boston a 2-0 lead with a homer, but O'Leary ended the inning by 
striking out. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third, after Brian Daubach's double put runners at second  
and third with one out, Indians manager Mike Hargrove had Charles 
Nagy walk Garciaparra. O'Leary then hit Nagy's next pitch 417 feet 
into the right-center field stands for Boston's first postseason 
grand slam in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	The score was tied 8-8 when Hargrove faced a similar decision in  
the seventh. And, despite O'Leary's grand slam, the manager still 
wanted no part of Garciaparra. 
</P>
<P>
	So after John Valentin walked and moved to second on Daubach's  
grounder to second baseman Roberto Alomar, Paul Shuey deliberately 
threw four balls to Garciaparra. 
</P>
<P>
	Up came O'Leary and out went the ball. It flew into the right  
field seats for the winning homer. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary's next at-bat was in the ninth after doubles by Daubach  
and Garciaparra produced the 12th run. Hargrove gave the order: 
walk O'Leary intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, it was too late.

<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- E. William Crotty, a major Democratic  
fund-raiser who became U.S. Ambassador to the Eastern Caribbean 
last year, has died of pneumonia. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Crotty died Sunday at a Gainesville hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	Crotty, a longtime Daytona Beach attorney and civic activist,  
was ambassador to seven nations -- Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, 
Dominica, St. Lucia, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent 
and The Grenadines. He was appointed to the post in November and 
was based in Barbados. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Security Guard Kills 3 Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A man killed three upstairs neighbors  
before taking his own life, leaving a wounded 2-year-old girl 
sitting in her highchair amid the bloodbath. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorenzo ``Sol'' Silva, a 63-year-old security guard, had been  
friendly with the young family who lived on the second floor of the 
two-story home he shared with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	But Silvestre Silva said his brother had mental problems that  
had worsened recently. He said his brother had ``flipped out'' when 
doctors recently diagnosed him with pancreatic cancer, said family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva had been taking antidepressants, to which he had an  
adverse reaction in the last two weeks, sometimes becoming 
paranoid, said family members. They had urged him to see a priest 
or return to his native Philippines to meet with a faith healer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, Silva couldn't sleep unless he was in the same room as  
their mother, and had a light on, his brother said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had been nervous for years,'' Silva said. ``I saw him last  
week -- he looked like he wanted to grab you. It was like he was 
drowning. He looked like he was seeing a ghost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not know what prompted the shooting.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said Silva finished the graveyard shift at the San  
Francisco airport and came home early Sunday. About 1:30 p.m., he 
marched upstairs with a handgun -- one of the half a dozen guns he 
kept in his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	He fatally shot Noel Ridual, his wife, Josephine, both 28, and a  
friend who lived with the couple, Ola Marquisias, 32. The Riduals' 
daughter, Jessica, was wounded in the shoulder and was in fair 
condition Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Downstairs, members of the Silva family heard the gunshots and  
went upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the four bodies and the baby crying'' in her highchair,  
said Silva's brother-in-law, Buen Liriors. ``There was blood all 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silvestre Silva said: ``I cannot believe he would do this. He's  
not aggressive. The people upstairs were his friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ridual, a math teacher, and Ms. Marquisias, a special  
education teacher, came to the United States from the Philippines 
through a program that brings foreign educators into San Francisco 
classrooms for five-year stints. This summer, Ridual brought his 
wife and daughter over. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members said Lorenzo Silva had been separated from his  
wife of 35 years for some time, and last year she returned to the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva had worked at the airport for 20 years. Airport officials  
did not return calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Marquisias ``was such a superb educator and human being. She  
had a smile that could light up a room,'' said Elaine Koury, school 
district spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bradley Closing on Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The race for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, which has grown close in early primary states like New 
Hampshire and New York, now is growing tighter nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bill Bradley is closing the gap on the Democratic  
front-runner, Vice President Al Gore, both remain behind George W. 
Bush, the leader among Republican presidential candidates, in a 
CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore had the support of 51 percent while Bradley, a former  
senator from New Jersey, had 39 percent among people likely to vote 
in a Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll taken a few weeks ago, in  
mid-September, showed Gore with 63 percent and Bradley with 30 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new poll, Gore and Bradley were in a statistical dead  
heat among male voters, but Gore led among women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore campaign expressed confidence that the vice president's  
campaign efforts are connecting with voters around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere Al Gore travels, grassroots voters are tuning to  
his campaign and his message and time will show the strength of his 
effort across the country,'' said Gore campaign spokeswoman Kiki 
Moore. Gore got good news Monday when there were growing signs that 
the AFL-CIO will back his candidacy with a critical labor 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley aides pointed to the latest poll numbers as a sign  
that Gore's aggressive new tactics, including direct attacks on 
Bradley, aren't working. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said: ``The public has been pretty  
clear that they want politics to be upright and positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contest between Bradley and Gore also has tightened in key  
states. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate New Hampshire polls released last week, Bradley, a  
former senator from New Jersey, had a slight edge over Gore in one 
survey and the two were in a statistical dead heat the other. They 
also were in a virtual tie in a New York survey last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, more than half the Bradley supporters in the  
CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll said it was at least fairly important 
that Bradley has fewer ties to President Clinton than Gore. But 
most of those planning to vote Democratic found Bradley and Gore 
acceptable as nominees for their party. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton had a job approval rating of 56 percent, but  
almost two-thirds said they don't approve of him as a person. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll indicated that just over a third approve of the job  
done by Republicans in Congress. More people, 50 percent, think 
Bush should have more influence over the direction of the GOP in 
the next year than congressional Republicans, 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Either Democratic candidate faces a formidable task running  
against Bush, the governor of Texas and GOP front-runner by a huge 
margin in the latest poll. Bush was at 60 percent among the 
Republican candidates among people likely to vote in a GOP primary. 
Former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole was at 11 percent and 
Arizona Sen. John McCain was at 8 percent. The remaining five 
Republican candidates were in the low single-digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has a 16-point lead over Gore and a 12-point lead over  
Bradley in head-to-head matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore and Bradley both had favorable ratings in the low  
50s, Bush had a favorable rating of 70 percent in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 976 adults nationwide was taken Oct. 8-10  
and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The 
error margin on the primary matchups was plus or minus 5 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Fraud Causes Higher Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Consumers are paying higher prices for mortgages  
because of fraudulent mortgage loans -- an estimated $60 
billion-per-year industry, one expert said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty percent of all mortgage loans are based on false  
information and 15 percent to 20 percent of loans would never be 
made if lenders knew all the facts, said Richard D. Ward, president 
of the Los Angeles-based Affinity Corp., and a former police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's consumers who pay the price, through higher loan costs,  
lending fees and interest rates, Ward said at the annual convention 
of the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI statistics show that $1.7 trillion in residential mortgage  
loans or refinancing packages were issued in 1998, said Roger A. 
Jackson, Affinity's chief financial officer. Of that total, about 
$60 billion was fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most common forms of fraud is ``property flipping,''  
where a property is bought and then resold -- or ``flipped'' -- 
several times, each time at a falsely inflated higher price, among 
a single group of people. 
</P>
<P>
	The property is then sold to an unsuspecting mortgage company  
that, seeing the previous purchase and sale prices, pays much more 
for the property than its market value. 
</P>
<P>
	When the company tries to resell the property, it loses tens of  
thousands of dollars. Often, the property sellers can't be tracked 
down because they've left town or used fake names to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schemes might be simpler: by creating false identities  
with stolen Social Security numbers, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Chartier, a private investigator from Whittier, Calif. who  
specializes in mortgage loan fraud, said it's not uncommon for 
people to use the Social Security numbers of dead people to take 
out fraudulent mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Others -- sometimes people in the mortgage industry -- simply use  
a randomly chosen Social Security number, or steal a number from 
old files or loan applications, Chartier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ease with which computer users can create bank statements,  
verifications of employment, W-2 tax forms and other documents 
needed for mortgage applications is also contributing to fraudulent 
activities, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	As housing markets tighten around the country and prices go up,  
it's more likely that borrowers will fudge the facts, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the property value's increasing, what does a borrower have  
to do to qualify for that house?'' he said. ``He may have to do a 
false tax return to increase his income, or he may have to inflate 
his assets.''

<HEADLINE> N.C. Schools Rely on Trailers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- More than 600 children filed into  
classrooms assembled out of trailers Monday, more than three weeks 
after Hurricane Floyd's floodwaters engulfed their schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngsters were greeted with hugs and stuffed animals.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's so good to hear the children laughing again,'' Edgecombe  
County schools spokeswoman Diane LeFiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children hadn't set foot in a classroom since Sept. 15, the  
day before Floyd swamped North Carolina with more than 20 inches of 
rain. The floodwaters swallowed farms and towns and killed at least 
49 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 other Edgecombe County schools opened last week, but the  
Princeville Montessori School and the Pattillo A+ Elementary School 
were so heavily damaged that dozens of trailers had to be brought 
in to serve as classrooms for at least the rest of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials have yet to determine whether the two buildings  
can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	``My children were so excited that they couldn't sleep last  
night,'' said Janice Davidson, whose twin 8-year-olds attend 
Princeville Montessori. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Odom, Princeville Montessori's principal, said a crisis  
team was on hand for the youngsters but didn't appear needed. 
``They're young, and they just bounce right back. They were ready 
to get back,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the students at Odom's school are from Princeville, a  
town of 1,900 founded by former slaves. Princeville was inundated 
by the Tar River, and it will probably be next year before 
residents can return home. Many are staying with friends and 
relatives; a few remain in a shelter at a high school. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pattillo, a donated stuffed animal sat on the desk of each  
student. Later in the day, Kathy Valadja of Pittsburgh and her two 
sons brought 930 stuffed animals to Princeville Montessori. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 10-year-old son Alex came up with the idea. He and his  
friends collected the animals and raised more than $1,000 for Floyd 
victims.

<HEADLINE> Nets' Cage Deciding Whether To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Veteran forward Michael Cage is  
going to get another week to decide whether he wants to play for 
the New Jersey Nets this season, general manager John Nash said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash said the reason Cage left training camp last Monday was  
because he wasn't sure whether he wanted to go through another NBA 
season being away from his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Cage has three children.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's not sure whether he wants to call it a career, either,''  
Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cage did not play last season after being waived by Seattle. The  
14-year veteran played in 79 games with New Jersey in 1997-98, 
averaging 1.3 points and 3.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded to Seattle on Jan. 21 in a deal that brought Jim  
McIlvaine to New Jersey. He was signed by the Nets as a free agent 
on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Cage was the 14th overall pick in the 1984 draft by the Los  
Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine had to leave Monday's practice after developing a  
rapid heartbeat 30 minutes into the workout. He was examined by 
team doctors and later returned to the Nets' practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine said he has had previous episodes with a rapid  
heartbeat in college and while he played for Washington of the NBA. 
He expects to play Tuesday night when the Nets face the Atlanta 
Hawks in an exhibition game at Albany, N.Y.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Phoenix Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick was  
suspended for five games by the NHL on Monday for an altercation 
involving a stick last week against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix's 3-3 tie at Chicago on Oct. 8, Roenick received a  
match penalty for slashing Blackhawks right wing Tony Amonte at 
2:25 of the third period. Amonte was struck in the face by 
Roenick's stick, and needed stitches to close the wound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Roenick was reckless with a swing of stick, and an  
opponent was injured by this dangerous play,'' NHL executive vice 
president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell said 
Monday. ``As always, players are accountable for the consequences 
of actions with their sticks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix general manager Bobby Smith disagreed with the severity  
of the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeremy was guilty of a high-sticking infraction, there's no  
argument there,'' Smith said. ``My disagreement with Colin Campbell 
is his feeling it was reckless. I thought it was careless. Most 
general managers think suspensions against their players are too 
harsh. This was harsh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick already served one game of the suspension Sunday while  
awaiting the hearing with Campbell. He is eligible to return on 
Oct. 23 when the Coyotes play Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't be overly concerned with J.R. being out of the  
lineup,'' Coyotes coach Bob Francis said following a 2-2 tie at 
Buffalo on Monday night. ``We'd like to have him but, we can't use 
it as an excuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the league's collective bargaining agreement and his  
contract, Roenick will forfeit $104,166.67 of his salary during the 
suspension.

<HEADLINE> Black Bears Return to Big Bend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG BEND NATIONAL PARK, Texas (AP) -- The yellow, diamond-shaped  
signs posted along the twisting road leading up to the Chisos 
Mountains serve as a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	But the blackened image in the middle is not of a deer, nor of  
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a bear.  
</P>
<P>
	To the delight of wildlife scientists and animal lovers, the  
black bear has returned to Big Bend National Park and 
re-established a population after a 50-year absence caused by 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the most exciting thing since the park's  
existence,'' said Raymond Skiles, a wildlife biologist with the 
National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, park officials want to do everything they can to preserve  
the population, currently estimated at 20 bears. 
</P>
<P>
	That means two things: keeping humans and their food away from  
the creatures, and studying the bears to learn where specifically 
they are living, their travel routes and whether they are 
inbreeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Bend officials have picked up a trick or two from their  
counterparts who have been dealing with black bears at other 
national parks for decades. At least 600,000 black bears are 
believed to be in North America today, with more in Alaska than any 
other state. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers have installed bear-proof trash cans with secure metal  
lids and food-storage lockers at campsites and along hiking trails 
in the 15,000-acre Chisos Mountains, the new habitat for a group of 
bears believed to have migrated from the Sierra del Carmen, a 
mountain range just across the border in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, they have put placards on the tables in the park's  
only dining room reminding visitors to keep food in cars and 
lockers, not tents and coolers. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials hope such measures will avert the types of  
problems experienced at some other parks, where hungry bears have 
ripped off car doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Bend is lucky in that they can start at the outset, taking  
advantage of these techniques that other parks have developed to 
try to head off nuisance activity,'' said Mike Pelton, an expert on 
black bears and a professor of wildlife science at the University 
of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early part of the century, black bears inhabited the land  
in southwestern Texas that is now Big Bend but were lost to hunting 
and trapping by the time the park opened on 800,000 acres in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until the mid-1980s that people started seeing black  
bears in the park's rugged, reddish-brown mountains, wandering 
among the drooping junipers and oaks and snacking on the purple 
fruit of the prickly pear cactus. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1988, a visitor captured snapshots of a mother bear and  
three cubs -- the first evidence of a breeding population. 
</P>
<P>
	As the black bear population blooms across the country, more  
people are becoming aware that the bear -- often perceived as a 
ferocious beast -- is timid and extremely unlikely to attack a 
person if left alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 40 people have been killed by black bears in North  
America this century, said Lynn Rogers, a director of the North 
American Bear Center in Minnesota and a retired wildlife biologist 
for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are learning the truth about these bears and are  
willing to co-exist with them,'' Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bears subsist on a mostly vegetarian diet of nuts and berries  
but will eat meat that is easily obtained. Problems arise if they 
get a taste of human food: There have been many cases around the 
country in which bears searching for food have broken into houses, 
ripped tents and mauled people. Many pesky bears have had to be 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	So far in Big Bend, which welcomes an average of 300,000  
visitors a year, no problems have been reported between the new 
bear population and park visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides hiding food from the bears, Big Bend's preservation  
program has another important component: the extensive, three-year 
study being conducted by researcher Dave Onorato, a doctoral 
student from Oklahoma State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Using techniques that are not uncommon for studying black bears,  
Onorato is trapping and holding the animals just long enough to 
draw blood, take ear tissue and hair and pull a tooth. And, using a 
needle, he injects a three-quarter-inch device between the scapula 
that gives each bear an individual code that can be read with a 
scanner. 
</P>
<P>
	All this poking and prodding is done to determine the number of  
bears, their ages and whether they are inbreeding, which could lead 
to sterile males. If that turns out to be the case, park officials 
may have to import some black bears to diversify the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to preserve these bears, it's important that we know  
more about them,'' Onorato said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he finishes with a tranquilized bear, Onorato attaches an  
electronic collar so that he can track its movements with a 
scanner. So far, he's taken samples from and put collars on 12 
bears. 
</P>
<P>
	By mapping the bears' movements, Onorato will learn how they are  
traveling and how close they are coming to campsites and popular 
tourist areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the park wants to avoid problems, we need to determine  
where the bears are spending time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skiles said he and other park officials hope to use the data  
``to literally manage the people around the bears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately,'' he said, ``we just want to preserve this  
population and want it to do what it naturally would.''

	Activists Gather at NGO Conference  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Activists from more than 100 nations  
gathered today to discuss human rights, land mines, hunger and 
refugees at a conference of nongovernmental organizations. The 
annual meeting was opened by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, 
whose 1997 election victory marked the first peaceful transfer of 
power to an opposition party in South Korea's 50 years of 
independence.Kim, a longtime democracy activist, was once sentenced 
to death by a military-backed government, but his 1980 sentence was 
commuted after pressure from Washington.

	Suharto Corruption Inquiry Dropped  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's top legal officer today  
recommended that the corruption case against ex-President Suharto 
be dropped due to lack of evidence. ``There is not sufficient 
evidence to continue the investigation,'' Ismudjoko, Indonesia's 
acting attorney general, said after presenting his report on the 
Suharto probe to President B.J. Habibie. The findings, and how 
Habibie responds to them, could prove crucial to the president's 
chances of staying in power during next week's presidential 
election by the 700-member parliament.

</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- International peacekeepers today blamed  
anti-independence militants for starting a firefight on the East 
Timor border that heightened tensions between foreign forces and 
the Indonesian military. The peacekeepers denied claims by the 
Indonesian army that a squad of Australian troops killed an 
Indonesian policeman and wounded two others yesterday and that the 
fighting took place on the Indonesian-controlled West Timor side of 
the border.

	Taiwan Mourns Earthquake Victims  
</P>
<P>
	LINKOU, Taiwan (AP) -- Thousands gathered at a sports arena in  
this Taipei suburb today to mourn the deaths of more than 2,000 
people killed by Taiwan's worst earthquake in decades. On a stage 
dimly lit in blue light, many of the island's top leaders 
one-by-one faced a 40-feet-tall memorial to the dead and bowed 
three times. Rows of military officials in formal uniforms watched 
from the stands along with lawmakers in dark suits and members of 
Buddhist, Taoist and Christian charity organizations.

	Delay of Test Ban Treaty Vote Sought  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three Cabinet members and the White House's  
national security adviser pleaded the Clinton administration's case 
on the nuclear test ban treaty before the public, saying rejection 
by the Senate could hurt nonproliferation efforts. But one 
Republican senator, Jon Kyl of Arizona, said he looked forward to a 
vote this week that is all but certain to kill the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty and force the government to ``go back to the 
drawing board.'' Kyl contended a defeat would strengthen the United 
States' hand in negotiations with other countries.

	EU Demands Worry Serb Leaders  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- European Union demands for the  
extradition of President Slobodan Milosevic to face war crimes 
charges is causing Serb opposition leaders to rethink their 
cooperation with the EU. More than two dozen top opposition leaders 
had been invited to Luxembourg today to discuss democracy, possible 
shipments of heating oil to municipalities run by opposition 
parties and other issues. But Zoran Djindjic said he and other 
leaders may not attend because EU officials want them to pledge 
that, if they come to power, they will extradite Milosevic and four 
of his aides to the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, 
Netherlands.

today in a leadership contest for his Socialist Party, a loss that 
threatened a new political crisis in this turbulent Balkan country.

an assist yesterday as the New York Islanders won their home 
opener, beating the Colorado Avalanche 4-2. New York, which hadn't 
played for eight days and was playing only its second game, also 
got goals from Mats Lindgren and Claude Lapointe. Felix Potvin

<HEADLINE> Compaq Plans N. Texas Telecom Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- North Texas will be home to a new Compaq Computer  
Corp. unit as part of the company's reorganized telecommunications 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The new unit will be located in the growing ``Telecom Corridor''  
in the suburbs north of Dallas, possibly in or near Plano, Compaq 
spokesman Alan Hodel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael D. Capellas, Compaq president and chief executive, was  
to formally announce the move during a keynote address at Telecom 
99, a major trade show beginning this week in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The move would bring up to 2,000 jobs to the area, Hodel said.  
The positions will be a mixture of new hires and transfers of 
current Compaq telecom employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry S. Schwartz will serve as the new group's general manager.  
</P>
<P>
	Compaq boosted its telecom operations two years ago when it  
bought Tandem Computers Inc. Its systems are used worldwide to run 
large-scale telecom operations and drive networks for automatic 
banking, securities trading and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodel said that Compaq, whose stock price was halved earlier  
this year amid faltering revenues that resulted in the ouster of 
top management, is relying in part on telecom and other large-scale 
computing customers to get the company back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, the world's largest personal computer maker, now derives  
more than half of its revenue from large-scale, non-PC products 
designed to drive networks and other large operations.

<HEADLINE> Kroger, Union Reach Tentative Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A union representing Kroger Co. workers in the  
Cincinnati area reached a tentative contract agreement with the 
nation's largest grocery store chain early today, averting a 
possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy with the agreement, and we also think it  
keeps the company competitive,'' said John Marrone, spokesman for 
United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1099, which 
represents about 8,400 workers at 66 Kroger stores in southeastern 
Indiana, northern Kentucky and the Cincinnati area. 
</P>
<P>
	Marrone said Kroger agreed to pay raises and improved health  
benefits for workers at no extra cost to the employees. He declined 
to discuss specifics of the five-year agreement before union 
members had a chance to review the details. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members must approve the contract with a vote, which could  
happen as soon as Wednesday, Marrone said. Calls to 
Cincinnati-based Kroger went unanswered early today. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's previous contract, which expired at midnight  
Saturday, covered employees in Kroger's grocery and meat sections. 
Drugstore and general merchandise division employees are covered 
under another contract. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, an eastern Ohio River Valley local representing 4,600  
Kroger workers in eastern Ohio, West Virginia and eastern Kentucky 
reached a tentative agreement with the company, Local 347 President 
Sterling Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball said that main negotiations failed to come up with an  
agreement about wages, profit sharing and other terms. But a 
smaller meeting between officials after talks ended enabled the 
sides to agree on a tentative contract, he said.

<HEADLINE> Arthur Miller-Based Opera Premieres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- ``Eddie never knew he had a destiny.''  
</P>
<P>
	So goes one of the most moving lines from William Bolcom's new  
opera, ``A View from the Bridge,'' making its world premiere 
Saturday at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	And tellingly, the line is delivered by the chorus, rather than  
one of the principals. For in Bolcom's recasting of Arthur Miller's 
acclaimed tragedy, the chorus is an all-important character. It's 
the collective soul of the Sicilian-American community in Red Hook, 
Brooklyn, in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	``A View from the Bridge'' is a rare thing: an Italian-American  
tragedy with no role for the Mafia. The gunmen in the wide-brimmed 
fedoras and bulky overcoats are from a far more ominous 
organization -- the Immigration and Naturalization Service. At a 
time of grinding poverty in Italy and prejudicial U.S. immigration 
quotas, ratting on a ``submarine'' (illegal immigrant) is Red 
Hook's unforgivable sin. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy in ``A View'' lies in how stevedore Eddie Carbone  
comes to commit that sin and the retribution he meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has called ``A View'' his most operatic play, and this  
production proves it. 
</P>
<P>
	As Eddie, baritone Kim Josephson has one of the meatiest, but  
oddest, roles in recent opera. He's the unquestioned star, but he 
doesn't have a single full-fledged aria. Neither Bolcom's music nor 
the libretto by Miller and longtime Bolcom collaborator Arnold 
Weinstein permits Eddie even a trace of lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
	But Josephson shines in the role, letting the audience see what  
a singing Robert De Niro might be like. He has the half-swagger, 
half-waddle of a true dockworker, and when he and his co-workers 
erupt into a doo-wop quartet over an ``accidentally'' split-open 
case of Scotch, it almost seems improvised. 
</P>
<P>
	Josephson, under the skilled direction of Frank Galati,  
convincingly portrays Eddie's gruff, but genuine, love for his job, 
his community and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, that family includes his wife's 17-year-old  
orphan niece, Catherine. Eddie's love for her is so overprotective 
and jealous that it constitutes platonic incest. And when Eddie 
agrees to hide two ship-jumpers who are cousins of his wife, the 
family tensions hit critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, Bolcom suggests the overcrowding of Eddie's tiny  
apartment through stretches of oppressive silence, or the simple 
ticking of a metronome. And, as in Miller's original play, he 
underlines Eddie's jealousy with recurring snatches from the old 
pop standard ``Paper Doll'' ('' ... those flirty, flirty guys with 
their flirty, flirty eyes ...''). 
</P>
<P>
	As Rudolpho, the younger of the two ``submarines,'' tenor  
Gregory Turay has most of the opera's lyrical passages. His biggest 
aria, the Gershwinesque ``New York Lights,'' would seem destined to 
enrich the repertoire of cabaret singers. It's Rudolpho's song of 
love to America, and to the girl who's showing America to him, 
Catherine. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine is sung by soprano Juliana Rambaldi, and her only full  
aria, curiously, is a defense of Eddie to her new lover. Rambaldi 
brings a needed innocence and coltish grace to the role, but, then 
again, most female singers would seem coltish if they had to share 
the stage with Catherine Malfitano, who plays Eddie's wife, 
Beatrice. 
</P>
<P>
	Malfitano's voluptuousness brings an added shiver to one of the  
opera's key lines: ``Eddie, when am I gonna be a wife again?'' And 
the soprano, who starred in Bolcom's previous work for the Lyric, 
``McTeague,'' has several of the most effective arias. 
</P>
<P>
	The most powerful aria, though, is ``I sailed on a ship called  
Hunger,'' sung from a jail cell by bass-baritone Mark McCrory, who 
plays Rudolpho's freakishly strong older brother, Marco. It is the 
only passage that has no counterpart in Miller's original play, and 
the words were added by the playwright at Bolcom's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Baritone Timothy Nolen sings the part of Alfieri, the lawyer,  
who served as narrator in Miller's stage version. In the opera, 
Alfieri leads the chorus and is the commentator -- the educated man 
who is powerless to stop either Eddie's fateful telephone call to 
the immigration office or his inevitable death. 
</P>
<P>
	Musically, Bolcom's deft use of instrumental color keeps the  
orchestral accompaniment effective throughout, and rarely 
obtrusive. He is also proving himself a master of the difficult art 
of fitting operatic music to the natural rhythms and stresses of 
American English. 
</P>
<P>
	And those rhythms and stresses get their due in the  
Miller-Weinstein libretto. This is not the Brooklynese of the 
B-movies and sitcoms, it's the language as it was spoken by these 
people at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``A View from the Bridge'' will have eight more performances  
before it closes Nov. 5.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Wants Stronger Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Strengthening European security forces and  
increasing the number of troops available for deployment will be 
one of NATO's top priorities, the alliance's incoming leader said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	George Robertson, who takes over as secretary-general this week,  
noted that the alliance is stretched to the limit after deploying 
40,000 troops in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Critical shortages of employable, rapidly available troops  
have got to be ironed out,'' he said in an interview with The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said he also will look at improving Europe's sea  
transport to access trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Europeans spend two-thirds of what the Americans spend,  
but we don't get anything like that in terms of capabilities,'' 
Robertson said. ``That's because we duplicate, because we compete 
and, in many ways, we are still spending on the defense needs of 
the Cold War rather than the defense we're going to face 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson stressed that the strengthened European defense force  
would remain within NATO, not become a rival to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some people in the United States who believe that  
the European defense initiative is about decoupling of NATO, the 
Europeans building a capability that is duplicating and may 
eventually split away from NATO,'' he said. ``They're wrong, and 
part of my job is going to be to reassure them that's not on the 
agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, 53, currently Britain's defense secretary, is  
scheduled to take over the NATO helm Thursday. He replaces Javier 
Solana, a former Spanish foreign minister who is ending his 
four-year term a few months early to take up the new European Union 
post of foreign policy coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said he expects Russia's deployment of troops into  
Chechnya two weeks ago to be discussed at the Oct. 22 EU-Russian 
summit in Helsinki, Finland, but would not comment directly on the 
situation. Russian troops now control the northern third of the 
breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly ... the violence in the northern Caucasus are of  
concern to the Russians, are of concern to anyone in the region,'' 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Kosovo, Robertson said no deadline has been set to  
withdraw troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a long time. Stability in the Balkans  
demands it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Stock Drops 26 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG (AP) -- Rite Aid reported a second-quarter loss of  
$67.9 million, or 26 cents per share, on Monday primarily because 
of costs associated with store closings and acquiring 
pharmacy-benefits manager PCS Health Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the nation's third-largest drugstore chain were  
$3.5 billion for the quarter ended Aug. 28, up 16.6 percent from 
$3.01 billion in the same period last year, the company said. The 
company said the results were preliminary and unaudited. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed with second-quarter results, but we  
believe we are taking the steps necessary to deliver better 
operating results and to restore the financial health of the 
business,'' Martin Grass, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Rite Aid, said in a statement. ``The fundamentals of the business 
are intact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid closed or moved 106 stores during the quarter,  
resulting in pre-tax charges of about $34 million, the company 
said. Also hurting the results was a $49 million increase in 
interest costs related to financing for the January acquisition of 
PCS, the retailer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid did not provide comparative earnings figures, because  
the company plans to restate earnings for prior years and interim 
periods to make adjustments related to the store closings. Rite Aid 
had reported a loss of $92.7 million, or 31 cents a share, for its 
fiscal second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid said sales at store open at least a year were up 8  
percent, boosted by prescription sales growth of 17.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said non-pharmacy sales have been improving since  
September. For the June-August period, so-called front-end sales 
were 3.5 percent lower than for the same period last year. The 
company increased its East Coast sales but was hurt by declines on 
the West Coast, where the company has agreements to sell 38 stores 
and hopes to sell another 250. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our basic strategy remains intact,'' Grass said in a  
presentation to investors. ``We will execute and do a better job 
than we did in the past 12 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid scheduled its announcement after the close of the stock  
market Monday. The company's stock closed Monday down $2.50 for the 
day at $10 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid is trimming costs with the store sales, the closing of  
a distribution center in Utah, and cuts in its corporate and field 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has considered selling at least some of its interest  
in PCS to help with financial problems, and Grass said the company 
would likely get more than the $1.5 billion it paid. The purchase 
from Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. increased Rite Aid's debt to $5.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Rite Aid reported a 39 percent drop in fourth-quarter  
earnings -- from $119.7 million to $73 million -- that it attributed 
to a flurry of store openings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Camp Hill, Pa.-based company has about 3,800 store locations  
in 30 states.

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds on Monday added two  
right-handed pitchers and a first baseman to their 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Flury, acquired from the Boston Red Sox on March 25 in  
exchange for outfielder Jon Nunnally, had a 2-2 record with a 4.13 
earned run average and 21 saves in 66 relief appearances combined 
for Triple-A Indianapolis and Double-A Chattanooga.

June 1994 free-agent draft, had an overall record of 10-5 with a 
2.51 ERA and six saves in 64 relief appearances for Indianapolis 
and Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman D.T. Cromer, drafted as a free agent by Oakland in  
June 1992 and signed by the Reds on Dec. 16 as a free agent, batted 
.310 with 30 homers and 107 runs batted in for Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Ministers Oppose Lottery With Vigil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Ministers opposed to a referendum  
allowing a state lottery held a 24-hour prayer vigil outside the 
state Capitol Monday, warning that gambling goes against God's will 
and would hurt the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Father, I pray that the answer be clear in the hearts and  
minds of the people of Alabama ... that they will see that gambling 
in any form is violation of your word,'' said Republican state Sen. 
Albert Lipscomb, as he led 20 people in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``God is telling us we have to stand for something,'' said  
Lillian Farmer, who prayed while she sat in a folding chair. 
</P>
<P>
	A day before Tuesday's referendum on a constitutional amendment  
to allow a lottery, Gov. Don Siegelman toured the state, arguing 
that it was needed to pay for college scholarships, public school 
programs for 4-year-olds and school technology. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the vote will determine ``our children's future. What's  
at stake is Alabama's future. Tomorrow we have a chance to change 
education forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman, a Democrat, won election on a campaign to establish a  
lottery to fund education programs. Though early polls found a 
clear majority for a lottery, the state's church ministers have 
united against it and polls lately have showed a tight race. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor held news conferences in support of the lottery in  
Huntsville, Birmingham and Mobile.

<HEADLINE> IMF Head Predicts Non-U.S. Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The U.S. economy is likely to slow,  
but Europe and Japan can be expected to offset the trend with an 
increase in economic growth, the head of the International Monetary 
Fund said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. expansion, which has had such a vital role in  
sustaining the world economy ... can -- and should -- be expected to 
slow, with the slack being taken up by expansion in the other 
industrial countries,'' IMF managing director Michel Camdessus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of improvement in key industrial countries, including  
Japan and Europe, underline that the worst of the global economic 
and financial crisis is over, he told an audience of business 
leaders and politicians in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said European countries -- at least some of the smaller  
ones -- were increasingly aware of the need to tackle ``structural 
issues,'' a reference to overregulation, inflexible job markets and 
the high cost of social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, Europe's biggest economy, seems set for an economic  
rebound, helped by the monetary conditions set by the European 
Central Bank, Camdessus said. The ECB has lowered interest rates 
since taking over monetary policy for 11 European countries on Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus specifically urged Germany to push structural reforms  
and consolidate the government's finances.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Corruption Probe Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's top legal officer dropped  
a corruption investigation against ex-President Suharto today, a 
move that raised fears of renewed student protests just nine days 
before a new head of state is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismudjoko, Indonesia's acting attorney general, said his  
investigation uncovered some irregularities but not enough evidence 
to show that Suharto had violated the law to enriched himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not sufficient evidence to continue the  
investigation,'' Ismudjoko, who like many Indonesians uses only one 
name, said after presenting his report to President B.J. Habibie, 
Suharto's hand-picked successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie promised to crack down on corruption after he took power  
16 months ago. He repeatedly denied accusations that he would 
protect his old boss, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for 32 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to let Suharto off the hook could damage Habibie's  
already dim chances of staying in power on Oct. 20, when the 
700-member People's Consultative Assembly chooses the next leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie did not immediately comment on the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Many assembly members have demanded that the government  
prosecute Suharto, who was forced to quit in May 1998 after a wave 
of student protests and bloody riots. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, students have regularly clashed with security  
forces. They have demanded that Suharto be tried, and they have 
rejected the attorney general's investigation as a whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Habibie's Golkar Party is to announce whether it  
will continue to back him as its sole candidate for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politically, this is a major factor. It could damage Habibie's  
candidacy,'' said Marzuki Darusman, who heads an anti-Habibie 
faction within Golkar. 
</P>
<P>
	Reformers condemned the decision and warned that the world's  
fourth most populous nation should brace itself for more trouble on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are going to be angry that Suharto has been let  
off,'' said Hendardi, who heads the Indonesian Legal Aid 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected this. No one in this country is brave enough to  
put Suharto on trial,'' said Tenten Masduki, of Indonesian 
Corruption Watch, an anti-graft group. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto, 78, has been accused of siphoning millions of dollars  
of public funds through charity foundations during his autocratic 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president, who was recently treated in a Jakarta  
hospital after suffering a stroke, has denied any wrongdoing. He 
also rejected accusations that his family has stashed away a 
fortune in foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew all along this case would be dropped,'' said Danny  
Kailimang, a member of Suharto's legal team. ``We respect the 
attorney general's office for making a professional decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Suharto children remain under separate investigations  
for corruption, and his youngest son, Tommy, is currently on trial 
over a multimillion dollar land deal. A verdict is expected as 
early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismudjoko said he had investigated the finances of seven  
foundations headed by Suharto, but focused on the two largest, 
Supersemar and Dahmais. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation focused on a scheme set up by Suharto under  
which his foundations received regular, legally required, donations 
from state institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found that the foundations had lent the funds to  
various commercial corporations. Although irregular, such 
transactions were not illegal because their profits ultimately were 
returned to the foundations and used for charitable work, Ismudjoko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law says that as long as the profit is used for social  
interests, it is not wrong for the foundation to lend it to 
commercial interests,'' Ismudjoko said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not specify what commercial interests had borrowed the  
money. However, opponents of Suharto claim the funds were milked as 
an easy source of credit to fuel the business empires of his six 
superrich children. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismudjoko said the case against Suharto could be reopened if new  
evidence of corruption was unearthed.

<HEADLINE> Vibraphonist Milt Jackson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Milt Jackson, a jazz vibraphonist who made the  
instrument sing like the human voice as a longtime member of the 
Modern Jazz Quartet, died of liver cancer. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, one of the best improvisers in jazz and an outstanding  
blues player, died Saturday at a Manhattan hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson originally was a singer in a Detroit gospel quartet. In  
the 1940s, he created a new sound by slowing the motor on his 
Deagan Vibraharp's oscillator to a third of the speed of Lionel 
Hampton's. The result was a warm, smoky sound with a vibrato 
approximating his own singing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came closer than anyone else on the instrument to making it  
sound like the human voice,'' vibraphonist Stefon Harris said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He set a precedent that this instrument can speak beautiful  
things and that it's not just percussive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's style came from Charlie Parker, whose rhythmic traits  
he adopted. He was one of the first bona fide be-bop vibraphone 
musicians, and he became a jewel in Gillespie's band. He recorded 
be-bop classics with the band, such as ``A Night in Tunisia,'' 
``Anthropology'' and ``Two Bass Hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, Jackson teamed with Thelonius Monk, recording ``Criss  
Cross'' and ``Straight, No Chaser,'' among others. 
</P>
<P>
	When a pianist in Gillespie's band, John Lewis, decided to form  
a new group, one going beyond soloists with a rhythm section, 
Jackson signed on. In 1952, the Modern Jazz Quartet was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Through 20 years of albums, mostly for Atlantic records, the  
group became one of the first jazz bands embraced by an audience 
much wider than jazz fans. Members choreographed all aspects of 
their presentation, from walking on stage to playing their subdued 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	The band dissolved in 1974 and reunited temporarily for a few  
tours in the 1980s and early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson started teaching himself to play the guitar when he was  
7 and taking piano lessons when he was 11. By high school, he 
played five instruments: drums, guitar, timpani, violin and 
xylophone. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Jackson was 16, he had begun playing the vibraphone  
and was performing with Clarence Ringo and the George E. Lee band. 
He started a jazz quartet, the Four Sharps, after high school and 
two years of overseas military service. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dizzy Gillespie saw the Four Sharps in a Detroit bar, he  
asked Jackson to join the rhythm section of his band in New York.

<HEADLINE> Major Airlines Hike Advance Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The nation's largest air carriers have banded  
together behind a $20 increase in advance-purchase tickets favored 
by vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
	Before they joined forces, they spent the weekend changing their  
minds about whether to match Continental Airlines' decision last 
Friday to raise fares because of higher jet fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental was joined by Delta, America West on Friday and then  
by American Airlines on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest carrier, United Airlines, raised its fares Saturday  
but backed down Sunday night when Minneapolis-based Northwest 
Airlines balked at the increase. By Monday, both airlines had 
raised fares. 
</P>
<P>
	``We rescinded the fare increase last night because Northwest  
had not matched, and we didn't want to be out of synch with them,'' 
Joe Hopkins, United spokesman said Monday. ``So this morning, we 
reinstated it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the largest carriers were on board, USAirways and TWA had  
reversed increases in excursion fares -- typically requiring a 
seven-, 14- or 21-day advance purchase -- as of midday Monday. 
Southwest, a discount airline, said it did not plan to raise 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The major carriers' increase of $20 applies to round-trip  
flights of more than 500 miles, with shorter flights going up $10. 
Continental also tried to raise business-class fares -- 
more-expensive seats sold without an advance-purchase requirement -- 
but other major airlines had refused to go along by Monday, and 
industry observers predicted that increase would fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business travelers will walk away OK, but I think there's  
a 98 percent chance that the leisure fares will stay higher,'' said 
Tom Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, an Internet site that sells 
discount travel tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only business I know where people raise prices to  
be competitive,'' said Parsons, who said five rounds of fare 
increases this year have added 14 1/2 to 17 1/2 percent, depending on the 
route, to the cost of leisure travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline analyst Glenn Engel of Goldman Sachs was underwhelmed by  
the fare increase. ``It's irrelevant. Very few tickets are bought 
at these prices,'' said Engel, who calculates that airlines are 
discounting about 25 to 30 percent off their base leisure fares in 
heavily advertised campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fare structure is not healthy. The spread between selling  
prices and list prices is too large,'' Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent increase adds about 3 to 7 percent for the base  
price of most leisure fares -- although the airlines frequently 
discount off the base rate. The impact of the increase is smaller 
on the most expensive routes, such as Boston-Los Angeles, which 
rose from $659 to $679, but more on shorter routes such as 
Dallas-Nashville, up from $340 to $360. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline executives said they needed to raise prices to rebuild  
profits that have been eroded by higher jet fuel costs. Spot-market 
jet fuel has risen from about around 30 cents a gallon to more than 
55 cents a gallon this year. Gordon Bethune, chief executive of 
Houston-based Continental, which triggered the round of increases, 
said in a recorded message Friday that higher fuel costs had 
``eaten up a lot of our potential profits for the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engel estimated that higher jet fuel costs have reduced  
airlines' profit margins by 3 to 4 percent this year. But, he said, 
lucrative business travel should be higher than it was in late 
1998, leading to improved margins the rest of the year.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Fassel Doing Damage Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The act is three years in the  
running and getting old for Jim Fassel. 
</P>
<P>
	Five games into the season, the New York Giants have a 2-3  
record, the defense is playing well enough to win and it's 
frustrated the offense isn't holding up its end of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	With the prospects for a winning season diminishing and the  
threat of finger-pointing on the rise following Sunday's 
embarrassing 14-3 loss to the Cardinals in Arizona, Fassel was once 
again engaged in damage control. 
</P>
<P>
	``My message right now to myself and the team is we've got  
eleven games left and we can be anything we want to be,'' Fassel 
said Monday. ``All we have to do is go out and start playing 
football like I think we are capable of playing. And that 
specifically applies to the offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants' offense has been almost nonexistent this season. It  
struggled in the first four games with Kent Graham at quarterback. 
Kerry Collins was no better on Sunday, when Graham was sidelined 
with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel said he had not decided who would start against Dallas  
next Monday night, noting that he wanted to think things out and to 
keep Dallas guessing as long as possible, as if that meant 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider this: The Boston Red Sox scored more runs Sunday night  
(23) than the Giants' point total over the past two weeks (19). 
</P>
<P>
	Putting a finger on what's wrong with the offense is tough,  
considering almost everyone in the group was making mistakes 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tackle Roman Oben gave up three sacks. Collins fumbled once and  
threw an interception. Receiver Ike Hilliard dropped a 20-yard pass 
on the Giants' first play from scrimmage. Fullback Charles Way and 
halfback Gary Brown failed to convert on a couple of 
third-and-short plays, with little help from the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Without naming the guilty party, Fassel also said there was a  
sweep that would have gained at least 15 yards if the receiver 
simply bumped into the Cardinals' defensive end. The receiver 
missed his block. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we're thinking too much and we don't execute the nuts  
and bolts of things,'' Fassel said. ``So I'll get it down to where 
we're confident in what we're doing and there's not a lot of 
indecision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will probably mean a shaved-down game plan.  
</P>
<P>
	However, that won't mean lineup changes other than the  
quarterback situation. 
</P>
<P>
	In dealing with the team, Fassel plans to stay positive, to keep  
everyone pulling together and to make some changes in how things 
are presented to the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will remind you of this,'' Fassel said. ``We haven't fallen  
apart in two years of doing this and I don't expect to right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither do some of the Giants' key veterans. They remember  
winning the NFC East after a 2-3 start two years ago. Last year, 
New York didn't right things until the end of the season, winning 
five of six to finish 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's fallen apart,'' Way said. ``That's  
overdramatizing the situation. I just think it's only three games 
(losses). We still have 11 left and we're by no means out of it. We 
just have to get it going starting Monday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reserve halfback Tiki Barber said the offense will go once the  
mistakes stop. He also doesn't see a rift developing between the 
offense and defense, which has only played one bad game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been down that road before,'' Barber said. ``That's an  
immature way to play football and it doesn't do anything but drive 
us apart and make it worse. I don't think we are to that point or 
that we will get to that point.''

<HEADLINE> Billy Davis Jr. Marks Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As they celebrated their 30th year of  
marriage, Grammy-winning couple Billy Davis Jr. and Marilyn McCoo 
were quietly agonizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the 61-year-old Davis learned he had prostate cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was the hardest part, just hearing those dreaded words:  
You have cancer,'' Davis said Monday. ``Your immediate reaction is, 
'This is a death sentence.' But it's not, and I think it's 
important that other men realize that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His prostate was removed in August, shortly after the couple  
celebrated their anniversary. Davis said the cancer had not spread 
beyond the prostate, and he opted for surgery over radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	When he awoke in the recovery room, Davis was concerned about  
one thing -- his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was worried that no one had told her I was fine, and I asked  
for her. After 30 years, it was like asking for my right arm,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple met as members of the multiple Grammy-winning group  
The Fifth Dimension in 1965. They left the band to record together, 
winning a Grammy in 1976 for ``You Don't Have to be a Star (To Be 
in My Show).''

<HEADLINE> Britain's GEC To Become Marconi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The General Electric Company PLC, Britain's  
biggest electrical engineering company, said Monday that it will 
change its name to Marconi PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	The change will become effective once GEC completes the sale of  
its Marconi Electronics Systems business to British Aerospace PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	The name change symbolizes GEC's transformation from an  
industrial and defense electronics group into an information 
technology company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marconi brand, long a part of GEC's business, is named for  
Italian physicist Guglielmo Marconi, who pioneered wireless 
telegraphy. Marconi PLC will be split into three businesses -- 
communications, systems and capital. 
</P>
<P>
	GEC said it plans to list shares in the renamed company in the  
United States some time next year. It said it expects that Marconi 
PLC will be listed on the London Stock Exchange and will be a part 
of the FTSE-100 index. 
</P>
<P>
	Marconi Electronics Systems comprises operations in aerospace,  
naval shipbuilding and defense electronics. GEC agreed in April to 
sell the business to British Aerospace. The $11.6 billion deal 
would be the largest defense-industry combination in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Gore Counting on Labor Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With an ``aye'' vote of the 1.4 million Food  
and Commercial Workers in its pocket, Vice President Al Gore's 
presidential campaign said the AFL-CIO's bigger-prize endorsement 
is all but assured. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, as backroom meetings continued, more votes moved toward  
Gore -- or at least promised not to block his path -- and union 
leaders said it was as good as done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're keeping a tally sheet and people are moving. Looks like  
it's going to happen,'' said Rick Diegel, political director of the 
yet-undecided Electrical Workers union. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UFCW endorsement makes it look very good. Now we just work  
on the rest of them to get them to endorse or abstain,'' said 
campaign chairman Tony Coelho, as he arrived late Sunday to lobby 
any holdouts at the AFL-CIO convention that opened today. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who made his desire for the Gore  
endorsement clear to his affiliated union presidents when they 
first met here on Friday, also sounded satisfied that the votes are 
all moving his way. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more people are realizing that it's really not  
early,'' he told a reporter on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.3-million-member Service Employees International Union  
decided against endorsing Gore at this AFL-CIO convention, but 
would likely abstain rather than oppose ``the way the bulk of the 
AFL-CIO is going,'' said political director Matt Witt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is in no way a boost of or slap at anybody,'' Witt said.  
Rather, the SEIU is going to follow its own schedule of deciding an 
endorsement in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Auto Workers, Teamsters, Electrical Workers, and,  
perhaps, the Machinists, remained uncertain votes, labor and 
political operatives said. But these unions do not represent enough 
votes to block an endorsement, which, under convention rules 
proposed by Sweeney, must be approved by unions representing 
two-thirds of the AFL-CIO's 13 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive council -- made up of presidents of the AFL-CIO's  
largest unions -- and the full convention of some 700 delegates vote 
on Wednesday. Gore made plans for a victorious acceptance speech at 
the Los Angeles Convention Center after those votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's unanimous endorsement of Gore by the board of the  
United Food and Commercial Workers followed back-to-back calls to 
UFCW President Doug Dority from Gore and his rival for the 
Democratic presidential nomination, Bill Bradley. Labor officials 
said the urgent, personal calls were typical of the intense 
lobbying that has gone into this high-stakes endorsement and the 
army of grassroots campaign volunteers that it carries. 
</P>
<P>
	As late as Saturday night, Dority, a Gore supporter, was  
nonetheless leaning toward the view that ``an endorsement a couple 
of months'' may be the best way to have an impact after building 
greater consensus, said Greg Denier, Dority's senior assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Another call from Gore, and Dority was tipped to the vice  
president's position. Before Sweeney arrived to press Gore's case 
at a private Sunday-morning meeting of the UFCW board, Dority asked 
his board to join him in supporting an early nod to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Denier explained that the news media had driven the stakes so  
high that the UFCW didn't want a ``no'' vote to be misinterpreted 
``as weak support for Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes as planned it will be one of the earliest  
presidential endorsements by the AFL-CIO since it gave then-Vice 
President Walter Mondale the nod in 1983.

<HEADLINE> SMU, TCU May Go to C-USA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The possible defection of Southern Methodist and  
Texas Christian from the Western Athletic Conference to Conference 
USA might be put to a vote today by C-USA school presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth Star-Telegram and The Dallas Morning News  
reported in today's editions that the presidents, meeting in New 
York, were expected to vote on whether to expand the 14-school 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	If expansion passes, the league then will decide whether to  
invite SMU and TCU. An official announcement might not come until 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	To be approved for membership, a school needs the votes of 11 of  
the 14 conference schools. SMU and TCU were not expected to have 
representatives at today's vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, TCU athletic director Eric Hyman said, ``Nothing's  
changed, We've neither applied nor have we been invited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hyman did cite ``ongoing discussion and exchanging of  
information'' between the Fort Worth school and league officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks ago, C-USA presidents gave commissioner Mike Slive the  
green light to explore the expansion issue and look at various 
schools. His targets were reportedly university's located in large 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	While SMU, in Dallas, and TCU are often thought of together,  
each university will be voted on separately. Officials said it was 
possible that only one of the two could be offered league 
membership, fulfilling C-USA's needs to claim entry into the 
Dallas-Fort Worth television market. 
</P>
<P>
	If the schools decide to leave the WAC for C-USA, the price tag  
could be high. There have been reports that both schools would to 
pay a $3 million entrance fee to join the league. 
</P>
<P>
	C-USA presidents also are expected to approve the addition of  
South Florida's football program. South Florida is already a C-USA 
member in all other sports. East Carolina, a football-only member, 
is seeking membership in all sports. 
</P>
<P>
	C-USA is made up of 12 basketball members and nine football  
members. By adding SMU, TCU and South Florida in football, C-USA 
would have the 12 schools necessary to stage a championship game.

<HEADLINE> Questions Linger Around Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- As the Los Angeles Lakers broke  
training camp Monday, they left with a long list of questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Shaquille O'Neal, who went 0-for-8 from the free throw line  
in a scrimmage Sunday night, ever make more than 50 percent of his 
free throws? Will he get to rest with roving veterans John Salley 
and Benoit Benjamin behind him? Can point guard Derek Fisher run 
the new triangle offense? 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal turned defensive when asked about his missed free throws  
in Sunday's scrimmage, refusing to answer questions and walking 
away from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers open their exhibition season Tuesday against the  
Washington Wizards in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we had another week before we start, but, you know,  
this is it, so we play it,'' coach Phil Jackson said after the 
team's final practice on the UC Santa Barbara campus. ``I have a 
lot of players out here to try to play, so I am going to try get 
everybody a chance to play a little bit and still get my starters 
some minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Building conditioning and playing together is important.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson feels his team has made strides, but knows it is going  
to take time for the players to adjust to his style. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they got an ear for what we are trying to do; they are  
willing and sometimes they are responding,'' said Jackson, who will 
take 17 players to Little Rock, holding off on cuts until the end 
of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they have that determination as a group to become a  
better team. But, now when the contests actually begin and the 
conflicts happen out there on the court, we'll see how easy it is 
to stay with our newfound stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers hope to have veteran point guard Ron Harper in  
uniform by Thursday. While Jackson would have preferred that Harper 
join the team in Santa Barbara, he is confident Harper can step 
right in. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper played for Jackson in Chicago during the Bulls' run of  
six championships in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ronnie doesn't need this,'' Jackson said. ``He's been doing  
this for about the last seven years. He's got this stuff down.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Elizabeth Dole said Monday that she  
will formally kick off her campaign on Nov. 7, hoping that date 
will turn into the anniversary of her election to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exactly one year before the first presidential election  
of the new millennium and our selection of that date reflects my 
sense that we will make history,'' Dole said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dole campaign also confirmed on Monday that she will join  
other Republican presidential candidates in New Hampshire's 
nationally televised debate Oct. 28 at Dartmouth College. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, who has been campaigning since early this year, will  
launch her official kickoff swing in Des Moines, Iowa. From there, 
the tour traces her strategy for next year's early nominating 
contests. She will appear in Manchester, N.H., and Columbia, S.C., 
on Nov. 8 before wrapping up the hoopla in her hometown of 
Salisbury, N.C.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Seem Okay With Close Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Apparently, the Pittsburgh Steelers no longer  
measure success in wins and losses. Their new measuring stick is 
yards and feet. 
</P>
<P>
	They have lost three in a row -- the first time that's happened  
so early in a season since 1988 -- eight of 10 and 10 of 14. For a 
team that lost as many as seven games only once from 1992-97, those 
numbers are staggeringly bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Steelers couldn't have put a more positive spin on  
Sunday's 24-21 loss at Buffalo if they were a political consultant. 
Linebacker Levon Kirkland even suggested they will win their next 
five games, beginning Sunday in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Is one good game by quarterback Kordell Stewart -- only his  
second such game in nearly a year -- enough to turn yet another loss 
and a discouraging 2-3 start into a positive, upbeat situation? 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to get uptight about anything,'' said running  
back Richard Huntley, who had 16 yards on five carries. ``We're 
coming along and we're going to keep coming along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one problem: former All-Pro running back Jerome Bettis  
isn't along for the ride. He managed 24 yards on 13 carries, his 
worst game for the Steelers except for two brief last-season 
appearances in 1996 when he was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	If it was an anomaly, it wouldn't be a problem. But it is not an  
anomaly. Bettis, who rushed for 4,281 yards in his first three 
Steelers seasons, has 256 yards in five games -- a 51 yards per game 
average that ranks only 10th in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis had 16 100-yard games the last two seasons, but doesn't  
have one this season. Usually the most talkative and upbeat 
Steelers player, he barely spoke Sunday even when his teammates 
were extolling the virtues of the narrow loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inevitable that when we get the passing game going, we're  
going to run the ball a lot better,'' Bettis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers did throw better, yet still couldn't run; Stewart  
was 21-of-29 for 216 yards and his first two touchdown passes to a 
wide receiver this season. It was his best game since he threw for 
225 yards in the Thanksgiving Day loss in Detroit that began a 
season-ending five-game losing streak last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we lost, we made some strides,'' wide receiver  
Hines Ward said. ``It was real encouraging. We went out there and 
drove the ball against one of the best defenses in the NFL. We 
proved we can play with the top teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beating them? That's different. The Steelers haven't beaten a  
winning team in almost 11 months, or since their 30-15 victory over 
Jacksonville on Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter, the message is nearly the same from every player: the  
Steelers are very, very close to being very, very good again. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, their schedule might have something to do with that.  
In their next six games, they play one-game winner Cincinnati 
twice, one-time winner Atlanta once and winless Cleveland once. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want to put us down, but you had better not, I'm  
telling you,'' Kirkland said. ``We're going to be there at the end. 
There is no sense of panic. We're going to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably, he meant making the playoffs, something the Steelers  
have missed only once since Bill Cowher was hired as coach in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no lack of confidence here,'' Kirkland said.  
</P>
<P>
	No, just a lack of rushing yardage. The Steelers, who  
traditionally rank near the top in rushing, are an unusually low 
sixth in the AFC and ninth in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we are very close,'' tight end Mark Bruener said. ``We  
need to keep pressing.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers Move Players to Triple-A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers outrighted infielders Jason  
Wood and Jose Macias and right-handed pitcher Beiker Graterol to 
its Triple-A affiliate on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move means the players are not on the Tigers' 40-man roster,  
have cleared waivers and have been assigned to Toledo. Macias has 
agreed to terms with the Tigers on a Triple-A contract, while Wood 
and Graterol have the option of becoming free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Wood played 27 games with the Tigers this  
season, batting .159 with one homer and eight RBIs. He started the 
season on the disabled list with a fractured left forearm sustained 
in spring training. In 48 games with Toledo, he hit .286 with six 
home runs and 24 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Macias, 25, played five games with Detroit, hitting a home run  
in five at bats. He hit .244 in 112 games with Toledo, hitting two 
homers with 36 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Graterol, 24, started one game for the Tigers, giving up seven  
runs in four innings in a loss in the Yankees home opener in April. 
He was 3-9 with Toledo with a 5.83 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Boost in Oil Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Iran, Iraq and several other OPEC members boosted  
their crude oil output in September, increasing global supplies at 
a time when wealthy nations are consuming less oil than expected, 
according to a survey released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, possible signs of a softer market -- as well as the dip  
in petroleum prices -- were offset by an anticipated strong growth 
in the demand for heating oil this winter, the International Energy 
Agency said in a monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was compiled before last week's reversal in world oil  
prices, when profit-taking and fears that OPEC was less resolved to 
keep production under control triggered a 16 percent plunge in 
prices for crude contracts for future delivery on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	David Knapp, the economist who edited the survey, said the drop  
in prices did not change the agency's conclusions that the markets 
remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The energy agency is part of the Organization for Economic  
Cooperation and Development, a group of the world's most developed 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also shows that OPEC complied 86 percent of the time  
with the production cuts agreed to by its members. OPEC's 
compliance rate for August was 94 percent, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Given OPEC's record of cheating on quotas, analysts said that  
the newest compliance rate was still good, even at its reduced 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Knapp said the biggest surprise in the report was that oil  
inventories in industrialized countries increased from June to 
September. Iran led the increase in production, pumping an 
additional 190,000 barrels of oil a day, while Iraq boosted output 
by 60,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts challenged the agency's data, calling it  
puzzling and inconsistent. Peter Hitchens of London brokerage 
Williams De Broe said the agency's finding on oil inventories was a 
``glaring error,'' noting alternative surveys showed decreases in 
stockpiles in the United States, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But these analysts agreed that the market was still firm,  
despite the recent drop in crude prices and OPEC's weakened 
compliance with output quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices peaked last week in New York at a 33-month high of  
$25.12 a barrel, but tumbled on Friday to $20.90. 
</P>
<P>
	November contracts for U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate  
were trading slightly lower Monday at $20.85 a barrel. In London, 
November contracts for North Sea Brent were trading at $20.47 a 
barrel, down 23 cents from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Mark Redway blamed the price reversal on speculators who  
bet that OPEC would stick to its quotas. When market sentiment 
changed, they panicked and closed out their long positions, causing 
a sharp retreat in prices, said Redway, of London-based brokerage 
Greig Middleton and Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	But others downplayed the fluctuation.  
</P>
<P>
	``Is OPEC falling apart at the seams? No. Have they lost the  
will to make the production cuts stick? No,'' said Peter Gignoux, 
who manages the petroleum desk in London at U.S. investment bank 
Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price of crude had built up such a head of steam that if  
it didn't have a pause, the price would have been shooting toward 
$30 a barrel now,'' Gignoux said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bradley Closing on Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley is closing the gap on Al Gore in  
the race for the Democratic presidential nomination although both 
are still well behind GOP front-runner George W. Bush, says a 
CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Gore had the support of 51 percent while Bradley,  
a former senator from New Jersey, had 39 percent among people 
likely to vote in a Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll taken a few weeks ago, in  
mid-September, showed Gore with 63 percent and Bradley with 30 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Bradley's recent progress in the polls has been in key  
states like New Hampshire and New York, where he and Gore are very 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	In the national poll released Monday, Gore and Bradley were in a  
statistical dead heat among male voters, but Gore led among women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore campaign expressed confidence that the vice president's  
campaign efforts will connect with voters around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere Al Gore travels, grassroots voters are tuning to  
his campaign and his message and time will show the strength of his 
effort across the country,'' said Gore campaign spokeswoman Kiki 
Moore. Gore got good news Monday when there were growing signs that 
the AFL-CIO will back his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley aides pointed to the latest poll numbers as a sign  
that Gore's aggressive new tactics, including direct attacks on 
Bradley, aren't working. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said: ``The public has been pretty  
clear that they want politics to be upright and positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the Bradley supporters said in the poll that it  
was at least fairly important that Bradley has fewer ties to 
President Clinton than Gore. But most of those planning to vote 
Democratic found Bradley and Gore acceptable as nominees for their 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton had a job approval rating of 56 percent, but  
almost two-thirds said they don't approve of him as a person. 
</P>
<P>
	Either candidate faces a formidable task running against Bush,  
the governor of Texas and GOP front-runner by a huge margin in the 
latest poll. Bush was at 60 percent among the Republican candidates 
among people likely to vote in a GOP primary. Former Cabinet 
secretary Elizabeth Dole was at 11 percent and Arizona Sen. John 
McCain was at 8 percent. The remaining five Republican candidates 
were in the low single-digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has a 16-point lead over Gore and a 12-point lead over  
Bradley in head-to-head matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore and Bradley both had favorable ratings in the low  
50s, Bush has a favorable rating of 70 percent in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 976 adults nationwide was taken Oct. 8-10  
and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The 
error margin on the primary matchups was plus or minus 5 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Trial Opens in Gay Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Aaron McKinney beat gay college student  
Matthew Shepard on the windswept Wyoming prairie but his judgment 
was clouded by drugs and alcohol, McKinney's attorney said Monday 
as jury selection began in his murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Dion Custis said he would not point the finger at Russell  
Henderson, McKinney's co-defendant who has pleaded guilty to murder 
and is serving life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to contest the cause of death or that he died  
as a result of a beating from Aaron McKinney along with Russell 
Henderson,'' Custis said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would not contend that McKinney was insane, but said  
``his mental state will certainly be a crucial question for you to 
answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Custis' comments marked the first time he has unveiled a  
strategy for defending McKinney, who is facing the death sentence 
if convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, a University of Wyoming freshman majoring in  
political science, died a year ago Tuesday, five days after he was 
lured out of a bar, driven to a remote spot on the freezing 
prairie, lashed to a wooden fence and pistol-whipped into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say McKinney, 22, accompanied by Henderson, also 22,  
instigated the crime to rob the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard of $20, 
but that Shepard may have been targeted because he was gay. 
Henderson is expected to testify for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Custis told the prospects he was concerned about the widespread  
attention stemming from the case, which brought gay-rights issues 
to the forefront. ``I don't think anyone here is going to suggest 
this is a hate crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha warned the juror candidates that they  
must treat both sides fairly, regardless of their prejudices. 
``Whether you're Catholic or Muslim, if you are straight or gay, 
everyone is treated equal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial began, a few anti-gay protesters demonstrated  
outside the courthouse, along with people who came to honor 
Shepard's memory, wearing angel costumes to spread what they said 
was a message of love. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, McKinney talked quietly with his lawyers, looked at his  
notes and smiled occasionally as the attorneys spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney has said he had no idea Shepard was gay and does not  
hate homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing provoked a national debate over hate crimes and led  
to measures across the country adding sexual orientation to 
anti-discrimination laws. However, hate-crime legislation failed in 
Wyoming last winter after lawmakers argued that gays and other 
protected groups would get special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial also opened on the day that gay activists call  
National Coming Out Day and the beginning of Gay Awareness Week. In 
San Francisco, the Rev. Jerry Falwell marked the occasion by 
preaching to gays and lesbians about how to ``come out of 
homosexuality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end the day, 21 prospective jurors had been dismissed,  
including a man reporters saw pass a note to Shepard's mother 
during the lunch break. The man indicated the note expressed his 
condolences. The pool of 256 candidates is about the average size 
for a murder case in Laramie. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's father, William, sat near the back of the room, his  
eyes cast downward. He was accompanied by three supporters. On the 
other side of the aisle, Shepard's parents, Dennis and Judy, sat in 
a back row. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen members of a group called Angel Action, wearing golden  
halos and costumes made of white bedsheets, stood silently in the 
street. Spokeswoman Romaine Patterson, 21, of State College, Pa., 
said the group wanted to send a message of love. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, six followers of the Rev. Fred Phelps, 69, of Topeka,  
Kan., waved signs bearing anti-gay slogans. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents in Laramie appeared to be taking little notice.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know, maybe the town just wants it over,'' said Ben  
Rashford, 23, a University of Wyoming graduate student. ``Laramie 
is not that different than any place else. People like to think 
that but it's not.''

<HEADLINE> CIA: No Encephalitis Terrorism Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The CIA looked into rumors that the recent  
encephalitis outbreak in the New York area was the work of 
terrorists and concluded it wasn't, an agency official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press there's no evidence Iraq or any other foreign 
government was involved. The CIA ``looked into rumors which 
appeared in British media and elsewhere,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials also played down any suggestions of bioterrorism.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing indicates that this was anything other than a natural  
outbreak,'' Jerome Hauer, director of the city's emergency 
management office, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said  
there was no evidence to suggest the recent outbreak was anything 
other than ``Mother Nature at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts at the CIA who deal with biological weapons said an  
Iraqi defector had claimed in April that Saddam Hussein was 
developing a strain of West Nile-like encephalitis for use as a 
biological weapon, The New Yorker reported in its issue that hit 
newsstands today. 
</P>
<P>
	The defector's report was published April 6 in the Daily Mail of  
London. It was an except from the book ``In the Shadow of Saddam,'' 
written by Mikhael Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramadan claimed that he worked as one of Saddam's body doubles  
and that the Iraqi president had told him of a plan to develop a 
strain of West Nile encephalitis that would kill 97 percent of 
people in an urban environment. The magazine said Ramadan was 
believed to be hiding somewhere in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	A strain of a West Nile-like virus has claimed the lives of six  
people in the New York area since it was discovered in early 
September. The mosquito-borne virus has infected at least 54 people 
in the metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of the strain include fever and headache. In rare  
cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death. The 
elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems are most 
vulnerable.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Internet Auction Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Memorabilia from the Yankee Clipper -- a private  
man on and off the field -- soon may be only a mouse click away. 
</P>
<P>
	A Charlotte businessman who bought Joe DiMaggio's personal  
collection of signed baseballs, jerseys and other mementos of his 
legendary career, plans to auction thousands of the items on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	From autographed baseballs cards to bats, balls, uniforms and  
prints, Ralph Perullo will offer a portion of DiMaggio's personal 
collection for sale in an online auction on eBay Oct. 20-29. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being totally candid, I have no idea what to expect,'' said  
the lifelong New York Yankee fan who acquired the extensive 
collection in June. ``But I'm giving it my best shot. If you're 
ready to buy something from Joe DiMaggio's personal memorabilia, 
now is the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items to be sold include 361 signed baseballs, which  
equal the number of DiMaggio's career home runs. Some have his 
uniform No. 5 and others have the number 55, referring to his order 
of entrance into the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have put a dent in the collection,'' Perullo said in an  
interview last week. ``I've been holding back some items that have 
not been offered to the public before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the summer, Perullo purchased more than 10,000 signed items  
and more for a price he would only describe as being ``in the 
millions.'' DiMaggio died March 8 at age 84. The sale was finalized 
in June with Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio was an intelligent businessman along with being a  
great ballplayer,'' Perullo said at the time. ``When he would sign 
baseballs for a show, he always kept 50 or so for himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perullo, 58, still has trouble believing he owns the collection  
of one of the game's greatest players. He remembers going to Yankee 
Stadium with his father as a young child to watch DiMaggio play in 
the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided to go with eBay after meeting with several other  
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a strong participant with eBay because I'm a card  
collector,'' he said. ``I've purchased a lot through them and I've 
enjoyed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stevens, program manager at eBay, said his company was  
excited about the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Few sports celebrities reach the status of becoming an  
American icon like Joe DiMaggio,'' he said in a statement released 
by Perullo's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Perullo said he's anticipating good things in the wake of the  
recent auction of the Barry Halper Collection at Sotheby's Holdings 
Inc., that raised nearly $22 million. One of the biggest prices was 
the $239,000 paid by actor-comedian Billy Crystal for one of Mickey 
Mantle's gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	Halper, a New Jersey businessman and a part owner of the  
Yankees, has one of the most extensive collections of sports 
memorabilia. ``Barry Halper has raised the bar considerably,'' 
Perullo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perullo had a conversation with Halper when he attended the  
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry offered me some free advice, ``Don't fall in love with  
anything,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Perullo already was smitten with a signed bat with the No.  
56 -- commemorating DiMaggio's 1941 hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's one item I would keep, that would be it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> `Like Anything Else, It Passes' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here is one more reason to root for Bobby Bowden to win another  
national championship: 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, when the Florida State coach learned the cops planned  
to charge star receiver Peter Warrick, a teammate and a 
department-store clerk with scamming to get $412 worth of clothing 
for $21, he didn't rush home and reread ``Crime and Punishment'' or 
agonize whether he'd failed as a father figure. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't call in psychologists, psychiatrists, ministers,  
retired FBI agents or Calvin Klein to talk to his team. Instead, 
Bowden crossed his fingers and hoped the ballplayers got tagged 
with misdemeanors rather than felonies. That way, they wouldn't run 
up against a school policy barring athletes charged with felonies 
from playing until the charges are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 69, he is proof that if you live long enough and win  
often enough, speaking plainly is a virtue instead of a burden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sitting there pleading to myself for a misdemeanor,''  
Bowden said. ``I didn't want to give up a talent like that. It 
shook me. It shook our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not so anybody noticed.  
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game with once-fearsome and still-hated Miami was  
tied 21-21 at halftime, but over once the No. 1-ranked Seminoles 
played less macho-man-to-man defense and more zone. On the other 
side of the ball, meanwhile, Warrick's absence was treated with all 
the urgency of a casting call. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't hurt, of course, that FSU rolled up 485 yards in total  
offense. Quarterback Chris Weinke completed 23 of 34 passes for 332 
yards and 2 touchdowns. That included a 48-yard scoring strike to 
Germaine Stringer -- Warrick's understudy -- less than four minutes 
into the game. By the end, 10 more players caught passes. Running 
back Travis Minor turned a season-high 25 carries into a 
season-high 146 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bowden of his team, ``It tells you we're not  
one-dimensional, thank goodness. It shows you we're in the hunt 
like a few are. Nothing is given yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That last bit is Bowden's way of saying he doesn't want to go  
through this all season, but that he is prepared to. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Warrick, who passed up certain first-round  
selection in the NFL draft to return for his senior season, has a 
court date scheduled today. His attorney, former Florida State 
swimmer John Kenny, said it usually takes six weeks for the matter 
to come to trial, but he hoped to have it resolved before then. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, Peter cannot afford to take too long,'' Kenny  
said. ``He has more interest in saying, `Let's get it done.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It's rare when a lawyer for a ballplayer seeks swift justice,  
but Warrick's situation is unique. One of his principal motives for 
returning to school was a chance to win the Heisman Trophy. But 
like FSU and its no-play policy, the Downtown Athletic Club of New 
York, which hands out the Heisman, has a policy barring someone 
with a felony conviction on their record from taking it home. 
</P>
<P>
	That almost certainly won't be the reason Warrick doesn't win.  
If his case goes according to form, it seems very unlikely his next 
suit of clothes will be provided free of charge, courtesy of the 
Florida Department of Corrections. The reason felony charges 
resulted is the value of the merchandise exceeded $300. In similar 
cases, the state's attorney's office agrees to reduce the charge to 
a misdemeanor as part of a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Should that happen in this case, Warrick could be back on the  
field by the following weekend. Missing only a game or two might 
not even seriously dent his Heisman chances. Interestingly, Bowden 
didn't seem to share the sense of urgency just about everybody else 
in Warrick's camp did. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way we should make a hero out of this thing right  
now. He needs to sweat a little bit,'' Bowden said, ``but again, I 
hope he comes back. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he comes back I would tell him to take a very back seat,  
a very back seat. You go out and play the best you can play, and 
don't even think about the Heisman,'' he said. ``That's probably 
blown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake: Bowden definitely likes Warrick, not just as a  
player and not the least because he left all that NFL money on the 
table and came back to FSU. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is upset Warrick made a decision as poor as this. If the  
kid did the crime, he will, in Bowden's book, be doing the time. 
And Florida State has the luxury of a weak schedule at the moment. 
Wake Forest visits Tallahassee on Saturday, then FSU is going to 
Clemson, where Bowden will square off against son Tommy in a 
father-son coaching duel that should provide him with career win 
No. 300. 
</P>
<P>
	What Bowden knows is that he can take a repentant Warrick back  
in time for the stretch run at a second national championship, 
chastened and hungry, and everybody will be better for it. And so 
when someone asked Bowden how Warrick would handle the aggravation 
certain to accompany this whole episode, he replied, ``It's like 
anything else, in time it passes.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers Might Make Garner Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Phil Garner might replace Larry Parrish as  
manager of the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers are thought to have interviewed the former Milwaukee  
manager in recent days about the possibility of leading their club 
into a new ballpark next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no comment on that,'' Tigers' general manager Randy  
Smith said Sunday night. ``This is a delicate subject right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, fired in August after eight years at Milwaukee, would  
replace Parrish who led the Tigers to a disappointing 69-92 record 
during his first full season as a major league manager. That left 
them a distant third in the AL Central behind the Cleveland Indians 
and Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner and Smith are thought to have met either Friday or  
Saturday. If the interview went well, it is possible an 
announcement could come early this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left at Garner's home by The Associated Press wasn't  
returned. Parrish, who returned to his home in Haines City, Fla., 
after the season ended, was on a hunting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until a formal announcement is made, I can't comment on  
anything,'' Smith said. ``And I'm not saying there's going to be a 
formal announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith met last Monday with Tigers' owner Mike Ilitch and club  
president and CEO John McHale Jr. The three discussed whether they 
would retain Parrish for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale said after that meeting that no timetable had been set  
for a decision. He noted, however, that it was in everyone's best 
interest to have it done as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got together last Monday and agreed we'd say nothing about  
anything until we had something to announce,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers, who got by on a lowly $35 million payroll this  
season, are expected to take a payroll in excess of $50 million 
next season into Comerica Park, a $300 million ballpark under 
construction about a mile from Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	To manage that kind of investment, the Tigers might want someone  
with more experience than Parrish -- even if their record is no 
better than the one Parrish fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers fired Garner in the midst of the seventh straight  
losing season in his eight years in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, like Parrish, could have been the victim of having to  
work with a small-market payroll. The situation in Milwaukee, like 
Detroit, was made worse by some poor personnel decisions by the 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner's best season was his first, 1992, before the payroll gap  
between clubs got extreme. That season, he almost guided the 
Brewers past Toronto for the AL East title. Milwaukee now plays in 
the NL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Tigers are determined to dump Parrish and don't hire  
Garner, there are other candidates. They could include Atlanta 
batting coach Don Baylor or Jim Riggleman, fired last Monday by the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Riggleman managed the San Diego Padres when Smith  
became the club's GM in mid-season. Riggleman left the Padres after 
that season for the Cubs, where he had two winning seasons in five 
years.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 4, Islanders 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Stephane Quintal scored the tie-breaking  
goal with 2:46 left in regulation as the New York Rangers beat the 
New York Islanders 4-2 on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintal broke a 2-2 tie with a slap shot from the right point  
that hit off defenseman Jamie Heward. The Islanders claimed Heward 
was pushed into goaltender Felix Potvin, but referee Bill McCreary 
allowed the goal to stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Theo Fleury added an empty-net goal with 22.8 seconds left as  
the Rangers won their third straight after starting the season 
0-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Harvey and Kevin Stevens also scored for the Rangers and  
Kirk McLean stopped 20 shots for his third straight win. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Isbister and Jamie Heward scored for the Islanders, who  
lost for the sixth straight time to the Rangers. Potvin stopped 33 
shots in a strong performance in the Islanders net. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers continued to struggle with their power play. After  
five failed attempts against the Islanders, the Rangers have only 
three power-play goals in 33 opportunities, including 0-for-17 on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers controlled most of the scoreless first period,  
outshooting the Islanders 15-4. Potvin came up with several big 
saves, including one at 14:17 when he used his stick to stop 
Harvey's hard shot from in close. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens put the Rangers up 1-0 two minutes into the second  
period when his cross-ice pass hit Islanders rookie Tim Connolly's 
skate and deflected past Potvin. Harvey made it 2-0 at 7:25 when he 
scored on a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Isbister scored for the Islanders at 9:42 with a backhander from  
the left circle. The Islanders tied the game at 12:34 of the third 
when Heward put a one-timer past McLean.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- John Roethlisberger's final high bar  
routine today at the World Gymnastics Championships earned 9.525 
points and seemingly clinched a spot in the medals round for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States stood sixth with 224.594 points, while  
three-time defending champion China was far ahead with its 230.546 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia was second with 227.083, followed by Belarus with  
226.557, Japan with 226.382, South Korea with 225.319 and the 
United States. The top six teams advance to the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia was 11th with 217.645, and was likely to be pushed out  
of the top 12 teams that qualify for next year's Olympics in 
Sydney. But if it makes the top 18, it still can send two men to 
compete for individual medals. The Australian women advanced to 
Tuesday's medal round. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Japanese gymnasts scored below 9 on the high bar,  
including Naoya Tsukahara (8.600), the 1997 individual bronze 
medalist. But the team performed well in the other events, and 
Yoshihiro Saito was solid throughout, moving into a third-place tie 
in the individual standings with 57.074 points, with 19 of 46 teams 
still to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Yang Wei, who scored 9.8 on the vault, led with 57.649.  
Teammate Huang Xu had 57.299, and Bulgaria's Jordan Jovtchev tied 
Saito's 57.074. 
</P>
<P>
	American Blaine Wilson scored just behind Saito and Jovtchev,  
gaining 57.048 points including 9.562 on the high bar that helped 
set the stage for Roethlisberger's decisive routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize it was that close until I got down. I'm glad  
I didn't,'' said the 29-year-old Roethlisberger, who like Wilson is 
a four-time U.S. champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two guys (on the high bar) had a little trouble, and  
that just puts the pressure on,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women advanced into the top six with their final  
routine, as Vanessa Atler scored a 9.762 in the floor exercises 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Romania led the women's qualifying with  
154.394 points. Also reaching the finals were Russia, 153.576; 
Ukraine, 151.970; China, 151.720; the United States, 151.001, and 
Australia, 150.688. 
</P>
<P>
	Finnish gymnast Jani Tanskanen, the 1997 world champion on the  
high bar, fell from the bar on his shoulder and suffered ligament 
damage that ended his competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanskanen first was thought to have suffered a dislocated  
shoulder, but officials of the International Gymnastics Federation 
said later he hoped to return to action at the Glasgow Grand Prix 
on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanskanen jumped back on the bar and tried to continue after his  
fall, but had to give up. He was given a score of 7.775. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had to abandon his last event, the floor exercises, and  
finished with a total of 42.637 points for four events.

<HEADLINE> Four Wins Breeders' Cup Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- A disqualification gave Four on the Floor his  
third win in as many outings as he was moved from second to first 
Monday in the $220,200 Grey Breeders' Cup Stakes at Woodbine, his 
second straight major 2-year-old stakes victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The dark bay son of Academy Award crossed the finish line  
second, 8 1/2 lengths behind odds-on favorite Exciting Story. But 
Exciting Story was disqualified for interfering with Twilight 
Dreams and Prime Time Talkin on the first turn of the 1 1-16-mile 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Exciting Story was dropped to fifth, while Four on  
the Floor moved to first, Gallop'n Gold to second, Prime Time 
Talkin to third and Twilight Dreams to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim McAleney, who has ridden Four on the Floor in his three  
wins, including the Summer Stakes last month, said he was also 
interfered with on the roughly ridden first turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were at the tail end of a pretty good domino effect,'' he  
said. ``... It forced my horse out and it cost us a significant 
amount of ground going into that turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``(But) my horse ran very well. He recovered really quickly and  
got himself right back into the race. I was very happy with him. 
... He's still learning but in the long run I think he'll be a very 
good horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exciting Story, who was clocked in 1:45.12, was ridden by  
Patrick Husbands. 
</P>
<P>
	``My horse left there running. The other horse (Gallop'n Gold,  
ridden by Laurie Gulas) came straight across. I had nowhere to go 
and I had four guys on the inside of me,'' he said. ``Unfortunately 
they took my number down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four on the Floor is owned by Arthur Preston's Lor Stables. The  
Kentucky-bred collected $87,120 in the Grey, raising his career 
earnings to $191,160. 
</P>
<P>
	He paid $13.20, $5.20 and $3.60. Gallop'n Gold returned $4.70  
and $3.80, while Prime Time Talkin was $4.80 to show.

<HEADLINE> Colt's To Exit Retail Gun Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Colt's Manufacturing Co., inventor of the  
six-shooter, plans to stop taking orders for most of its retail 
handguns so it can limit its liability in lawsuits, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to reduce dramatically the number of  
commercial weapons it makes and focus instead on selling mainly to 
the military, law enforcement agencies and collectors, who account 
for the bulk of its business. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's 144-year-old retail gun business effectively will be  
stopped and the company will cancel seven product lines, partly 
because it is having trouble paying suppliers, an unnamed senior 
Colt's executive told The New York Times in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive told the Times that Colt's can no longer acquire  
loans to pay for manufacturing because of lawsuits that ``could be 
worth zero, or a trillion dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The West Hartford, Conn., company faces 28 lawsuits from cities  
and counties blaming it for gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a federal district court jury in New York City  
found that the marketing practices of Colt's and eight other gun 
manufacturers made them liable for shootings with handguns obtained 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's will lay off as many as 300 of its 700 union workers in  
Connecticut, Newsweek magazine reported in its Oct. 18 edition, 
citing unnamed industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sent a letter about its new strategy to its 19  
distributors last week and is notifying 3,000 U.S. dealers, the 
Times said. Sales to civilian consumers accounted for about 30 
percent of Colt's business, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Sliwa, president and chief executive of Colt's, was out  
of the office this morning and could not be reached for comment by 
The Associated Press. Telephone messages were left for Colt's 
spokesmen Tom Kilby and Richard Esposito.

<HEADLINE> Major Airlines Hike Advance Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- After a weekend of indecision, the largest U.S.  
air carriers by Monday had joined ranks behind a $20 increase in 
advance-purchase tickets favored by vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines made the first move late last week, saying  
it needed to raise fares to offset higher jet fuel costs. It was 
quickly joined Friday by Delta, America West Airlines and on 
Saturday by American Airlines, the nation's No. 2 carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest carrier, United Airlines, raised its fares Saturday  
but backed down Sunday night when the Minneapolis-based Northwest 
Airlines balked at the increase. By Monday, both airlines had 
raised fares. 
</P>
<P>
	``We rescinded the fare increase last night because Northwest  
had not matched, and we didn't want to be out of synch with them,'' 
Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for Chicago-based United, said Monday. 
``So this morning, we reinstated it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the largest carriers were on board, USAirways and TWA had  
reversed increases in excursion fares -- typically requiring a 
seven-, 14- or 21-day advance purchase -- as of midday Monday. 
Discount airline Southwest said it did not plan to raise prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The major carriers' increase of $20 applies to round-trip  
flights of more than 500 miles, with shorter flights increasing 
$10. Continental also tried to raise business-class fares -- 
more-expensive seats sold without an advance-purchase requirement -- 
but other major airlines had refused to go along and by late Monday 
Continental had withdrawn the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, an Internet site that  
sells discount travel tickets, said that despite collapse of the 
business fare hike, there was a 98 percent chance the leisure-fare 
increase would stick. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only business I know where people raise prices to  
be competitive,'' said Parsons, who said five rounds of fare 
increases this year have added 14.5 percent to 17.5 percent -- 
depending on the route -- to the cost of leisure travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Engel, an airline analyst with Goldman Sachs, was  
underwhelmed by the fare increase. ``It's irrelevant. Very few 
tickets are bought at these prices,'' said Engel, who calculates 
that airlines are discounting about 25 to 30 percent off their base 
leisure fares in heavily advertised campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent increase adds about 3 to 7 percent for the base  
price of most leisure fares. The impact of the increase is smaller 
on the most expensive routes, such as Boston-Los Angeles, which 
rose from $659 to $679, but more on shorter routes such as 
Dallas-Nashville, up from $340 to $360. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline executives said they needed to raise prices to rebuild  
profits that have been eroded by higher jet fuel costs. Spot-market 
jet fuel has risen from about 30 cents a gallon to more than 55 
cents a gallon this year.

<HEADLINE> Colt May End Consumer Handgun Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The Colt's Manufacturing Co.,  
inventor of the six-shooter, plans to stop taking orders for most 
of its retail handguns so it can limit its liability in lawsuits, 
according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing unidentified industry sources, Newsweek magazine reports  
that the gunmaker also will lay off as many as 300 of its 700 union 
workers in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the reports, the company plans to reduce  
dramatically the number of commercial weapons it makes and focus 
instead on selling to the military, law enforcement agencies and 
collectors, who already account for the bulk of its business. 
</P>
<P>
	While the gun-maker informed distributors last week that it  
would discontinue at least three of its product lines, Colt's 
executives strongly disputed the implication that the company was 
shedding a major segment of its business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is that we are oversold on virtually  
all our guns. They are very much in demand, all of these handguns, 
principally by collectors. We intend to produce sufficient quantity 
to service the demand,'' Carlton Chen, vice president and general 
counsel for Colt's, told The Hartford Courant on Sunday. ``So I 
hardly think that is exiting the handgun business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Chen acknowledged that layoffs were being considered.  
</P>
<P>
	Colt's is going to give its distributors one more chance to buy  
the guns the company is planning to eliminate, the newspaper said. 
The size of those final orders will help determine the size and the 
timing of any immediate personnel cutbacks, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Sliwa, Colt's president and chief executive, was out of  
the office this morning and could not be reached for comment by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Colt's the biggest victim of lawsuits filed against the  
gun industry, Newsweek reported that it is having trouble paying 
its vendors and hopes to avoid the damage of a possible jury 
verdict by abandoning the handgun business -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to focus on what we know we can make money on, without  
taking that risk,'' Newsweek quoted a Colt's executive as saying. 
``It's extremely painful when you have to withdraw from a business 
for irrational reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times quoted an unidentified Colt's executive as  
saying it would cancel seven product lines. The executive said Colt 
can no longer acquire loans to pay for manufacturing because of 
lawsuits that ``could be worth zero, or a trillion dollars,'' the 
executive said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 144-year-old company, based in West Hartford, faces 28  
lawsuits from cities and counties blaming it for gun violence. In 
February, a federal district court jury in New York City found that 
the marketing practices of Colt's and eight other gun manufacturers 
made them liable for shootings with handguns obtained illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's will keep making military and collectible guns, Newsweek  
reported. And its new start-up company -- iColt -- plans to market a 
``smart gun,'' which can be fired only by the owner, sometime next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's will, at the very least, continue to produce some  
collectible weapons, including its trademark Colt 45, and the Model 
P, a replica of Samuel Colt's famous six-shooter.

<HEADLINE> Utah's Malone May Play With Sprain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone has been  
diagnosed with a lower back sprain but isn't expected to miss 
Wednesday night's exhibition opener against Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Malone was hurt sometime during training camp  
last week in Boise, Idaho, and the injury has persisted. Malone 
missed practice Monday and trainers planned to hold him out again 
Tuesday as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	A team spokesman said the perennial NBA All-Star was expected to  
play in Utah's first exhibition game in Ogden, Utah. The Jazz play 
again on Friday night, meeting the Seattle Supersonics in Boise. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting his 15th season in the NBA, Malone has kept himself in  
superb health through rigorous offseason workouts. Last year he won 
his second league MVP award after averaging 23.8 points.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Irvin Injures Neck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dallas receiver Michael Irvin injured his neck and spinal cord  
in Philadelphia on Sunday and was carried off the field in a 
stretcher, but he was able to move his hands and feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was taken to a hospital, where tests showed swelling in  
the spinal cord and a herniated disc. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who rode in the ambulance with Irvin,  
refused to speculate about the seriousness of the injury. The 
hospital didn't release any information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that he needed me, because I knew his family would want  
me to be there to give them information,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another star receiver, Denver's Shannon Sharpe, broke his left  
collarbone against Oakland. It wasn't immediately known how long 
Sharpe would be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin caught a short pass from Troy Aikman in the first quarter,  
tried to shake a tackle from Bobby Taylor and was hit on the head 
by safety Tim Hauck. As Taylor tackled Irvin, Hauck's shoulder pad 
collided with the side of Irvin's helmet, twisting his head 
awkwardly as it hit the artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was scheduled to spend the night in the hospital, then  
return to Dallas on Jones' jet as early as Monday. Cowboys doctor 
Robert Vandermeer said the herniated disc probably was an old 
injury that wasn't caused by the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin moved his fingers and appeared to be talking as he lay on  
his back for more than 10 minutes. He was fitted with a neck brace 
and loaded onto a stretcher as his teammates circled in prayer 
across the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans at Veterans Stadium cheered when they realized Irvin  
was down. Players on both sides said they were disgusted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know our fans pride themselves on being tough, but that  
wasn't tough,'' Eagles receiver Charles Johnson said. ``That was 
just plain ignorant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' Emmitt Smith said: ``It disgusted me to death. This is  
just a game. Life, paralyzation and death are a reality. Sport is 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles went on to beat the Cowboys 13-10.  
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was injured in the third quarter against the Raiders,  
adding to the Broncos' long list of serious injuries this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, who has gone to seven consecutive Pro Bowls and is tied  
for first among NFL tight ends with three 1,000-yard receiving 
seasons, was hit by two defenders and landed hard as he attempted 
to catch a pass from Brian Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos already are missing running back Terrell Davis and  
linebacker John Mobley for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa bay running back Warrick Dunn sprained his left knee late  
in the Buccaneers' loss to Green Bay. He hopped off under his own 
power but did not return to the game. Tampa Bay is off next week. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis running back Marshall Faulk injured a hip in the first  
quarter of the Rams' 42-20 victory over San Francisco. He returned 
later, but had just 6 yards on seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same game, 49ers defensive lineman Marvin Washington was  
knocked out for the season with a ruptured quadriceps tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago quarterback Shane Matthews played well in the Bears'  
24-22 victory over Minnesota before pulling his right hamstring 
while scrambling early in the fourth quarter. He completed 19 of 28 
passes for 184 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans quarterback Billy Joe Hobert missed most of Sunday's  
20-17 loss to the Atlanta Falcons after getting a neck stinger on a 
second-quarter sack, the same injury he suffered a week earlier in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last week, when Hobert was carted off, he walked off the  
field Sunday after remaining down for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The battered Detroit defense got more bad news during a 20-10  
loss to San Diego. Starting middle linebacker Stephen Boyd left the 
game with a strained arch, defensive tackle Luther Elliss strained 
his groin and backup linebacker Andre Collins sprained an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore managed just 246 yards in offense in a 14-11 loss to  
Tennessee as Pro Bowl left tackle Jonathan Ogden missed most of the 
game after straining his neck.

<HEADLINE> Global Crossing To Buy Racal Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecommunications company Global Crossing Ltd.  
has agreed to buy Racal Telecom, a part of Britain's Racal 
Electronics PLC, for about $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition announced Monday is another big step for  
fast-growing Global Crossing, which owns and operates an advanced 
fiber-optic network in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, Bermuda-based Global Crossing will pay  
$1.57 billion in cash and assume Racal Telecom lease obligations 
worth $82.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still must be approved by Racal shareholders and  
regulatory authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Based at Bracknell, west of London, Racal Telecom operates  
fiber-optic telecommunications links between 2,000 towns and cities 
in the United Kingdom. It adds to Global Crossing's existing 
British operations and a pan-European network now being developed, 
said Bob Annunziata, chief executive of Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Annunziata estimated that the acquisition would yield net  
savings of about $450 million a year. No jobs are expected to be 
cut from among Racal Telecom's 1,300 employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In clinching the deal, Global Crossing outbid Energis, a British  
telecommunications firm, which had earlier offered an estimated 
$1.32 billion for Racal Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing which recently acquired U.S. phone service  
provider Frontier Corp., and it agreed in May to pay $908 million 
for the underwater cable-laying business of Britain's Cable &AMP; 
Wireless PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing offers the Racal business ``a certain critical  
mass'' that is necessary for survival amid the rapid consolidation 
in the telecommunications industry, said Racal spokesman David 
Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
	Racal shareholders would benefit from a reduction in company  
debt and a large cash payout, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After selling its telecommunications network, Racal's business  
would consist mostly of defense and industrial electronics and 
transportation services.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Irvin Has Spine Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Michael Irvin lay motionless on the Veterans  
Stadium turf, his teammates gathered in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was hospitalized overnight with swelling in his spine  
after a scary neck injury in the Dallas Cowboys' 13-10 loss to the 
Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Once word reached the Dallas locker room that Irvin was able to  
move his arms and legs, his teammates expressed their anger at fan 
reaction that was boorish and outrageous even by Philadelphia 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Incredibly, many fans cheered while Irvin lay on the artificial  
turf for about 15 minutes late in the first quarter. It was enough 
to anger even a player on the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know our fans pride themselves on being tough, but that  
wasn't tough,'' said Eagles receiver Charles Johnson, whose 28-yard 
TD reception from Doug Pederson was the game-winner with 67 seconds 
left. ``That was just plain ignorant. ... I was embarrassed to 
stand on the sideline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people need to grow up,'' an angry Emmitt Smith said.  
``Some people need to grow up and find some inner peace, because 
there is no peace in watching somebody suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, a five-time Pro Bowl selection and vocal member of the  
best Dallas teams this decade, caught an 8-yard pass from Troy 
Aikman with 5:16 left in the first. He tried to shake a tackle from 
Bobby Taylor and was hit on the head by safety Tim Hauck as he hit 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As Taylor tackled Irvin, Hauck's shoulder pad collided with the  
side of Irvin's helmet -- a clean hit that twisted Irvin's head 
awkwardly as it hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was taken to the spinal unit at Thomas Jefferson Hospital,  
where an MRI showed swelling in the spinal cord in two places near 
the base of the skull and a herniated disc. He had movement in his 
feet and hands, team doctor Robert Vandermeer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin hasn't missed a game due to injury since the 1990 season,  
but Vandermeer reacted angrily when asked if Irvin could play next 
week. Vandermeer said he didn't know if the injury was 
career-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so, but I don't know,'' Vandermeer said. ``We'll  
have to evaluate him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Jerry Jones, who rode in the ambulance with Irvin,  
said it was ``way too speculative'' to say how serious the injury 
was. The hospital barred a reporter from entering, and would 
release no information. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was expected to fly to Dallas as early as today in Jones'  
private jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that he needed me, because I knew his family would want  
me to be there to give them information,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who moved his fingers and appeared to be talking as he  
lay on his back, was fitted with a neck brace and loaded onto a 
stretcher as his teammates circled in prayer across the field. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Cowboys' prayer group broke up, Sanders nervously  
circled his fallen teammate while medical staff attended to him. As 
Irvin was loaded into the ambulance, ``He said that he was going to 
be OK and he gave me the old Michael Irvin smile,'' said Sanders, 
disgusted by the cheers from Philadelphia fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ignorance and stupidity, but I expect that,'' Sanders  
said. ``That's one of the sick things about our game, that people 
can actually cheer upon a man's injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vandermeer said the herniated disc probably was an old injury  
that wasn't caused by the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch was the 750th of Irvin's career, tying Charlie Joiner  
for ninth in NFL history.

<HEADLINE> Braves Face Another Hurdle in LCS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Excuse the Braves if they feel like they've been  
down this road before. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating New York five times in the final two weeks of the  
regular season and cruising to the division title, Atlanta finds 
those same Mets standing in the way of its first trip to the World 
Series since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to life in the wild-card era.  
</P>
<P>
	``This series is 0-0,'' Chipper Jones said, looking ahead to the  
start of the NL championship series Tuesday night at Turner Field. 
``The first team with four wins is going to the World Series. 
They're riding a lot of momentum, and we've been playing good 
ourselves for the last month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta reached its eighth straight LCS by defeating the Houston  
Astros in the opening round, finishing off the triumph with a 7-5 
victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	About the time the Braves were popping champagne corks at the  
Astrodome, Todd Pratt hit a 10th-inning homer against Arizona to 
send the New York Mets to their first LCS since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta dominated New York during the regular season and won the  
East by seven games. But those standings don't mean a thing now, as 
the Braves learned two years ago when they lost to wild-card 
Florida in the championship series after finishing nine games ahead 
of the Marlins in the division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had four tons of bricks on our backs two years ago,'' John  
Smoltz said. ``It consumed some of us. Now, who cares if we're the 
team of the decade? They're going to forget these 10 years some 
day. All we care about is we've got a chance to win again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta beat the Mets 9-3 in the season series, winning five of  
six games in the final two weeks to seemingly knock New York out of 
the postseason. But the Mets swept their final series, beat 
Cincinnati in a wild-card playoff and knocked off 100-game winner 
Arizona in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys never gave up,'' Atlanta's Brian Jordan said.  
``They stuck together as a team and right now they're on a high. 
We're on a high, too, so it should be a great series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves are expected to stick with the same rotation they  
used in the opening round, which means Greg Maddux (19-9) will 
start Game 1 on Tuesday night at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Millwood (18-7), who had a one-hitter and a save against  
the Astros, will go in Game 2 Wednesday, followed by Tom Glavine 
(14-11) and Smoltz (11-8) when the series shifts to Shea Stadium 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing Game 1 in the best-of-5 division series, the Braves  
won three in a row over the Astros -- including a 12-inning, 5-3 
victory Friday that will be remembered for many years if Atlanta 
goes on to win its second World Series title of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston was on the verge of winning the pivotal third game,  
loading the bases with no outs in the 10th. But John Rocker escaped 
the jam -- largely due to a brilliant defensive play by shortstop 
Walt Weiss -- and Jordan's two-out, two-run double clinched the 
victory in the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the Braves have been defying the odds all year. They  
lost cleanup hitter Andres Galarraga and closer Kerry Ligtenberg 
before opening day, then overcame season-ending injuries to Javy 
Lopez, Rudy Seanez and Odalis Perez to win more games than any team 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year is special,'' said Smoltz, who won the deciding game  
against the Astros. ``We won 103 games. There is no way we thought 
we could go that. I can't tell you how many times this season that 
I thought we had lost and we came back to sneak out a victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why the businesslike Braves celebrated Saturday  
like little kids, swilling champagne, playfully dousing teammates 
and puffing on victory cigars after beating the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a team,'' Jones said, ``that goes out there every day  
and plays on sheer will and pride and knows that great things are 
going to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Atlanta's Jones Readies for N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Chipper Jones did his part to knock the New York  
Mets out of the playoffs. Now, he's got to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Having withstood Jones' four-homer, MVP-like barrage late in the  
season, the Mets are still hanging around. And they wasted little 
time focusing on the Atlanta Braves third baseman as the lightning 
rod for their barbs heading into the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, New York manager Bobby Valentine took umbrage at  
Jones telling the Mets fans to ``go put on their Yankees stuff'' 
after the Braves took two of three games at Shea Stadium in final 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones arrived at the Turner Field clubhouse on Monday, wearing a  
stock car racing cap and in no mood to keep this exchange going. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby can turn my comments any way he wants,'' the Braves star  
said. ``The last thing I want to do is get in a newspaper war with 
Bobby Valentine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to Valentine's assessment, Jones insisted he has  
nothing but respect for the Mets, who lost five of six games to the 
Braves in the final two weeks of the regular season but still made 
the playoffs as a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones homered four times during a three-game sweep of the Mets  
at Turner Field, then endured the wrath of the New York fans when 
the teams met again the following week at Shea. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Braves sent the Mets to the brink of elimination by  
winning two games, Jones said it was almost as much fun as winning 
the World Series. He seemed to have a grudge against the Mets all 
season, hitting .400 (16-of-40) with seven homers, 16 RBIs and four 
stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	New York rebounded to win its final three games, beat Cincinnati  
in a wild-card playoff and upset Arizona in the opening round of 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the two best teams in the National League are playing  
each other in the league championship series,'' Jones said. ``Their 
backs were against the wall. A lot of people were counting them 
out. But you've got to give them credit. They came back from the 
dead and here they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his comments in New York were directed more at the fans  
than the Mets themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always say things in the heat of battle that maybe you  
don't mean,'' Jones said. ``Don't get me wrong. They have my utmost 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first two games in the best-of-7 series are at Turner Field.  
When the series shifts to New York for the weekend, Jones is 
prepared for hostile treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing the fans say or do is going to take me out of my  
game,'' he said. ``The guys on the field affect what I do. Me and 
the fans can jaw all we want, but it's going to have no affect on 
the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleanup hitter Brian Jordan, who hits behind Jones in the  
Atlanta order, doesn't think his teammate will change his icy 
demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chipper has been calm, cool and collected all year long,''  
Jordan said. ``Words are words. You can't change them. You've just 
got to go out there, play your game and let your actions speak. ... 
Believe me, they're going to come at Chipper, and he's going to 
come through for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 27, rebounded from personal turmoil -- he admitted to  
fathering an illegitimate child and wound up divorcing his wife -- 
to have the greatest season of his career. He hit .319 with 45 
homers, 110 RBIs and 25 stolen bases, virtually carrying the Braves 
late in the season when Jordan was rendered powerless by a sore 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	But good news for the Mets: Jones was only 3-of-13 (.231) in the  
opening-round victory over the Houston Astros and showed a tendency 
to swing at poor pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they will pitch me just like Houston did,'' Jones  
said. ``I'm not swinging the bat like I was three weeks ago. 
Certainly, the pitching has something to do with that. I've got to 
be patient and hope I hit the mistakes.''

<HEADLINE> Weight: Genes or Discipline? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's problems with extra weight are not  
so much in our genes as they are in our discipline, researchers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a little less eating or more activity is all it would take  
to turn around weight problems that kill many Americans early, the 
researchers say. Just the same, we don't do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modest changes in what we are eating, and what we are doing  
may go a long way,'' said Dr. William H. Dietz, director of the 
Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity at the federal Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty calories a day less food or more exercise works out to 5  
pounds less weight over a year -- and doubling the lost calories 
means doubling the lost weight. 
</P>
<P>
	America's weight problem doesn't look primarily genetic, Dietz  
said. Data show the most graphic gains in weight came from 1980 
through 1994, and ``the genes didn't change substantially,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 55 percent of adults weigh too much. The implication is  
that people got that way by eating more and being active less. 
</P>
<P>
	Weight control looks even more important now that a new study  
links even moderate excess weight to a greater risk of dying early. 
The American Cancer Society report, published Thursday in the New 
England Journal of Medicine, found the risk began to rise with a 
body mass index -- a weight-to-height ratio -- that would fit a 
5-foot-5 woman of 150 pounds, or a 5-foot-10 man of 174 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A study in the October edition of the American Journal of Public  
Health looked at the lifetime health and economic benefits if obese 
people lost 10 percent of their weight and kept it off. Their life 
expectancy would increase by 2 to 7 months, and the lifetime 
medical costs of five obesity-related diseases would fall by as 
much as $5,300, said researchers at Harvard Medical School and a 
private firm, Policy Analysis Inc. of Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Small permanent changes are what we should strive for, rather  
than radical or punitive weight loss programs,'' said the cancer 
society study's lead author, Eugenia E. Calle. 
</P>
<P>
	It could start with as little as a daily 15-minute walk out your  
front door and a 15-minute walk back, she said. It also could 
involve eating more fruits and vegetables, and less high-calorie 
processed foods, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen if people will do it. The latest figures  
from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance Survey find no 
meaningful change in the proportion of Americans who meet even the 
minimum levels recommended by CDC, the surgeon general and the 
American College of Sports Medicine. The groups call for 30 minutes 
of moderate activity -- such as brisk walks for at least 10 minutes, 
three times a day -- on most days. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 risk factors data show almost 30 percent of Americans  
are inactive, said epidemiologist Carol Macera of CDC's physical 
activity and health branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Community health experts think that, through cars, escalators  
and other labor-saving machinery, America has engineered out its 
ability to get activity in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since about 1950, we have designed our communities and  
environments to be automobile-driven,'' said CDC health scientist 
Richard E. Killingsworth. The average person takes about 8 to 10 
trips a day to such places as work, school or shopping, and 90 
percent are by car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not realistic to think Americans will give up their cars,  
but ``if we can replace 2 to 3 auto trips (per day), think of the 
public health benefit we would get,'' Killingsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC and other organizations have been trying to encourage  
walking, starting with the young. The National Walk Our Children to 
School Day campaign was aimed at getting parents and children who 
live within one mile of school to start walking instead of being 
driven. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort ``should continue all year long,'' said Jessica  
Shisler, the CDC's project coordinator for the program.

                            *Frank Baker    	
</P>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The Rev. Frank Baker, an authority on  
Methodism founder John Wesley, died Monday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	An ordained minister and author of 30 books and more than 200  
articles, Baker retired from Duke University in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke Divinity School dean L. Gregory Jones called Baker ``the  
leading authority on the history of the Wesleys and early 
Methodism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker was ordained as a Methodist minister in 1937 and served  
pastorates in central and northern England until 1959. He joined 
the Duke Divinity School faculty in 1960 and retired as professor 
emeritus of English church history. 
</P>
<P>

	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- E. William Crotty, a major Democratic  
fund-raiser who became U.S. Ambassador to the Eastern Caribbean 
last year, died Sunday of pneumonia. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Crotty, a longtime Daytona Beach attorney and civic activist,  
was ambassador to seven nations -- Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, 
Dominica, St. Lucia, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent 
and The Grenadines. He was appointed to the post in November and 
was based in Barbados. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Milt Jackson, a jazz vibraphonist who made the  
instrument sing like the human voice as a longtime member of the 
Modern Jazz Quartet, died Saturday of liver cancer. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was one of the best improvisers in jazz and an  
outstanding blues player. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson originally was a singer in a Detroit gospel quartet. In  
the 1940s, he created a new sound by slowing the motor on his 
Deagan Vibraharp's oscillator to a third of the speed of Lionel 
Hampton's. The result was a warm, smoky sound with a vibrato 
approximating his own singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's style came from Charlie Parker, whose rhythmic traits  
he adopted. He was one of the first bona fide be-bop vibraphone 
musicians, and he became a jewel in Dizzy Gillespie's band. He 
recorded be-bop classics with the band, such as ``A Night in 
Tunisia,'' ``Anthropology'' and ``Two Bass Hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, Jackson teamed with Thelonius Monk, recording ``Criss  
Cross'' and ``Straight, No Chaser,'' among others. 
</P>
<P>
	When a pianist in Gillespie's band, John Lewis, decided to form  
a new group, one going beyond soloists with a rhythm section, 
Jackson signed on. In 1952, the Modern Jazz Quartet was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Through 20 years of albums, mostly for Atlantic records, the  
group became one of the first jazz bands embraced by an audience 
much wider than jazz fans. Members choreographed all aspects of 
their presentation, from walking on stage to playing their subdued 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	The band dissolved in 1974 and reunited temporarily for a few  
tours in the 1980s and early 1990s.

<P>
	ALLIANCE, Ohio (AP) -- Monsignor Joseph Krispinsky, a longtime  
religious leader in northeast Ohio, died Thursday. He was 99. 
</P>
<P>
	He was found unconscious at his home Oct. 4 and died from  
pneumonia and complications from a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Krispinsky was ordained a priest in 1923.  
</P>
<P>
	He was assistant pastor of churches in Cleveland, Lakewood,  
Warren and Youngstown before becoming pastor of Sacred Heart Church 
in Canton in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1941, Krispinsky became pastor of SS. Cyril and Methodius  
Church in Warren, where he stayed for 32 years.

	The son of a Saltsburg, Pa., coal miner, Lake received his  
bachelor's degree in pharmacy and chemistry from Temple University 
in 1941. He served in the Army in World War II, rising to the rank 
of major. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake began his career with Lilly in 1946 in sales. He was  
president from 1973-1976 and served on the board of directors from 
1965-1989. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1977-1992, Lake also was chairman of the Lilly Endowment,  
one of the largest private foundations in the nation. He served as

<HEADLINE> Suharto Escapes Prosecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Former President Suharto has escaped  
prosecution on allegations of corruption, but his hand-picked 
successor, B.J. Habibie, risks being kicked out of office when 
angry lawmakers choose a new head of state next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Worst still for violence-wracked Indonesia, the student  
protesters who drove Suharto from power 16 months ago -- and who 
have clashed repeatedly with security forces since then -- 
threatened Monday to hit the streets again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very angry about this decision. Habibie only wants to  
protect the old man,'' said one member of the radical Forkot 
student group, who identified herself only as Dina. ``We will 
protest again until Suharto is put on trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Indonesia's top legal officer announced he had  
dropped a corruption investigation against Suharto, citing lack of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismudjoko, Indonesia's acting attorney general, said a 15-month  
inquiry uncovered some irregularities by wealthy charitable 
foundations headed by Suharto, but nothing to prove he illegally

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Bengals activated tackle Jamain  
Stephens on Monday, a week after he finished a four-game suspension 
for substance abuse, and waived linebacker Jimmy Sprotte. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals claimed Stephens off waivers from Pittsburgh in  
August. He missed the first four games because of the NFL's 
suspension, and the Bengals had a one-week grace period before 
having to activate or release him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprotte, a second-year player out of Arizona, appeared in the  
first four games and had one tackle on special teams. He was 
inactive Sunday for an 18-17 victory in Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Colt's To Exit Retail Gun Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Colt's Manufacturing Co., inventor of the  
six-shooter, plans to stop taking orders for most of its retail 
handguns so it can limit its liability in lawsuits, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to reduce dramatically the number of  
commercial weapons it makes and focus instead on selling mainly to 
the military, law enforcement agencies and collectors, who account 
for the bulk of its business. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's 144-year-old retail gun business effectively will be  
stopped and the company will cancel seven product lines, partly 
because it is having trouble paying suppliers, an unnamed senior 
Colt's executive told The New York Times in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive told the Times that Colt's can no longer acquire  
loans to pay for manufacturing because of lawsuits that ``could be 
worth zero, or a trillion dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The West Hartford, Conn., company faces 28 lawsuits from cities  
and counties blaming it for gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a federal district court jury in New York City  
found that the marketing practices of Colt's and eight other gun 
manufacturers made them liable for shootings with handguns obtained 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's will lay off as many as 300 of its 700 union workers in  
Connecticut, Newsweek magazine reported in its Oct. 18 edition, 
citing unnamed industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sent a letter about its new strategy to its 19  
distributors last week and is notifying 3,000 U.S. dealers, the 
Times said. Sales to civilian consumers accounted for about 30 
percent of Colt's business, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Sliwa, president and chief executive of Colt's, was out  
of the office this morning and could not be reached for comment by 
The Associated Press. Telephone messages were left for Colt's 
spokesmen Tom Kilby and Richard Esposito.

<HEADLINE> Gays Urged To Renounce Homosexuality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gay activists hissed, booed and screamed  
Monday as the Rev. Jerry Falwell lectured via satellite to a group 
of gays and lesbians about giving up homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of ACT UP San Francisco threw a blueberry pie at a  
member of the group that organized Falwell's speech from Lynchburg, 
Va., to about 60 people in a building in Golden Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Christian bigots out of our city,'' cried Josh Trenter, who  
was hauled away by police after allegedly tossing the pie. He and 
another member of his gay rights group were cited for battery and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``God loves you and so do I,'' Falwell told the audience. ``Just  
as people can come out of the closet, so can people choose to come 
out against a sinful lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The presentation was designed ``to reach out to the homosexual  
community in a spirit of love,'' said Allen Wildmon, a spokesman 
for the American Family Association, a conservative Christian group 
that sponsored the event with Falwell. Wildmon is the brother of 
the association's founder, Donald Wildmon. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Johnston, the pie's intended target, said he walked away  
from relationships with men after testing positive for HIV in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we really believe what we say we believe, it would be  
hateful not to reach out and share the Christian gospel with these 
people,'' he said. ``If we really hated them, we would leave them 
alone and let them go on their way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was chosen to coincide with National Coming Out Day,  
an annual event celebrating gay life. 
</P>
<P>
	It also came as trial began for one of the men accused of  
killing gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard. Falwell, 
whom critics have blamed for inciting violence against gays, 
condemned Shepard's killing.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Mobster Held for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another son of a one-time Mafia boss is behind  
bars. 
</P>
<P>
	First, John A. ``Junior'' Gotti, son of the former boss of New  
York's Gambino crime family, was sentenced to nearly 6 1/2 years in 
prison for bribery, extortion, gambling and fraud. Then, on Sunday, 
Alphonse ``Allie Boy'' Persico, whose father once ran the Colombo 
crime family, was ordered held without bail on loan-sharking 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Persico, 45, was charged after investigators  
found papers showing he was involved in loan-sharking, extortion 
and bank fraud. He allegedly took control of the Colombo family 
several years after his father, Carmine ``The Snake'' Persico, was 
sentenced to 100 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Arlene Lindsay ordered that the younger Persico,  
who surrendered early Saturday, be held without bail. He was to be 
taken by federal marshals to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where goes on 
trial Wednesday on a separate weapons possession charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Walden said a complaint filed  
against Persico was ``a bare-bones sketch of some of the truth that 
will come out at trial. ... It is an overwhelming case against Mr. 
Persico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walden said Persico committed crimes that violated the terms of  
his bail in the Florida case. He also told Lindsay that 
investigators had seen Persico with high-ranking members of the 
Colombo family. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan-sharking, racketeering, and bank fraud charges carry a  
maximum of 70 years in prison, Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Persico's lawyer, Barry Levin, said his client had done nothing  
illegal, and that prosecutors were out to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The search warrant was a pretext to harass him,'' Levin said  
before the arraignment in Brooklyn federal court. ``They stayed in 
the house for 16 hours, tearing the place up and down, and they 
came up with a lot of nothing. ... They just put away Gotti's son, 
now they want to put away Persico's son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Junior'' Gotti was sentenced Sept. 3.  
</P>
<P>
	Persico was acquitted in 1994 in a racketeering and murder case  
stemming from a reported war for control of the Colombo family. He 
previously served seven years for racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin said Persico now spends most of his time in Florida and  
runs family businesses including a limousine company, a coffee 
wholesaling operation and several restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not involved in any criminal activity,'' Levin said.  
Most of the time, he added, ``You'll find him in a pair of shorts 
and slippers on a boat in Florida.''

<HEADLINE> Security Guard Kills 3 Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A man killed three upstairs neighbors  
before taking his own life, leaving a wounded 2-year-old girl 
sitting in her high chair amid the bloodbath. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorenzo ``Sol'' Silva, a 63-year-old security guard, had been  
friendly with the young family who lived on the second floor of the 
two-story home he shared with his mother. But recently his mental 
condition worsened and he couldn't sleep without his mother in the 
room and a light on, said his brother, Silvestre Silva. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had been nervous for years,'' Silva said. ``I saw him last  
week -- he looked like he wanted to grab you. It was like he was 
drowning. He looked like he was seeing a ghost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not know what prompted the shooting.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said Silva finished the graveyard shift at the San  
Francisco airport and came home early Sunday. About 1:30 p.m., he 
marched upstairs with a handgun -- one of the half a dozen guns he 
kept in his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	He fatally shot Noel Ridual, his wife, Josephine, both 28, and a  
friend who lived with the couple, Ola Marquisias, 32. The Riduals' 
daughter, Jessica, was wounded in the shoulder and was in fair 
condition Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Downstairs, members of the Silva family heard the gunshots and  
went upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the four bodies and the baby crying'' in her high chair,  
said Silva's brother-in-law, Buen Liriors. ``There was blood all 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silvestre Silva said that his brother had been taking medication  
and that family members had urged him to see a priest or return to 
his native Philippines to meet with a faith healer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot believe he would do this,'' his brother said. ``He's  
not aggressive. The people upstairs were his friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ridual, a math teacher, and Ms. Marquisias, a special  
education teacher, came to the United States from the Philippines 
through a program that brings foreign educators into San Francisco 
classrooms for five-year stints. This summer, Ridual brought his 
wife and daughter over. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members said Lorenzo Silva had been separated from his  
wife of 35 years for some time, and last year she returned to the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva had worked at the airport for 20 years. Airport officials  
did not return calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Marquisias ``was such a superb educator and human being. She  
had a smile that could light up a room,'' said Elaine Koury, school 
district spokeswoman.

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Dan Marino redeemed himself.  
</P>
<P>
	Criticized by coach Jimmy Johnson after a loss to Buffalo,  
Marino passed for 393 yards and hit Oronde Gadsden on two big 
passes in the closing minutes as the Miami Dolphins beat the 
Indianapolis Colts 34-31 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't always say the right things, but I say what I feel,''  
said Johnson, who found little to fault Marino this time. ``Danny 
was fantastic. After the first quarter, he did just a super job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winning TD came after an apparent sack and fumble by Marino  
were reversed.

	After watching a replay, officials ruled Marino's arm was going  
forward and that it was an incomplete pass, keeping the Miami (3-1) 
drive alive at midfield with 1:16 to go. After two more 
incompletions, Marino passed 48 yards to Gadsden at the 2. Two 
plays later Gadsden made a leaping catch in the end zone, barely 
keeping both feet inbounds, for the winning touchdown with 27 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``The replay system is not going to be perfect, but it's better  
than nothing,'' Johnson said. ``I'm sure glad it did work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Dolphins lost to the Bills 23-18 last Monday night,  
Johnson said Marino became flustered by Buffalo's pass rush and was 
at fault on two interceptions and a fumble returned for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Johnson nor Marino wanted to talk about that on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``After 17 years, you don't know how long you're going to play.  
So you want to keep having fun. Throwing the winning touchdown with 
27 seconds left is still big,'' Marino said. ``We're playing our 
guts out. Give a lot of guys credit for hanging in like we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts (2-2), who got three touchdown passes by Peyton  
Manning and a 97-yard kickoff return by Terrence Wilkins, had their 
final drive end on a pass interception by Terrell Buckley with 16 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts thought Marino fumbled on the play that was ruled an  
incompletion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to comment on it,'' said Indianapolis coach Jim  
Mora. ``If I criticize the officials, I'm going to get fined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts led 17-9 after the first of Manning's two TD passes to  
Marcus Pollard, but Marino passed 28 yards to Tony Martin for a 
score early in the final period. After Wilkins' long touchdown 
return, Marino passed 23 yards to Martin to set up a 25-yard TD run 
by rookie Cecil Collins, the longest run by the Dolphins this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Colts rookie Edgerrin James then ran for 21 and 14 yards, and  
Manning passed 32 yards for the second touchdown by Pollard as 
Indianapolis went ahead 31-22 with 8:14 to go. The Dolphins, who 
drove inside the Indianapolis 10 four times without scoring a 
touchdown, reached the Colts 25 before Olindo Mare hit his fourth 
field goal, a 43-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts were pinned near their own goal line on the next  
possession, and Manning deliberately ran out of the end zone for a 
safety, giving the Colts a free kick, still holding a 4-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino started the Dolphins on their winning drive from their  
own 36 with 1:50 left, completing two passes to Martin to midfield 
before the apparent fumble on a tackle by Shawn King. For the game, 
Marino was 25-for-38. Martin had 10 catches for 166 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dont think Dan had to do anything today to ensure his spot  
in the Hall of Fame,'' said Manning, who was 17-for-24 for 274 
yards. ``I've always admired him. His career is one you'd like to 
model yourself after. That's the kind of quarterback I'd like to 
be, that consistent for that many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, who came in with a career-low 74.3 quarterback rating,  
did little wrong in the first half, except for not getting into the 
end zone. Miami drove inside the Colts 10 three times in the first 
half, once to the 1, but had to settle for field goals of 37, 27 
and 21 yards by Mare. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Miami's O.J. McDuffie and the Colts' Marvin Harrison each  
extended streaks for consecutive games with at least one reception. 
McDuffie has caught a pass in 66 straight games and Harrison has 
receptions in all 48 of his NFL games. ... Harrison, who caught a 
33-yarder from Manning in the second quarter, has TD catches in 
four straight games, the longest streak by a Colt since Jerry 
Richardson in 1968. ... Mare improved his Miami record for field 
goal accuracy by making all four of his attempts. He's made 63 of 
77 attempts, including 13 of 14 this year, and has had at least one 
in 14 consecutive games. ... Pollard had never caught two TD passes 
in his previous 59 games and had only five scoring receptions until 
Sunday. ... Marino finished the game only seven yards short of 
reaching the 60,000-yard mark. The Colts failed to sack Marino for 
the third consecutive time and have sacked him only 27 times in 32 
games. In that time, Marino has completed 600 of 992 attempts for 
7,224 yards and 51 touchdowns against the Colts.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Governor Rejects E-Mail Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis vetoed a bill that would  
have required companies to tell their workers before monitoring 
their e-mail, saying the measure tramples on employer rights and 
leaves them open to unjust lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is likely to further the debate about the limits to  
which companies can monitor an employee's actions while on the job, 
including computer files and usage and reading e-mails sent through 
the company network. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis likened e-mail monitoring to other employer rights, such  
as the right to limit personal long-distance phone calls. He also 
noted that businesses can be sued if employees use work computers 
to defame or harass someone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It therefore follows that any employer has a legitimate need  
to monitor, either on a spot basis or at regular intervals, such 
company property, including e-mail traffic and computer files 
stored on either employer-owned hard drives, diskettes or CD 
ROMs,'' Davis said after vetoing the bill on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Fortune 1000 companies and half a dozen  
federal agencies now use monitoring software to watch over their 
office computers, according to the American Management Association. 
By 2001, 80 percent of large companies are expected to be using 
such software, according to International Data Corp., a research 
firm in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers say they only want to improve productivity, ferret out  
computer products that could malfunction in 2000 and avoid legal 
problems, such as company secrets or racist or harassing computer 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	But state Democratic Sen. Debra Bowen, who sponsored the  
notification bill, said employees should at least be fully informed 
when a company plans to keep tabs on them electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree with the governor's starting point, that equipment  
in a business is always company property,'' Bowen said Monday. 
``Because an employer provides you a restroom, that doesn't give 
him a license to videotape everything you do in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Sobel, general counsel for non-profit research group  
Electronic Privacy Information Center, said some states are 
considering banning e-mail monitoring altogether as a cottage 
industry evolves to make it easier for companies to snoop.

<HEADLINE> Buffet Gives Teen Finance Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Some free advice to teens from  
multibillionaire investor Warren Buffett: Avoid credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to make progress, you will not do it by  
borrowing at 18 to 20 percent interest,'' Buffett told about 380 
Nebraska high school students Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Warren Buffett can probably give us more real-life examples  
than a teacher in economics class could,'' said Reese Pearson, a 
17-year-old senior from the southeast Nebraska community of 
Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	In a forum on economics, the third-richest man in America and  
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. also urged the students to: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Develop integrity, which guides intelligence and energy, three  
qualities Buffett said he looks for in hiring people. ``If they 
don't have the first one, integrity, the other two will kill 'ya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Establish good habits, picking people to admire and following  
their example, while learning to weed out attributes that are not 
admirable. ``If you do that, two or three years from now you'll 
find out the person you admire most will be yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Learn about companies before investing in them; do not rely on  
someone else's advice. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Choose professions for love of the work, not the money. Doing  
well in the United States is not far removed from being rich, said 
Buffett, who added with self-effacing humor: ``I'll pay more for my 
suits than you will, but as soon as I put it on, it will look cheap 
on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students gathered from across the state for the event organized  
by U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. They talked about savings and 
investment, and filled out budgets based on the average starting 
salary for college graduates in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The students also heard from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, civil  
rights leader and two-time candidate for the Democratic nomination 
for president, who spoke via speakerphone from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said energy and focus are needed for financial success,  
and those qualities can help students avoid the pitfalls of drugs 
and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson also urged the students to help close the gap between  
rich and poor in America. Capital and resources need to be more 
accessible to the disadvantaged, Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Halts Inmate Work Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The state police director ordered that  
inmates working under a minimum-security arrangement at state 
police headquarters and the Governor's Mansion be returned to 
prison Monday, following the escape of a convicted killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Stone, 39, escaped Friday night from barracks at the state  
police headquarters where he worked in an honor system-based 
rehabilitation program. Forty-nine other inmates participated in 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've asked that they all be taken back,'' state police  
director Tom Mars said. 
</P>
<P>
	Correction Department vans were standing by at late-afternoon to  
take the prisoners away, likely to a minimum-security unit in 
Wrightsville. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars, who became state police commander last winter, said he had  
long been uncomfortable with prisoners working at his headquarters. 
Some trusties had access to places off-limits to troopers; others 
worked on police vehicles or maintained the state police radio 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 trusties assigned to the agency saved $500,000 a year,  
and Mars said he could not afford to give up the free work -- until 
Stone escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to do this months ago,'' said Mars, who previously  
moved to restrict inmate access to guns stored in the troopers' 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, convicted in the 1984 beating death of his girlfriend,  
escaped by walking out of a dayroom off the barracks. He was being 
held there while officers investigated reports of inmate beer 
drinking. Mars said previously that Stone should not have been left 
unattended.

<HEADLINE>  Taiwan Mourns Quake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINKOU, Taiwan (AP) -- Thousands gathered at a sports arena in  
this Taipei suburb today to mourn for the more than 2,000 people 
killed by Taiwan's worst earthquake in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	On a stage dimly lit in blue light, many of the island's top  
leaders one-by-one faced a 40-foot-tall memorial to the dead and 
bowed three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Rows of military officials in formal uniforms watched from the  
stands along with lawmakers in dark suits and members of Buddhist, 
Taoist and Christian charity organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief speech to the audience of more than 6,000, President  
Lee Teng-hui said the Sept. 21 quake caused losses that will be 
difficult to recover and left a ``wound in the hearts of all 
countrymen that will be impossible to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many lost their homes in the earthquake. They lost their  
closest family members and friends,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Lien Chan then spoke about the 2,312 people  
killed in the 7.6-magnitude tremor that devastated large parts of 
central Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we can't see you, we feel your presence, your eternal  
presence,'' Lien said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the great quake, we lost our loved ones. It's in rebuilding  
that we achieve rebirth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, a newspaper reported on a new study that estimated  
half the people killed in the quake might still be alive if 
builders had followed construction codes. The study, done by 
National Chiao Tung University's engineering department, said 
inspections of toppled buildings turned up persistent evidence of 
contractors diverging from blueprints or ignoring safe practices, 
the study said, according to the United Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, builders routinely ignored requirements that walls  
and supporting columns of tall buildings be constructed 
independently of each other, the report said. That significantly 
reduced their strength, causing collapses.

<HEADLINE> Drought Will Hurt Farmer's Finances / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLDWICK, N.J. (AP) -- An insurance adjuster visited Fred Clucas  
at his farm here in early September and told him what he already 
knew: His corn field was worthless. He had lost $150,000 in 
potential income. 
</P>
<P>
	A light breeze blew among the tiny ears of corn that never  
matured. Most were shriveled from the summer's intense heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The dried tassels atop the plants should have dropped pollen  
onto the cornsilk below to start the reproductive process, Clucas 
explained, holding one of the tiny ears in his hands. His 
thumbnails dug into the husk. A twist of the wrists easily split 
open the ear. Inside were rows of sunken kernels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just didn't happen this year,'' said Clucas, 69, as he  
flicked the ear aside. It bounced once on the reddish soil 
moistened by rains that came too late. 
</P>
<P>
	Clucas grows field corn, hay, wheat and oats spread over 500  
acres in Hunterdon County. He's been doing it since 1957, but said 
this was his worst year ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he considers himself fortunate. Crop insurance  
will let him recoup about $20,000 of the $75,000 he lost out of 
pocket. About one-third of New Jersey corn farmers have such 
policies, he said. And his wheat crop was good, which will help 
offset the loss on the corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Field crops like the ones he grows, which brought New Jersey  
farmers $67 million in cash receipts last year, were the hardest 
hit by the summerlong drought. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey farms produced about 9 million bushels of corn for  
grain in 1998. This year's crop is expected to be only one-third 
that amount, and soybean production is expected to be down 25 
percent from last year's total of 3.2 million bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	With normal rainfall next year, Clucas and others are optimistic  
there will be no lasting effect on future crop yields. 
</P>
<P>
	What nature's compensation can't undo, however, are the effects  
of the drought of '99 on farmers' finances. And that may affect 
what gets planted next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``If money don't come in, one of the problems some of the guys  
will have is to get credit for next year. They're not going to be 
able to get the credit to plant a crop,'' Clucas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-interest loans are available, but many farmers say they need  
grants instead because they're already too deeply in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't borrow yourself out of debt, that's for sure,''  
Clucas said. ``We're hoping to get that grant. That loan don't mean 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress have requested about $1.5 billion in federal  
aid for Northeast farmers. Clucas, who is associate director of the 
New Jersey Farm Bureau, said New Jersey farmers alone need about 
$800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainty over how much money will be made available has  
raised concerns that some New Jersey farmers may be forced out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see most farmers bailing out,'' said Vic Tolomeo,  
state statistician of the New Jersey Agricultural Statistics 
Service. ``But if there was going to be a reason to go this year, 
it would be the drought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey farm acreage has decreased by nearly 20 percent since  
1975, to about 830,000 acres, according to the New Jersey 
Department of Agriculture, as the average size of a farm dropped 
from 120 acres to 88 acres.

<HEADLINE> 6 Students Hit By Truck and Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Had Brandon Kallmeyer dozed off  
and let his truck slide onto the shoulder almost anywhere else, he 
might have simply awakened and steered back onto the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	But police said Kallmeyer tragically veered off a straight, flat  
four-lane road at precisely the place where a group of college 
students had gathered en route to a fraternity party, leaving six 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could hear screaming and stuff but at first we didn't have  
any idea he was running over people,'' said Daniel Lara, a 
22-year-old student who lives nearby. ``We walked out and saw 
bodies all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred just after midnight Sunday about two miles  
west of the Texas A&AMP;M University main campus, said police Maj. Mike 
Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims -- four students from Baylor University, one from  
Texas A&AMP;M and one from Southwest Texas State -- had gathered to 
attend a party at the Tau Kappa Epsilon house along the four-lane 
highway. Some had just parked on the road's shoulder, and the 
pickup sideswiped two parked cars and struck a third. 
</P>
<P>
	Kallmeyer, 18, also a Texas A&AMP;M student, was not injured and  
apparently had not been drinking, police said. He was driving back 
to College Station after dropping off his girlfriend about 30 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said investigators will present evidence to Brazos  
County prosecutors without recommending charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as Emily Hollister, 18, of South  
Bend, Ind.; Tricia Calp, 18, of Houston; Dolan Wostal III, 22, of 
Alvin, Texas and Erika Lanham, 18, of Fort Collins, Colo. all 
Baylor students; William Flores, 22, a Southwest Texas student from 
San Marcos, Texas; and Ted Bruton, 21, a Texas A&AMP;M student from San 
Angelo, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other students were hospitalized with non life-threatening  
injuries, one with a broken pelvis. Both were treated and released 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baylor students had made the trip for their school's  
football game at Texas A&AMP;M earlier in the day. Miss Lanham, Miss 
Hollister and Miss Calp lived on the same floor of a Baylor 
dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people attended the party at a house about 30 yards  
off the road. Witnesses said parties there often draw large crowds 
who must park on the shoulder of a highway with a 65-mph speed 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really shouldn't be any parking on this four-lane  
highway,'' Lara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternity members wouldn't discuss the accident Sunday, and  
covered a large sign bearing their Greek letters with black plastic 
sheeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, the accident scene remained marked with large puddles of  
blood amid spent police flares and shattered plastic and chrome. A 
victim's brown sandal, marked by a yellow evidence flag, lay in a 
roadside ditch. A memorial bouquet was left there later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	At Baylor, president Robert B. Sloan said the campus was  
grieving. A chaplain visited the dorm where the three young women 
lived to offer counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each and every student is precious to us,'' Sloan said, ``and  
to lose four at one time is an unspeakable tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> Scotland Church Chided on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- Abortion-rights activists have  
criticized a Scottish Catholic Church aid program for paying a 
12-year-old girl not to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified girl, who lives in England and is now midway  
through her pregnancy, was advised by teachers and social workers 
to terminate the pregnancy because of her young age, the British 
news agency, Press Association, reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But her unemployed parents contacted the Scottish Catholic  
Church's Pro-life Initiative, a program set up to offer 
alternatives to abortion. The family was offered immediate 
financial help if the girl chose to go ahead with the birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of the payments was not disclosed, but the action  
drew quick and pointed criticism from abortion-rights groups in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offering money to a child to keep her baby is bribery and  
removes choice,'' said Sarah Colborn of the National Abortion 
Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	But Roseann Reddy, coordinator of the Pro-life Initiative, said  
the program got involved after the family decided that the girl 
would keep the baby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parents wanted to support the girl, but could not afford  
the baby clothes, and that is where we step in,'' Ms. Reddy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The church defended the move and said the girl was also being  
offered emotional help, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major concern is that the girl is not suffering in any  
way,'' said Monsignor Tom Connelly, a spokesman for the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Weyman, chief executive of the Family Planning Association  
-- a private organization that offers advice on reproductive health 
-- said teen-age girls should receive unbiased information and 
advice about abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offering financial incentives in the initial stages to keep a  
baby is ignoring the long term difficulties that teen-age mothers 
often face -- disrupted education, isolation, poverty, depression,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Might Make Garner Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Phil Garner might replace Larry Parrish as  
manager of the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers are thought to have interviewed the former Milwaukee  
manager in recent days about the possibility of leading their club 
into a new ballpark next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no comment on that,'' Tigers' general manager Randy  
Smith said Sunday night. ``This is a delicate subject right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, fired in August after eight years at Milwaukee, would  
replace Parrish who led the Tigers to a disappointing 69-92 record 
during his first full season as a major league manager. That left 
them a distant third in the AL Central behind the Cleveland Indians 
and Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner and Smith are thought to have met either Friday or  
Saturday. If the interview went well, it is possible an 
announcement could come early this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left at Garner's home by The Associated Press wasn't  
returned. Parrish, who returned to his home in Haines City, Fla., 
after the season ended, was on a hunting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until a formal announcement is made, I can't comment on  
anything,'' Smith said. ``And I'm not saying there's going to be a 
formal announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith met last Monday with Tigers' owner Mike Ilitch and club  
president and CEO John McHale Jr. The three discussed whether they 
would retain Parrish for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale said after that meeting that no timetable had been set  
for a decision. He noted, however, that it was in everyone's best 
interest to have it done as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got together last Monday and agreed we'd say nothing about  
anything until we had something to announce,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers, who got by on a lowly $35 million payroll this  
season, are expected to take a payroll in excess of $50 million 
next season into Comerica Park, a $300 million ballpark under 
construction about a mile from Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	To manage that kind of investment, the Tigers might want someone  
with more experience than Parrish -- even if their record is no 
better than the one Parrish fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers fired Garner in the midst of the seventh straight  
losing season in his eight years in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, like Parrish, could have been the victim of having to  
work with a small-market payroll. The situation in Milwaukee, like 
Detroit, was made worse by some poor personnel decisions by the 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner's best season was his first, 1992, before the payroll gap  
between clubs got extreme. That season, he almost guided the 
Brewers past Toronto for the AL East title. Milwaukee now plays in 
the NL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Tigers are determined to dump Parrish and don't hire  
Garner, there are other candidates. They could include Atlanta 
batting coach Don Baylor or Jim Riggleman, fired last Monday by the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Riggleman managed the San Diego Padres when Smith  
became the club's GM in mid-season. Riggleman left the Padres after 
that season for the Cubs, where he had two winning seasons in five 
years.

<HEADLINE> Internet Plan Spurs Privacy Fear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Engineers designing a new way to send  
information across the Internet want to include a unique serial 
number from each personal computer within every parcel of data, an 
idea that privacy advocates fear could lead to tracing of senders' 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics warn that, if adopted, the move could potentially strip  
away a measure of anonymity and security enjoyed by tens of 
millions of home computer users who dial into America Online Inc. 
and other Internet providers over traditional telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue also illustrates the danger of the unintended  
potential consequences from arcane design decisions aimed at 
ensuring the Internet's stability into the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by the Internet Engineering Task Force, an  
international standards body, would include the unique serial 
number for each computer's network connection hardware as part of 
its expanded new Internet protocol address. 
</P>
<P>
	These ``IP'' addresses, planted within e-mails and all other  
information flowing across the Internet, must be as unique as 
telephone numbers to distinguish each computer on the global 
network and to guide the billions of bits and bytes flowing among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The IETF's top engineers acknowledge some implications for  
online privacy, but ``I think the privacy concerns are overrated,'' 
said Fred Baker, the task force's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	But some privacy experts said they were appalled that IETF  
engineers would consider the idea. The new address scheme, called 
``IPv6,'' would not become widely used for years but ultimately 
would affect every Internet user. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics warned that commercial Internet sites, which already  
routinely record IP addresses, could begin to correlate these 
embedded serial numbers against a consumer's name, address and 
other personal details, from clothing size to political 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force itself will ultimately decide whether to include  
the identifying numbers in the new IP addresses. The timing on that 
decision is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said the task force is also envisioning ways to configure  
Internet devices manually so addresses won't contain the sensitive 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those folks concerned about the privacy issue could use this  
(alternate) technique,'' said Thomas Narten, an IBM software 
engineer working with the IETF. 
</P>
<P>
	Most home computer users currently are assigned a different IP  
address each time they connect to the Internet through a telephone 
line, which affords some extra security and anonymity. It's akin to 
a person using a different phone number every day to shield his 
identity and avoid prank phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	But under the IETF proposal, a portion of even those somewhat  
randomlyassigned addresses could include the consumer's unique 
serial number -- and that information would be stamped on every 
piece of information sent from his computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just winding the tape forward here five years, when we all  
say, 'Oh, my God!''' said Richard L. Smith of Brookline, Mass., a 
security expert who was among the first to question the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger worsens, critics warn, as Internet sites are expected  
to begin to share information about their customers: A consumer 
visiting a Web site for the first time could be identified by his 
computer's serial number that had been recorded at another site. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt there are serious privacy concerns,'' said  
Marc Rotenberg of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy 
Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker and others said the plan is meant to simplify configuring  
these new types of addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters also question how invasive the disclosure of those  
numbers might be. They note that most of today's business computers 
and home computers with high-speed Internet connections use IP 
addresses that never or rarely change -- and thus already are 
susceptible to use as a type of identifier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, you are externalizing a little more information ... but  
correlating that back to a person -- I don't think you actually gain 
more information,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith discovered earlier this year that Microsoft's Windows  
operating system was planting a similar identifier number within 
some electronic documents. Within days, following a public outcry, 
executives offered a way for consumers to strip the numbers from 
their records. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest controversy also follows criticism of Intel Corp.,  
the world's largest manufacturer of computer processors, which 
designed its new Pentium III chips to transmit a unique serial 
number internally and to Web sites that request it to help verify 
the identity of consumers.

<HEADLINE> Mount Union on 46 Game Win Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIFFIN, Ohio (AP) -- With a shot at breaking the nation's longest  
college football winning streak, Mount Union coach Larry Kehres 
says he won't change a thing. 
</P>
<P>
	And why would he?  
</P>
<P>
	Mount Union, which has won three straight Division III national  
championships, can break Oklahoma's NCAA record 47-game winning 
streak with a victory over Otterbein this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do the same things we always do,'' Kehres said.  
``We're not going to change our weekly routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the attention on the tiny school with just 2,000  
students in Alliance in northeast Ohio, Kehres won't let his 
players get too caught up in the excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't want them to feel any added pressure.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we have a win streak of five, that's this year,''  
Kehres said. ``And that's the primary focus of this '99 team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Purple Raiders matched Oklahoma's record Saturday with a  
66-0 victory over Heidelberg. They did have a scare the week 
before, needing three overtimes to get by John Carroll 57-51. 
</P>
<P>
	After that game, the players talked about how they needed to  
forget about the streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you let it affect you, it tends to make your team play  
tentatively,'' linebacker Jesse Pearson said. ``We realized we 
can't let it affect us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kehres, who has the highest winning percentage of any coach in  
college football history, has downplayed the streak all season. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no pep talks urging the team to keep it alive,  
or banners in the locker room counting down to next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about not letting the streak overshadow the goals  
our team has set for the season,'' Kehres said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purple Raiders are 111-6-1 during the 1990s, with the last  
loss coming Dec. 2, 1995, 20-17 to Wisconsin-La Crosse in the 
national semifinals. In each of the past four seasons, they have 
scored at least 500 points, something no other Division III school 
has done. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why there was no wild celebration after the victory  
over Heidelberg. Both teams and their coaches simply met at 
midfield and exchanged handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, played on a wet high school football field in front of  
about 2,000 fans, was never in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Union didn't show any nervousness despite the hype  
surrounding the streak, opening a 35-0 lead after one quarter and 
scoring twice on defense in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Smeck threw four touchdown passes, two to Adam Marino, on  
plays of 7 and 60 yards. Smeck was 9-of-12 for 176 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearson scored on a blocked punt and returned an interception 51  
yards to give the Purple Raiders (5-0, 3-0 Ohio Conference) a 42-0 
lead with 14:17 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearson has scored five touchdowns on defense this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Heidelberg (2-3, 2-2) was held to 95 yards offense in the first  
half and didn't get a first down until the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehres has a 143-16-3 record -- a .910 mark -- in his 14 seasons  
at Mount Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Mount Union began its streak, no one came within 10 games  
of Oklahoma's record in the four decades since it was set under 
coach Bud Wilkinson. The Sooners were unbeaten in 47 consecutive 
games between 1953-57 until losing to Notre Dame 7-0 in 1957.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Young Will Miss More Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young's concussion is more  
serious than originally thought and as much as the San Francisco 
49ers quarterback wants to play, there's no telling when or if his 
doctors will let him. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, they've been reluctant to clear him to play and coach  
Steve Mariucci said Monday that Young probably will miss his third 
straight game this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidently, they don't feel this is the appropriate time to let  
him start banging around,'' Mariucci said. ``I know we're all being 
very conservative and they are too because of the frequency of the 
concussions. They're taking their time. They're trying to make sure 
that when they say yes, it's a go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci reiterated that even if Young eventually receives  
medical clearance, the team may continue to hold him out for an 
indefinite period just to make sure he's all right. 
</P>
<P>
	Young made clear he's anxious to get back on the field but  
conceded he's having difficulty persuading his doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to play,'' he said. ``I don't want to watch and I've  
got to get cleared. That's a process that the doctor is going to go 
through. He's the one that has to clear me and I've got to figure 
out how to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who turned 38 Monday, sustained his fourth concussion in  
three years when he was leveled Sept. 27 by blitzing Arizona 
cornerback Aeneas Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the 49ers initially described the concussion as mild,  
Young was knocked out for several seconds by the force of the blow. 
Concussions accompanied by unconsciousness are almost always 
considered severe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he was knocked out may be a little different  
than what he's had in the past,'' Mariucci said. ``We think he's 
going to play and hopefully he will soon, but until he's cleared, 
we'll continue to rest him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, there are no plans for Young to be evaluated by his  
neurologist until Wednesday, making it highly likely that Jeff 
Garcia will get the bulk of the practice reps for Sunday's game 
against Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia believed Young would be back by now but that hasn't  
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if it continues into this week, then it does become a  
situation where it is more of a long-term thing than what everybody 
assumed would be a one or two week situation,'' he said. ``I think 
if it goes into this week, then I think we're looking at 
potentially a change in the future but it's hard to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Young's agent, Leigh Steinberg, raised the  
possibility that Young may have been susceptible to a more serious 
concussion because of the pounding he took against New Orleans the 
week before the knockout blow in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Sept. 19 game against the Saints, Young endured a  
sustained pounding, absorbing 21 hits, including five sacks and a 
ferocious helmet-to-helmet blow from Chris Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think think there's a cumulative effect with those games  
back-to-back,'' Steinberg said. ``I think he got hit much harder 
against New Orleans and then the hit in Arizona, those things are 
causing him some problems. He's still feeling the effects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Wednesday, Young admitted he was still bothered by  
post-concussion symptoms such as headaches, grogginess and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Young's neurologist, Stanford's Dr. Gary Steinberg, who is not  
related to the agent, has made no recommendation yet on whether 
Young should retire. Concussions, especially if they're bunched 
together, can have long-term health repercussions, including 
premature senility and other brain dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve still hopefully can play. He's still got that  
competitive fire,'' Leigh Steinberg said. ``But we're treating this 
very carefully. We'll just react to whatever the doctors say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Steinberg added that Young understands the seriousness of  
his medical situation and is prepared to deal with whatever his 
neurologist ultimately recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 38. He's a mature person who's not as wild and reckless  
as the Steve Young of the early 1980s,'' Leigh Steinberg said. 
``He's taking this very seriously and he's taking time to study all 
the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, he does want to play football but he also understands he  
has a wonderful life waiting for him after football. So I would say 
he's being calm and reflective right now, and so, it's up to the 
doctors.''

<HEADLINE> Reformers Send Demand List to Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- While Europe's bishops debated the direction  
of the Roman Catholic Church in the new millennium, a group of 
European Catholics seeking reforms fashioned their own list of 
demands ranging from married priests to an end to the ban on 
contraception. 
</P>
<P>
	After holding what they called a ``shadow synod,'' they  
delivered the list Monday to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	``The year 2000 is the occasion for initiating bold changes in  
(church) structures and in some papal decisions, which cause so 
much suffering to so many Christians,'' the group said in their 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 120 representatives of the movements We Are Church and  
Church on the Move met for four days near Rome, while 179 bishops 
from across Europe were in the second week of a three-week synod. 
</P>
<P>
	Such protests are not new to We Are Church, a movement begun in  
Austria that has garnered millions of signatures in petition drives 
seeking changes in the Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time, they raised their voice in Rome, holding a news  
conference in an office building 500 yards from St. Peter's Square. 
Among their demands was that lay Catholics be involved in 
decision-making, including responsibility for appointing bishops, 
which now rests with the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	At the synod itself, there appeared to be little stress on the  
issues raised by the lay Catholics, according to the printed 
summaries released by the Vatican from the closed-door meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the speeches touched on broad issues such as problems of  
immigration, relations with the Orthodox church and the difficulty 
of getting the Christian message across in secular European 
societies.

	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The actress who played saucy Lucy  
Ewing is now ladling tabloid gossip.

<P>
	``Like most people, I love to gossip,'' former ``Dallas'' star  
Charlene Tilton said in explaining her assignment as a columnist

</P>
<P>
	``Everyone remembers Charlene as Lucy Ewing on `Dallas' -- a role

<HEADLINE> ACC Suspends Officials After Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- The Atlantic Coast Conference on Monday  
suspended for one game all six officials who refereed Saturday's 
Clemson-North Carolina State game. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviews of video tape replays and interviews with officials and  
game administrators confirmed complaints by both schools, league 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our review of the situation involving penalties during the  
Clemson-N.C. State game, leaves no doubt that the officials errored 
in their application during the course of the contest,'' ACC 
commissioner John Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called officials James Knight, Frank Overcash, Mike Looney,  
Bill Wampler, Rick Page and Virgil Valdez ``extremely competent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``However, the entire officiating crew works as a team and must  
be accountable as a team,'' Swofford said. Their experience ranges 
from 21 years calling games for Knight to one year for Looney. 
</P>
<P>
	ACC officials refused to elaborate on the specific errors in  
North Carolina State's 35-31 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The game crew apparently erred once when marking off yardage on  
a penalty and once when the 25-second play clock apparently expired 
without a violation being called. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina State coach Mike O'Cain admitted Monday that he  
lost his composure while trying to get the officials' 
interpretation of a holding penalty midway through the second 
quarter with Clemson ahead 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
	N.C. State was called for holding in the backfield on a  
first-down pass play. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials assessed the penalty from the spot of the foul instead  
of from the line of scrimmage. The resulting mark pushed the 
Wolfpack back to their 15 and the drive ended with a punt. 
</P>
<P>
	The officiating crew called a total of 26 penalties totaling 244  
yards.

<HEADLINE> Israel Confirms Cuba Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHKELON, Israel (AP) -- Israel confirmed today that 400 Cuban  
Jews were brought to Israel in the past two years in a secret 
operation that apparently had the blessing of Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel and Cuba do not have diplomatic ties, but Castro is known  
to want to improve Cuba's image abroad and encourage Washington to 
consider lifting the nearly 40-year-old economic embargo that has 
hurt Cuba's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's military censor today lifted a ban on reporting on the  
arrival of the Cubans and the Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental 
agency dealing with immigration, allowed reporters limited access 
to the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban immigrants interviewed at a center in the southern coastal  
town of Ashkelon said they left Cuba over a two-year period, in an 
operation they said they understood had Castro's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Everyone in Cuba) knows the Jews are coming to Israel,'' said  
Alexei Colon Mizrachi, 23, who lives at the center with his twin 
brother Alexander, and their father, Cristobal. 
</P>
<P>
	The immigrants said they have been frustrated by a slow  
integration process, and want to begin working. ``I would do 
anything,'' said Cristobal Colon, who was a physics teacher in 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no mention of the Jewish immigration in Cuba's  
government-controlled news media. 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli official said 400 Jews have immigrated from Cuba and  
that 1,300 remain on the island. Of those, 200 have said they are 
interested in coming to Israel, said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. He said he expected that those wishing to 
leave Cuba would be allowed out by next June. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, accused of supplying arms to Palestinian terror groups,  
has long been hostile to Israel. While he never cracked down on 
Jews, the country officially embraced atheism in 1962, forcing many 
to shy away from public worship. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, however, the constitution was changed to  
make the government secular. For the first time, believers of all 
faiths were accepted in the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Cuban Jews are descendants of Polish and Russian Jews who  
fled pogroms at the turn of the century. While many in the Jewish 
community initially supported Castro after his 1959 revolution, 
many left Cuba after he turned toward socialism and their 
businesses were expropriated or shut down.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Loses Sundin to Broken Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Center Mats Sundin has been lost to the Toronto  
Maple Leafs for at least six weeks with a broken right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs' captain was injured Saturday night during  
Toronto's 4-3 loss at the Ottawa Senators when he took a shot off 
the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised by it,'' Sundin said prior to the Maple Leafs'  
game Monday night against the Nashville Predators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was on a 3-on-2 and (Magnus) Arvedsson was going wide and I  
went wide with him. He dropped a pass and I stopped. I think it was 
(Marian) Hossa, who took a one-timer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was initially thought Sundin only had a bruised foot, but he  
didn't practice Sunday and had a series of X-rays Monday morning, 
when the nondisplaced break was discovered. No surgery is required. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you get hurt you're not pleased,'' Sundin said.  
``There's a first for everybody. I've been fortunate in my career 
not to get hurt so we'll have to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-year NHL veteran had played 259 consecutive games, the  
second-longest active streak in the league. The 6-foot-5 native of 
Sweden was off to a great start this season, leading the Maple 
Leafs to a 3-1-0 record with three goals and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Warriner was given the duties of filling in for Sundin on  
the Maple Leafs' No. 1 line against Nashville, centering Jonas 
Hoglund and Steve Thomas.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Charged in Chicago Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- DNA evidence from a string of unsolved killings  
and rapes in several South Side neighborhoods has led police to one 
possible suspect: a man in a Chicago jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Macon, 35, has been charged with three counts of  
first-degree murder. The Chicago man has been in jail since August 
awaiting trial on a separate rape charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said DNA evidence linked him to three of 13 killings of  
women in and around the poverty-stricken Englewood neighborhood 
since 1993. Police Cmdr. Frank Trigg said Sunday that Macon 
confessed on videotape to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Macon's arrest was the breakthrough they had  
been hoping for, but their investigation into the other murders 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to continue because the perpetrators are still  
out there,'' Trigg said. ``But we're certainly going to pause and 
acknowledge the significance of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macon's three alleged victims were all killed this year in the  
Englewood and Washington Park neighborhoods. Angelnetta Peeples, 
43, was found in an abandoned building Feb. 20. She had been 
strangled and hit on the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Soloman, 36, who was found April 14 in a stairwell, also  
had been strangled and hit on the head. Rosezina Williams, 50, was 
strangled and her body found in a trash container on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Macon could face the death penalty if convicted  
on the murder charges. They said they also might charge him with 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Macon is being held in lieu of $1.25 million bond on the current  
rape charge. He could be arraigned on the murder charges as early 
as today, Trigg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Macon's arrest, police have had little success in their  
investigation into the string of slayings. Few people in the 
neighborhoods knew the women or were willing to talk to police. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorities thought their luck might be changing last month  
when they charged three men with the March 1998 slaying of 
LaCreesha Avery, 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, who was beaten, raped and strangled, was found wrapped in  
one of the suspects' sheets in the same general area where the 
other bodies were found, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities thought the men might be tied to other unsolved  
murders, but later found that DNA samples from the men showed no 
connection.

<HEADLINE> India's Premier Woos Key Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- In a formal step toward assuming office,  
Atal Bihari Vajpayee was named the country's prime minister today 
and his National Democratic Alliance staked its claim to build 
India's next government. 
</P>
<P>
	NDA coordinator George Fernandes told President K.R. Narayanan  
that the alliance has the support of 303 legislators, more than the 
required one half of the 545 members in the Lok Sabha, the lower 
house of parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have pleasure in appointing you as the prime minister,''  
Narayanan, the constitutional figurehead, wrote in a formal letter 
after meeting with Vajpayee in the sandstone presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter is a formality required before Vajpayee is sworn in  
as prime minister Wednesday and appoints Cabinet ministers from the 
22-party alliance. The alliance handed the main opposition Congress 
party its worst electoral defeat since independence 52 years ago in 
elections that ended a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The NDA includes 274 legislators and pledged outside support of  
the 29-member Telugu Desam party who have so far resisted joining 
the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	With the wider backing, observers said the new government could  
complete a full five-year term, unlike the four previous minority 
governments that collapsed over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vajpayee, who will lead the government for the third time,  
will need to persuade the Telugu Desam to join his government in 
order to ensure its stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandrababu Naidu, the Telugu Desam leader, has been  
noncommittal so far, although he gave Vajpayee a letter promising 
support in crucial parliamentary voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee wants all his supporters to be part of the government  
in order to minimize chances of losing power on another 
no-confidence motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee's government fell in April when a southern politician  
withdrew her party's 18 seats from the coalition and Vajpayee lost 
a confidence motion by one vote. No other group was able to form a 
government and elections were ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	Another southern ally, the Dravida Progressive Front, has said  
its legislators will decide Thursday -- the day after Vajpayee is to 
be sworn in -- whether to join the government. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, NDA lawmakers unanimously elected Vajpayee their  
leader in the Lok Sabha, the lawmaking lower house of parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief speech, Vajpayee said the government will have to  
take unpopular decisions to boost the economy and plans to push 
through stalled bills on foreign investment, foreign exchange 
transactions and curbing the black market. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee also has said he will seek a consensus among all  
parties on signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or CTBT, 
which India has resisted for years. India carried out nuclear tests 
in May last year, provoking Pakistan to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The new government is also eager to reopen dialogue with  
Pakistan in order to resolve the dispute over the northern 
territory of Kashmir, claimed by both countries.

<HEADLINE> CBS Show To Strand 16 Americans </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	``Survivor,'' a CBS program that will strand contestants on a  
remote island to compete for a $1 million prize, was promoted by 
its producer as putting only the players' egos at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	A Swedish version of the show, however, began with a dark  
incident: In the initial season of ``Expedition Robinson'' in 1997, 
the first contestant to be declared a loser committed suicide a 
month after returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	The network that airs the highly popular program in Sweden  
denied any responsibility, but the man's widow blamed the show then 
and still does. CBS said it believes the program was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence to suggest a connection between the young  
man's tragedy and the show,'' CBS spokesman Chris Ender said Monday 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Survivor,'' scheduled to air next summer, will bring 16  
American men and women together on a South China Sea island, with 
the promise of $1 million for the last contestant remaining on 
Pulau Tiga off Malaysia's Borneo coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is whittled down by secret ballot, with members voting  
every three days to expel a fellow contestant. When the final two 
contestants are left, those most recently voted out of the game 
will decide who ends up the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Contestants will discover why they were blackballed when the  
13-episode series airs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expedition Robinson,'' which airs on Swedish public  
broadcaster SVT, began filming June 1, 1997, in Malaysia, with 
Sinisa Savija the first one kicked out by his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He became deeply depressed and agonized. He felt degraded as a  
person and didn't see any meaning with life,'' his widow, Nermina 
Savija, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet at the time. He 
worried about having to wait to see his failure on the air, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a glad and stable person when he went away, and when he  
came back he told me, 'They are going to cut away the good things I 
did and make me look like a fool, only to show I was the worst, and 
that I was the one that had to go,''' Mrs. Savija said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Monday with The Associated Press, she  
said her feelings about the show are unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a game when you choose ordinary people and put them  
under great pressure, constantly in front of the camera,'' she said 
from Norrkoping, Sweden, where Savija jumped in front of a train 
July 11, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Savija appealed to SVT to pull the series after his death;  
instead, footage of Savija was largely edited out of the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was aware of the conditions,'' Pia Marquard, the then-head  
of SVT's entertainment division said in 1997. ``When you enter 
something like this you have to take some personal responsibility, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board that monitors radio and television in Sweden concluded  
that ``Expedition Robinson'' did not subject contestants to 
bullying or psychological abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a public backlash against the show, which critics  
deemed cruel, and changes were made to soften it. In one rules 
switch made the following season, players voted who to keep instead 
of who to expel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Survivor'' contestants will be scrutinized by medical  
professionals throughout their participation, CBS' Ender said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The safety of the participants will be paramount,'' he said.  
``All the contestants will have background checks, medical 
screenings and psychological evaluations. We will make sure 
everybody headed for Malaysia is ready for the experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When ``Survivor'' was announced last week, series producer Mark  
Burnett was asked if it could be dangerous for the contestants, who 
will be required to forage for food and water in cooperation with 
their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there's going to be major conflicts, but I don't  
expect them to be hunting each other with spears,'' Burnett said. 
The game is ``really more about bruised egos, if anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett said Monday in Los Angeles he understood that Savija's  
suicide was related to personal issues, including his experiences 
as a Bosnian refuge. But he said the incident influenced how 
``Survivor'' is produced. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologists will determine that potential ``Survivor''  
contestants are ``balanced enough in their own lives so the 
situation doesn't affect them,'' Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience is intended to be a rousing, Robinson Crusoe-type  
adventure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see this as really a very positive show,'' Burnett said.  
``Whoever lasts until the end of this thing must be a real winner 
in life.''

<HEADLINE> R&AMP;B Pioneer Louis Jordan Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The music of rhythm and blues pioneer Louis  
Jordan was revived, studied and celebrated over the weekend here. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, scholars and music industry insiders gathered at  
Case Western Reserve University to discuss the life and legacy of 
the singer and sax-playing bandleader. That night, musicians tipped 
their hats to Jordan in Cleveland's Flats nightclub area. 
</P>
<P>
	The events were part of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and  
Museum's fourth annual American Music Masters series. Jordan, who 
died in 1975, was inducted in 1987 into the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jordan taught me about women, wine and definitely song,''  
said John Bunkley, lead singer of the Atomic Fireballs, an 
eight-piece Detroit ensemble.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Has High Hopes for New Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a $375 million palace fit for a King -- or  
a Clipper -- the seats are wide-bodied and the shower heads are 9 
feet high. For the chosen few, there are fireplaces, wine cellars 
and humidors. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's newest mega-sports arena, the privately financed  
Staples Center, opens this month. Los Angeles boosters hope its 
packed calendar of basketball, hockey, concerts -- even the 
Democratic National Convention -- helps rejuvenate downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a 9-to-5 downtown right now,'' said Carol Schatz,  
president of the Central City Association of L.A. ``What Staples 
does when it opens its doors is make downtown a 9-to-11 area. We'll 
take that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The architects wanted the sports and entertainment complex to  
reflect its city's passion for seeing and being seen, so they put 
tons of glass under neon lights. Staples, the office supply 
company, paid $100 million for the right to put its name on the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	The center will be home to basketball's Lakers and Clippers,  
hockey's Kings and the Avengers, a new indoor football team that 
begins play in April. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band open a  
four-night stand at the Staples Center. The center will also play 
host to the Grammy Awards in February and the Democratic convention 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings and Lakers are moving across town from the Great  
Western Forum, which opened in 1967; the Clippers are leaving the 
old Sports Arena in Exposition Park, next to the Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those places has the style or amenities of the Staples  
Center, a 1 million-square-foot wonder with palm trees, terrazzo 
floors, a constant light show and airy lobbies that reveal the 
surrounding skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	The basketball locker rooms have shower heads 9 feet above the  
floor so 7-footers like Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers and Michael 
Olowokandi of the Clippers won't bump their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 20,000 seats for basketball; 18,500 for hockey and  
arena football. 
</P>
<P>
	And there is plenty of luxury -- 160 three-story suites that cost  
between $197,500 and $307,500 a year. There are only five left. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there is the Grand Reserve Club for 200 members  
that costs $10,500 a year and features an indoor-outdoor fireplace, 
a wine cellar and a humidor with 36 drawers for cigars. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground was broken in March 1998, and work went on 18 hours a  
day, six days a week. Thousands of construction workers were hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a spectacular building. It's like a city,'' center  
President Tim Leiweke said. ``We spent the money to make sure this 
would be the premier arena in the country.''

<HEADLINE> Dallas' Irving May Play This Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Wearing a protective collar around his  
neck, Michael Irvin flew home Monday and will await further 
examinations to determine the severity of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Early indications suggest the Dallas Cowboys receiver will  
recover from a swollen spinal cord and herniated disc and play 
again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was injured when he was tackled early in Sunday's 13-10  
loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, and now the question is how much 
time he will miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really too hard to tell how long he's going to be out  
right now,'' trainer Jim Maurer said. ``We're optimistic that Mike 
will be back this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who is taking medicine to reduce the swelling, will see a  
Dallas-area spine specialist Wednesday. An MRI will be taken and 
compared to one made hours after the injury. How much has changed 
will determine the next step in his treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Exams Sunday showed swelling in the spinal cord in two places  
near the base of the skull. Maurer said he doesn't expect the new 
pictures to show any further damage that may have been obscured by 
the initial swelling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they got a pretty good picture of everything he  
incurred,'' Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trainer admitted Monday that Irvin lost some feeling  
immediately after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had some limitations on the field,'' Maurer said. ``He  
didn't have full motor function and he had pain in his neck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was able to move his hands and feet within 15 minutes,  
much to the relief of his terrified teammates. He was then strapped 
to a stretcher and taken to the spinal unit at Thomas Jefferson 
Hospital, where he spent the night. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday morning, Irvin had regained full use of his motor  
functions -- the most encouraging sign yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the reasons he's being released as early as  
today,'' Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old has been a leader for Dallas on and off the  
field since joining the team in 1988. He hasn't missed a game 
because of injury since 1990, Emmitt Smith's rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael has been a great player for this organization for a  
long time,'' said quarterback Troy Aikman, who has won three Super 
Bowls with Irvin. ``He's made a lot of big plays in a lot of big 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss his presence and we'll miss his  
competitive spirit. Hopefully it'll only be two weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a highly optimistic view considering Maurer said Irvin is  
likely to be in the neck brace about a week as he deals with 
soreness and stiffness. The trainer said he wouldn't speculate 
whether surgery was an option. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Mills will start in Irvin's place. Rookie Wane McGarity,  
who has been inactive the last two weeks, also will get more 
playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said the team would still consider adding another  
receiver if Irvin was going to be out six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	One option is former Cowboy Alvin Harper, who worked out for  
coaches last week. Harper last played in the NFL in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Targets Jews in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley,  
reaching out to an important segment of the state's electorate, 
signaled Monday that his administration would be a friend to Israel 
and a supporter of Jewish causes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech honoring Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York  
Democrat who will not seek re-election to the U.S. Senate next 
year, Bradley touched on issues important to Jews. He stressed the 
value of Israel to the United States, called for a law protecting 
religious expression in the workplace and said ethnic diversity 
helped make America strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need meaningful legislation to protect religious  
sensitivities in the workplace,'' he said at a dinner sponsored by 
the Orthodox Union, which represents nearly 1,000 Jewish 
congregations. ``No American should feel trivialized because of 
their religious beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance was one of Bradley's first before a Jewish group  
as a presidential candidate. Support from Jews could help boost his 
challenge to Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley praised Moynihan's support for moving Israel's capital  
to Jerusalem, his efforts to win elimination of a United Nations 
resolution equating Zionism with racism and his work on behalf of 
Jews in the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's warm words for Moynihan -- he even quoted a Jewish sage  
-- appeared designed to remind listeners that he, too, was a friend 
to Jewish issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan ``unforgettably declared (Israel) to be a metaphor for  
democracy,'' Bradley said, adding that he often borrowed the 
phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation is strengthened by the gifts and interests of its  
many diverse components,'' he continued. ``You don't have to 
disappear into a melting pot to be a real or complete American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan gave Bradley's underdog campaign a boost last month  
when he endorsed his longtime Senate colleague and declared that 
Gore ``can't be elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who represented neighboring New Jersey in the Senate  
for 18 years, enjoys something of a home court advantage in New 
York, where voters remember his Hall-of-Fame Knicks career. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have shown him pulling even with Gore in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	But Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf said many Jewish voters  
may be loyal to the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Jewish community has had a long relationship with Al Gore  
... and that's not a relationship that will be dissipated very 
easily,'' Sheinkopf said.

<HEADLINE> Al Green Performs for His Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Green has delivered sermons as pastor  
at the Full Gospel Tabernacle Church for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he sang -- and all it took was someone to ask.  
</P>
<P>
	Green presented his first concert at the church, and more than  
650 people turned out for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert, which featured the Mount Moriah East Baptist Church  
choir, members of Green's touring band and other solo gospel 
singers, raised money for the church's building fund and promoted 
the church's Women's Day Month, said Beverly White, who coordinated 
the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one had asked him to do a gospel concert in his own church  
until I asked him, and his answer was yes,'' Ms. White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, known for the hits ``Tired of Being Alone,'' ``Let's Stay  
Together'' and ``Look What You Done for Me,'' recently completed a 
road tour of 21 shows.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bobby Valentine loves trash talk -- especially if  
it's directed at the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason that we should have any affection for them,''  
the New York Mets manager said Sunday, looking ahead to his next 
opponent. ``We have great respect for them. I think we still have 
to earn our respect. They've shown us very little.''

	New York advanced to its first championship series in 11 years  
by beating Arizona 4-3 in 10 innings Saturday, winning the 
best-of-5 first-round series in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Just nine days earlier, after going 5-1 against New York over  
the final two weeks, the Braves declared the Mets finished, two 
games out of the wild-card lead with three to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the next-best thing to winning the World Series,''  
said Braves third baseman Chipper Jones, annoyed by taunts from the 
Shea Stadium fans. ``I told them to go home and put their Yankees'

	Atlanta went 9-3 against New York for the second straight

games from the Mets on the final weekend of '98 to keep them out of 
the playoffs, and nearly knocked them out again by sweeping three 
in Atlanta and winning two of three in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was the biggest nemesis, hitting .400 with seven homers  
and 16 RBIs in 39 at-bats. In the three-game sweep at Turner Field 
from Sept. 21-23, he was 4-for-9 with four homers and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's going to be as magical ever again as he was  
in that one series,'' Valentine said on a conference call Sunday 
after leaving Mass. ``I don't think anyone could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just Jones who annoys the Mets. It's pretty much the  
entire Braves team. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of comments, subtle,'' Valentine said. ``If  
the comments and actions they've made over the years were in New 
York, as a New York team, they'd be well known and documented, but 
a lot of them have slipped by some people.''

<P>
	New York hit just .224 against Atlanta this year, with Robin  
Ventura batting .140, Edgardo Alfonzo .159, Mike Piazza .211 and 
John Olerud .229. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Game 1 starter Greg Maddux, Olerud is 3-for-17 (.176) in

	``We're due for good things to happen against this club, and I

</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't reveal his rotation, but it seems certain Masato  
Yoshii (12-8) will start against Maddux (19-9) in Tuesday's series 
opener at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine hinted he's thinking of moving up Al Leiter to Game 3  
and dropping back Kenny Rogers. Rick Reed could wind up pitching 
Game 2 or Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real decision in Game 3,'' Valentine said. ``Al would be  
on his regular rest. If we could have Al for 3 and 7 on regular 
rest, then that's something maybe we want to do. But I want to talk 
to everyone about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no big news on the status of Piazza's swollen left  
thumb, an injury that caused him to miss Games 3 and 4 against 
Arizona. Piazza's replacement, Todd Pratt, hit the game-winning 
homer in the 10th Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the clubhouse at Shea Stadium was empty as rain swamped  
the field Sunday, Mets trainer Fred Hina visited Piazza at the 
catcher's home, Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Piazza's health is questionable, the Mets might activate Mike  
Kinkade, according to general manager Steve Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping that nature takes its course and Mike is ready,''  
Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was more low-key than Valentine in his assessment of  
the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expectations are they've pretty much handed it to us all  
year. They're supposed to do the same thing,'' Phillips said. 
``We're going in the underdog, without much to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was hoping Mets fans will shake up the Braves next  
weekend, saying he thought fans would ``give it their best shot.'' 
He credited them for help in Game 3. They repeatedly taunted 
Arizona starter Omar Daal with slow chants of ``Omar,'' and he was 
taken out after four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they had an effect,'' Valentine said. ``I think they  
broke his concentration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Strawberry was thinking about Shea, too. The former Mets  
star, now a Yankees hero, is pulling for a Subway Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to think, how crazy will it be in New York?'' he said  
after the Yankees swept Texas. ``We know we'd have to play, but as 
far as the fans and the rivals, Mets' fans and Yankees' fans, you 
wonder if the city can control that.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bobby Valentine loves trash talk -- especially if  
it's directed at the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason that we should have any affection for them,''

<HEADLINE> UAW Wraps Up Three Auto Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With quick and peaceful negotiations, the United  
Auto Workers wrapped up three new contracts with American 
automakers that promise some 360,000 workers more money and 
security for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The automakers -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., and  
DaimlerChrysler AG -- were rewarded, too, apparently winning won the 
freedom they sought to reduce costs, including shedding workers. 
</P>
<P>
	And both sides avoided costly strikes that could have cut short  
what is shaping as a record sales year for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who currently work for the automakers are all  
winners,'' said John Revitte, a professor at Michigan State 
University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the automakers, ``I doubt they would have signed it if  
they thought it was too much,'' Revitte said. ``They probably 
assumed they could settle a pretty nice contract from the worker 
view, and they wouldn't have any trouble from Wall Street because 
the economy is doing so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern agreement made by the UAW is a four-year contract  
with 3 percent raises each year, a signing bonus of $1,350 and 
improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the UAW, the average DaimlerChrysler and GM worker  
will see gains of more than $29,000 over the life of the deal. 
Estimates are not yet available on the Ford contract agreement 
reached Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average assembly worker at DaimlerChrysler earns $70,000 a  
year, while the average Ford assembler earns about $60,000. The 
figure for GM is not available. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts with DaimlerChrysler, GM and GM's former parts  
unit also include clauses that prohibit the companies from selling 
off or closing factories or parts of their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	All those terms will likely add to the hourly payroll at the  
automakers, which totaled about $22 billion in 1998. Analyst Scott 
Merlis with Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc. in New York said 
the deals would increase labor costs for the automakers about 5 
percent a year, thanks to the increased wages and health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	But automakers might win that increase back and even save some  
costs by cutting jobs through retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The American automakers have been trying to cut costs to improve  
profits and compete better with more efficient foreign companies. 
With contract provisions that make layoffs or firings expensive, 
automakers rely on retirement to shed workers. The average UAW 
autoworker is in his mid-40s and has at least 15 years of 
experience; half of the more than 360,000 UAW workers will be 
eligible for retirement in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts sweeten retirement packages, and allow companies  
to shed jobs through attrition by setting a ratio for how many 
replacements must be hired to offset retirements. When retirements 
are relatively insignificant, the carmakers would only have to 
replace one out of every three retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new contract terms, a factory could lose 24 percent of  
its workers over four years to retirement before an automaker would 
have to replace every additional retiree. 
</P>
<P>
	And automakers have been loath to add new workers, preferring  
instead to fill their needs with overtime. Last year, GM added 500 
hourly workers to its total of about 143,000, but the average GM 
worker put in nearly nine hours of overtime every week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement can be somewhat on the expensive side, but it's  
highly workable and compatible with improved productivity,'' Merlis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW's deal with Ford also allows the automaker to spin-off  
its Visteon Automotive Systems, with 23,500 UAW workers, into a 
separate company. Visteon's current workers would remain Ford 
employees, while future hires would be covered by a Visteon 
contract that mirrors the deal Ford has with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW officials had opposed a spin-off or sale of Visteon, fearing  
it could lead to fewer union jobs and lower pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact remains there will likely be a spin-off, and this  
could be achieved without a long strike, and that the Ford-UAW 
relationship, which has been amicable and enviable, can be 
sustained,'' Merlis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The DaimlerChrysler deal has been approved by workers, while GM  
workers are expected to finish voting on their deal this week. Ford 
local union officials will hear details of their contract 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Irvin Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Michael Irvin lay motionless on the Veterans  
Stadium turf, his teammates gathered in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was hospitalized overnight with swelling in his spine  
after a scary neck injury in the Dallas Cowboys' 13-10 loss to the 
Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said today that Irvin was expected to  
be released from the hospital this afternoon and would fly back to 
Dallas. His condition will be better known after he visits a spine 
specialist Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurer said it's too early to tell when Irvin would play again,  
but ``we're optimistic he'll be back this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin will wear a collar-style neck brace for about a week.  
He'll be stiff and sore as he awaits the swelling to go down and 
fluid that has built up to drain. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurer said Irvin did have some limited motor skills immediately  
after the injury, but he could use his hands and feet before 
leaving the field strapped to a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Once word reached the Dallas locker room that Irvin was able to  
move his arms and legs, his teammates expressed their anger at fan 
reaction that was boorish and outrageous even by Philadelphia 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Incredibly, many fans cheered while Irvin lay on the artificial  
turf for about 15 minutes late in the first quarter. It was enough 
to anger even a player on the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know our fans pride themselves on being tough, but that  
wasn't tough,'' said Eagles receiver Charles Johnson, whose 28-yard 
TD reception from Doug Pederson was the game-winner with 67 seconds 
left. ``That was just plain ignorant. ... I was embarrassed to 
stand on the sideline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people need to grow up,'' an angry Emmitt Smith said.  
``Some people need to grow up and find some inner peace, because 
there is no peace in watching somebody suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, a five-time Pro Bowl selection and vocal member of the  
best Dallas teams this decade, caught an 8-yard pass from Troy 
Aikman with 5:16 left in the first. He tried to shake a tackle from 
Bobby Taylor and was hit on the head by safety Tim Hauck as he hit 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As Taylor tackled Irvin, Hauck's shoulder pad collided with the  
side of Irvin's helmet -- a clean hit that twisted Irvin's head 
awkwardly as it hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was taken to the spinal unit at Thomas Jefferson Hospital,  
where an MRI showed swelling in the spinal cord in two places near 
the base of the skull and a herniated disc. He had movement in his 
feet and hands, team doctor Robert Vandermeer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin hasn't missed a game due to injury since the 1990 season,  
but Vandermeer reacted angrily when asked if Irvin could play next 
week. Vandermeer said he didn't know if the injury was 
career-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so, but I don't know,'' Vandermeer said. ``We'll  
have to evaluate him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Jerry Jones, who rode in the ambulance with Irvin,  
said it was ``way too speculative'' to say how serious the injury 
was. The hospital barred a reporter from entering, and would 
release no information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that he needed me, because I knew his family would want  
me to be there to give them information,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who moved his fingers and appeared to be talking as he  
lay on his back, was fitted with a neck brace and loaded onto a 
stretcher as his teammates circled in prayer across the field. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Cowboys' prayer group broke up, Sanders nervously  
circled his fallen teammate while medical staff attended to him. As 
Irvin was loaded into the ambulance, ``He said that he was going to 
be OK and he gave me the old Michael Irvin smile,'' said Sanders, 
disgusted by the cheers from Philadelphia fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ignorance and stupidity, but I expect that,'' Sanders  
said. ``That's one of the sick things about our game, that people 
can actually cheer upon a man's injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vandermeer said the herniated disc probably was an old injury  
that wasn't caused by the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch was the 750th of Irvin's career, tying Charlie Joiner  
for ninth in NFL history.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Stock Drops 26 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG (AP) -- Rite Aid reported a second-quarter loss of  
$67.9 million, or 26 cents per share, on Monday primarily because 
of costs associated with store closings and acquiring 
pharmacy-benefits manager PCS Health Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the nation's third-largest drugstore chain were  
$3.5 billion for the quarter ended Aug. 28, up 16.6 percent from 
$3.01 billion in the same period last year, the company said. The 
company said the results were preliminary and unaudited. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed with second-quarter results, but we  
believe we are taking the steps necessary to deliver better 
operating results and to restore the financial health of the 
business,'' Martin Grass, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Rite Aid, said in a statement. ``The fundamentals of the business 
are intact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid closed or moved 106 stores during the quarter,  
resulting in pre-tax charges of about $34 million, the company 
said. Also hurting the results was a $49 million increase in 
interest costs related to financing for the January acquisition of 
PCS, the retailer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid did not provide comparative earnings figures, because  
the company plans to restate earnings for prior years and interim 
periods to make adjustments related to the store closings. Rite Aid 
had reported a loss of $92.7 million, or 31 cents a share, for its 
fiscal second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid said sales at store open at least a year were up 8  
percent, boosted by prescription sales growth of 17.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said non-pharmacy sales have been improving since  
September. For the June-August period, so-called front-end sales 
were 3.5 percent lower than for the same period last year. The 
company increased its East Coast sales but was hurt by declines on 
the West Coast, where the company has agreements to sell 38 stores 
and hopes to sell another 250. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our basic strategy remains intact,'' Grass said in a  
presentation to investors. ``We will execute and do a better job 
than we did in the past 12 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid scheduled its announcement after the close of the stock  
market Monday. The company's stock closed Monday down $2.50 for the 
day at $10 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid is trimming costs with the store sales, the closing of  
a distribution center in Utah, and cuts in its corporate and field 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has considered selling at least some of its interest  
in PCS to help with financial problems, and Grass said the company 
would likely get more than the $1.5 billion it paid. The purchase 
from Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. increased Rite Aid's debt to $5.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Rite Aid reported a 39 percent drop in fourth-quarter  
earnings -- from $119.7 million to $73 million -- that it attributed 
to a flurry of store openings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Camp Hill, Pa.-based company has about 3,800 store locations  
in 30 states.

<HEADLINE> Nasal Strips Marketed for Horses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Winning by a nose could take on a whole new  
meaning with a nasal strip developed to ease the breathing of 
horses during racing and performing. 
</P>
<P>
	CNS Inc., which has sold close to 1 billion Breathe Right nasal  
strips to open up nasal passages of everyone from NFL players to 
snoring spouses, goes to market this month with its Flair equine 
nasal strip.

Daniel Cohen, CNS chairman and chief executive, ``but a product 
such as this will help the horse perform to its maximum ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strip for humans looks like a small Band-Aid over the bridge  
of the nose. The nasal strip for horses is much larger -- about 4 by 
6 inches -- but has been worn by horses without objection in tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Because a horse breathes only through its nose, the soft outer  
nasal passage tissue can close when the animal inhales hard during 
strenuous exercise. The patented, drug-free strip is attached over 
the horse's nasal passages, where it is held in place by a special 
adhesive. The strip's spring-like action holds the nostrils open so 
the horse doesn't have to struggle for breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``Horses expend tremendous energy and effort simply to breathe  
during highly competitive events,'' Cohen said. ``Because the strip 
reduces the work of breathing, horses experience less physical 
stress during and after heavy exercise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical trials at Kansas State University also indicated the  
strips can reduce pulmonary hemorrhage induced by exercise, a 
condition for which horses commonly are given the drug Lasix before 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Further tests would be needed to determine whether using the  
strips would have any effect on the need for Lasix, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lasix reduces blood pressure. Flair works to reduce the  
pressure swings in the lungs. As a result, the two may work 
synergistically. But that's speculation at this point,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the clinical trials, the strips have been tested  
at private training facilities and in workouts at pari-mutuel 
tracks. It hasn't been used in races, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vince Baker, an equine veterinarian at California's Santa Anita  
Racetrack, tested the strips for comfort on more than 200 horses at 
the company's request. He did not monitor how the strips affected 
the horses physically, but is a believer in the Kansas State 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest fear in horse racing, or for an equine athlete, is  
exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage,'' said Baker. The most 
appealing part of the strips is their potential for protecting a 
horse's health, he said. He didn't expect the strips to improve 
race times. 
</P>
<P>
	The nasal strip has been ruled equipment by regulators in  
California, Kentucky and Florida and can be used in races, Cohen 
said. New York is evaluating it, and the company will present it in 
other states soon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-inventor Ed Blach, a veterinarian in Roswell, N.M., said the  
idea of adapting the nasal strip to horses ``was one of those 3 
o'clock in the morning sit-up inspirations. It came out of 
experience from practice, watching horses perform on the track and 
on tread mills in exercise drills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blach said he and Jim Chiapetta of Minneapolis, the other  
inventor, went through many prototypes. While the horse anatomy is 
quite different from the human anatomy, the function of the strips 
is similar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started with creating something that would fit the horse's  
face'' using what CNS had learned about human breathing and 
modifying it, Blach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actual act of breathing is a bit different. A horse cannot  
breathe through its mouth. But the bottom line is they have a lot 
of similarities,'' Blach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Comments we've gotten from trainers and jockeys is that the  
horse relaxed, seemed more focused on what they're doing,'' Blach 
said. ``It tends to let them do what they do best because they 
don't have to fight to get air.''

<HEADLINE> Flyers Center Out for 2 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers center Rod Brind'Amour,  
whose iron man streak ended when he missed the season opener, needs 
surgery on his broken foot and will be out up to two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour will have two pins inserted into his left foot  
Tuesday after X-rays showed a second fracture. With forward Keith 
Jones also out for at least a month with a knee injury, general 
manager Bob Clarke said he may be looking to make a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can replace Rod Brind'Amour, but it may  
cause us to reevaluate,'' Clarke said Monday. ``If Brind'Amour's 
going to miss the next couple of months, or at least a month and 
half, and if Jones is going to miss a month and a half, that's two 
of our top six or seven forwards out. We may have to reevaluate 
what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour sustained a fracture in his foot in a preseason game  
and was placed on injured reserve Oct. 2, ending the NHL's longest 
current streak at 484 consecutive games. He started skating last 
week and thought he was getting better. 
</P>
<P>
	But X-rays last Thursday showed a second fracture. Brind'Amour  
said doctors told him it wasn't a new injury, but an old one that 
didn't show up on the original X-rays. But Clarke questioned 
whether Brind'Amour tried to come back too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``With hindsight, I guess you could say there should have been  
more caution with Brind'Amour,'' Clarke said. ``But he did follow 
what the team was told and what he was told. I guess Rod did go at 
it a lot harder and has a lot higher pain threshold than the normal 
person, and that may have caused this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Brind'Amour, who was supposed to center the team's  
second line with Mark Recchi and Simon Gagne, the Flyers are 0-1-1 
and scored only one goal in their first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to get it fixed,'' Brind'Amour said. ``It's the  
type of thing that gets worse with every game that you watch in 
terms of being frustrated, but there's nothing I can do about it.''

<HEADLINE> Statuary Hall, Fame's Fading Flame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Of the thousands of men and women sent to the  
Capitol by the states over the years, exactly 96 are authorized to 
stay for as long as forever turns out to be. Which, given the 
temper of the times, may not be much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Carved from marble or cast in bronze, the weighty images of  
America's favored sons and daughters have tested the weight limits 
of the Capitol's floors since the first of the lot was installed in 
Statuary Hall in 1870. 
</P>
<P>
	Since reputations can rise and fall like shares on history's  
stock market, the result is a collection in which fame confronts 
obscurity, in which George Washington of Virginia contemplates 
George Washington Glick of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	While Washington's place as his nation's No. 1 founder remains  
secure, the decades have been less kind to his namesake, Glick, who 
was elected his state's first Democratic senator in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
	So low has Glick's stock fallen that Kansas has been trying  
since 1971 to replace him with a statue of that far more memorable 
Kansan, Dwight David Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
	There is certainly more luster in Eisenhower. The Abilene native  
and Army general led the Allied invasion of Europe and followed 
that up with two terms in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, the Kansas legislature raised the stakes.  
</P>
<P>
	In a request to Congress, it asked not only to replace Glick  
with Ike but to also bring home former Sen. John J. Ingalls, who is 
credited by some with coining the Kansas state motto, ``Ad Astra 
per Aspera'' (To the Stars Through Difficulties.) 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls has been on duty in the Capitol for 94 years, Glick for  
85. 
</P>
<P>
	Because there are no precedents, there is no procedure in place  
for states to replace their statuary. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate and House committees that concern themselves with  
such matters have, in effect, given Kansas their blessing to 
proceed. It is inevitable, they say, that some states may wish to 
revisit decisions made as long as 129 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection overflows Statuary Hall, the old chamber of the  
House of Representatives. It peppers corridors and anterooms with 
an assemblage of portrait sculpture remarkable for the sheer 
diversity of those portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
	There are rules for admittance: Each state can select two  
citizens of ``national prominence'' for membership. Four states -- 
Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming -- have yet to make a 
choice on a second statue. The states, often through contributions, 
pay for the statues; Congress does the dusting. 
</P>
<P>
	The first statue arrived in 1870; the latest, that of Apollo 13  
astronaut John Swigert, complete with white space suit and golden 
helmet, just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one king, Kamahameha the First of Hawaii; one selfless  
priest, Father Damien, who ran Hawaii's leper colonies even after 
he had contracted the disease himself. There are a quorum of 
lawmakers; a platoon of generals; and Jeannette Rankin of Montana, 
the first woman ever elected to the House, who voted against U.S. 
entry into both world wars. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection has a place for both Confederate President  
Jefferson Davis of Mississippi and for humorist Will Rogers of 
Oklahoma, whose bronze shoes are polished to a golden glow by the 
hands of tourists and, by tradition, members of the Oklahoma 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the rest, there's a lawyer with a modern footnote attached  
to his last name. 
</P>
<P>
	The footnote belongs to Uriah Milton Rose, 1834-1913, sent to  
Statuary Hall in 1917 by Arkansas. Rose founded the Rose Law Firm 
in Little Rock, the former legal headquarters of first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than his footnote, Uriah Rose may gingerly be added to the  
list of Capitol statues for whom bronze and marble have probably 
proved more lasting than name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	There are many others whose reputations are, at the least,  
dusty. Many would presumably have their defenders if the floodgates 
open for states to opt for change. But others might well be ushered 
from the posts of honor they have held so long. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., wants term limits for statues as well  
as for living lawmakers. And if Kansas provides the opening wedge, 
he wants to send Harry Truman to Statuary Hall. That would mean 
retirement for one of the two Missourians already there: former 
Sens. Thomas Hart Benton and Francis Preston Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kansas, at least, the light is flashing green.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've been told to go ahead, that no one will try to stop  
us,'' said Joey Rathbone, a spokesman for Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressman is helping raise the estimated $200,000 or more  
it would take to create an Eisenhower statue and ship George 
Washington Glick back to Kansas.

<HEADLINE> Packers Defeat Buccaneers 26-23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- A couple of minutes after nearly giving  
the game away, Brett Favre gave himself quite a birthday present. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre, who turned 30 on Sunday, led Green Bay on a last-minute,  
game-winning drive for the third time this season, hitting Antonio 
Freeman with a 21-yard touchdown pass with 1:05 left as the Packers 
beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 26-23. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't think we'd have to do it again,'' said Favre, who  
re-injured his right thumb during the game. ``Three times out of 
three, though -- that's not too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winning pass capped a six-play, 73-yard drive Favre directed  
in 40 seconds against the Buccaneers' top-ranked defense. The 
Packers racked up 452 yards of total offense against Tampa Bay but 
looked to be in trouble when Mike Alstott's 22-yard touchdown run 
with 1:45 to play put the Bucs up 23-19. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre, who wept after the first comeback win and hyperventilated  
after the second, was somber after the latest. His swollen, bruised 
thumb, which was wrapped in ice, ``doesn't look good right now,'' 
he said, though he thought he would be able to play next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers got the ball back at their 27 with 1:40 to play, and  
Favre hit Bill Schroeder with a 42-yard pass down the left 
sideline. Favre got up holding his right arm, but it didn't slow 
him down. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 10-yard draw by Dorsey Levens and a couple of  
incompletions, Favre saw the Buccaneers coming on an all-out blitz, 
and he exchanged a look with Freeman. Favre then threw a 21-yard 
bullet to Freeman, who caught the ball in the end zone while Ronde 
Barber tackled him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the blitz, and my eyes got big,'' Freeman said. ``I  
figured if I beat my man, I was getting the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 13th come-from-behind win for Favre and the 16th time  
he led a game-winning drive. He broke the hearts of the Bucs, who 
were outplayed most of the night before losing their second 
straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have bet my life we'd have stopped them on that drive,''  
said Warren Sapp, who had two of Tampa Bay's five sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre was 22-of-40 for 390 yards and two touchdowns. He hit  
Corey Bradford with a 23-yard TD pass with 12 seconds to play in 
Green Bay's 23-20 win over Minnesota two weeks ago, and he won the 
season-opener against Oakland 28-24 by hitting Jeff Thomason with a 
1-yard scoring pass with 11 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers (3-1) moved into first place in the NFC Central with  
the win, their eighth straight and 33rd in the last 34 games at 
Lambeau Field. Ryan Longwell kicked four field goals for the 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buccaneers (2-3), who haven't won at Lambeau Field since  
1989, were crippled by four turnovers. Trent Dilfer threw three 
interceptions, including one to Darren Sharper with 13 seconds to 
play that sealed Green Bay's win. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre's last-minute heroics erased an embarrassing miscue. With  
4:48 to play, Packers defensive end Keith McKenzie sacked Dilfer, 
forced a fumble and recovered it at Tampa Bay's 19. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the Packers drove to the 4, Favre was chased out of  
the pocket and then was called for intentional grounding when he 
wildly flung the ball away to avoid a sack. After the 22-yard 
penalty, Longwell missed a field goal from 45 yards with 2:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay then drove 65 yards, highlighted by Dilfer's 27-yard  
scramble, to Alstott's touchdown, but the Bucs left Favre too much 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It crushes you,'' said Alstott, who had 87 yards on 14  
carries. ``You're on top of the world one minute, and 1:45 later 
the game's over, and you lost. It's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre hit his two starting wide receivers early and often.  
Schroeder had seven catches for a career-high 158 yards and Freeman 
had seven for 152, giving Green Bay two 100-yard receiving games 
for the first time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder caught a 51-yard pass from Favre on Green Bay's first  
play of the game, and Freeman caught a 19-yard touchdown pass 
moments later to cap a 77-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buccaneers' much-maligned offense struggled, and one  
first-half drive died on a goal-line interception by Green Bay's 
Jermaine Smith. Martin Gramatica kicked three field goals for Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick Dunn, who was injured late in the game, scored on a  
16-yard pass from Dilfer on Tampa Bay's opening play of the second 
quarter, and Gramatica kicked a 36-yarder with 14:28 left in the 
half that tied it 16-16. 
</P>
<P>
	At halftime, the Packers retired former defensive end Reggie  
White's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Favre made his 113th consecutive start, putting him just  
three behind Ron Jaworski for the league record for most by a 
quarterback. ... Favre's 390 yards passing were the third most of 
his career. ... Longwell's miss was his first of the season after 
nine straight successful attempts. ... The Buccaneers scored more 
than 20 points in a game for the first time this season. ... Tampa 
Bay had allowed 794 total yards in its first four games combined. 
... Green Bay has beaten Tampa Bay in 17 of their last 20 meetings.

<HEADLINE> Internet Plan Spurs Privacy Fear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal to improve the way information  
flows across the Internet is drawing attention from privacy 
advocates, who worry its design could be used to trace a sender's 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers creating a new Internet address system are proposing  
to include a unique serial number from each personal computer 
within every parcel of data. That could vastly simplify the 
sometimes befuddling job of setting up computers so they can talk 
to each other on a network. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics warn that, if adopted, the move could potentially  
strip away a measure of anonymity and security enjoyed by tens of 
millions of home computer users who dial into America Online Inc. 
and other Internet providers over traditional telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue also illustrates the risks of unintended consequences  
over arcane design decisions aimed at ensuring the stability of the 
Internet into the 21st century despite its extraordinary growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by the Internet Engineering Task Force, an  
international standards body, would include the unique serial 
number for each computer's network connection hardware as part of 
its expanded new Internet protocol address. 
</P>
<P>
	These ``IP'' addresses, planted within e-mails and all other  
information flowing across the Internet, must be as unique as 
telephone numbers to distinguish each computer on the global 
network and to guide the billions of bits and bytes flowing among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The IETF's top engineers acknowledge some implications for  
online privacy, but, ``I think the privacy concerns are 
overrated,'' said Fred Baker, the task force's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some privacy experts said they were appalled that IETF  
engineers would consider the idea. The new address system, called 
``IPv6,'' would not become widely used for years but ultimately 
would affect every Internet user. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics warned that commercial Internet sites, which already  
routinely record IP addresses, could begin to correlate these 
embedded serial numbers against a consumer's name, address and 
other personal details, from clothing size to political 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force itself will ultimately decide whether to include  
the identifying numbers in the new IP addresses. The timing on that 
decision is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said the task force also envisions alternate ways to  
configure Internet devices so addresses won't contain the sensitive 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those folks concerned about the privacy issue could use this  
(alternate) technique,'' said Thomas Narten, an IBM software 
engineer working with the IETF. 
</P>
<P>
	Most home computer users currently are assigned a different IP  
address each time they connect to the Internet through a telephone 
line, which affords some extra security and anonymity. It's akin to 
a person using a different phone number every day to shield his 
identity and avoid prank phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	But under the IETF proposal, a portion of even those somewhat  
randomly assigned addresses could include the consumer's unique 
serial number -- and that information would be stamped on every 
piece of information sent from his computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger worsens, critics warn, as Internet sites are expected  
to begin to share information about their customers: A consumer 
visiting a Web site for the first time could be identified by his 
computer's serial number that had been recorded at another site. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt there are serious privacy concerns,'' said  
Marc Rotenberg of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy 
Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker and others said the plan is meant to simplify configuring  
these new types of addresses. The IETF's Scott Bradner said 
engineers wanted an easy method for even less sophisticated 
consumers to hook up computers to a network and share information.

<HEADLINE> Joe Mantegna Portrays Castro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Joe Mantegna had such a good time playing  
Dean Martin a couple of years ago, that the idea of playing Fidel 
Castro at the beginning of the Cuban revolution intrigued him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like him or not, he's one of the more important historical  
figures of the 20th century,'' Mantegna said of the man who has 
presided over the communist nation for nearly 40 years.

	``My Little Assassin,'' airing tonight on Lifetime, tells the  
story of American teen-ager Marita Lorenz (Gabrielle Anwar) who 
falls in love with Castro after a chance meeting in Cuba. She moves 
there at Castro's request and later becomes pregnant by him. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, inspired by actual events, sheds light on the  
enigmatic dictator, who remains a mystery to many Americans even in 
today's world of instant information. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been around so long and it's amazing how little we know  
about him. He's been very secretive about a lot of his private 
life,'' Mantegna said in between bites of a pesto pasta lunch on 
the Warner Bros. lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found out he did have this private life, these other women  
in his life, other children in his life. In a way, it shouldn't be 
surprising,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the only country that gets so hung up on our presidents.  
... Everywhere else everybody's got mistresses and illegitimate 
kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marita Lorenz was 19 when she met Castro on the cruise ship her  
German father captained. Her mother, played by Jill Clayburgh, was 
an American who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The real-life Lorenz provided insight on her complicated  
relationship with Castro during a visit to the movie's Los Angeles 
set. Lorenz, now in her late 50s, lives in New York City. Mantegna 
says she has little or no contact with her former lover. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a strong woman. I could see where she could've climbed  
under his skin a bit when she was a young woman, but this guy was 
never a one-woman guy,'' he said. ``He's the great love of his 
life; I think power is the great love of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the movie, the pregnant Lorenz is drugged in Havana and  
believes she has lost her baby after FBI agents tell her she had an 
abortion ordered by Castro. She is shot at by unknown assailants 
while trying to call Castro from a phone booth in New York, then is 
trained by the FBI and sent back to Cuba to assassinate Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would tend to say that a lot of what she says is true and  
probably is the way things happened,'' Mantegna said of Lorenz. 
</P>
<P>
	Mantegna plays Castro as a man deeply concerned about how  
history will view him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a little deluded if he thinks that they'll all  
look back on it and say, `Wow, he was a visionary,''' Mantegna 
said. ``I don't think he will be remembered as fondly and as 
greatly as he would've liked and probably not as badly and as 
terrible as we would like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like his expatriate Cuban friends such as actor Andy Garcia,  
Mantegna sees a lot of negative things in Castro's long reign. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a guy that was somewhat of an opportunist. I don't  
doubt he has somewhat the welfare of his country in mind, but you 
look and see where that country is at now,'' Mantegna said. ``If he 
dies, I think things will change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mantegna, a Tony Award winner for ``Glengarry Glen Ross,''  
played Martin in the 1998 HBO film ``The Rat Pack'' about Frank 
Sinatra (portrayed by Ray Liotta), Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, 
Martin and pals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago native has never visited Cuba and doesn't speak  
Spanish. About the only thing he has in common with Castro is a 
love of cigars. But he doesn't smoke Cubans in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to go through so many of them, it would've taxed the  
budget,'' he said. ``Let alone they're illegal, but we certainly 
could've gotten them.'' 
</P>

<P>
	MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- Actor Tim Allen was recovering from an  
emergency appendectomy that forced him out of a car race at the 
Laguna Seca Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, best known as Tim ``the Toolman'' Taylor from the

<HEADLINE> WAC Chief Has Expansion Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Western Athletic Conference is continuing with  
plans for its own expansion, commissioner Karl Benson said Monday 
after TCU announced it would leave the league for Conference USA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be continued discussion and analysis of the  
WAC as a nine-team league, 10-team league or a 12-team league,'' 
Benson said in a telephone conference call. ``Today's action by 
Conference USA may cause our membership to pause and evaluate the 
urgency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would contend that if we look to the future, we need to give  
serious consideration to shoring up our numbers, and trying to 
satisfy some of the geographic gap we have between California and 
Texas. It probably would behoove us to look at additional 
membership,'' Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conference USA presidents earlier Monday unanimously approved  
the addition of TCU to the league in all sports, but passed on 
another WAC team from the Dallas-Fort Worth market, Southern 
Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had prepared myself for both SMU and TCU to get invitations  
and accept those invitations,'' Benson said. ``(Now) we can look at 
Dallas as the WAC market. That's a huge plus for the WAC as we 
continue to try to place ourselves in attractive positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TCU, a former Southwest Conference member now in the Western  
Athletic Conference, will join C-USA in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The WAC was a 16-school league until eight members -- BYU, Utah,  
New Mexico, Air Force, Wyoming, UNLV, Colorado State and San Diego 
State -- defected to form the Mountain West Conference. That 
conference is in its first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining in the WAC were Rice, Fresno State, Hawaii, San Jose  
State, UTEP, TCU, Tulsa and SMU. The league will have at least 
eight schools, because Nevada is scheduled to join next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the schools believed to be expressing interest are Boise  
State, Idaho, Utah State, Arkansas State, North Texas, New Mexico 
State, Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana Tech and Louisiana-Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with several of the WAC presidents today,'' Benson  
said. ``There is a meeting scheduled for Sunday here in Denver, in 
anticipation that the WAC would need to make some membership 
decisions. That meeting will still be conducted and the WAC will 
look at the options. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would behoove us to continue to explore the various models,  
whether that be a nine-team model, 10-team model or a 12-team 
model,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Colleges Mull Telling on Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- When it comes to college, Mom and Dad  
often pay the bills and Junior has the fun, partying without having 
to worry about a scolding for staying out too late or drinking too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Junior may have to start worrying.  
</P>
<P>
	Congress amended federal confidentiality laws last year to give  
universities the option of telling parents when students under 21 
violate campus codes on drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Some schools -- including the University of Delaware, Indiana  
University, Penn State and most colleges in Virginia -- have already 
put notification policies in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Others -- like the huge University of California system -- have to  
deal with strict state privacy laws that prevent them from telling 
parents about student misbehavior unless the student's safety is 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	But most colleges and universities across the country --  
including the University of Illinois -- are still debating whether 
to take advantage of the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nationally, campuses find themselves in a dilemma. The public  
expectation is that students will graduate with good grades, get 
good jobs and do so in a safe environment,'' said Nancy Schulte, 
the coordinator of drug education services at George Mason 
University in Virginia who has also served on national alcohol task 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities are trying to balance taking care of students,  
knowing that they also have to establish their own independence and 
take responsibility for their own actions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	As administrators work to shape the University of Illinois'  
policy, they know where students stand on parental notification -- 
firmly against it. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent advisory referendum asked the university's students if  
the college should notify parents of students who break alcohol and 
drug codes. More than 5,800 students voted against the idea and 
1,211 voted for it -- the highest turnout for a student election in 
at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students have a right to live here free of the possibility of  
having their mommy and daddy called,'' said student government 
president Jeff Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law is absolutely a violation of the privacy of  
students,'' he said. ``If they are worried about underage drinking 
there are other methods that need to be exhausted first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, administrators have contacted parents only when  
drinking or drug use led to death or serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Five alcohol-related deaths on campuses in Virginia led Sen.  
John W. Warner from that state to push the amendment last year that 
cleared the way for colleges to notify parents of any drug or 
alcohol infraction by an underage student. 
</P>
<P>
	At the most basic level, universities have to decide when to put  
in a call to a mother or father. Every time an underage student is 
caught with a beer? Only when a student drinks so much that he ends 
up in the hospital? Or some fuzzy point in between? 
</P>
<P>
	At the University of Delaware, administrators decided to share  
with parents all information concerning students who had been found 
guilty of violating campus code -- from sexual assault to academic 
dishonesty to underage drinking. Under the policy, students with 
three alcohol or drug violations are suspended from campus. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two years since the get-tough procedures have been in  
place, the University of Delaware has seen dramatic improvements in 
what once was a serious problem with campus alcohol abuse, said Tim 
Brooks, the university's dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandalism in residence halls is down, along with the number of  
alcohol overdoses that led to hospitalization, the number of 
students who binge drink and the campus judicial caseload. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said some parents handle the problem just by talking to  
their children, while others have insisted their son or daughter 
get counseling or enter a rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents really appreciate what we are doing. As a whole,  
parents are very concerned about their sons' and daughters' 
potential for alcohol and drug abuse. They really want to know if 
something is going on, and if it is they want to be part of the 
team to try to rectify the situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the Washington,  
D.C.-based American Council on Education, said most colleges and 
universities are still trying to decide how to handle the option of 
parental notification. 
</P>
<P>
	``This provision gives institutions another arrow in their  
quiver in dealing with alcohol and drug abuse on campus,'' he said. 
``Only time will tell how much it helps.''

<HEADLINE> Princeton May Halt Plus Marks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Concerned that high marks have become  
commonplace, Princeton University might do away with the A-plus. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plan proposed by a faculty committee, A-plus would be  
replaced by a grade called ``A with distinction,'' for truly 
outstanding work. 
</P>
<P>
	One idea is to assign it a symbol, such as ``A .'' Instead of  
being worth 4.3 to the student's grade-point average, the ``A with 
distinction'' would be worth 4.0, the same as regular A. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, faculty members would have to file written  
explanations with each ``A with distinction'' they give. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation, which still must be approved by the Ivy  
League university's faculty, was suggested last week by an 
eight-member faculty committee that was asked to come up with 
possible solutions to the problem of grade inflation -- too many 
students getting A's and B's. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, it would take effect for the 4,500 undergraduates  
beginning in the 2000-2001 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem we've got with A pluses is that there's too many  
of them to suggest that the students getting them are really doing 
exceptional work,'' said Princeton spokesman Justin Harmon. ``And 
they're not evenly distributed across the subjects. It's easier to 
get an A-plus in science and engineering than it is in the 
humanities. We want a common standard and we want it to mean 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students worry that the change, while well-intended, could  
end up making them look bad to graduate schools or potential 
employers by reducing their GPAs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure if it will accomplish all they say,'' said Robbie  
Adler, 20, of Scottsdale, Ariz., a junior electrical engineering 
major. 
</P>
<P>
	Students are being asked for their opinions on the proposal, but  
ultimately the decision will be the faculty's, Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other top universities don't use A-plus at all,  
according to Princeton officials. Among them: Brown, Dartmouth, 
Harvard, MIT and Yale. Columbia, Cornell, Penn and Stanford all use 
A-plus.

<HEADLINE> Colt's To Exit Retail Gun Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Colt's Manufacturing Co., inventor of the  
six-shooter, plans to stop taking orders for most of its retail 
handguns so it can limit its liability in lawsuits, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to reduce dramatically the number of  
commercial weapons it makes and focus instead on selling mainly to 
the military, law enforcement agencies and collectors, who account 
for the bulk of its business. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's 144-year-old retail gun business effectively will be  
stopped and the company will cancel seven product lines, partly 
because it is having trouble paying suppliers, an unnamed senior 
Colt's executive told The New York Times in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive told the Times that Colt's can no longer acquire  
loans to pay for manufacturing because of lawsuits that ``could be 
worth zero, or a trillion dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The West Hartford, Conn., company faces 28 lawsuits from cities  
and counties blaming it for gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a federal district court jury in New York City  
found that the marketing practices of Colt's and eight other gun 
manufacturers made them liable for shootings with handguns obtained 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's will lay off as many as 300 of its 700 union workers in  
Connecticut, Newsweek magazine reported in its Oct. 18 edition, 
citing unnamed industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sent a letter about its new strategy to its 19  
distributors last week and is notifying 3,000 U.S. dealers, the 
Times said. Sales to civilian consumers accounted for about 30 
percent of Colt's business, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Sliwa, president and chief executive of Colt's, was out  
of the office this morning and could not be reached for comment by 
The Associated Press. Telephone messages were left for Colt's 
spokesmen Tom Kilby and Richard Esposito.

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Bird has completed what he says is his  
final training camp as coach of the Indiana Pacers, praising the 
work of his players on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys really worked hard until the last day. The last practice  
that we held, I think everybody wanted to get home,'' Bird said 
after sending the team through a morning practice at Market Square 
Arena, where the team was holding a free public scrimmage and 
autograph session in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as camp, I thought it went extremely well. There were  
some players who played extremely well,'' Bird said. ``Some guys 
are lingering behind in terms of conditioning. But most of them 
came into camp in great condition, so we were able to move them 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers begin their exhibition schedule Wednesday by hosting  
Denver, then play Sacramento here Saturday. Both teams travel to 
Evansville, Ind., for another game on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 19.95 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened modestly higher today, extending  
last week's rally, as optimism over corporate profits drew 
investors into a quiet market. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 19.95 at 10,669.71. Last week's gain of 
almost 377 points marked the best performance by the Dow in three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 2.04 at 1,333.98, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 11.38 at 2,897.95. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, earnings reports from a wide range of companies are  
expected to drive market activity. Analysts expect most 
corporations to report strong profit growth for the recently ended 
third quarter, and warn that companies that miss expectations may 
face harsh punishment from investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Knight/Trimark confirmed that prediction, falling 3 23/64  
to 26 5/8 after saying it expects to report third-quarter earnings 
between 17 cents and 19 cents per share. Analysts had expected the 
company, a securities dealer which focuses on making markets for 
Nasdaq stocks, to earn 30 cents per share in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a wide range of cyclical stocks rose, buoying the Dow.  
Cyclical companies tend to rise and fall along with the broader 
economy, and many are expected to show strong earnings growth in 
light of the nation's fierce economic growth. Caterpillar rose 1 
1/16 to 57 11/16, and Alcoa rose 13/16 to 62 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Today marks the start of the bull market's 10th year. On Oct.  
11, 1990, the Dow closed at 2365.1, and has risen 350 percent since 
then in the longest bull market in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 86.7 million shares, well 
behind Friday's early pace. Traders anticipated a quiet session as 
the bond market was closed in observance of Columbus Day. Stock 
markets were open for the full trading day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.74 to 428.45.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's stock market was closed for a national  
holiday. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.1 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.1 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was down 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> NL Playoff Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Braves manager Bobby Cox was secretive Monday  
about his lineup for Game 1 of the NL championship series, which 
may indicate Walt Weiss will start at shortstop instead of Jose 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, hero of the opening-round victory over Houston, started  
69 games but served primarily as a backup after Atlanta acquired 
Hernandez from the Chicago Cubs on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez slumped late in the regular season and was only  
1-for-11 (.091) against the Astros, with an error. Weiss hit only 
226 during the season but is a better player defensively, as 
indicated by his game-saving play against the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3, Weiss made a diving stop on a hard grounder up the  
middle by Tony Eusebio, throwing out a runner at the plate with the 
bases loaded in the bottom of the 10th. The Braves won 5-3 in 12 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Cox was asked about Weiss' role in the upcoming  
series against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want to answer that right now,'' the manager said.  
</P>
<P>
	Later, when asked his plans for Game 1, Cox replied, ``I'll post  
the lineup tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DECISIONS, DECISIONS:* Mets manager Bobby Valentine shuffled  
his rotation for the NLCS, shifting around Al Leiter and Rick Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first round against Arizona, the Mets opened with Masato  
Yoshii, followed by Kenny Rogers, Reed and Leiter. For the NLCS 
against Atlanta, it will be Yoshii, Rogers, Leiter and Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thought is it was more on line,'' Valentine said. ``That's  
the way we started the last series, Yoshii and Kenny Rogers. And we 
did all right. That's been our rotation for the better part of the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really wasn't any major determining factor,'' he said.  
``We felt we had a good pitcher either way we went. It would mean a 
really long rest and wait for Kenny, and would mean a little 
extended rest for Rick.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A NEW SEASON:* The Braves had no problem beating up on the Mets  
during the regular season, winning nine of 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta manager Bobby Cox knows that won't help his team win  
four more times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new season,'' Cox said. ``I don't think what you did in  
the past has a lot to do with what's going to happen in the future. 
They're all new ballgames.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves won the season series 5-4 against the Padres last  
year before being knocked out in six games in the NL championship 
series. The last time the Mets made it this far, they were knocked 
out by a Dodgers team that lost 10 of 11 in the regular season to 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't care,'' Game 1 starter Greg Maddux said.  
``What matters is how we play this week.''

<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BULLPEN BATTLE:* The Mets bullpen was the one that got all the  
accolades this season. But the Braves relievers actually outpitched 
their New York counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's bullpen, led by closer John Rocker, was the second  
best in the majors, going 33-14 with 45 saves and a 3.58 ERA. The 
Mets were third, with a 31-19 record, 49 saves and a 3.67 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rocker has finished everything off and done a very good job of  
it,'' Maddux said. ``But you can't overlook the guys that have gone 
in there to pitch the seventh and eighth also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker, who saved 38 games, sure isn't overlooking the  
contributions of set-up men Mike Remlinger and Terry Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without those two guys, I think we would be kind of where the  
Mets ended up, and maybe scrapping for a wild card,'' Rocker said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHAT RIVALRY?* Inflammatory comments to the contrary, Braves  
manager Bobby Cox insisted there's hardly a bitter rivalry between 
his team and the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's because Atlanta spent 25 years in the NL West,  
competing regularly against Los Angeles and San Francisco. Despite 
the lack of geographical ties, the remnants of those relationships 
still endure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dodgers, of all things, them being on the West Coast and  
us on the East Coast, were the biggest thing we had to a rivalry,'' 
Cox said. ``We were supposed to create one with Florida, and that 
hasn't materialized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves shifted to the East when baseball realigned the  
divisions in 1994, pitting them against teams of closer proximity 
such as the Marlins and Mets. But five years isn't long enough for 
a rivalry to develop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have a rivalry,'' Cox said. ``The rivalry is  
who is in first and who is in second, competing each year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 starter Greg Maddux insisted he was oblivious to the  
trash talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what's being said. Ever since I had kids, it's no  
more ESPN,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	```Now, we're watching Franklin and stuff like that,'' he added,  
referring to the cartoon turtle. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MELLOW ROCKER:* Maybe there will come a time when John Rocker  
walks in from the bullpen. For now, he's going to keep on running. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker has become a fan favorite in Atlanta with his trademark  
sprint from the bullpen and his shenanigans on the mound, which 
involve constantly tugging at his hat, jersey, resin bag and 
whatever else he can get his hands on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I can keep up this pace for however many more  
years I've got left in me,'' he said. ``I think if I keep up with 
the frantic pace I go now, I'll probably die young, which might not 
be a bad thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker has talked with other pitchers, such as former-Brave Norm  
Charlton, who displayed similar traits on the mound in their early 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I watched Norm pitch, he was more mellow in the way he  
dealt with things,'' Rocker said. ``I'll calm down or burn out 
trying, I guess.''

<HEADLINE> British Airways Orders 12 Airbuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- British Airways plans to buy 12 new Airbus  
Industrie A318 jetliners to replace some of its older Boeing planes 
on short-haul routes, a blow to Boeing Co., which had hoped to win 
a high-profile customer for its new 717 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways, which also took options to buy another 12  
A318s, chose the European consortium's 100-passenger jet ``for its 
superior economics, flexibility and commonality with the rest of 
our short-haul fleet,'' the carrier said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline will pay $412 million for the first 12 airliners.  
</P>
<P>
	Boeing had sought the order as a major-airline endorsement of  
its 106-seat 717, which went into service last month with its first 
delivery to AirTran Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing inherited the 717 -- then called the MD-90 -- from  
McDonnell Douglas when the companies merged two years ago. There 
has been speculation that Boeing will discontinue the plane, as it 
has other McDonnell Douglas jetliner models, if sales do not pick 
up. The 717 is built in Long Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Sept. 30, Boeing has 225 orders and options placed for the  
717, spokesman Sean Griffin said. In addition, Hawaiian Air has 
announced its intention to purchase 13 717s and take options on 
seven more. Airbus has orders and commitments for 157 of its A318s. 
The first A318 won't come off the production line until 2002, and 
British Airway will get its first aircraft in January 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts thought Boeing might have had an edge because the  
717 is flying now while the A318 is three years away. The first 
A318 won't come off the production line until 2002, and British 
Airway will get its first aircraft in January 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Boeing last week agreed to buy 34 used Boeing 757s from  
British Airways and reconfigure them into freighters for lease to 
DHL Worldwide Express, which many thought was a prelude to an order 
for 717s. In some instances, the new A318s will replace 757s on 
British Airways routes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big-brand launch customer was going to be British  
Airways,'' said Brian O'Keefe, an analyst with Commerzbank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 717 looks like it is going to be stillborn in the market,  
without good customers,'' he added. The British Airways loss ``is 
very bad for Boeing -- it's a big shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Sean Griffin said Monday that while Boeing  
hates to lose a sales competition, ``we will not go forward with a 
deal that does not return value to our shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffin emphasized Boeing is ``absolutely committed to the (717)  
program and has no plans to kill it.''

<HEADLINE> Brain Shocks May Help Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A pacemaker-like device may relieve severe  
depression by sending tiny electric shocks into a mysterious region 
of the brain that governs emotion, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	The device is still experimental, but a pilot study with  
patients who failed every other antidepressant proved promising. 
Other studies suggest this gateway into the brain could be used to 
enhance memory or curb appetite as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, a former shipbuilder had severe depression  
unrelieved by any current therapies, and he was so sick that he had 
trouble even leaving his house. Doctors implanted the 
pacemaker-style device to stimulate a part of his brain thought 
important for mood -- and that very day the man laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was remarkable,'' recalled Dr. Mark George of the Medical  
University of South Carolina, who performed the experimental 
implant. ``I said, 'Are you being forced to laugh or do you feel 
good inside?' He said, 'Both.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Stimulating a nerve that runs from the neck into one of the  
brain's most mysterious regions appears promising enough that the 
government just granted permission for a study at 15 hospitals 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment, called vagus nerve stimulation, involves sending  
tiny electric shocks into the vagus nerve in the neck, where it 
then relays messages deep into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the 30 depressed patients treated in a pilot study --  
people who had failed every other treatment -- ``got a very good 
response,'' George said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are not definitive, he cautioned. But he added,  
``Stimulating there really is a wonderful portal into the base of 
the brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, scientists think stimulating this nerve could have even  
more far-reaching effects, such as enhancing memory or treating 
obesity by curbing appetite. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the vagus nerve is what Dr. Mitchell Roslin of  
Brooklyn's Maimonedes Medical Center calls ``one of the information 
superhighways'' between the brain and other organs. It relays 
messages, such as signals to regulate heartbeat, and sends messages 
back to the brain, such as when the stomach is full. 
</P>
<P>
	The nerve also reaches deep into brain regions thought to  
regulate mood and emotion, said Dr. John Rush of the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who heads the pilot depression 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	If the implant truly signals the depressed brain circuits to act  
more normally, it could prove important for some of the estimated 1 
million Americans with depression not eased by conventional 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The stimulator is essentially a brain pacemaker. A generator the  
size of a pocket watch is implanted into the chest. Wires snake up 
the neck to zap the nerve every few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved the  
implant to treat severe epilepsy, a way to signal the brain to 
reduce seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Depression often accompanies epilepsy. Soon after the implants  
began selling, doctors began reporting epilepsy patients who felt 
happier even if the implant failed to reduce their seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly an overlap between emotions and the site  
where people have intractable seizures,'' said Dr. Cynthia Harden 
of Cornell University, author of one of those early studies. 
</P>
<P>
	So manufacturer Cyberonics Inc. funded a pilot study of patients  
with untreatable depression not complicated by epilepsy. Full 
results won't be released until December, but George said about 
half the patients responded well -- prompting the FDA last week to 
approve a new study, beginning early next year at 15 hospitals, to 
prove the effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The vagus nerve might also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Fight obesity. Because the nerve signals the brain when  
someone's stomach is full, Roslin implanted Cyberonics stimulators 
in dogs to see they suppressed appetite. For a week, the dogs 
continued to gulp whatever food was in sight. But gradually their 
appetite dropped, until eventually they left half their food 
uneaten each day and lost one-third of their weight. Then Roslin 
switched off the stimulators, and within five days the dogs' 
appetite and weight rebounded. Roslin hopes to begin an implant 
study in obese New Yorkers early next year to see if they get the 
same effect. 
</P>
<P>
	--Help stroke or head-injury victims' memory recover. In a study  
last year, epilepsy patients scored 36 percent better at recalling 
words read just before their vagus nerve was stimulated. The 
theory: Emotional hormones seem to stimulate the vagus nerve to 
store memories, so maybe the implant could mimic that effect in 
injured patients.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with  
key market indicators losing ground in Hong Kong, Indonesia, 
Thailand and South Korea while rising in Malaysia, Australia and 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the financial markets were closed for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell in Hong Kong in anticipation of the government  
announcement of plans to sell the stock it acquired when it propped 
up the market last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 119.70 points, or 0.9  
percent, closing at 12,992.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the close of trading, officials said the  
government will start selling the shares in an offering from Oct. 
25 to Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said they will package the shares into mutual  
funds and sell them, hopefully without harming prices on the Hong 
Kong Stock Exchange. The fund set up to sell the shares is called 
the Exchange Fund Investment Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale would be the government's first attempt to divest  
itself of the shareholdings amassed last August, and which are now 
worth more than $25.64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors sold banking and property stocks, which make up  
the bulk of the government shares, in anticipation that the new 
fund will allow investors to buy the shares at a discount to 
current market prices, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares closed lower. The Jakarta market's Composite  
Index fell 0.7 percent, or 4.177 points, to 584.060. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai stock prices closed lower, led by losses in banking stocks.  
The Stock Exchange of Thailand or SET index fell 4.14 points, or 
1.05 percent, to 388.88. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices also fell in Seoul, pushed down by a fall in  
semiconductor stocks due to a decline in global chip prices. The 
Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 5.02 points, or 0.5 percent, 
to 834.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares close higher, boosted by a plan to merge  
Malaysian banks. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite index 
rose 3.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 747.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's remarks  
during the weekend that the government wouldn't be too rigid in 
determining the number of banks in the merger fueled speculations 
that it could be increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the initial plan, Malaysian 58 financial institutions will  
be fused into six banking groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian stock market also closed higher, boosted by a  
strong performance from blue-chip industrial companies, noticeably 
in the finance and telecommunications sectors. The Sydney's All 
Ordinaries Index rose 29.3 points, or 1.0 percent, to 2,926.4. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, share prices closed higher, supported by technology  
and financial stocks. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
rose 54.13 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,607.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's Straits Times Index rose 7.74 points, or 0.4  
percent, to 2,122.23, the shares in the broader market were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower. The NZSE-40  
Capital Index slipped 5.29 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,060.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares closed mixed. The Philippine Stock Exchange  
index of 30 selected companies rose 6.34 points, or 0.3 percent, to 
2,070.17.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A once unloved and unwanted dog went from  
rags to riches after being chosen to star in his own television 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowdy, an Australian shepherd-husky mix, was rescued from an  
animal shelter a few years ago and has appeared in a few

<P>
	The producers chose Rowdy for the part of Eddie because of his  
personality and striking looks, including pale blue eyes. Rowdy was 
chosen from about 700 other canines. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the pooch travels with an entourage of trainers and is  
constantly pampered.

<HEADLINE> Ram Fans Don't Know How To Win Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- With a minute to go in their 42-20 win over San  
Francisco, the St. Louis Rams reached the 49ers 1-yard-line. 
</P>
<P>
	Rams coach Dick Vermeil ordered quarterback Kurt Warner to take  
a knee. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boooo!'' went the fans.  
</P>
<P>
	Big problem.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rams are the NFL's only unbeaten team. St. Louis fans are so  
unused to winning -- they had the Cardinals before they got the Rams 
-- that they don't know the etiquette for winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, those coaches over there on the other side are my  
friends,'' Vermeil said after the game Sunday. ``Besides, we have 
to play them again. You don't want to make enemies by running it 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running it up indeed. It had been 17 games and almost nine years  
since the Rams -- both Anaheim and St. Louis varieties -- had beaten 
San Francisco. Yes, San Francisco beat them with Joe Montana and 
Steve Young, but they also beat them with Elvis Grbac and Jim 
Druckenmiller. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Vermeil suggested last week that nobody thought much  
about the streak, he belied that after the game, hugging owner 
Georgia Frontiere, and talking openly about it. 
</P>
<P>
	So did his players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting my entire career to watch our team take a  
knee against that team,'' said defensive tackle D'Marco Farr, 0-10 
against the 49ers entering Sunday's game and knows NFL etiquette 
better than his fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's by far the biggest win of my career,'' said cornerback  
Todd Lyght, who was 0-16 against the 49ers until Sunday. Then, 
there was the man who thinks of himself as Mentor of All Football 
Coaches, San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked into Vermeil's news conference and hugged the St.  
Louis coach, who indeed is a Walsh protege. ``You're going all the 
way,'' Walsh told him and Vermeil blanched. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't say that,'' Vermeil said.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, why not? In a league that's finally achieved total  
parity (after all, the Eagles and Bengals won Sunday) why can't the 
Rams be this year's Falcons? 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil has a quarterback in Kurt Warner, who is ``Field of  
Dreams'' reincarnated in a football uniform -- he was Gateway 
Conference Player of the year at Northern Iowa and starred for the 
Arena League's Iowa Barnstormers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was cut by the Packers, cut by the Bears, then made the Rams  
last year by beating out the well-traveled Will Furrer for the 
third-string spot behind Tony Banks and Steve Bono. He moved up to 
backup when Trent Green, the Rams' $16 million off-season 
acquisition, tore up his knee in the third exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured he'd come along by midseason,'' Vermeil  
acknowledged. ``I thought until then that the rest of the team 
would carry him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uh ...  
</P>
<P>
	Sorry.  
</P>
<P>
	Warner threw five touchdown passes Sunday, four to Isaac Bruce,  
who, finally healthy, looks as good as the 49ers' ``80,'' a guy 
named Jerry Rice. Warner has 14 in four games -- a pace that would 
give him 56 for the season or eight more than the record set by Dan 
Marino in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, let's get serious.  
</P>
<P>
	At some point, Warner will hit a wall -- maybe next week in  
Atlanta, where the Rams' old coach, Rich Brooks, is the Falcons' 
defensive coordinator. They've already seen Warner and lost to him 
35-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the help has to kick in. And yes, there's talent.  
</P>
<P>
	Only eight players remain from the team Vermeil took over at the  
start of the 1997 season. And Bruce, who may be the NFL's best 
receiver, has trouble staying healthy -- he missed most of the last 
two seasons with various nagging injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line that caused the Rams so much trouble during  
5-11 and 4-12 seasons under Vermeil? That's been bolstered by 
free-agent guard Adam Timmerman and by Orlando Pace, the No. 1 
overall pick in 1997 coming into his own at left tackle. And 
Marshall Faulk has done little yet because they let Warner throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 4-yard gain is overrated. Sid Gillman told me that,''  
Vermeil said of the man whom even Walsh admits was a mentor. ``Why 
get 4 yards when you can get 40?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense?  
</P>
<P>
	It's anchored by veterans like Farr and Lyght, has an emerging  
star in end Kevin Carter, another No. 1 lost on losing teams and a 
wonderful 5-foot-10, 250-pound middle linebacker named London 
Fletcher, a free-agent rookie signed last year from John Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Shula went to John Carroll.  
</P>
<P>
	Is that an omen?

<HEADLINE> Warrick Dunn Sprains Left Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Warrick  
Dunn sprained his left knee late in the Bucs' 26-23 loss to the 
Green Bay Packers on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn, who had 1,026 yards rushing last season, was hurt during  
Tampa Bay's final scoring drive of the game. He caught a short pass 
from Trent Dilfer at the Tampa Bay 39 near the Buccaneers' sideline 
and was tackled awkwardly by Green Bay linebacker Brian Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn lay on the field for several minutes but eventually hopped  
off under his own power. He didn't return to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctors said afterward that he had sprained the knee. The  
Buccaneers are off next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the injury, Dunn had an excellent game with six pass  
receptions for 41 yards and 14 rushes for 39 yards. With 22 
catches, Dunn is second in the league behind Green Bay's Dorsey 
Levens for receptions by a running back.

<HEADLINE> Planet Hollywood To Close Nine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Planet Hollywood announced Monday the  
immediate closing of nine of its 32 U.S. locations as the 
struggling restaurant chain heads to a bankruptcy court filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando-based company plans to file petitions for Chapter 11  
protection from creditors Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Delaware, and will soon file its reorganization plan, a company 
statement released Monday evening said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the first step in our plan to position Planet  
Hollywood for a return to long-term profitability and healthy 
growth,'' said Robert Earl, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring plan calls for upgrading a number of  
facilities and menus, Earl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurants closed Monday were in Chicago, Costa Mesa,  
Calif.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Gurnee, Ill.; Houston; Indianapolis; 
Maui, Hawaii; Miami and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	There may still be a couple of additional closings or franchise  
conversions, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reorganization, Planet Hollywood International  
Inc.'s two largest shareholders and a trust for Earl's children 
have agreed to provide a $30 million cash infusion to help keep the 
international chain of glitzy, movie-themed restaurants going.

<P>
	The planned bankruptcy filing is the latest setback for the  
operator of nearly 80 Planet Hollywood restaurants.

<P>
	Former president William Baumhauer resigned in June, just three

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. Treats Meningitis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Hundreds of Michigan State University  
students lined up Monday for vaccines against bacterial meningitis 
as another student remained in the hospital battling the infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Busuttil was in critical condition Sunday, his doctor said,  
and the university said his condition was unchanged Monday morning. 
University and hospital officials declined to update his condition 
Monday afternoon, citing his family's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Busuttil became ill Friday and passed out Saturday night from  
the infection, meningococcal meningitis. He is an instrumental 
music education sophomore who plays the cymbals in the Michigan 
State marching band. 
</P>
<P>
	The university is offering antibiotics to anyone who may have  
come into close contact with Busuttil, including the 950 people who 
live in his dorm and the 300 members of the band. It also is 
offering a vaccine to the entire university community and is 
picking up the $50-per-person cost of the vaccination until Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	While the antibiotics treat the infection, the vaccine is more  
of a preventive measure. However, it cannot protect against one of 
the five forms of meningococcal meningitis, officials said. 
University officials won't know which strain Busuttil has until 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Meningitis is a swelling of the lining surrounding the brain and  
spinal cord and comes in two forms -- the common and not very 
serious viral meningitis and the rare bacterial meningitis, which 
can be fatal. Busuttil has the bacterial form. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundreds of students lined up for the vaccines Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We live on the other side of campus, but we decided to get  
it,'' said biology sophomore Rebecca Gould as she and roommate Rita 
Brust drank juice after getting their shots. ``It's free and it's 
going to protect us for three to five years, so why not get it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in three years that the university has  
given the mass vaccination after a student got sick. Three students 
got the disease from December 1996 to March 1997, and two died. 
After that outbreak, 19,000 people chose to be vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	Meningococcal meningitis is spread by intimate or direct  
contact. Symptoms are a fever of more than 101 degrees and a severe 
headache, neck or back stiffness, rashes or mental changes, such as 
agitation or confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Kramer, 19, said she took the antibiotics and got the  
vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never knew the kid, but because I live in the same dorm, I  
wanted to take the extra precaution,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Offers Peek at Diana Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Readers of an Australian magazine got a  
peek today at the memoirs of Princess Diana's lover James Hewitt 
after a British tabloid backed down from serializing his book. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper last month backed out of a  
$492,000 serialization deal after Diana's brother wrote to the 
editor asking him not to publish details about the late princess. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Australia, Woman's Day published a 16-page insert of  
Hewitt's book ``Love and War,'' which details his five-year affair 
with Diana, Princess of Wales, that began when she was still 
married to Prince Charles in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Some excerpts from the book were also printed in Sunday's  
edition of The Daily News in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While the prospect of publication caused uproar in Britain, it  
barely caused a ripple in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first of a three-part series, Hewitt, a former Life  
Guards cavalry officer, writes of meeting and falling in love with 
Diana. 
</P>
<P>
	``There she was at the bottom of the stairs, in a long summer  
skirt, with bare feet, her shoes in her hand,'' he writes of their 
first meeting at Buckingham Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who later became her lover talks of palace pillow fights  
with Diana's two children, William and Harry, but labels as 
``disgusting'' rumors he is Prince Harry's father. 
</P>
<P>
	He claims Diana initiated the affair, saying her marriage to  
Prince Charles was all but over. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewitt was labeled a ``love rat'' and ``the most hated man in  
Britain'' by British tabloids after he collaborated on a book by 
journalist Anna Pasternak entitled ``Princess in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hewitt began selling stories about Diana in 1993 soon after she  
broke off the affair. Extracts printed today contain more detail 
about the food the couple ate than their love life. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing of their first night together, Hewitt writes: ``The main  
course was chicken in a lemon and cream sauce, with mashed potatoes 
and mange tout and French beans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few paragraphs later he simply adds: ``That evening our affair  
began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hewitt claims Diana told him her former bodyguard Barry  
Mannakee, who later died, was an earlier lover. 
</P>
<P>
	And he reveals Diana sent him copies of Playboy and Penthouse  
while he was stationed in the Persian Gulf during the 1991 conflict 
with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Woman's Day deputy editor Lorrae Willox did not reveal how much  
the magazine paid for serialization rights.

<HEADLINE> AFL-CIO To Offer New Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The AFL-CIO is creating an Internet gateway  
it hopes will connect its 13 million members online and serve as a 
high-tech organizing device. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a revolutionary tool for communications,'' said  
Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America. 
``Can you imagine being able to ask millions of Internet users to 
boycott a product or bombard an elected official with protests?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web portal site, called workingfamilies.com, was scheduled  
to be up and running by Dec. 1 and union members will be offered 
Internet service at no more than $14.95 per month. The AFL-CIO also 
said it will offer members discounted computers, with full 
financing, for as little as $600. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to bring families online for less than $30 a month,  
Ray Abernathy, an AFL-CIO spokesman, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site will link to the homepages of the AFL-CIO's 68  
affiliated unions. Card-carrying members also will have access to 
e-mail, news, weather and an electronic storefront featuring 
union-shop goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``With workingfamilies.com, we're helping bridge the growing gap  
between the technological 'haves' and 'have-nots,' and we're also 
giving working families new ways to connect with one another and to 
make their voices heard,'' said John Sweeney, AFL-CIO president. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Charron, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge,  
Mass., said the AFL-CIO could create a successful online community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is a great way to create support and mobilization  
for communities that are otherwise disparate,'' Charron said. 
``Having a virtual meeting place for the national workforce makes 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO will not challenge the major Internet service  
providers, such as America Online, or the major portal sites, such 
as Yahoo!, Charron said. The organization, however, does have the 
opportunity to serve a niche market. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the capacity to create a small access business and a  
community content site,'' Charron said. ``But it really has no 
chance of competing with the large broad-based sites.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Mourns Quake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINKOU, Taiwan (AP) -- Thousands gathered at a sports arena in  
this Taipei suburb today to mourn for the more than 2,000 people 
killed by Taiwan's worst earthquake in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	On a stage dimly lit in blue light, many of the island's top  
leaders one-by-one faced a 40-foot-tall memorial to the dead and 
bowed three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Rows of military officials in formal uniforms watched from the  
stands along with lawmakers in dark suits and members of Buddhist, 
Taoist and Christian charity organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief speech to the audience of more than 6,000, President  
Lee Teng-hui said the Sept. 21 quake caused losses that will be 
difficult to recover and left a ``wound in the hearts of all 
countrymen that will be impossible to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many lost their homes in the earthquake. They lost their  
closest family members and friends,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Lien Chan then spoke about the 2,312 people  
killed in the 7.6-magnitude tremor that devastated large parts of 
central Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we can't see you, we feel your presence, your eternal  
presence,'' Lien said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the great quake, we lost our loved ones. It's in rebuilding  
that we achieve rebirth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, a newspaper reported on a new study that estimated  
half the people killed in the quake might still be alive if 
builders had followed construction codes. The study, done by 
National Chiao Tung University's engineering department, said 
inspections of toppled buildings turned up persistent evidence of 
contractors diverging from blueprints or ignoring safe practices, 
the study said, according to the United Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, builders routinely ignored requirements that walls  
and supporting columns of tall buildings be constructed 
independently of each other, the report said. That significantly 
reduced their strength, causing collapses.

<HEADLINE> Collapse Ends Indians Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians of the 1990s: five  
straight division titles, two AL pennants and yet another big 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	As it has every year since 1948, Cleveland's season ended in  
failure -- this time with the Indians losing the deciding game of 
the AL division series 12-8 to the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's loss completed a downfall that began when starter  
Dave Burba left Game 3 with a strained forearm and the Indians 
leading 1-0 in the game and 2-0 in the series. It ended 44 Boston 
runs later. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the first two games we were high as a kite, and playing  
well,'' Indians starter Charles Nagy said in a voice barely above a 
whisper. ``Then we went to Boston, they got hot and we couldn't get 
them out after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, it's always something with the Indians, isn't it?  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, it was David Justice, then of the Atlanta Braves,  
homering off Jim Poole in Game 6 of the World Series. In '96, it 
was Roberto Alomar, then with Baltimore, hitting a 12th-inning 
homer off Jose Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, Cleveland was two outs away from beating Florida  
in the World Series when Mesa collapsed again. Last season, 
Cleveland was the victim of the overpowering New York Yankees, like 
everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest was in '97. That was much tougher than this,''  
said Jim Thome as he sat in Cleveland's hushed locker room. ``We 
were within two outs of winning it all. Even if we won tonight, we 
still would have had a long, long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome's probably right. Cleveland heard all year it didn't have  
the pitching staff to carry it through the postseason, and in the 
end it turned out to be true. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Nagy nor Bartolo Colon, the loser in Sunday's 23-7  
humiliation in Game 4, was effective pitching on three days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy gave up eight runs in just three innings, enough to waste  
an offensive output, including two Thome home runs, that should 
have won most games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice for me to do but individual things don't matter.  
The bottom line is getting that ring,'' Thome said. ``We have 
nothing to be ashamed of, but now we have to go home and think 
about what will make us better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A more effective bullpen could help. In a pen riddled with  
injuries, only rookie reliever Sean DePaula was able to shut down 
the Red Sox as he pitched three no-hit innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed in the effort,'' Cleveland manager Mike  
Hargrove said. ``I'm obviously disappointed in the execution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's something Hargrove could say for each of the last five  
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians have won 471 regular-season games since they began  
their run of AL Central titles in 1995. They've also sold a lot of 
tickets in the process, with 373 sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the Indians and their fans, only one statistic really  
counts. The team still hasn't won a World Series in more than half 
a century.

<HEADLINE> Army Official Sees Stronger Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to the view that ground forces are  
becoming less relevant to national security, Army Secretary Louis 
Caldera is telling the defense industry and the Army that the 
service needs to change. 
</P>
<P>
	The threats of terrorism, drug-trafficking and weapons of mass  
destruction offer new challenges to a force that is at the top of 
its game but needs to respond more rapidly to a changing world, 
Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Change is never easy. Change is difficult. It is  
threatening,'' Caldera told the Association of the U.S. Army on 
Monday. But he told the Army boosters the service was at a 
crossroads where it must be prepared for humanitarian and rescue 
work as well as for battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new timetables of this new world dictate that to be the  
relevant force of choice for the nation for emergency response, for 
deterrence by putting soldiers on the ground or for war-fighting, 
we have to get there faster,'' Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing a restructured Army, he said, ``We must be a  
full-spectrum force in which every unit is capable of contributing 
along every point of the spectrum from humanitarian system to high 
intensity conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Setting the tone for the association's annual meetings, the  
organization's president, retired Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, declared 
the Army ``overcommitted, under-resourced and underpaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said that although recruitment lagged last year, the  
Army experienced record retention and re-enlistment rates, with 
increased funding and pay levels. He said intensified recruitment 
efforts were planned. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that although ground troops were not engaged in combat  
during the successful Kosovo conflict, ground forces played a huge 
role in preparing for the air war and were deeply engaged in the 
postwar period. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real goals of Operation Allied Force are only now on their  
way to being achieved because of the hard and dangerous work that 
our peacekeeping and our civil-society-building soldier are now 
doing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	AUSA, organized to promote Army goals, includes both active and  
retired military as well as members of the defense industry.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Lofton Shoulder Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Sports Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland center fielder Kenny Lofton  
dislocated his left shoulder during Monday night's fifth and 
deciding game of the AL division series against Boston and was 
admitted to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton was hurt in the fourth inning when he hit a ground ball  
to first baseman Mike Stanley and slid head first in an attempt to 
beat the throw to pitcher Pedro Martinez, covering at first. After 
Lofton was called out, he lay face down on the ground for several 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton, who had two stints on the disabled list this season with  
hamstring injuries, got slowly to his feet and was helped off the 
field by Indians assistant trainer Jim Warfield, who had his hand 
under Lofton's left elbow for support. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton was replaced in center field in the top of the fifth by  
Dave Roberts with the score 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians said Lofton's shoulder had been popped back into the  
socket. He was expected to spend the night at Lutheran Hospital and 
the undergo X-rays that would determine if there was additional 
damage to his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez entered the game to start the fourth, his first  
appearance since straining a muscle beneath his right shoulder 
blade during last Wednesday night's series opener at Jacobs Field.

<HEADLINE> Limping Denver Regains A Bit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With Denver's first victory of the season finally  
in hand, defensive end Neil Smith mocked the inhospitable Oakland 
crowd with a sign that read, ``Look at the score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He simultaneously sent a message to the doubters who had given  
up the Broncos for dead. 
</P>
<P>
	One week after an anonymous Denver player was quoted as saying,  
``We're finished,'' the Broncos (1-4) can at least claim to be 
breathing after their 16-13 victory over the Raiders on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a sense of desperation around here,'' defensive  
end Harald Hasselbach said Monday. ``Anybody who didn't feel 
desperation, I don't know what locker room they were in, but they 
weren't in ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since winning their second straight Super  
Bowl nine months ago, the Broncos were able to celebrate a victory 
when Tory James intercepted a pass in the game's final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman Mark Schlereth called the win more satisfying  
than the recent Super Bowl title. Others were more conservative 
when describing the importance of avoiding the first 0-5 start in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you haven't won in so long, it's a great feeling to get a  
win,'' cornerback Ray Crockett said. ``That was the magnitude of 
it, that you finally got a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Denver regained any championship swagger, it comes with a  
limp. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro tight end Shannon Sharpe broke his left collarbone and  
will be out 7-to-9 weeks, joining MVP running back Terrell Davis 
and linebacker John Mobley on the long-term injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos also will know more this week about the status of  
quarterback Bubby Brister (strained oblique muscle) and Davis' 
replacement, Derek Loville, (strained hamstring). Neither played 
against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty crowded in the training room today,'' Loville  
said. ``We took a few on the chin, but it's OK. It's a long season. 
We've got 11 more games. You never know what could happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule does not offer the Broncos much solace as Green Bay  
(3-1) travels to Denver on Sunday, followed by a road game against 
New England (4-1) and a home date with Minnesota (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
	At least Denver is assured of avoiding an 0-8 start -- the  
scenario suggested by one player in an article in Sports 
Illustrated last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can get on a roll here,'' coach Mike Shanahan  
said. ``Guys are feeling good about themselves. We won a football 
game in a tough situation. It carries over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's first victory raised new questions about the team's  
ongoing quarterback shuffle. Brian Griese, demoted last week, 
played his best game of the season but will return to the bench if 
Brister is healthy Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always going to be, `What do you do here?' If you want  
Bubby. If you want Brian,'' Shanahan said. ``Going into that game, 
Bubby had an excellent week of preparation. He was fired up to 
play. If he's healthy, he's going to go. If not, we'll go in a 
different direction.''

<HEADLINE> CIA: No Encephalitis Terrorism Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The CIA looked into rumors that the recent  
encephalitis outbreak in the New York area was the work of 
terrorists and concluded it wasn't, an agency official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press there's no evidence Iraq or any other foreign 
government was involved. The CIA ``looked into rumors which 
appeared in British media and elsewhere,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials also played down any suggestions of bioterrorism.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing indicates that this was anything other than a natural  
outbreak,'' Jerome Hauer, director of the city's emergency 
management office, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said  
there was no evidence to suggest the recent outbreak was anything 
other than ``Mother Nature at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts at the CIA who deal with biological weapons said an  
Iraqi defector had claimed in April that Saddam Hussein was 
developing a strain of West Nile-like encephalitis for use as a 
biological weapon, The New Yorker reported in its issue that hit 
newsstands today. 
</P>
<P>
	The defector's report was published April 6 in the Daily Mail of  
London. It was an except from the book ``In the Shadow of Saddam,'' 
written by Mikhael Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramadan claimed that he worked as one of Saddam's body doubles  
and that the Iraqi president had told him of a plan to develop a 
strain of West Nile encephalitis that would kill 97 percent of 
people in an urban environment. The magazine said Ramadan was 
believed to be hiding somewhere in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	A strain of a West Nile-like virus has claimed the lives of six  
people in the New York area since it was discovered in early 
September. The mosquito-borne virus has infected at least 54 people 
in the metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of the strain include fever and headache. In rare  
cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death. The 
elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems are most 
vulnerable.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The injuries are definitely piling up  
quicker than the victories for the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFC champions won for the first time this season, beating  
New Orleans 20-17 Sunday, but any euphoria was offset by injuries 
to their top two linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Brooking, the first-round draft pick in 1998, will be out  
at least three weeks with a knee injury, while Pro Bowl selection 
Jessie Tuggle is doubtful for Sunday's game against unbeaten St. 
Louis because of a sore thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons (1-4) beat the Saints without their best offensive  
players, quarterback Chris Chandler and running back Jamal 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	At least coach Dan Reeves knows his team hasn't forgotten how to  
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I think your mental outlook is a heck of a lot better,''  
he said Monday. ``You are answering questions about how you won 
rather than answering questions about how you lost. That is huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle, the Falcons' 13-year defensive cornerstone, aggravated a  
left thigh injury against the Saints and missed nearly the entire 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle was capably replaced by rookie linebacker Jeff Kelly, a  
sixth-round draft pick who had played only on special teams this 
year. He had five tackles and a forced fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury to Brooking, the team's leading tackler with 38, is  
more serious. The former Georgia Tech standout tore a ligament in 
his right knee and will miss at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruffin Hamilton, who took over when Brooking went down, played  
well enough to be named defensive player of the game by the 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losing two of your best players on defense and having two guys  
to step in like that and fill a void is critical,'' defensive 
coordinator Rich Brooks said. ``If they hadn't played well, we had 
no chance to win the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's season ended in Week 2 with a knee injury and a  
pulled hamstring has caused Chandler to sit out three games and 
part of a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries on defense, however, are more prevalent and arguably  
more costly. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Tuggle has missed only four games over the last  
10 years -- a 165-game span in which he became a fan favorite with a 
nickname, ``The Hammer,'' that reflected just how hard he hit 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember (linebacker Henri Crockett) saying, `The leader is  
down. We have to step up,''' Kelly said. ``The Saints' offensive 
line was looking around to see where Tuggle was. Everybody told me, 
`They'll be coming right at you.' But I guess I did OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also ailing is left defensive end Lester Archambeau, who  
persevered Sunday with a bad shoulder and neck. Defensive end Chuck 
Smith has endured the entire season with an injured toe. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting defensive tackles Travis Hall (thumb) and Shane Dronett  
(neck) were forced to rotate with backups Shawn Swayda and Pellom 
McDaniels -- much to the dismay of Dronett. 
</P>
<P>
	He grew so incensed with the temporary demotion that he  
initiated a sideline argument in the third quarter with defensive 
line coach Bill Kollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup tackle Ed Jasper has the same injury as Brooking but  
could return this week. The Falcons also have Crockett playing with 
an ailing thigh, and Hamilton missed the previous two games with a 
bad hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	In the secondary, cornerback Michael Booker missed the first  
three games with a partially torn thigh muscle, and rookie safety 
Johndale Carty left Sunday's game with an injured hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Jets-Jaguars Delayed by Turf Tear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The game between the Jacksonville  
Jaguars and New York Jets was delayed for about eight minutes 
Monday night because of a tear in the artificial turf, which is 
scheduled to be replaced next year by grass. 
</P>
<P>
	The turf was torn with 3:56 left in the third quarter when  
Jaguars' running back James Stewart tore up a piece when making a 
cut during a 9-yard run at the Jets' 45-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, along with the Giants and the New Jersey Sports and  
Exposition Authority, have agreed to replace the turf for next 
season.

<HEADLINE> Big Farms Benefit from Farm Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the largest, most profitable farms in  
the country would be among the biggest beneficiaries of Congress' 
$8.7 billion agricultural assistance package because it loosens 
rules that were intended to target government payments to 
family-size operations. 
</P>
<P>
	An individual farm could claim up to $460,000 in subsidies a  
year -- double the current restriction -- and the legislation creates 
a new way for producers to get around even that limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The new limit would be high enough to cover a giant, 6,000-acre  
corn farm in the Midwest or a 3,000-acre cotton operation in Texas. 
The average farm in the country is less than 500 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible idea,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``I  
just think that's a sorry state of affairs when we're short of 
money to help family farms that you have some large producers 
getting $460,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But farm organizations that pushed for raising the subsidy  
limits say low commodity prices are hurting big farms as well as 
small ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Producers need to get their income from the marketplace (but)  
the marketplace simply isn't providing it right now,'' said Steve 
Pringle, legislative director of the Texas Farm Bureau, a farmer 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is expected to give final approval to the aid package  
this week and send it to President Clinton for his signature. The 
White House has made no threat of a veto. The House passed the 
legislation Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The payment limits apply to two different programs: crop  
subsidies that vary according to fluctuations in commodity prices; 
and annual ``market transition'' payments, which were guaranteed to 
producers under the 1996 farm law. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are technically allowed to receive no more than $75,000  
in crop subsidies and $40,000 a year in market transition payments 
under current law. But many farms, especially in the South, legally 
claim twice that much because they are divided into different 
entities. A husband and a wife, for example, can claim separate 
payments on the same farm. 
</P>
<P>
	The aid package would double those caps, so farms could get up  
to $300,000 in crop subsidies and $160,000 in market transition 
payments this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With commodity prices at the levels they are, a cotton operation  
in west Texas would reach the $75,000 cap on crop subsidies at 
about 700 acres, while a corn grower in Iowa would reach it at 
about 1,500 acres. The subsidies vary by commodity and region. 
</P>
<P>
	Another provision in the legislation would allow farms to avoid  
the restriction on crop subsidies entirely. It would permit the 
Agriculture Department to issue certificates redeemable for 
government-held commodities in lieu of cash. The certificates would 
not be subject to any payment limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	The certificate program was written into the bill by Sen. Thad  
Cochran, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate's agricultural 
appropriations subcommittee, at the request of cotton producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of the certificate program say farmers can already  
avoid the payment limits on crop subsidies though a program that 
allows them to take out a loan on their crop and later forfeit the 
crop to the government then keep a portion of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the looser payment rules fear they will encourage the  
consolidation of farms and hasten the demise of smaller-scale 
operations. Big farms will use the extra cash to buy up land from 
the neighbors, driving up land prices in the process, said Chuck 
Hassebrook, program director of the Center for Rural Affairs in 
Walthill, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the purpose of these farm programs? Is it to help very  
wealthy, very large landowners get bigger and get richer? If it is 
then this all makes sense. ... I don't think that's what the public 
supports,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Limits on subsidies do ``retard the movement to larger farms and  
fewer farms,'' but raising them is unlikely to have much effect on 
farmers' expansion plans unless producers are convinced Congress 
won't lower them later, said Don Ethridge, an agricultural 
economist at Texas Tech University. 
</P>
<P>
	Pringle of the Texas Farm Bureau said it will take more than the  
prospect of bigger subsidies payments to get most farmers to buy or 
rent more land. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it. People in agriculture aren't going to expand  
their operations with prices where they are. The govenment payments 
aren't a good enough incentive,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Packers See Win As Ordinary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Even the extraordinary becomes ordinary  
if you see it often enough. Just ask the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	A funny thing didn't happen in the Packers' locker room Sunday  
night. After Green Bay beat Tampa Bay 26-23 by rallying in the 
final seconds for their third thrilling, come-from-behind win this 
season, almost nobody was excited. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one could say anything,'' said Brett Favre, who  
masterminded all three game-winning drives. ``I had three or four 
guys come up to me and say, `I guess I'm supposed to be excited, 
but I don't know what to say.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Favre, who has never in his life been called shy, said he  
was more numb than anything else. It seems the leader of the 
Cardiac Pack is just as amazed by his pressure performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time I didn't hyperventilate, because I just couldn't  
believe it,'' Favre said. ``This time I didn't cry, because I'm out 
of tears. Nobody knows what to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers (3-1) took over first place in the NFC Central by  
beating the Buccaneers, who thought they had the game sewn up when 
Mike Alstott ran 22 yards for a touchdown with 1:45 to play. It 
took Favre 40 seconds to change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Favre is a great player. You just like to watch him play,''  
Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said. ``He was just tremendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After four games and a bye week, Green Bay is a difficult team  
to evaluate. Will all these last-minute gut checks translate into 
maturity and toughness later in the season, or will the Packers 
finally run out of last chances? 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times can we get away with it?'' Favre wondered.  
``Good football teams will put the game away early. I just don't 
know if it's possible to keep doing it the way we've done it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay's vaunted defenders weren't much more than spectators  
late Sunday night as Favre, running back Dorsey Levens and wideouts 
Antonio Freeman and Bill Schroeder -- four players on pace for the 
best statistical seasons of their careers -- methodically moved the 
ball downfield in six plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have the feeling we're going to get it done,'' Freeman  
said. ``We're not cocky, but we know Brett will give us the 
opportunities we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some impressive statistics and those three remarkable  
drives, Green Bay's offense has been fickle. The Packers have 
scored just four offensive touchdowns over the last three games and 
are showing a disturbing propensity for failing in the red zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay got inside the 20 six times against the Buccaneers but  
came away with just one touchdown and one field goal. Those numbers 
won't do during the playoffs, and the Packers know it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, coach Ray Rhodes wasn't at all impressed with his  
seventh win in eight preseason and regular season games with the 
Packers. Instead, he condemned his team's lackluster special teams 
play and the nine penalties the Packers took for 88 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some bonehead penalties, that's all there is to it,''  
Rhodes said. ``Eventually this stuff is going to catch up to us. 
Number 4 can't save us every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Favre, who would have his fourth MVP award locked up if the  
voting were held this week, thinks some good can come from all the 
drama the Packers are enduring. He also thinks the Packers, who 
travel to Denver on Sunday, are good enough to win a game before 
the final seconds one of these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good football teams find a way to win,'' Favre said.  
``Someday, somebody's going to start believing.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Test Ban Vote Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked the Senate in writing  
on Monday to put off voting on the nuclear test ban treaty, warning 
that a likely defeat in Tuesday's scheduled vote would ``severely 
harm the national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans called his letter a first step toward possibly  
postponing the vote but sought further assurances the issue 
wouldn't come up again during this 106th Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I firmly believe the treaty is in the national interest,''  
Clinton wrote to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. But he recognized he lacked the 
two-thirds vote needed for ratification. ``Accordingly, I request 
that you postpone consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty on the Senate floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By putting his request in writing, Clinton met one demand of his  
Republican opponents. The letter was silent on their insistence 
that Clinton promise not to revive it during the 2000 election 
season, but White House officials rejected that request. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though there are campaigns under way in the United  
States, we have to take into account the larger national 
interest,'' said National Security Council spokesman David Leavy. 
``It would be irresponsible for the president to limit his tools in 
dealing with something as sensitive as nuclear testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said the letter was ``merely  
a first step,'' and noted that Lott, joined by Sen. Jesse Helms, 
R-N.C., Foreign Relations Committee chairman, has asked for 
agreement that the treaty not come before the Senate again before 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Lott will discuss this reversal by the White House  
with his fellow senators on Tuesday,'' Czwartacki said. ``Now there 
must be agreement reached in the Senate that it not come up 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms called Clinton's letter ``a step in the right direction''  
but insufficient. ``It must be made clear that this (treaty) is 
dead and that the next president will not be bound by its terms,'' 
he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services  
Committee, called the letter ``a significant step forward'' and was 
working with Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to build support 
in both parties for postponing the vote until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	A Warner aide said the two senators hoped to have a letter  
supporting the delay signed by a majority of senators from both 
parties on the desks of party leaders Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should be an easy call,'' Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware,  
the Foreign Relations Committee's ranking Democrat, said in a 
statement. ``The president has asked for a delay. Most Democrats 
and many Republicans support a delay. It's clearly in our national 
interest to put off this vote without any further wrangling. I hope 
the Senate puts the national interest first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty would impose a blanket international ban on all  
nuclear test explosions. Supporters estimate they are 15 to 20 
votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for Senate 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact has been signed by 154 nations, including the United  
States, but ratified by only 51. It will not go into effect if the 
United States fails to ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sent the signed treaty to the Republican-led Senate two  
years ago, but leaders refused to move on it before now. The only 
hearing on it was held last week by the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that proceeding to a vote under these circumstances  
would severely harm the national security of the United States, 
damage our relationship with our allies and undermine our historic 
leadership over 40 years ... in reducing the nuclear threat,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Clinton acknowledged he lacked the needed votes,  
suggested he wouldn't mind delaying ratification. But angered by 
the partisanship he said has clouded the issue, he also seemed to 
reject the idea of sending the Senate a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This treaty was never treated seriously,'' he charged. ``They  
want me to give them a letter to cover the political decision they 
have made? ... I don't think so.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Olympic Basketball To Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- The U.S. national women's  
basketball team will start a 12-game exhibition tour against some 
of the country's top college programs at Stanford on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams on the schedule include longtime powers Tennessee  
and Louisiana Tech, defending NCAA champion Purdue, Texas Tech and 
Duke, last season's NCAA runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-week tour is part of the national team's preparation for  
the 2000 Olympics. The national team is to form the core of the 
Olympic team, which will be announced next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a real competitive schedule,'' U.S. coach Nell  
Fortner said. ``It gives us the opportunity to work on things we 
need to work on heading into January, when we go play international 
teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team is on a break from training and will reassemble Oct. 25  
at Stanford. After meeting Stanford, coached by 1996 U.S. Olympic 
coach Tara VanDerveer, the U.S. team has games at UCLA (Nov. 5), 
Tennessee (Nov. 7), Duke (Nov. 10), Virginia (Nov. 12), Florida 
(Nov. 17), Ohio State (Nov. 21), Purdue (Nov. 28), Texas Tech (Dec. 
5), Stephen F. Austin (Dec. 7), Louisiana Tech (Dec. 9) and 
Illinois (Dec. 12). 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule is reduced from the 20-game college tour played by  
the 1996 Olympic team, which won the gold medal and went 60-0 and 
its warmup and Olympic games. 
</P>
<P>
	There also won't be as many scheduled public appearances as the  
'96 team made during its tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the idea this time,'' Fortner said. ``The idea in  
'95-96 was training and marketing. The water was being tested to 
see if the interest was here to have a professional league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to do that right now. We'll do some of it. These  
players are great. They're very approachable, very giving. They 
will sign autographs. They understand the importance of continuing 
to grow the game and continuing to gather fans. But we might not 
have as many things set up.''

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Coach Delays Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Doctors have delayed knee replacement  
surgery for Wisconsin football coach Barry Alvarez who now is 
expected to undergo the operation after the Big Ten season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Alvarez went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,  
Minn., last week and was expected to have the surgery to replace 
his severely arthritic right knee on Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a tissue infection was discovered in early stages of  
the surgery and the knee replacement was halted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin sports information office said Monday that Alvarez  
was cleared for release Tuesday from the Mayo Clinic. Back in 
Madison, he will require nursing care in his home to administer 
antibiotics and help with physical therapy while he works on 
increasing the range of motion and strength in the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	His progress in physical therapy will determine how soon he can  
return to some coaching duties. Plans for the knee replacement 
surgery also are dependent on everything going well with his 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez said Monday he was mildly frustrated by the delay.  
</P>
<P>
	``You come out of surgery and plan on having a new knee and they  
tell you that you don't because you have an infection,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez watched on a big-screen television Saturday as his  
17th-ranked Badgers beat Minnesota 20-17 in overtime. He talked to 
his coaches by telephone from his hospital room. 
</P>
<P>
	A nursing supervisor asked him to keep it down a couple times  
during the game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sitting in the (press) box is passive enough, let alone in a  
hospital bed,'' he said. ``Then they cut away to a commercial. It 
is very frustrating and very strange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez coached the Badgers' previous games against Michigan and  
Ohio State from the press box. 
</P>
<P>
	The knee has caused Alvarez severe pain ever since he re-injured  
it while attending an exhibition game in Madison between the Green 
Bay Packers and the Denver Broncos on Aug. 23. Internal bleeding 
was filling the joint with fluids. 
</P>
<P>
	John Palermo, Wisconsin's assistant head coach and defensive  
line coach, is acting head coach until Alvarez returns.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Men Vault to Gymnastics Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- In the end, the U.S. team's medal hopes  
rested on the muscled shoulders of John Roethlisberger. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't realize it. Eyes shut, facing away from his  
teammates, Roethlisberger had been elsewhere, trying to imagine 
himself back home in his gym, running through his routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Only when his feet hit the mat did he deal with reality. The  
four-time national champion's last-ditch effort Monday on the high 
bar had vaulted his team into the World Gymnastics Championships 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in two days that U.S. medal hopes rested  
on the last routine. Vanessa Atler clinched the women's team's 
place in the medal round with a 9.762 Sunday in the floor 
exercises. The finals for both teams are Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger's 9.525 on the bar capped a remarkable comeback  
for the 29-year-old from Falcon Heights, Minn. He underwent 
reconstructive knee surgery last year, and was sidelined for months 
before recovering and making the team for the championships in 
Tianjin. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men, whose last team medal -- a bronze -- came in 1979,  
were shaky in their first event, the floor exercises. Stephen 
McCain scored an 8.812, and Chris Young an 8.862 while his parents 
shouted encouragement from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the best way to start,'' Roethlisberger said of the  
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But they regrouped immediately on the pommel horse, led by a  
9.650 from Roethlisberger, a 9.612 from Yewki Tomita and a 9.487 
from Blaine Wilson -- the reigning and four-time national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The tattooed, pierced 25-year-old Wilson, who wears a silver  
tongue stud, was the most consistent U.S. gymnast. His 57.048 
points placed him sixth among the 36 gymnasts who qualified for the 
individual all-around competition. Tomita, whose father is a team 
coach, was 35th. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was lying fifth going into the high bar, its final  
event. With Russia and Belarus yet to come, they needed a strong 
finish to clinch a place in the medal round six. 
</P>
<P>
	But again, they started poorly. Sean Townsend fell and Tomita  
lost his grip, almost coming off, for scores of 8.762 and 8.450 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Young and Wilson did better, stopping the slide with scores of  
9.550 and 9.562. Wilson's routine included two circles of the bar 
hanging on with just one hand, performed despite an injured, 
taped-up shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't enough. With just Roethlisberger left, the team  
was still seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Roethlisberger said he hadn't been aware that the  
team was that close to not making the cut. He'd been standing apart 
from the team, running through his routine in his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was psyching myself up, trying to relax,'' he said. ``You've  
got to dig down deep, you've got to figure out what you're made of 
and get up there and try to pull off a routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Roethlisberger took a long time tightening up his wrist  
straps before climbing onto the bar, his routine seemed to be over 
in a flash. 
</P>
<P>
	When the scoreboard lit up 9.525, for a team score of 224.594  
and a place in the final, the team erupted with high-fives and 
shouts of ``Yeah!'' Roethlisberger turned to U.S. coaches in the 
stands and pumped his fists into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just awesome,'' said the elder Tomita. ``This team  
has such a big heart. Everyone chipped in, that's what turned it 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But getting a medal in the final will be tough. Ahead of the  
sixth-placed U.S. team in qualifying were South Korea, with 225.319 
points, Japan with 226.382, Belarus with 226.557 and Olympic 
champion Russia in second with 227.083. 
</P>
<P>
	China, the three-time defending champion and runaway qualifying  
leader with 230.546 points, looked untouchable. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to beat them here,'' Wilson said. ``They're  
home, definitely on their own turf, and they're real good.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect Charged in Chicago Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- DNA evidence from a string of unsolved killings  
and rapes in several South Side neighborhoods has led police to one 
possible suspect: a man in a Chicago jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Macon, 35, has been charged with three counts of  
first-degree murder. The Chicago man has been in jail since August 
awaiting trial on a separate rape charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said DNA evidence linked him to three of 13 killings of  
women in and around the poverty-stricken Englewood neighborhood 
since 1993. Police Cmdr. Frank Trigg said Sunday that Macon 
confessed on videotape to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Macon's arrest was the breakthrough they had  
been hoping for, but their investigation into the other murders 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to continue because the perpetrators are still  
out there,'' Trigg said. ``But we're certainly going to pause and 
acknowledge the significance of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macon's three alleged victims were all killed this year in the  
Englewood and Washington Park neighborhoods. Angelnetta Peeples, 
43, was found in an abandoned building Feb. 20. She had been 
strangled and hit on the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Soloman, 36, who was found April 14 in a stairwell, also  
had been strangled and hit on the head. Rosezina Williams, 50, was 
strangled and her body found in a trash container on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Macon could face the death penalty if convicted  
on the murder charges. They said they also might charge him with 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Macon is being held in lieu of $1.25 million bond on the current  
rape charge. He could be arraigned on the murder charges as early 
as today, Trigg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Macon's arrest, police have had little success in their  
investigation into the string of slayings. Few people in the 
neighborhoods knew the women or were willing to talk to police. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorities thought their luck might be changing last month  
when they charged three men with the March 1998 slaying of 
LaCreesha Avery, 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, who was beaten, raped and strangled, was found wrapped in  
one of the suspects' sheets in the same general area where the 
other bodies were found, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities thought the men might be tied to other unsolved  
murders, but later found that DNA samples from the men showed no 
connection.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell To Miss Exhibition Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell's excuse for missing the first  
week of training camp wasn't a good one. In fact, he really had 
none. He simply decided to blow it off in favor of a cross-country 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it was obvious where I was at,'' Sprewell explained  
Sunday following a week of uncertainty over his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said he ignored the Knicks' phone messages as he drove  
a 36-hour stretch solo in his Mercedes-Benz sedan from Oakland to 
his home in Milwaukee, arriving before dawn Wednesday, and then 
continued on to New York a day later with his brother and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks expected him to arrive at camp in Charleston, S.C.,  
by Wednesday morning. He'll be fined as much as $40,000 and will 
have to sit out the first exhibition game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell nonchalantly explained that he drove instead of taking  
a flight because he wanted to pick up some things in Milwaukee and 
he wanted to be sure that his car made it to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't call anybody. I'm not denying I didn't call  
them back; I just didn't,'' he said. ``It's on me. I didn't really 
communicate to anybody. It's like, I'll get there; I'll be there. 
It was not like I'm ditching camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell met with coach Jeff Van Gundy and general manager Scott  
Layden for 45 minutes Sunday morning at the team's practice 
facility. Sprewell arrived 20 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy and Layden refused to divulge many details of the  
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Knicks had the day off Sunday. Sprewell will  
join them for his first practice -- it will be the team's 10th -- 
today at Madison Square Garden before the team holds a public 
scrimmage. Sprewell will not play but is not officially suspended 
for the exhibition opener in Uniondale, N.Y., against the 
Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how our team is going to react,'' Van Gundy said.  
``I think Latrell most likely will need to address the situation to 
his teammates, and how the team from the inside handles it will be 
between them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said his lateness had nothing to do with his contract  
situation. Entering the final year of a four-year deal that will 
pay him $9 million this season, Sprewell is eligible to sign an 
extension during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts said over the  
summer that the Knicks were eager to begin discussing an extension, 
although it is unclear now if the Knicks will be a reluctant to 
commit as much as $60 or $70 million to Sprewell in a long-term 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden said the Knicks remain committed to Sprewell, while  
Sprewell said he'll wait and see what kind of money the Knicks 
offer him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on what the numbers are like,'' Sprewell said.  
``Obviously I want to do what's best for me, so I have to see what 
that entails.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What also remains to be seen is how this episode affects  
Sprewell's relationship with Van Gundy following a season in which 
they didn't see eye to eye on the question of whether Sprewell 
should have been a starter or a sixth man. Van Gundy didn't move 
Sprewell into the starting lineup until the Eastern Conference 
finals against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell does not want to come off the bench this season,  
although he said that had nothing to do with his absence from camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't trying to send a message,'' Sprewell said. ``People  
are going to think what they want to think. I don't see any reason 
why we can't hit the ground running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a big part of what we do, but I wasn't the sole reason why  
we got so far last year,'' he said. ``We still have time. It's not 
like the first game is tomorrow or in a week.''

<HEADLINE> Gordon Wins UAW-GM Quality 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon overtook Bobby Labonte with  
seven laps left to win the rain-delayed UAW-GM Quality 500 today, 
his second Winston Cup victory in as many weeks with new crew chief 
Brian Whitesell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really should seriously consider retiring right now,'' an  
elated Whitesell said after Gordon took the checkered flag about 10 
car-lengths ahead of Labonte at Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Gordon's 49th career victory, tying him with Rusty  
Wallace for 10th place on the sport's all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
	But more important to Gordon, it showed that he can continue to  
succeed without Ray Evernham, the crew chief who led him to his 
first 47 victories and three Winston Cup titles. Evernham asked for 
and was granted his release from the team late last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels incredible, absolutely incredible,'' Gordon said  
after his seventh victory of 1999. ``That Brian Whitesell, he's 
awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon averaged 160.306 mph, the fastest 500-mile race in the  
40-year history of the track, in a race slowed by just two 
cautions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Skinner put on a strong bid for the first victory in his  
105-race Winston Cup career, leading 62 laps before the final round 
of green-flag pit stops with 74 laps remaining. Skinner's crew had 
trouble changing a rear tire, dropping him to third for the 
restart, and he was unable to contend for the lead the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner wound up third, tying the best finish of his career.  
Mark Martin and Ward Burton rounded out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte went into the last round of pit stops in third place but  
beat the rest of the contenders back out onto the track. Once in 
front, he built his lead to three seconds before Gordon staged his 
charge in the closing stages of a race delayed one day by rain.

<HEADLINE>  German Wins Nobel for Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Dr. Guenter Blobel of The Rockefeller  
University in New York won the Nobel Prize for medicine today for 
protein research that shed new light on diseases including cystic 
fibrosis and early development of kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
	Blobel, 63, a native of Germany, was cited for discovering that  
proteins carry signals that act as zip codes, helping them find 
their correct locations within the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Some hereditary diseases are caused by errors in these signals  
and the associated transport mechanisms, the Nobel Assembly said in 
announcing the prize. The work has helped scientists use cells in 
laboratories to churn out drugs, and has had an ``immense impact'' 
on studies of the cell, the assembly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blobel was not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The prize announcement said Blobel's work explained the  
molecular roots of several genetic diseases. They include primary 
hyperoxaluria, which causes kidney stones at an early age, as well 
as some forms of inherited high cholesterol and illnesses like 
cystic fibrosis that occur when proteins fail to reach their proper 
positions within a cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Blobel, a cellular and molecular biologist, discovered in the  
early 1970s that newly made proteins carry the signals. During the 
next 20 years, he illuminated the details of how the signals work. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical mammalian cell contains about a billion protein  
molecules. Some are building blocks for the cell, while other act 
as enzymes, encouraging chemical reactions. The proteins are 
continually being destroyed and replaced, so newly made proteins 
must find their way to their proper posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralf Pettersson, professor of molecular biology at the  
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, dramatized the importance of the 
signals Blobel discovered by displaying an aerial picture of New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without an address, anybody who lands in this mash-mash of  
houses or streets would get lost,'' Pettersson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klas Kaerre, another Karolinska professor, said Blobel's  
research laid the basis for using biotechnology to produce drugs 
like insulin, growth hormone and a substance used during 
chemotherapy that helps the production of bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Proteins are long, folded chainlike molecules made up of  
building blocks called amino acids. The signals Blobel found are 
particular sequences of amino acids found either at one end of a 
protein or within it. 
</P>
<P>
	Specific signals determine whether a protein will end up in a  
specific compartment of a cell, lodge in the cell wall or be 
exported from the cell. Blobel's work also solved the mystery of 
how proteins enter the tightly sealed compartments of the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners of the Nobel Prize in physics and chemistry are to be  
announced Tuesday, followed by economics Wednesday and the peace 
prize Friday. All the prize announcements are in Stockholm, except 
for the peace prize, which is announced in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden will present the literature,  
science and economic prizes, this year worth $960,000, on Dec. 10, 
the anniversary of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel's death in 
1896. The peace prize will be presented on the same day in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	The science awards tend to be for breakthroughs that often pave  
the way for major advances in fighting disease and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Americans won the Nobel Prize in medicine last year for  
discovering that the body uses nitric oxide gas to make blood 
vessels relax and widen -- a finding that helped lead to the 
development of Viagra and could also pay off in treatments for 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery by Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Dr.  
Ferid Murad also triggered research that could lead to new 
treatments for cancer and septic shock.

	Clinton Seeks Test Ban Vote Delay  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked the Senate in writing  
on today to put off voting on the nuclear test ban treaty, warning 
that a likely defeat in tomorrow's scheduled vote would ``severely 
harm the national security.'' Republicans called his letter a first 
step toward possibly postponing the vote, but sought further 
assurances the issue wouldn't come up again during this 106th 
Congress. By putting his request in writing, Clinton met one GOP 
demand. His letter was silent on their insistence that he promise 
not to revive it during the 2000 election season, but White House 
officials rejected that request.

The endorsement would almost immediately kick into gear a

wrest control of Congress from the Republicans and topple GOP 
presidential front-runner George W. Bush. After backroom lobbying 
by Sweeney, the endorsement of Gore appeared secure.

<HEADLINE> Global Crossing To Buy Racal Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Global Crossing Ltd. is buying Racal Telecom,  
operator of a fiber-optic network in Britain, for about $1.6 
billion from Racal Electronics PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition announced Monday is the latest in a series of  
major deals for Bermuda-based Global Crossing, which has been 
building undersea and land-based fiber-optic networks to link 
different continents and countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, Bermuda-based Global Crossing will pay  
$1.57 billion in cash and assume Racal Telecom lease obligations 
worth $82.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still must be approved by Racal shareholders and  
regulatory authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Based at Bracknell, west of London, Racal Telecom operates  
fiber-optic telecommunications links between 2,000 towns and cities 
in the United Kingdom. It adds to Global Crossing's existing 
British operations and a pan-European network now being developed, 
said Bob Annunziata, chief executive of Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Annunziata estimated that the acquisition would yield net  
savings of about $450 million a year. No jobs are expected to be 
cut from among Racal Telecom's 1,300 employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In clinching the deal, Global Crossing outbid Energis, a British  
telecommunications firm, which had earlier offered an estimated 
$1.32 billion for Racal Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing recently completed a deal to acquire Frontier  
Corp., a U.S. long-distance company and operator of a U.S. 
fiber-optic network. It also agreed in May to pay $908 million for 
the underwater cable-laying business of Britain's Cable &AMP; Wireless 
PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing offers the Racal business ``a certain critical  
mass'' that is necessary for survival amid the rapid consolidation 
in the telecommunications industry, said Racal spokesman David 
Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
	Racal shareholders would benefit from a reduction in company  
debt and a large cash payout, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After selling its telecommunications network, Racal's business  
would consist mostly of defense and industrial electronics and 
transportation services.

<HEADLINE> Spartans Rise to No. 5 in AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Florida State and Penn State survived, Michigan State thrived  
and Georgia took a nosedive. 
</P>
<P>
	Those results created a minor shakeup near the top of this  
week's Associated Press Top 25 college football poll, with the 
Seminoles and Nittany Lions remaining 1-2 for the fourth week in a

Lansing. The Wolverines (5-1) fell seven spots to No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs were beaten 37-20 by No. 6 Tennessee and dropped  
four places to No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-ranked Seminoles (6-0), who beat Miami 31-21, had 63  
first-place votes and 1,743 points from the 70 sports writers and 
broadcasters on the AP panel, while the Nittany Lions, 31-7 winners 
over Iowa, had six first-place votes and 1,678 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska (6-0), a 49-14 winner over Iowa State, moved up one  
spot to No. 3, followed by No. 4 Virginia Tech and Michigan State. 
Rounding out the top 10 were Tennessee, No. 7 Florida, No. 8 
Georgia Tech, No. 9 Kansas State and Michigan.

</P>
<P>
	Mississippi and Southern Mississippi, the two new entries this

<HEADLINE> Justice Foresees Global Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court increasingly will be asked  
to look beyond U.S. borders when resolving 21st century disputes, 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor predicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling herself ``just a cowgirl from Arizona,'' O'Connor  
recently told a Navy War College audience in Newport, R.I., ``The 
world is increasingly interdependent and demands that we 
participate in a global community.'' She said America must learn 
``how to live in a world with porous borders,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, who took questions after her speech, said world trade  
treaties, ever-improving communications technology and 
multinational organizations blur the borders between nations and 
give rise to numerous legal questions. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Justice John Paul Stevens also has been out on the stump talking  
about blurred lines, but in a completely different context. The 
oldest justice is complaining about a recent practice of newly 
confirmed Supreme Court appointees. 
</P>
<P>
	Two oaths -- constitutional and judicial -- are taken before a  
justice takes his or her place on the bench, and Stevens noted 
during a speech at the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, 
Mich., that for decades both oaths were administered at the Supreme 
Court building. 
</P>
<P>
	``In recent years, some of my colleagues have taken their first  
oath in a televised proceeding conducted at the White House,'' said 
Stevens, 79. ``I ... have refused to attend the last four of those 
televised events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why? ``It is, in my judgment, a serious mistake to replace an  
important symbol of the independence of the federal judiciary with 
an event that tends to blur the critical distinction between 
political and judicial service,'' Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, one of the court's most prolific dissenters,  
acknowledged that ``my colleagues do not share my concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Republican senators, Jon Kyl and John McCain, want a  
new federal courthouse being built in Phoenix to bear O'Connor's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice O'Connor has been making history throughout her long  
and distinguished career,'' Kyl said in announcing that he and 
McCain were introducing legislation to bring about the honor. ``She 
... should be recognized for that service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, 69, became the first woman on the Supreme Court when  
appointed by President Reagan in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Her name already is attached to a high school in Helotes, Texas.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Wanda Martinson, who for 25 years served as No. 1 secretary to  
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, has left the court for a new job. She is 
confidential assistant to Solicitor General Seth Waxman, the 
Clinton administration's chief advocate before the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun died in March at age 90, five years after he retired.  
Martinson has spent recent months cleaning off his offices. 
</P>
<P>
	At a sendoff party for Martinson last week, Chief Justice  
William H. Rehnquist described her early career with painstaking 
detail. ``All this came to me in a dream,'' said Rehnquist, 
laughing, when asked about his research. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinson was given a flag that had flown over the court plaza  
on the 1999-2000 court term's opening day, but Rehnquist mistakenly 
told her it had flown at ``half-staff.'' Catching his error, the 
chief justice said: ``We aren't that sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer spoke about  
Martinson's kindness to them and their office staffs when they were 
high court rookies. Also on hand were Justices Antonin Scalia and 
David H. Souter and retired Justice Byron R. White.

<HEADLINE> Colt May End Consumer Handgun Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Colt's Manufacturing Co. -- inventor of  
the six-shooter, ``the gun that won the West'' -- is all but getting 
out of the everyday handgun business because of lawsuits against 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's -- which also makes the famous .45-caliber automatic that  
was the U.S. military sidearm of choice for most of this century -- 
is discontinuing seven lines of consumer handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales to everyday consumers make up about 30 percent of the  
company's business, The New York Times reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will continue to make its classic handguns: the  
.45-caliber automatic and the Model P, a replica of Samuel Colt's 
famous six-shot revolver. Both will continue to be available to the 
general public. 
</P>
<P>
	Handguns for the military, law enforcement agencies and  
collectors, which already make up the bulk of its business, will 
also continue. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to distributors last week, Colt's said the move  
was forced by lawsuits filed against gun manufacturers by 28 cities 
and counties around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had to face the harsh reality of the significant  
impact which our litigation defense costs are having on our ability 
to operate competitively in the marketplace,'' Vice President 
Thomas H. Kilby wrote. A copy of the letter was obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's also plans to eliminate as many 300 of the 700 jobs at  
its West Hartford factory, according to Newsweek magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Colt's officials nor company attorneys returned calls  
seeking comment Monday. But in a statement, the company said 
eliminating some unprofitable handgun lines ``is part of the 
normal, ongoing management of the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our marketing objective is to streamline our handgun product  
line into a smaller, but higher-value collection of real Colt 
`Classics' ... for serious gun enthusiasts and shooters,'' Kilby 
said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Colt got his first patent for a revolver -- a handgun with  
a cylinder holding five or six cartridges -- in 1836. An initial 
venture failed, but Colt's design gained new favor after the war 
with Mexico in 1846. 
</P>
<P>
	The business was incorporated in 1855 as the Colt's Patent Fire  
Arms Manufacturing Co. Its long-barreled Single Action Army model 
of 1873 is the archetypal six gun of the Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
	But today Colt's is among the gunmakers targeted by cities and  
counties seeking reimbursement for the costs of gun violence. In 
February, a federal jury in New York City found that the marketing 
practices of Colt's and eight other companies made them liable for 
shootings with handguns obtained illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Colt's announced it would create a separate  
company, iColt, to produce its high-tech ``smart gun,'' a weapon 
that can only be fired by an authorized user. 
</P>
<P>
	Other gunmakers, including California-based Davis Industries,  
have taken steps to limit their liability. Davis, a company that 
makes small, cheap handguns, filed for bankruptcy protection in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian J. Siebel, senior attorney with the Washington-based  
Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, said the decision by Colt's 
will not persuade the cities to drop the company as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun advocates said they were disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think these lawsuits are going to go anywhere,'' said  
Robert Crook, executive director of the Coalition of Connecticut 
Sportsmen, a lobbying group with 40,000 members in Connecticut. 
``They're based on a faulty presumption: that manufacturers should 
pay for the death and disorder of criminals on the streets.''

<HEADLINE>  Yanks Matching '98 Postseason Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Through 162 games, the 1999 New York  
Yankees were no match for their record-setting predecessors. 
Through one round of the playoffs, the two are dead even. 
</P>
<P>
	As unfair as it might be to compare any team to the 1998  
Yankees, winners of an AL-record 114 games, the harsh reality is 
that this year's club is playing in their shadow. It's almost 
impossible not to use last year as a measuring stick. 
</P>
<P>
	With a 3-0 victory Saturday night against Texas, New York  
wrapped up a first-round sweep by that same margin. The Yankees 
allowed only one run in the three games -- just like last year -- 
while scoring five more than they did in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Although this team won 16 fewer games from April to October --  
the biggest falloff in the AL -- it still has a chance for a better 
postseason. Beating last year's 11-2 playoff run won't be easy, but 
sweeping Texas at least makes it possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see guys are just determined to get it done, whether it's  
going to get a ball or cut a ball off,'' said Game 3 winner Roger 
Clemens. ``That's what these games are about now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees began their quest for a third title in four years  
and their 25th overall by extending their postseason winning streak 
to 10 straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Great pitching was the biggest reason for their success,  
starting with starts Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Andy Pettitte 
and Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Notice someone missing? How about David Cone, who pitched a  
perfect game this summer and is widely regarded as the staff's 
postseason ace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're throwing the ball well, and our best money pitcher  
hasn't even come out of the bag yet,'' Clemens said. ``It'll be 
interesting to see what spark he gives us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone, who could use the extra rest, would've started Game 4  
against Texas. Instead, he'll likely pitch the opener of the AL 
championship series Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium against 
either Cleveland or Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers are getting good at being a first-round sparring  
partner for the Yankees, having lost nine straight playoff games to 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, which led the majors with a .293 average in the regular  
season, batted just .152, including 0-for-13 with runners in 
scoring position. The Rangers were shut out twice in three games 
after being blanked seven times in 162 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees led 20 of the 27 innings this series thanks largely  
to improved hitting by Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams. After going 
1-for-20 against Texas last year, the duo went 9-for-22 with six 
RBIs and five runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both also came through in the field, especially Saturday. Jeter  
made a nice play to get the final out, and Williams chased down the 
three hardest-hit balls by the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter and Williams were on base in the first inning when Darryl  
Strawberry drove in the game's only runs with a two-out homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive awoke a lifeless New York dugout and left Texas facing  
a deficit it didn't have the confidence to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching like a five-time Cy Young Award winner should, Clemens  
made the lead hold up by allowing just three singles in seven 
shutout innings. The Rangers reached second only once, and that 
threat ended on the next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' first postseason win since 1986 began making up for a  
mediocre regular season and reminded critical Yankees fans why he 
was acquired from Toronto in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this turns the page on everything that happened this  
year,'' New York manager Joe Torre said. ``This is the pitcher we 
traded for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost overshadowed is the dramatic reversal by Strawberry, who  
at this time last year only gave the Yankees inspiration as he 
fought colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Having beaten the disease and endured another arrest and  
suspension, the king of comebacks said this homer ``probably is at 
the top of the list after all I've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling,'' he said. ``This team is always  
accomplishing a lot. We play as a team, as hard as we can and we 
win. I think everybody appreciates what we've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees and New York Mets both among the final four  
teams for the first time, the city already is abuzz over the chance 
for a Subway Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who has won World Series rings with both teams, can  
only imagine the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to think, `How crazy will it be in New York?''' he  
said. ``As far as the fans and the rivals, Mets fans and Yankees 
fans, you wonder if the city can control that.''

<HEADLINE> South Africa, EU Sign Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- After more than four years of  
negotiations, South Africa and the European Union signed a free 
trade pact Monday, warding off a last-minute bid by France to get 
further concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement proposes abolishing tariffs on about 90 percent of  
two-way trade between South Africa and the EU -- which tops more 
than $17 billion annually. Over 12 years, South Africa will 
eliminate tariffs on 86 percent of goods it imports from EU 
countries, while tariffs on 90 percent of its exports to the EU 
will be lifted within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears that the accord would unravel emerged Monday after  
Pretoria rejected fresh demands that it give wider recognition to 
product names emanating from Europe. The signing ceremony in 
Pretoria, the capital, was delayed by nearly an hour as the French 
deliberated whether to block the deal, which needed the approval of 
all 15 EU member states. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats said French President Jacques Chirac had to be called  
to resolve the impasse and have the agreement cleared by a meeting 
of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, to be implemented Jan. 1 next year, is the most  
important to be struck by South Africa's post-apartheid government. 
Pretoria took a hard line in the negotiations with its largest 
trading partner and was rewarded with significant access for its 
agricultural products in EU markets.

<HEADLINE> Mets Third-Base Coach Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- New York Mets third-base coach Cookie Rojas was  
suspended Monday for five games -- a penalty to begin with Game 1 of 
the NL championship series -- for shoving umpire Charlie Williams in 
the chest during a playoff game last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman issued the suspension and also fined  
Rojas $500. 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Bruce Benedict will take over Rojas' spot. Rojas  
declined comment until he could meet with Coleman, most likely 
before the Mets opened their best-of-7 series against Atlanta on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our view, it was much steeper than we anticipated,'' Mets  
general manager Steve Phillips said. ``I talked to Len for about 30 
minutes and shared my feelings and my view about the severity of 
the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him what I saw live and on tape,'' he said. ``Our views  
agreed on some things and disagreed on others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The altercation took place Saturday at Shea Stadium after Rojas  
was ejected in the eighth inning of the Mets' clinching 4-3 win 
over Arizona in Game 4 of the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas became enraged after Williams, the left-field umpire,  
ruled Darryl Hamilton's drive down the line was foul. Replays 
showed Williams made the correct call. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas was quickly ejected and the argument heated up. Manager  
Bobby Valentine ran onto the field and shielded Rojas from 
Williams, and first-base coach Mookie Wilson also tried to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rojas broke through and, after there was contact between him  
and Williams -- it was unclear who initiated that brush -- he pushed 
the umpire with two hands in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Rojas claimed Williams had called him a name and  
added, ``He bumped me first.'' Williams did not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said Rojas, who also positions the Mets' infielders,  
would be missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people think all he does is coach third base,'' Valentine  
said. ``He does a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Robin Ventura said he would notice the change.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's different,'' he said. ``The infielders rely on  
him being at third base every day. You're used to his timing of 
giving you signs and the way you communicate, you know what he's 
asking for. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it's going to be a little bit different to understand what  
the other coaches are asking you to do,'' he said. ``I think Cookie 
becomes comfortable with us, and it doesn't take quite as long to 
explain what you want when you've done it that long.''

<HEADLINE> Lonmin Offers To Buy Ashanti Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British mining company Lonmin PLC has offered to  
buy the 68 percent of shares in Ashanti Goldfields Co. that it 
doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashanti, a gold mining company based in Ghana, said Monday it  
received the offer. It has been struggling to come up with some 
$270 million to pay its creditors for margin calls on futures 
contracts for the sale of gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm was surprised by the recent surge in gold prices and  
had hedged 40 percent of its reserves against a decrease in price. 
When prices increased, banks demanded that it put up cash as 
collateral for its mounting paper losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the offer, Lonmin would pay 32 new Lonmin shares for every  
43 Ashanti shares that it doesn't own. Lonmin already has a 32 
percent stake in Ashanti. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the Oct. 8 closing price for Ashanti shares, this  
represents a price of $7 a share. Ashanti last traded Friday on the 
New York Stock Exchange, when it closed at $3.75 a share.

<HEADLINE> Piazza Expects To Return to Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The soft blue cast on Mike Piazza's left thumb  
was replaced with a gray wrap. The New York Mets' All-Star catcher 
was smoking line drives in batting practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of their NL championship series showdown with the  
Atlanta Braves, the Mets got the best news possible: Their best 
hitter would likely be back in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pain has definitely subsided a lot,'' Piazza said Monday  
after missing the last two games against Arizona because of his 
injured left thumb. ``The swelling has gone down a lot. I don't 
want to say anything definite right now, but it is feeling good. I 
do expect to play tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza took batting practice, played catch and ran sprints  
during a workout that began two hours early after the Braves 
notified the Mets that thunderstorms were expected at the scheduled 
7 p.m. starting time. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he felt about 90 percent, and manager Bobby Valentine  
was encouraged by what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a tough cookie, hard to read sometimes,'' Valentine said.  
``When we talk to him we will know where we are. It's probably not 
perfect, but it's better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were going to wait until Tuesday morning to decide  
whether to add Mike Kinkade to the roster as a third catcher. 
General manager Steve Phillips said the team could drop one of its 
11 pitchers or a position player -- most likely Bobby Bonilla -- to 
create a roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza originally injured the thumb when he was hit in the thumb  
of his glove hand by a foul tip off the bat of Philadelphia's Ron 
Gant on Sept. 17. He re-aggravated the injury last Wednesday 
against Arizona and took a cortisone shot to reduce the swelling. 
But he had a bad reaction and the swelling increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is once the inflammation from the cortisone  
stopped, it could start to do what it was supposed to,'' Phillips 
said. ``He should be better now than he was before the shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Piazza can't play, the Mets once again will turn to Todd  
Pratt, who hit the game-winning home run in the 10th inning 
Saturday off Matt Mantei to put the Mets in the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pratt took batting practice Monday, a teammate yelled out  
``Mantei'' before he swung. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can you say about Todd?'' Piazza asked. ``He's done a  
tremendous job. It wasn't like I had this overwhelming pressure 
from Bobby or anybody else. ... It was like they're going to have 
to do it without me, and that's a good feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets did it without Piazza against the Diamondbacks, but  
making up for his 40 home runs and 124 RBIs will be a tougher task 
against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``His presence in the lineup is different than anybody else  
because of his power and average and everything he brings to the 
lineup,'' Robin Ventura said. ``Obviously it's important that we 
have him. He makes our lineup a lot stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Atlanta beat up on the Mets even with Piazza. The Braves won  
nine of 12 against the Mets -- losing the only game Piazza missed. 
They held New York to three or fewer runs in all nine wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams have claimed the other doesn't respect them -- a war  
of words that has left Piazza amused. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like you keep getting knocked down, and probably  
they're saying, `How many times are you guys going to come back for 
your beating?' '' Piazza said. ``We're the proverbial kid on the 
block who is maybe trying to work out and get stronger and do 
something different to finally beat up the bully. Hopefully, this 
will be that time.''

<HEADLINE>  Yanks Matching '98 Postseason Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Through 162 games, the 1999 New York  
Yankees were no match for their record-setting predecessors. 
Through one round of the playoffs, the two are dead even. 
</P>
<P>
	As unfair as it might be to compare any team to the 1998  
Yankees, winners of an AL-record 114 games, the harsh reality is 
that this year's club is playing in their shadow. It's almost 
impossible not to use last year as a measuring stick. 
</P>
<P>
	With a 3-0 victory Saturday night against Texas, New York  
wrapped up a first-round sweep by that same margin. The Yankees 
allowed only one run in the three games -- just like last year -- 
while scoring five more than they did in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Although this team won 16 fewer games from April to October --  
the biggest falloff in the AL -- it still has a chance for a better 
postseason. Beating last year's 11-2 playoff run won't be easy, but 
sweeping Texas at least makes it possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see guys are just determined to get it done, whether it's  
going to get a ball or cut a ball off,'' said Game 3 winner Roger 
Clemens. ``That's what these games are about now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees began their quest for a third title in four years  
and their 25th overall by extending their postseason winning streak 
to 10 straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Great pitching was the biggest reason for their success,  
starting with starts Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Andy Pettitte 
and Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Notice someone missing? How about David Cone, who pitched a  
perfect game this summer and is widely regarded as the staff's 
postseason ace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're throwing the ball well, and our best money pitcher  
hasn't even come out of the bag yet,'' Clemens said. ``It'll be 
interesting to see what spark he gives us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone, who could use the extra rest, would've started Game 4  
against Texas. Instead, he'll likely pitch the opener of the AL 
championship series Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium against 
either Cleveland or Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers are getting good at being a first-round sparring  
partner for the Yankees, having lost nine straight playoff games to 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, which led the majors with a .293 average in the regular  
season, batted just .152, including 0-for-13 with runners in 
scoring position. The Rangers were shut out twice in three games 
after being blanked seven times in 162 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees led 20 of the 27 innings this series thanks largely  
to improved hitting by Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams. After going 
1-for-20 against Texas last year, the duo went 9-for-22 with six 
RBIs and five runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both also came through in the field, especially Saturday. Jeter  
made a nice play to get the final out, and Williams chased down the 
three hardest-hit balls by the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter and Williams were on base in the first inning when Darryl  
Strawberry drove in the game's only runs with a two-out homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive awoke a lifeless New York dugout and left Texas facing  
a deficit it didn't have the confidence to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching like a five-time Cy Young Award winner should, Clemens  
made the lead hold up by allowing just three singles in seven 
shutout innings. The Rangers reached second only once, and that 
threat ended on the next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' first postseason win since 1986 began making up for a  
mediocre regular season and reminded critical Yankees fans why he 
was acquired from Toronto in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this turns the page on everything that happened this  
year,'' New York manager Joe Torre said. ``This is the pitcher we 
traded for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost overshadowed is the dramatic reversal by Strawberry, who  
at this time last year only gave the Yankees inspiration as he 
fought colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Having beaten the disease and endured another arrest and  
suspension, the king of comebacks said this homer ``probably is at 
the top of the list after all I've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling,'' he said. ``This team is always  
accomplishing a lot. We play as a team, as hard as we can and we 
win. I think everybody appreciates what we've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees and New York Mets both among the final four  
teams for the first time, the city already is abuzz over the chance 
for a Subway Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who has won World Series rings with both teams, can  
only imagine the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to think, `How crazy will it be in New York?''' he  
said. ``As far as the fans and the rivals, Mets fans and Yankees 
fans, you wonder if the city can control that.''

<HEADLINE> Nine Planet Hollywoods To Close U.S. locations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Planet Hollywood has closed nine of its 32  
U.S. restaurants ahead of a planned Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando-based company plans to file bankruptcy petitions  
today in Delaware, and will soon file its reorganization plan, the 
company said in a news release Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the first step in our plan to position Planet  
Hollywood for a return to long-term profitability and healthy 
growth,'' said Robert Earl, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's restructuring plan also calls for upgrading  
several of its movie-themed restaurants and menus, Earl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurants closed Monday were in Chicago, Costa Mesa,  
Calif.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Gurnee, Ill.; Houston; Indianapolis; 
Maui, Hawaii; Miami and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	There may still be a couple of additional closings or franchise  
conversions, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reorganization, Planet Hollywood International  
Inc.'s two largest shareholders and a trust for Earl's children 
have agreed to provide a $30 million cash infusion to help keep the 
international chain of glitzy restaurants going. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned bankruptcy filing is the latest setback for the  
operator of nearly 80 Planet Hollywood restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Former president William Baumhauer resigned in June, just three  
months after the company's co-founder resigned his board position. 
Keith Barish, who started the venture with Earl and actors 
Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce 
Willis, left the company in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been trying to cut operating costs by reducing  
corporate overhead, putting in cost-control systems, streamlining 
store-level operations and disposing of nonessential corporate 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those moves, analysts have said aggressive expansion and  
increased competition have hurt the company.

<HEADLINE> Vanguard Releasing After-Tax Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Vanguard Group will begin publishing the  
after-tax returns for 47 of its stock and balanced funds, in a move 
the company said will give investors a clearer picture of their 
funds' actual return. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest mutual fund firm is the first fund  
company to disclose after-tax returns on a broad range of mutual 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vanguard has long recognized the importance of discussing tax  
facts in evaluating mutual fund returns,'' said Joel Dickson, 
Vanguard principal and tax specialist. ``We see the actual 
publication of returns as a next logical step in providing 
investors the information they need to assess how their portfolio 
has performed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The information debuts in Vanguard's U.S. Growth Fund and its  
International Growth Fund's 1999 annual reports being mailed to 
shareholders this week, Dickson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Vanguard, taxes have deducted about 2.5 percentage  
points per year off the return of its U.S. stock mutual funds over 
the past 10 years. Investors in the company's largest portfolio, 
Vanguard Index 500 Fund, saw taxes take away 1.2 points per year. 
On the high end, taxes erased 3.5 points per year from the return 
of actively managed Vanguard Windsor Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard's step may lead other fund groups to start providing  
similar disclosures, but investors should keep in mind that the 
return information is not customized and will vary from person to 
person, said Geoff Bobroff, a fund consultant in East Greenwich, 
R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're proposing to do is a great first step in  
providing information to investors about their investments, but 
it's going to have to be somewhat uniformly applied,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The after-tax figures are calculated based on the highest  
individual federal income-tax rates -- currently 39.6 percent for 
dividends and short-term capital gains distributions and 20 percent 
for long-term capital-gains distributions. State and local taxes 
are not included. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard will present tables showing pretax and after-tax  
figures over one-, five- and 10-year periods. For comparison, the 
returns use calculations by Morningstar Inc. of after-tax returns 
of similar funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningstar calculates that industrywide, mutual funds that are  
set up to minimize taxes lost just 0.22 percentage point of their 
return to taxes in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, while the average 
growth fund lost 1.67 points to taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningstar's data indicated that growth funds' overall  
after-tax performance still was better than tax-managed funds for 
the past 12 months, although tax-managed funds outperformed growth 
funds for both the past three years and the past five years. There 
are relatively few tax-managed funds, however, compared with growth 
funds, and even fewer tax-managed funds existed three and five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving investors more information is a good move but Vanguard  
may be ``preaching to the converted,'' said Daniel P. Wiener, 
editor of The Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get the annual report, you're already a shareholder ...  
you're going to have to work a little harder for it if you're not a 
shareholder,'' he said. ``But it's a good first step. They're going 
to get a lot of kudos for this, and they deserve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The after-tax information will not be available to investors in  
tax-deferred accounts such as IRAs or 401(k)s, Dickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard, based in Valley Forge, Pa., serves 14 million clients  
and manages nearly $500 billion, including the retirement 
investments of The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any information that's useful and provides a better  
representation of returns ... is beneficial,'' Dickson said. 
``Although it's difficult to do an exact evaluation, we know what 
isn't correct -- and that's a zero percent tax rate.''

<HEADLINE> Eagle's Croce Will Have Leg Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia 76ers president Pat Croce will  
undergo surgery on his severely broken left leg, which has shown no 
signs of bone growth, his doctor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's X-rays show really no significant sign of bone  
healing,'' said Dr. William DeLong, Head of Trauma at the Hospital 
of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP), who will perform the 
procedures Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most fractures such as this require more than the initial  
surgery,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Croce has a metal rod in the middle of his leg with some screws  
at the top and bottom holding it in place. Doctors plan to remove 
the screw from the top part to allow the bone to slide down, then 
inject bone marrow and possibly some protein into the fracture to 
stimulate the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat has some pain when he walks now, which means he doesn't  
have stability in the leg,'' DeLong said. ``There could be 
additional pain when we do this, but that pressure is one of the 
things that can increase bone growth. It may help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On June 17, the 44-year-old Croce was injured in a motorcycle  
accident on a wet New Jersey road, shattering his leg in 10 places. 
He was admitted to HUP, where three procedures were performed, 
including a skin graft taking tissue from his shoulder blade and 
applying it over the wound. 
</P>
<P>
	While the skin graft has taken well and Croce has strengthened  
the muscles in his leg to the point he can now walk with the aid of 
crutches, the fact the bone itself has not grown is cause for 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat's injury was very bad and it happened in the worst spot on  
the leg,'' DeLong said. ``We are fortunate at this point there is 
sign of infection. His superior conditioning can only help him. I 
probably have never had a specimen to work on like Pat Croce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors expect to know in two to four weeks whether the  
procedure is working, and there are several options to consider if 
it fails. ``But, it's hard for us to put a clock on him,'' DeLong 
said.

<HEADLINE> Mice Infest Orlando Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Mice have infested thousands of homes in a  
part of Florida practically built on the popularity of Mickey 
Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush has directed $400,000 in state and local funds for  
poison, traps and other weapons to kill rodents that have crawled 
into at least 10,000 homes in a 50-square-mile area of Orange 
County, the home of Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just one or two. There were dozens of them,'' said  
retiree Mildred Jackson of Zellwood. ``We've tried everything. 
Traps, sticky pads, everything. Nothing works. I'm ready to pack up 
and go back to New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	County health officials believe the mice population is booming  
and making its way out of the farmland and muck near Lake Apopka, 
about 10 miles north of Walt Disney World. No mice problems have 
been reported at Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials warn the rodents will be looking to move  
indoors as temperatures drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Mouse bait and traps will be distributed through fire stations  
and other public places as early as Tuesday. Officials plan to cut 
high grass and demolish some abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Doyle of Plymouth said she is keeping her traps baited.  
</P>
<P>
	It's going to be us or them,'' she said, ``and I'll be damned if  
I'm going to let a little mouse chase me out of my home.''

<HEADLINE> N.C. Schools Rely on Trailers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- More than 600 children filed into  
classrooms assembled out of trailers Monday, more than three weeks 
after Hurricane Floyd's floodwaters engulfed their schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngsters were greeted with hugs and stuffed animals.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's so good to hear the children laughing again,'' Edgecombe  
County schools spokeswoman Diane LeFiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children hadn't set foot in a classroom since Sept. 15, the  
day before Floyd swamped North Carolina with more than 20 inches of 
rain. The floodwaters swallowed farms and towns and killed at least 
49 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 other Edgecombe County schools opened last week, but the  
Princeville Montessori School and the Pattillo A+ Elementary School 
were so heavily damaged that dozens of trailers had to be brought 
in to serve as classrooms for at least the rest of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials have yet to determine whether the two buildings  
can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	``My children were so excited that they couldn't sleep last  
night,'' said Janice Davidson, whose twin 8-year-olds attend 
Princeville Montessori. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Odom, Princeville Montessori's principal, said a crisis  
team was on hand for the youngsters but didn't appear needed. 
``They're young, and they just bounce right back. They were ready 
to get back,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the students at Odom's school are from Princeville, a  
town of 1,900 founded by former slaves. Princeville was inundated 
by the Tar River, and it will probably be next year before 
residents can return home. Many are staying with friends and 
relatives; a few remain in a shelter at a high school. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pattillo, a donated stuffed animal sat on the desk of each  
student. Later in the day, Kathy Valadja of Pittsburgh and her two 
sons brought 930 stuffed animals to Princeville Montessori. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 10-year-old son Alex came up with the idea. He and his  
friends collected the animals and raised more than $1,000 for Floyd 
victims.

<HEADLINE> European stocks close mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed mixed Monday, with the  
pharmaceutical industry leading the rise and oil shares falling. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in SmithKline Beecham jumped 38.5 pence, or 5 percent, to  
813 pence and Glaxo shares rose 70 pence, or 4 percent, to 1,801 
pence. 
</P>
<P>
	The stocks rose after rumors circulated that SmithKline  
Beecham's chief executive Jan Leschly was to retire early, but the 
company denied that he was leaving. Still, the rumors set off 
merger speculation as Leschly was seen as the main obstacle to a 
deal between the pharmaceutical companies, after talks broke down 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the European bourses, oil stocks were among those falling,  
with BP Amoco down 2 pence to 538 pence, Shell dropping 2 pence to 
439 pence. In Paris, Total Fina lost 2.00 euros to close at 112.00 
euros. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 614 European companies rose 0.78  
points to close at 313.15. The pharmaceutical index was the best 
performer, with a gain of 2.3 percent, followed by the technology 
index, which rose 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 310 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed up 0.53 points at 
327.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 5.57 points to 3789.89,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed up 18.40 points at 3775.51. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares rose 0.6  
percent, to close at 6,234.8. In addition to the jump in 
pharmaceutical shares, telecommunications stocks also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone AirTouch rose 12.25 pence to 315.25 pence, Orange rose  
68 pence to 1,419 pence, and British Telecommunications rose 23 
pence to 1,018.5 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in the rest of Europe, telecommunications shares fell,  
with Deutsche Telekom down 89 pence at 42.11 euros. Traders 
attributed the decline to uncertainty about the future of the 
company's Global One partnership with Sprint Corp. and France 
Telecom, which itself lost 2.35 euros to close at 86.50 euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index fell 0.1 percent to 5,414.40, the  
Paris CAC-40 index rose 0.42 of a point to 4,722.35, Milan's MIBtel 
index fell 0.2 percent to 33,837 and Amsterdam's AEX index fell 0.9 
percent to 559.77.

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A staffer working for the U.N.  
civilian mission in Kosovo was shot and killed Monday night after 
his first day on the job, U.N. officials said. The staffer was shot 
on the main street of the capital, Pristina, on his way to dinner 
after arriving for duty earlier in the day, spokesman Manoel de 
Almeida e Silva said in New York. Members of the U.N. police force 
in Pristina said the man, apparently a Bulgarian national, was shot 
near the Grand Hotel, where many international workers stay.

	Clinton Pushes Senate for Test Ban Delay

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton formally asked the Senate  
today to delay tomorrow's vote on the nuclear test ban treaty, 
warning that a likely defeat would hurt national security. 
Republicans called his letter a first step toward possibly 
postponing the vote, but sought assurances the issue wouldn't come 
up again during this 106th Congress. By putting his request in 
writing, Clinton met one demand of his Republican opponents. The 
letter was silent on their insistence that Clinton promise not to 
revive it during the 2000 election season, and White House 
officials rejected that request.

born here was to be designated as the symbolic Baby Six Billion.

	U.S. Citizen Wins Nobel for Medicine  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A scientist at New York's Rockefeller University  
won the Nobel Prize in medicine today for discovering how proteins 
find their rightful places in cells. Dr. Guenter Blobel, 63, a 
German native who became a U.S. citizen in the 1980s, said that by 
showing how cells work when they're healthy, his research might 
help scientists understand what goes wrong in diseases. Blobel 
found that after proteins are created, they reach their various 
workplaces because they carry signals that indicate where to go. 
These signals determine whether a protein ends up in a certain 
compartment of a cell, takes up residence in the cell wall, or is 
expelled from the cell. Mistakes can kill a cell or cause disease.

al-Sayegh left the United States on a U.S. government aircraft late

States are considered ``mujahedeen,'' or holy warriors, by the 
Taliban religious army. Mullah Mohammed Omar also warned Washington 
not to threaten the Taliban or Afghanistan. But he didn't elaborate 
on what actions, if any, the Taliban were prepared to take.

	World Population Nears 6 Billion  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The world's population will reach 6  
billion tomorrow according to U.N. demographers -- having doubled 
since 1960 -- with more than 1 billion young people just entering 
their reproductive years. Even with a continuing decline in 
fertility rates and family size, the sheer numbers of the largest 
``youthquake'' in history guarantee enormous population growth 
through 2050, U.N. population experts say. And there is another 
``youthquake'' coming, with 1.8 billion youngsters under the age of 
15.

	2nd Trial Opens in Gay Attack  
</P>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Almost a year to the day after gay college  
student Matthew Shepard died with a cracked skull, jury selection 
began today in the murder trial of the man accused of instigating 
the attack. A few anti-gay protesters demonstrated outside the 
courthouse, along with people who came to honor Shepard's memory, 
wearing angel costumes to spread what they said was a message of 
love. Inside, Aaron McKinney's lawyer told prospective jurors that 
he had a role in the beating death, but his judgement was clouded 
by drugs and alcohol.

	Clinton Asks for Test Ban Vote Delay

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In response to a demand by Republicans,  
President Clinton sent a letter to the Senate today asking that a 
vote on the nuclear test ban treaty be delayed. However, the letter 
left unanswered the demand by some senators that Clinton promise 
not to try to revive the treaty during the 2000 presidential 
election year. Senate opponents led by Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., have said the vote will proceed unless Clinton withdraws 
the treaty and promises not to resubmit it during his term. The 
treaty would impose a blanket international ban on all nuclear test 
explosions.

	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- AIDS and rape are so common in  
South Africa that an insurance company is offering a policy to try 
to protect rape victims from contracting the disease. The policy, 
to be introduced tomorrow by the CGU Insurance Ltd, provides a 
one-month course of anti-retroviral drugs to prevent infection, a 
year's worth of AIDS tests and counseling. The new policy arrives 
as South Africa's two ugliest social problems are dominating the 
attention of the media and public officials.

	UAW Reaches 3 Deals With Automakers  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers wrapped up three new  
contracts with American automakers that promise some 360,000 
workers more money and security for the next four years. The deals 
with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., and DaimlerChrysler AG 
followed peaceful and quick negotiations that avoided costly 
strikes. The pattern agreement made by the UAW is a four-year 
contract with 3 percent raises each year, a signing bonus of $1,350 
and improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments. The 
automakers won the freedom they sought to reduce costs, including 
shedding workers.

Under a plan proposed by a faculty committee, A-plus would be 
replaced by a grade called ``A with distinction,'' for truly 
outstanding work. In addition, faculty members would have to file 
written explanations with each ``A with distinction'' they give. If 
approved, it would take effect for the 4,500 undergraduates

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell was back on the court today for  
the New York Knicks after his unexcused, underexplained absence 
from the first week of training camp. Coach Jeff Van Gundy 
addressed the team and told them the matter merits more discussion, 
and the rest of the players wondered whether Sprewell would stand 
before them and take the heat. But while Sprewell remained 
nonchalant and remorseless about his absence, it remained an issue 
that could potentially splinter the team into pro-Latrell and 
anti-Latrell factions. Acutely aware that the Knicks were a 
fractured unit last season, Van Gundy told his team it should air 
its grievances now.

<HEADLINE> Mich. State Students Given Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Antibiotics were made available to  
more than 1,500 students at Michigan State University after a 
sophomore came down with bacterial meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who live in the university's Wilson Hall began lining  
up Sunday night to receive drugs to fight the potentially fatal 
disease. Valentine Gutierrez, 18, a business freshman from Texas, 
was among those in line. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I wasn't going to, but then I thought, 'I do live on  
his floor, ''' she said. ``Better safe than sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Busuttil began feeling ill Friday night, passed out in his  
Wilson Hall dorm room on Saturday evening and was taken by 
ambulance to Sparrow Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Busuttil remained in critical condition this morning, university  
spokeswoman Deb Osbourn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Michigan State students have died of bacterial meningitis  
since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Busuttil is a member of the school's marching band but did not  
perform Saturday during the game against the University of 
Michigan, school officials said. They declined to say what 
instrument he played, but said it was not an instrument in which he 
would share a mouthpiece with others. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials declined to disclose further information about  
Busuttil, saying the only reason they were releasing Busuttil's 
name was so that students who had come into contact with him could 
take action. 
</P>
<P>
	The school already has notified Busuttil's suitemate and was  
contacting people who may have had contact with him. Antibiotics 
also were to be made available to the 200 band members today. 
</P>
<P>
	A vaccine will be made available to other students, faculty and  
staff throughout the week and through the rest of the month, 
university President Peter McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine is generally about 80 percent to 90 percent  
effective, but takes 10 days to two weeks before it begins to work. 
McPherson says the vaccine costs more than $50 per dose and will be 
paid by the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly this is a major expense, but on the other hand this is  
a health step we have to take,'' McPherson said. ``It will be a 
sizable bill, no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine protects against four of the five strains of  
bacterial meningitis. Doctors have not yet determined which strain 
Busuttil contracted. 
</P>
<P>
	A fact sheet e-mailed to students said bacterial meningitis has  
an average mortality rate of between 2 percent and 10 percent, with 
early recognition and treatment being the crucial variables. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacterial meningitis is an inflammation of the tissues that  
cover the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fever, headache, 
a stiff neck, vomiting, confusion and sleepiness. 
</P>
<P>
	It is usually spread through intimate contact, being touched or  
kissed, sharing eating utensils or any secretions or excretions 
from the body. The best protection is a balanced diet, adequate 
sleep, appropriate exercise and the avoidance of drinking, smoking 
and excessive stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Dean Sienko, medical director of the Ingham County Health  
Department, said that the incidence of bacterial meningitis is 
higher in dorms, military barracks or in other places where people 
live in large groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sporadic illness that we don't fully understand,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1996, a Michigan State student died after  
contracting bacterial meningitis strain B, the strain the vaccine 
is ineffective against. In February 1997, a student who contracted 
strain C died. In March 1997 another student contracted strain C 
and survived. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 19,000 students, faculty and staff at the school  
received the vaccine. There are about 40,000 students at the 
school.

<HEADLINE> Gore Counting on Labor Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore finally appeared to nail down an  
endorsement by the AFL-CIO as 15 building and trade unions voted 
today to follow 1.4 million Food and Commercial Workers in giving 
the vice president's presidential campaign an early boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The building and trade unions -- many of them long holdouts on  
the question of endorsing Gore now or later -- approved a motion to 
vote ``yes'' after a pitch at their morning huddle by AFL-CIO 
President John Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're keeping a tally sheet and people are moving. Looks like  
it's going to happen,'' said Rick Diegel, political director of the 
Electrical Workers union, which was included in the morning vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement, to be finalized in Wednesday votes by the  
federation's executive council and full convention, would hand Gore 
an instant organizational advantage over Democratic rival Bill 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll start now, meeting with state federations in Iowa, New  
Hampshire, New York, California, Ohio, Michigan -- a bunch of the 
early primary states -- to put in place the mechanisms for 
mobilizing union members. We know how to produce a vote,'' said 
AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Food and Commercial Workers board began to tip the  
long-uncertain scales when it unanimously voted Gore's way on 
Sunday, after a direct appeal by Sweeney, who for months has been 
committed to an October endorsement of Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UFCW endorsement makes it look very good. Now we just work  
on the rest of them to get them to endorse or abstain,'' said 
campaign chairman Tony Coelho, as he arrived late Sunday to lobby 
any holdouts at the AFL-CIO convention that opened today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney also sounded satisfied. ``More and more people are  
realizing that it's really not early,'' he told a reporter on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.3-million-member Service Employees International Union  
decided against endorsing Gore at this AFL-CIO convention, but 
would likely abstain rather than oppose ``the way the bulk of the 
AFL-CIO is going,'' said political director Matt Witt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is in no way a boost of or slap at anybody,'' Witt said.  
Rather, the SEIU is going to follow its own schedule of 
deliberating an endorsement and voting in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Auto Workers, Teamsters, Electrical Workers, and,  
perhaps, the Machinists, remained uncertain votes, labor and 
political operatives said. But these unions do not represent enough 
votes to block an endorsement, which, under convention rules 
proposed by Sweeney, must be approved by unions representing 
two-thirds of the AFL-CIO's 13 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive council -- made up of presidents of the AFL-CIO's  
largest unions -- and the full convention of some 700 delegates vote 
on Wednesday. Gore made plans for a victorious acceptance speech at 
the Los Angeles Convention Center after those votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's unanimous endorsement of Gore by the board of the  
United Food and Commercial Workers followed back-to-back calls to 
UFCW President Doug Dority from Gore and his rival for the 
Democratic presidential nomination, Bill Bradley. Labor officials 
said the urgent, personal calls were typical of the intense 
lobbying that has gone into this high-stakes endorsement and the 
army of grassroots campaign volunteers that it carries. 
</P>
<P>
	As late as Saturday night, Dority, a Gore supporter, was  
nonetheless leaning toward the view that ``an endorsement a couple 
of months'' may be the best way to have an impact after building 
greater consensus, said Greg Denier, Dority's senior assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Another call from Gore, and Dority was tipped to the vice  
president's position. Before Sweeney arrived to press Gore's case 
at a private Sunday-morning meeting of the UFCW board, Dority asked 
his board to join him in supporting an early nod to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Denier explained that the news media had driven the stakes so  
high that the UFCW didn't want a ``no'' vote to be misinterpreted 
``as weak support for Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes as planned it will be one of the earliest  
presidential endorsements by the AFL-CIO since it gave then-Vice 
President Walter Mondale the nod in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Italy Seeks Antiquities Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Italian officials are enlisting State  
Department help in their effort to curb the pillaging of coveted 
antiquities by American collectors, dealers and museums. 
</P>
<P>
	An Italian request to impose restrictions on imports of the  
valued vases, figurines and pottery pieces was being taken up today 
at a public session sponsored by the State Department's Cultural 
Property Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee ultimately will make recommendations to the  
president. An early decision is not expected. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Italian side is a 1970 international convention aimed at  
reducing the incentive for pillage of national treasures. But some 
collectors and their allies believe the Italian request is too 
sweeping. They will try to limit any restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	That objective would be achieved under legislation introduced by  
New York Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer, both 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sources told The Washington Post that the categories  
covered by Italy's still-secret petition embrace virtually every 
type of high-value artifact produced or found in ancient Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	This would include Attic pottery made in Greece and either  
looted by Romans or purchased by them and buried in their tombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome M. Eisenberg, owner of New York's Royal-Athena Galleries  
and the publisher of the antiquities magazine Minerva, told the 
Post, ``Ancient art always traveled. We're concerned with art theft 
but (the scope of the Italian request) is absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In support of their petition, Italian authorities are likely to  
focus on a 1997 case in which a New Yorker, Michael Steinhardt, 
lost his 4th century B.C. antique gold platter when a judge ruled 
it had been imported illegally into the United States from Italy. 
He paid $1.2 million for the platter in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is believed to have been one of the first to order  
the return of an archaeological item exported in violation of 
Italy's cultural property laws.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Downplays Bioterrorism Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials downplayed a report that suggests  
the CIA is investigating whether the recent West Nile-like 
encephalitis outbreak was deliberately triggered by Iraqi 
bioterrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing indicates that this was anything other than a natural  
outbreak,'' Jerome Hauer, the director of the city's emergency 
management office, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said  
there was no evidence to suggest the recent outbreak was anything 
other than ``Mother Nature at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts at the CIA who deal with biological weapons said an  
Iraqi defector had claimed in April that Saddam Hussein was 
developing a strain of West Nile-like encephalitis for use as a 
biological weapon, The New Yorker reports in its Oct. 18-25 double 
issue that hits newsstands today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recalled by the analysts was published April 6 in the  
Daily Mail of London. It was an except from the book ``In the 
Shadow of Saddam,'' written by Mikhael Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramadan claimed that he worked as one of Hussein's body doubles  
and that Hussein had told him of a plan to develop a strain of West 
Nile encephalitis that would kill 97 percent of people in an urban 
environment. The magazine said Ramadan was believed to be hiding 
somewhere in Canada or the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A strain of a West Nile-like virus has claimed the lives of six  
people in the New York area since it was discovered in early 
September. The mosquito-borne virus has infected 54 people in the 
New York metropolitan area -- 39 in New York City, nine in 
Westchester county and six in Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of the strain include fever and headache. In rare  
cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death. The 
elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems are most 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	CDC officials would not comment directly on the report but  
issued a statement saying, ``The investigation is ongoing and, to 
date, the CDC has no evidence that this is anything but Mother 
Nature at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls by The Associated Press to CIA offices in Virginia went  
unanswered this morning.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Riley May Start Kramer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Erik Kramer might have earned another start at  
quarterback for the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	And it could be a pretty big one, if that's the way coach Mike  
Riley decides to go. The Chargers play the Seattle Seahawks on 
Sunday, with the winner taking sole possession of first place in 
the AFC West. Both teams are 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer wasn't flashy in replacing the injured Jim Harbaugh, but  
the struggling offense did make some progress in Sunday's 20-10 win 
at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Erik warrants consideration as our starter,''  
said Riley, who added that it might be Wednesday before he 
announces his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just say again, I'm really glad to have both of those  
guys here,'' Riley said. ``Even though we're not the most 
productive offense around, those guys are good leaders and give us 
a definite chance to get better offensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was pleased to hear that Riley is giving him strong  
consideration. But when asked if he thought he deserved to start, 
Kramer said, ``That's a platform I'm not going to stand on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was 20-of-34 for 208 yards and one interception.  
</P>
<P>
	``As far as hanging in there, taking a lot of hits and still  
completing 20 balls and getting our team into shape on third downs, 
I thought he did an outstanding job,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego converted 7 of 15 third downs. A week earlier, it was  
just 1-of-12 in a 21-14 win over Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he can handle returning to his backup role, Kramer said  
he'd love to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``At 34, you just never know how many times you're going to be  
out there again. I'm excited to get on the field. I had to overcome 
an injury in the offseason. I look at things maybe differently than 
I used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While with the Chicago Bears, Kramer missed the last half of  
1998 after undergoing knee and shoulder surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh sustained two cracked ribs and a bruised throwing elbow  
in a 21-14 win over Kansas City on Oct. 3. He practiced little last 
week, but on Monday said he felt much better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to play, I'd like to play, Erik feels the same way. I'm  
with the program whatever they decide,'' Harbaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Natrone Means was held out of Sunday's game to rest  
his sore ankles, and Riley said there's a good chance he'll get a 
full week of practice for the first time since before the Sept. 19 
opener at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's good enough to practice on Wednesday, that means that  
this deal was real good for him taking that game off,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Means, who agreed with the move, said he felt fine.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're 3-1 and sitting, definitely, in a position nobody  
thought we'd be in,'' he said. ``We have a big game this Sunday and 
I had a week off to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's hard-hitting defense came up big again on Sunday.  
Linebacker Junior Seau had 12 tackles, two of them sacks, and 
safety Rodney Harrison forced a fumble that cornerback Darryll 
Lewis returned 42 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it's still early, Harrison figures a win over the  
Seahawks can win over any doubters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a playoff game,'' Harrison said. ``It's time for us  
to come in here and make a statement and get the respect of the 
league. The way to get respect is to go out there and get a 
victory.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Terminate Royal's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts on Monday terminated  
the contract of veteran linebacker Andre Royal. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced Royal, who had been suspended for Sunday's  
game with the Miami Dolphins, was released ``for the good of the 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Mora and club president Bill Polian declined to state  
Royal's latest violation. Royal, who started the first three games 
this season, has been involved in a series of disciplinary problems 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only comment I'm going to make on that is it was a  
violation of team policy and it was something we felt we needed to 
do,'' Mora said after Sunday's game. ``I'm not going to get into 
details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 220-pound Royal also was suspended by the Colts  
for last year's Dec. 6 game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	He was acquired by Indianapolis in a trade with New Orleans  
before the 1998 season. While Royal was with New Orleans, he was 
involved in a hazing incident in which a Saints' rookie claimed he 
was hit, kicked and pounded with a bag of coins during training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal also was arrested in New Orleans for refusing to pay for  
private dances at a French Quarter strip club. He later settled 
with the club, but the stripper sued Royal claiming he hit her. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Planet Hollywood To Close Nine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Planet Hollywood announced Monday the  
immediate closing of nine of its 32 U.S. locations as the 
struggling restaurant chain heads to a bankruptcy court filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando-based company plans to file petitions for Chapter 11  
protection from creditors Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Delaware, and will soon file its reorganization plan, a company 
statement released Monday evening said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the first step in our plan to position Planet  
Hollywood for a return to long-term profitability and healthy 
growth,'' said Robert Earl, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring plan calls for upgrading a number of  
facilities and menus, Earl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurants closed Monday were in Chicago, Costa Mesa,  
Calif.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Gurnee, Ill.; Houston; Indianapolis; 
Maui, Hawaii; Miami and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	There may still be a couple of additional closings or franchise  
conversions, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reorganization, Planet Hollywood International  
Inc.'s two largest shareholders and a trust for Earl's children 
have agreed to provide a $30 million cash infusion to help keep the 
international chain of glitzy, movie-themed restaurants going. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned bankruptcy filing is the latest setback for the  
operator of nearly 80 Planet Hollywood restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Former president William Baumhauer resigned in June, just three  
months after the company's co-founder resigned his board position. 
Keith Barish, who started the venture with Earl and actors 
Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce 
Willis, left the company in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been trying to cut operating costs by reducing  
corporate overhead, putting in cost-control systems, streamlining 
store-level operations and disposing of nonessential corporate 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those moves, analysts have said aggressive expansion and  
increased competition have hurt the company.

<HEADLINE> FDA Suspends Gene Therapy Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has ordered Schering-Plough  
Corp. to temporarily halt two gene therapy studies because the 
research is designed similarly to a Pennsylvania experiment in 
which a teen-ager died last month. 
</P>
<P>
	No one yet knows what killed Jesse Gelsinger, 18, of Tucson,  
Ariz. Just four days before his death, University of Pennsylvania 
scientists had placed healthy genes in his liver to combat a rare 
metabolic disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn's study has been halted while scientists there, along with  
federal regulators, try to determine what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration decision late Friday halts two  
separate experiments by Schering-Plough to try gene therapy as a 
treatment for liver cancer and for colorectal cancer that spreads 
to the liver. 
</P>
<P>
	Those studies have one similarity to the Penn experiment that  
worried regulators: They use relatively high doses of a type of 
cold virus called adenovirus to slip new genes directly into the 
liver. 
</P>
<P>
	No deaths or unexpected side effects have been seen in the  
Schering trials, but the studies' suspension is a precaution to let 
the FDA scrutinize patient data for any early signs of problems, 
FDA gene therapy chief Dr. Philip Noguchi said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA wants to see ``if there's any pattern we might be able  
to understand, to give us some insight into the Penn study,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA suspension means Schering cannot enroll any new  
patients, but patients already given their first gene dose can 
receive the rest of their scheduled treatment, said company 
spokesman Robert Consalvo. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA decision does not affect dozens of other gene therapy  
experiments that use lower doses of adenoviruses or that inject 
them into some organ other than the liver.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Charged in Chicago Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- DNA evidence from a string of unsolved killings  
and rapes in several South Side neighborhoods has led police to one 
possible suspect: a man in a Chicago jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Macon, 35, has been charged with three counts of  
first-degree murder. The Chicago man has been in jail since August 
awaiting trial on a separate rape charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said DNA evidence linked him to three of 13 killings of  
women in and around the poverty-stricken Englewood neighborhood 
since 1993. Police Cmdr. Frank Trigg said Sunday that Macon 
confessed on videotape to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Macon's arrest was the breakthrough they had  
been hoping for, but their investigation into the other murders 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to continue because the perpetrators are still  
out there,'' Trigg said. ``But we're certainly going to pause and 
acknowledge the significance of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macon's three alleged victims were all killed this year in the  
Englewood and Washington Park neighborhoods. Angelnetta Peeples, 
43, was found in an abandoned building Feb. 20. She had been 
strangled and hit on the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Soloman, 36, who was found April 14 in a stairwell, also  
had been strangled and hit on the head. Rosezina Williams, 50, was 
strangled and her body found in a trash container on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Macon could face the death penalty if convicted  
on the murder charges. They said they also might charge him with 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Macon is being held in lieu of $1.25 million bond on the current  
rape charge. He could be arraigned on the murder charges as early 
as today, Trigg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Macon's arrest, police have had little success in their  
investigation into the string of slayings. Few people in the 
neighborhoods knew the women or were willing to talk to police. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorities thought their luck might be changing last month  
when they charged three men with the March 1998 slaying of 
LaCreesha Avery, 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, who was beaten, raped and strangled, was found wrapped in  
one of the suspects' sheets in the same general area where the 
other bodies were found, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities thought the men might be tied to other unsolved  
murders, but later found that DNA samples from the men showed no 
connection.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Orders 12 Airbuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- British Airways plans to buy 12 new Airbus  
Industrie A318 jetliners to replace some of its older Boeing planes 
on short-haul routes, a blow to Boeing Co., which had hoped to win 
a high-profile customer for its new 717 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways, which also took options to buy another 12  
A318s, chose the European consortium's 100-passenger jet ``for its 
superior economics, flexibility and commonality with the rest of 
our short-haul fleet,'' the carrier said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline will pay $412 million for the first 12 airliners.  
</P>
<P>
	Boeing had sought the order as a major-airline endorsement of  
its 106-seat 717, which went into service last month with its first 
delivery to AirTran Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing inherited the 717 -- then called the MD-90 -- from  
McDonnell Douglas when the companies merged two years ago. There 
has been speculation that Boeing will discontinue the plane, as it 
has other McDonnell Douglas jetliner models, if sales do not pick 
up. The 717 is built in Long Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Sept. 30, Boeing has 225 orders and options placed for the  
717, spokesman Sean Griffin said. In addition, Hawaiian Air has 
announced its intention to purchase 13 717s and take options on 
seven more. Airbus has orders and commitments for 157 of its A318s. 
The first A318 won't come off the production line until 2002, and 
British Airway will get its first aircraft in January 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts thought Boeing might have had an edge because the  
717 is flying now while the A318 is three years away. The first 
A318 won't come off the production line until 2002, and British 
Airway will get its first aircraft in January 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Boeing last week agreed to buy 34 used Boeing 757s from  
British Airways and reconfigure them into freighters for lease to 
DHL Worldwide Express, which many thought was a prelude to an order 
for 717s. In some instances, the new A318s will replace 757s on 
British Airways routes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big-brand launch customer was going to be British  
Airways,'' said Brian O'Keefe, an analyst with Commerzbank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 717 looks like it is going to be stillborn in the market,  
without good customers,'' he added. The British Airways loss ``is 
very bad for Boeing -- it's a big shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Sean Griffin said Monday that while Boeing  
hates to lose a sales competition, ``we will not go forward with a 
deal that does not return value to our shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffin emphasized Boeing is ``absolutely committed to the (717)  
program and has no plans to kill it.''

up technology stocks. It rose 29.48 to 2,916.05, surpassing its 
all-time closing high of 2,887.06, set Sept. 10. The Dow Jones 
industrial average, meanwhile, closed down 1.58 at 10,648.18, 
having given up an earlier gain of as much as 69 points. Other 
broader measures were little changed in quiet trading. Traders said

	Fed Regulators Eye Bank Mergers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regulators are weighing changes to deal with  
the huge banks being formed by mergers that could hurt the economy 
if they fail, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told bankers 
today. Greenspan said ``significant changes are in the pipeline'' 
in banking supervision by U.S. regulators and their foreign 
counterparts. The changes point to a ``multitrack approach'' to 
oversight of banks, since they vary significantly in size, business 
strategy and penchant for risk, the central bank chief said. ``Even 
among the largest banks, no two institutions have exactly the same 
risk profiles, risk controls or organizational and management 
structure,'' Greenspan told the American Bankers Association's 
annual convention in Phoenix. Copies of his speech were released in 
Washington.

	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp., the No. 1  
seller of personal computers directly to customers, says it will 
stick to its strengths despite Wall Street pressure to vigorously 
branch into areas such as computer services. While Dell's financial 
results are among the strongest in the computer industry, its stock 
price has fallen 16 percent since early this year in part because 
of investor concerns that tumbling PC prices will slow galloping 
revenues and profits. But Dell chief executive Michael Dell said 
today that computer services, or helping corporate customers set up 
and maintain their computer networks, will remain an adjunct 
activity. Dell shares were at 45 9/16, up 1/16.

according to a report in Newsweek magazine. Citing unidentified 
industry sources, Newsweek said the gunmaker also will lay off as 
many as 300 of its 700 union workers in Connecticut. While the 
gun-maker informed distributors last week that it would discontinue 
at least three of its product lines, Colt's executives strongly 
disputed the implication that the company was shedding a major

<HEADLINE> Women Want Pain Relief During Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- In about two weeks, Wendy McGahey is due to have  
her third child. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the first time, she'll go to the hospital knowing what  
to expect -- a relatively pain-free delivery, thanks to anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Mrs. McGahey, more women are opting for pain relief during  
labor and delivery. Doctors say they have refined painkilling 
techniques, and women are feeling less pressure from society to 
tough out the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine  
found that in large hospitals, the use of regional anesthesia -- 
epidurals and other spinal techniques -- tripled from 22 percent in 
1981 to 66 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McGahey said that when she went into labor five years ago  
with her first son, she decided against anesthesia -- until it was 
too late to change her mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``My biggest fear was getting a needle in my back,'' she said.  
But before long, ``they could have put a pitchfork in my back. It 
was intense misery and I couldn't see an end in sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, the Hurst, Texas woman entered the hospital to  
give birth again, and wary from her first delivery, asked to try an 
epidural. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was instant euphoria,'' she said. ``There was no pain. And  
when the baby came I felt rested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McGahey, 28, said the experience was so enjoyable that she  
has no fears about giving birth to her next child -- due on 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time I'm not afraid,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The survey results, gathered from 750 hospitals around the  
nation, were to be presented in Dallas today during the annual 
meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found that in midsize hospitals, those with between  
500 and 1,499 births per year, 55 percent of women opted for 
regional anesthesia in 1997, compared to 13 percent in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	A huge increase was also reported at hospitals with less than  
500 births per year. The percent of women receiving regional 
anesthesia went from 9 percent in 1981 to 42 percent in 1997, the 
survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joy L. Hawkins, who led the research, said the increase at  
small hospitals partly can be attributed to an increased number of 
anesthesiologists on staff in obstetrical units. In the past, some 
obstetricians provided anesthesia care. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Hawkins said many patients in the survey also opted for  
narcotics to ease the pain during labor and delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 11 percent of obstetrical patients at large and mid-size  
hospitals opted for no analgesia of any kind in 1997. In small 
hospitals, 17 percent of women had no pain relief. 
</P>
<P>
	But some doctors and mothers-to-be believe epidurals and other  
pain-relievers greatly raise the chances of a Caesarean section by 
slowing labor and inhibiting the mother's ability to push. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Miller, a birthing assistant, or a doula, says her clients  
``have a strong belief in the natural process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They believe it's safer for their babies and safer for them,''  
said the Dallas resident, who is certified. 
</P>
<P>
	Childbearing techniques like Lamaze and the Bradley Method first  
gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, advocating relaxation 
techniques and abdominal breathing to ease pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Hawkins said medical advances have made anesthesia safer.  
The development of ultra-fine needles reduces the incidence of 
headaches to less than one percent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have better needles and better drugs. We can provide pain  
relief where you can still walk around.''

<HEADLINE> Marino's Main Critic Mostly Mum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Dan Marino's most vocal critic had little to  
say on the subject Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Johnson stepped to the microphones for his weekly news  
conference and offered a five-minute opening statement on the Miami 
Dolphins' 34-31 victory Sunday over the Indianapolis Colts. But 
those comments included no reference to Marino's 393-yard passing 
performance or his heroics that produced 25 points in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Johnson was asked about reports that he met last week  
with Marino and threatened to bench him, the coach cut off the 
question as he made a brisk exit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so sick of some of these ...'' he said, not finishing the  
sentence. ``Enough, OK? Enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it's probably safe to conclude that Sunday's thrilling win  
failed to repair the rift that developed last week when Johnson 
criticized Marino following a 23-18 loss to Buffalo. The strain 
will likely remain as the Dolphins (3-1) prepare for Sunday's game 
at New England (4-1) in another AFC East showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no criticism Monday of the quarterback by the coach,  
but there was scant praise. In his opening comments, Johnson said 
running back Cecil Collins, center Tim Ruddy, cornerback Sam 
Madison and linebacker Zach Thomas played well. The rest of the 
defense, the special teams and tackle Brent Smith did not. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about Marino, Johnson said: ``Dan played fantastic in  
the fourth quarter. Obviously when you score 25 points, it's about 
as good as you can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Marino responded to last week's controversy with one of  
the greatest performances in his 17-year career. Johnson has denied 
that his criticism was an attempt to motivate Marino, but that was 
the result. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final period alone, Marino was 12-of-17 for 176 yards and  
two touchdowns, including the game-winner with 27 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan doesn't quit,'' Collins said. ``He doesn't have too many  
years left to play, so he doesn't take losses too well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was reminiscent of many during Marino's career. The  
running game stalled and the defense struggled, but the quarterback 
went 25-of-38. The 393-yard performance was his most productive in 
four seasons under Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	After being accused last week of making poor decisions and  
becoming flustered by pass rushers, Marino didn't commit a 
turnover. He was knocked down at least 10 times but wasn't sacked. 
As a formidable footnote, he closed to within 7 yards of 60,000, an 
NFL record certain to stand for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino didn't speak with reporters Monday. When asked Sunday  
about his gallant performance in the face of criticism, he said: 
``I couldn't care less. You guys can write what you want. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``We played our guts out. A lot of people came up big in tough  
situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino most of all. For now, at least, he has silenced his  
harshest critic.

<HEADLINE> Gannett Earnings Up; Scripps Flat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Stronger newspaper revenues boosted Gannett Co.'s third-quarter  
earnings by nearly 20 percent, beating analysts' estimates. E.W. 
Scripps Co. recorded flat third-quarter earnings Monday because of 
several expenses related to its television operations. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Gannett Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Gannett recorded a 19 percent gain in profits for the third  
quarter as revenues rose from its newspapers, which include USA 
Today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett earned $207.5 million, or 74 cents per share, in the  
quarter ended Sept. 26, up from 62 cents per share, or $176.5 
million, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had projected earnings of  
71 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 11 percent to $1.36 billion, from $1.23  
billion in the same quarter in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales of classified and national advertising, along with  
a decline in the cost of newsprint, powered the company's newspaper 
earnings. Operating income from newspapers grew 23 percent in the 
third quarter to $304.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At USA Today, the company's flagship newspaper, paid advertising  
pages jumped 16 percent to 1,443 compared to 1,242 in the third 
quarter of 1998, while ad revenues grew 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable revenues increased 11 percent in the third quarter to  
$64.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett, which is based in Arlington, Va., publishes 74 daily  
newspapers and operates 21 television stations and cable TV systems 
in three states. In addition, the company owns a variety of 
non-daily publications, including the USA Weekend newspaper insert. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Gannett's net earnings  
fell 11 percent to $663 million, or $2.35 per share, from $742 
million, or $2.59 per share, in the same period a year ago. 
Revenues for the period rose 6 percent to $3.95 billion from $3.73 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting one-time gains this year and last from such things  
as the disposal of properties, operating earnings for the first 
nine months rose nearly 13 percent to $630.6 million, or $2.26 a 
share, from $558.6 million, or $1.96 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Gannett fell 18 3/4 cents to $22.81 1/4 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                          *E.W. Scripps Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Scripps, a newspaper and television company based in Cincinnati,  
had flat earnings in the third quarter because of several one-time 
expenses related to its TV business. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps earned $24.9 million in the three months ended Sept. 30,  
down slightly from $26.1 million in the same period a year ago. 
Per-share earnings were unchanged at 32 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 8 percent to $369.9 million from $343.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Scripps earmarked $2.5 million to compensate advertisers for  
possibly not having delivered the expected audiences for past 
broadcasts of the company's Home &AMP; Garden Television cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	Expenses also included $800,000 for relocating the Food  
Network's operations within New York City, $1.2 million in 
severance costs for television station employees, and $1 million 
for costs of the Scripps Ventures fund, including compensating its 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps' revenues from newspaper advertising remained strong,  
but television stations were hurt by weak advertising revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps operates 19 daily newspapers; nine network-affiliated  
television stations; three cable television networks, Home &AMP; Garden 
Television, Food Network and Do it Yourself, and a TV programmer, 
Scripps Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other businesses include United Media, which syndicates and  
licenses news features and comics; Scripps Howard News Service and 
independent Yellow Pages directories. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, earnings totaled $101.1  
million, or $1.28 per share, compared with last year's $87.6 
million and $1.08. Revenues were $1.13 billion, up from $1.06 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Scripps fell $1.50 to $49.56 1/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Monarch Butterfly Population Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The numbers of monarch butterflies,  
those delicate orange-and-black-winged creatures one devotee 
compares to ``flying jewelry,'' have taken flight across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a shrinking habitat and natural and man-made threats, it  
has been a good year for monarchs, even as the butterflies prepare 
for their long journey to Mexico and California, where they'll wait 
out the harsh winters of their northern range. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a good year for butterflies in general, and we're  
looking forward to a prolonged fall so we can enjoy the show,'' 
said Donald Lewis, a professor of entomology at Iowa State 
University. ``There's been good moisture to keep the plants 
growing. The caterpillars need various and specific species of food 
plants during the summer. So when we have good growing conditions 
over a wide area, the food plants do well and the caterpillars do 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis also noted that the summer's rains -- while abundant -- were  
for the most part not accompanied by vicious thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Butterflies are not fragile critters, but they do need some  
gentleness in their environment, which often means absence of 
spectacular storms, especially at the time when the butterflies are 
reproducing and the tiny caterpillars are establishing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The butterflies, whose wingspan can range up to nearly 5 inches,  
feed on milkweed nectar. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyewitness accounts corroborate Lewis' statement that 1999 has  
treated butterflies well. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, one couple near Lake Rathbun reported seeing roughly  
3,000 monarchs on Sept. 17. A few days later, as many as 25,000 
were spotted off the Massachusetts coast. It was by far the largest 
sighting in the nation in September, according to the North 
American Butterfly Association. 
</P>
<P>
	During the summer, the butterflies range from southern Canada  
south through all of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The bumper crop of butterflies seems to defy the findings of a  
study earlier this year by Cornell University, which claimed pollen 
from a popular genetically engineered corn hybrid kills monarch 
caterpillars in laboratory tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Bt-corn, which was supposed to kill only pests such as the  
European corn borer while having no effect on insects such as 
honeybees and ladybugs, produces pollen containing crystalline 
endotoxin. When the corn pollen is dispersed by the wind, it lands 
on other plants, including milkweed, the exclusive food of monarch 
larvae, commonly found around cornfields. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the market leader in Bt-corn,  
said it did not test the product on monarch caterpillars because 
they do not naturally feed on corn pollen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of Bt having an impact on monarchs when 30  
percent of our market is using it, I think it suggests very little 
risk,'' Pioneer spokesman Doyle Karr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Glassberg, president of the North American Butterfly  
Association, said caution must be exercised when introducing new 
variables into the ecosystem. But he also said he thought the 
danger was overstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are a lot more dire threats than that to  
monarchs,'' he said. ``In the Midwest, mowing roadsides and using 
herbicides is probably much more devastating, actually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 25 million acres across North America will be  
planted with Bt-corn this year, Pioneer said. This represents about 
30 percent of the 1999 corn acreage. 
</P>
<P>
	The monarchs may also find another problem when they reach their  
winter home in the western oyamel-fir forests of Mexico, 
particularly the central western Mexican state of Michoacan, the 
habitat where tens of millions of butterflies reside. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists have been warning that excessive logging and  
forest fires damaged the sanctuary. Also blamed are climatic 
changes caused by El Nino and a drought that left the fir trees 
vulnerable to bark-destroying beetles last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results have been alarming, as Mexican government figures  
show that masses of butterflies covered 42 acres two years ago, but 
shrank to 32 acres last year and only 13.5 acres in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of the monarchs on the North American  
continent go down to these Mexican sites, so if anything were to 
happen to these, the mass migrations and so forth would clearly be 
in jeopardy,'' Glassberg said. ``It's speculative whether they 
would be able to survive someplace else, whether they would all die 
off. It would obviously have a major effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the monarchs would go extinct in this area, but  
there would clearly be a tremendous diminution in numbers,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Welcomes Labor Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As polls show Bill Bradley closing in on Al  
Gore, the vice president's camp welcomed a certain endorsement by 
the AFL-CIO as more than just a symbolic nod. ``It means 
volunteers, organizers, committed supporters'' and a hefty 
on-the-ground advantage, said campaign chairman Tony Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
	Nudged along by President Clinton, the AFL-CIO's political  
committee was preparing for a late afternoon vote that would send 
Gore's endorsement to the labor federation's executive council and, 
finally, to ratification by the more than 700 union delegates 
convened here. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO is committed to spending at least $40 million to get  
union members to vote Democratic next year. In crucial 
early-primary states like New Hampshire and New York, where Bradley 
has edged ahead of or tied Gore in the polls, that mass union 
mobilization could tip the scales to the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll released Monday showed Gore leading  
Bradley, 51 percent to 39 percent, among likely Democratic primary 
voters nationwide. A similar poll a few weeks ago put Gore further 
ahead, with 63 percent support to Bradley's 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO counts nearly 580,000 union members among New York's  
registered Democrats -- about a third of all New Yorkers who voted 
in 1998. And in Iowa, whose caucuses in January will begin the 
nomination chase, AFL-CIO organizers were credited with the 69 
percent turnout of registered union voters that lifted Democrat Tom 
Vilsack from fourth place to winner of last year's gubernatorial 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the kind of program we're talking about, we're able to  
not just do voter and issue education, but drive up a much bigger 
turnout,'' said AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a machine, though we don't like to use that word,'' said  
Kathy Bowler, director of Gore's campaign in California. 
</P>
<P>
	National campaign manager Donna Brazile showed off the  
collection of business cards pushed on her Monday by union leaders 
eager to help Gore. ``I'm delighted by all the strong support we're 
going to receive,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An endorsement, said Coelho, will bring Gore immediate  
``volunteers, organizers and not just supporters, but committed 
supporters -- people who have a stake and want to go out and help 
you win because they know what it means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley adviser Anita Dunn said Gore's institutional advantage  
is nothing new and her candidate will continue to campaign among 
workers for grassroots labor support. 
</P>
<P>
	On the campaign trail, Gore mingled with hardhats at a Phoenix  
construction site to try to cast the apparently imminent 
endorsement as a rank-and-file nod. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very grateful for all the working men and women who have  
helped me in this campaign,'' Gore told workers who greeted him 
with applause and handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement stakes grew so high in the days leading up to  
this biennial convention that Clinton reached out to several labor 
leaders. He telephoned International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers chief J.J. Barry, and reached out to United Food and 
Commercial Workers President Doug Dority through a mutual friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's message, Dority said, was that the stakes had been  
``so ginned up that we didn't want (a delay in the endorsement) to 
appear that we were doing something that would hurt'' Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony to some feeling here that Gore had taken labor for  
granted and not paid attention to where union presidents stood, 
IBEW political director Rick Diegel said Clinton called Barry over 
the weekend to say thanks, apparently unaware that Barry remained 
undecided until Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	A disgruntled undercurrent among some delegates and union  
officials feeling bullied by the accelerated endorsement was 
palpable on the convention floor Monday. More than one union 
officer privately griped that the rush to endorse was being 
dictated from the top down by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Hunt, an airline grounds crewman with the Transportation  
Workers, said the point should be ``to listen to all the issues 
first.'' And, he added, ``This could be a mistake in the long 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Electrical worker Joe Lubitz, from St. Paul, Minn., said, ``I  
want to put my efforts behind someone who can win and I don't know 
enough about Bradley yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO officials countered that GOP front-runner George W.  
Bush's runaway popularity in polls and ever-mounting bankroll lent 
urgency to the endorsement, which frees the labor group to begin 
attacking the Texas governor's record.

<HEADLINE> Plenty of Atlanta Tickets Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Empty seats are becoming an October tradition at  
Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves once again are having a tough time selling  
tickets to the National League championship series, which opens 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a nasty rivalry brewing against the New York Mets,  
more than 8,000 tickets were available Monday afternoon for Game 1 
at the 50,062-seat ballpark. Nearly 10,000 tickets remained for 
Game 2 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the fans are taking for granted that we're going to make it  
to the World Series, the Mets may have something to say about 
that,'' Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a new complaint. Former Braves outfielder David Justice  
ripped 
</P>
<P>
	fans in 1995 for not making enough noise during the World Series  
against Cleveland. But it seems to be getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves drew only 39,119 fans to the first game of the  
division series against Houston -- nearly 11,000 short of capacity 
and the smallest crowd ever in Atlanta's 44-game postseason 
history. The second game wasn't much better, with only 41,913 in 
the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	David Teske, a fan from Jonesboro, said the 4 p.m. EDT game  
times against Houston hurt attendance. It's hard for working fans 
to attend afternoon games on the weekdays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fans see the empty seats as a symptom of the Braves'  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fans are getting a little complacent,'' said Vicki  
Reidy of Newnan, who bought tickets for Game 1 on her lunch break 
Monday. ``They're used to winning, and they like to wait until the 
end before they show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lukewarm support in the playoffs follows what may have been  
one of the Braves' most exciting seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	With Andres Galarraga recovering from cancer and Javy Lopez  
still out with a knee injury, the Braves managed to fight off the 
hard-charging Mets in the final week of the season. They won more 
than 100 games for the third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I was a little spoiled playing in St. Louis the last  
few years,'' Braves right fielder Brian Jordan said. ``Those are 
true baseball fans. Win, lose or draw, they were always there. To 
come here and be in the postseason and not have sellouts is 
surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braves officials still thought tickets for Game 1 will sell out  
by Tuesday. Paul Adams, director of tickets sales, said 2,500 
tickets sold Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Atlanta fans are going to rise to the occasion,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Fortt, a New York Yankees fan who lives in Atlanta, said  
he wasn't going to any playoff games because of the expensive 
tickets. Reserved seats are $45, and box seats are $60. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leetha Hayes of Chamblee said the Braves don't have the same  
magic they had in 1991, when they went from worst to first in a 
single season and extended the World Series to seven games beforing 
losing to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a fan at one time when they had Deion (Sanders) and Fred  
McGriff,'' she said. ``After they traded them away, it hasn't been 
the same.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Of course a billion dollars isn't what it used  
to be, but when you owe 6,170 of those billions, as American 
householders do, it catches your eye. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more debt than is owed by Uncle Sam, whose spending and  
borrowing habits are often lambasted by critics. It's more money 
than is borrowed by the entire non-financial business community. 
</P>
<P>
	A shocking figure, to be sure, but then you must consider  
another figure: There are more than 100 million households in the 
United States which, divided into the total, means something around 
$61,700 per household. 
</P>
<P>
	These are round figures, as are most sums with zeros numerous as  
pearls in a necklace. So many zeros in this case, that millions of 
people simply cannot identify with a sum so large. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, those zeros can mean everything.  
</P>
<P>
	Pay attention to them, say economists, including most  
prominently those at the Federal Reserve, because credit is costly 
and eventually comes due. It's better to save, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	You might not guess that from the behavior of some families,  
mainly those that continue to spend beyond their incomes. Millions 
of families do it, even though personal income continues to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income -- wages, interest and government benefits -- rose  
0.5 percent in August, but spending rose 0.9 percent, driving the 
savings rate back down to minus 1.5 percent, same as in May. 
</P>
<P>
	These are extraordinarily good times for many families, and a  
bit of borrowing makes them feel even better. Confidence is high, 
for both present and future, and the future seems a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, however, America's households must consider paying  
down their debts, and that's why some economists worry even if the 
borrowers don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cautionary lesson is that high debt levels cannot readily  
be reversed during a downturn,'' says analyst Jane D'Arista of the 
Financial Markets Center, which analyses the flow of finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, she writes in the private think tank's ``FOMC Alert''  
report, high debts ``tend to prolong slumps as borrowers struggle 
to meet debt payments with stagnant or declining incomes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewing the broad picture, signs exist that households might  
agree, since the debt expansion rate dipped a bit in the second 
quarter of the year, mainly due to a decline in consumer credit. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's more to the picture than consumer credit, including  
credit cards and car loans. Mortgages play a big part, and mortgage 
debt has been persistently strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of this mortgage debt is a result of home purchases, but  
not all. Some also is a consequence of owners borrowing funds from 
the rising value of their homes. Borrowing to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with a reduction in the amount of corporate stocks held  
directly by households rather than through intermediaries, the cash 
obtained via home mortgagees has helped fund consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	By no means has all this spending been frivolous, as sometimes  
it's made out to be. Households have obtained fine homes, cars and 
educations, and the consumption has kept businesses humming and 
innovating and hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's hard to ignore what D'Arista suggests -- that's it's  
easier to get your financial house in order during good times than 
bad. Zeroes can indicate nothing, or everything.

<HEADLINE> CIA: No Encephalitis Terrorism Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The CIA looked into rumors that the recent  
encephalitis outbreak in the New York area was the work of 
terrorists and concluded it wasn't, an agency official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press there's no evidence Iraq or any other foreign 
government was involved. The CIA ``looked into rumors which 
appeared in British media and elsewhere,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials also played down any suggestions of bioterrorism.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing indicates that this was anything other than a natural  
outbreak,'' Jerome Hauer, director of the city's emergency 
management office, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said  
there was no evidence to suggest the recent outbreak was anything 
other than ``Mother Nature at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts at the CIA who deal with biological weapons said an  
Iraqi defector had claimed in April that Saddam Hussein was 
developing a strain of West Nile-like encephalitis for use as a 
biological weapon, The New Yorker reported in its issue that hit 
newsstands today. 
</P>
<P>
	The defector's report was published April 6 in the Daily Mail of  
London. It was an except from the book ``In the Shadow of Saddam,'' 
written by Mikhael Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramadan claimed that he worked as one of Saddam's body doubles  
and that the Iraqi president had told him of a plan to develop a 
strain of West Nile encephalitis that would kill 97 percent of 
people in an urban environment. The magazine said Ramadan was 
believed to be hiding somewhere in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	A strain of a West Nile-like virus has claimed the lives of six  
people in the New York area since it was discovered in early 
September. The mosquito-borne virus has infected at least 54 people 
in the metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of the strain include fever and headache. In rare  
cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death. The 
elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems are most 
vulnerable.
