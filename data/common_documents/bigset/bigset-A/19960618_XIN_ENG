<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today signed the
Protocol of the Financial Services Agreement of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in hope that it would help encourage foreign
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
A report by the official Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) said that
Kuwait's permanent representative to the United Nations and other
international organizations in Geneva Dharar Razzooqi today
signed the pact.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to KUNA, Razzooqi said "we hope this agreement
will encourage foreign investment in the Kuwaiti market in
financial services and lead to a substantial exchange of
technical expertise in this area."
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait had presented to the WTO, via the Central Bank,
its trade laws related to financial services.
</P>
<P>
The pact, which was reportedly concluded last year at WTO and
aimed at bringing new opportunities and greater security and
predictability for investors in banking, insurance and other
activities in the financial services sector, will enter into force
30 days after acceptance by all members concerned, KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait had opened its securities exchange to foreigners before
the 1990 Iraqi invasion, it now has given a limited access to
foreign investors and is planning to widen such participation in
future although it was reluctant to give them access during the
early years after liberation in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Issues New Bank Note With Large Denomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's central bank today issued
a new bank note with the denomination of 5,000 leva (about 73
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local press said the central bank decided to issue the new bank
note because bank notes with lower denominations have caused much
inconvenience in circulation due to a sharp depreciation of the
leva against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Until today, the highest denomination of the Bulgarian bank
notes was 2,000 leva.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Bulgaria had constantly issued bank
notes with higher denominations, starting from 50 leva to 2,000
leva, to cope with the leva's depreciation. Before 1990, the
highest denomination of the country's bank notes was 20 leva (0.29
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials said that by the end of this year, the
bank will withdraw bank notes with denominations of less than 10
leva from circulation.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts said the 5,000-leva notes will be able to
meet people's demand caused by the leva's depreciation in the next
two years.

stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Lu said China will try its utmost to maintain Hong Kong's
position as an international financial, economic and trade, and
shipping center, which will also need support from international
investors.

and expressed the hope that the Chinese government will continue
to protect the interests of Thai investors in Hong Kong after
1997.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S., France Sign Accord to Share Nuclear Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and France have signed
a secret accord which allows them to help each other maintain
their respective nuclear arsenals after an expected international
treaty bans all test explosions, the Washington Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper, quoting U.S. diplomatic sources, said that the most
important provision of the agreement is that the United States
will share with France for the first time a vast amount of
computer data drawn from simulated explosions of atomic bombs at
the heart of all modern U.S. warheads.
</P>
<P>
Weapons information of this quality has previously been shared
with only one U.S. ally -- Britain.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Washington's decision to share the data
with France reflected its strong belief that it is in the
U.S. interest to ensure the continued reliability of the French
strategic nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed on June 4 by four senior U.S. and French
officials, including Assistant to U.S. Secretary of Defense Harold
Smith and Assistant Secretary of Energy Victor Reis in a private
office near Washington, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The secret deal may just mark the beginning of a new era of
extraordinary cooperation among the existing Western nuclear
powers, the report said.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Four Greek Air Force military
aircraft flew over Cyprus today as part of a joint Greco-Cypriot
defense policy, Cyprus news agency reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a spokesman from the Cyprus' Defense Ministry
as saying that the four aircraft were in "the broader region and
in early afternoon they flew from Paphos, western part of the
island, to Limassol and Larnaca ports in the south, and then took
a northwestern turn to Nicosia, in the center of the island,
before leaving."
</P>
<P>
"The flight path was part of training exercises in the
framework of our joint defense dogma," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, he refrained from identifying the type of aircraft or
their exact flight path and final destination.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece agreed on a joint defense policy in
November, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Greek military aircraft attended a military exercise in Cyprus
with live ammunition for the first time last year.
</P>
<P>
Greece has warned Turkey that further advance of the Turkish
troops, which invaded and took control of 37 percent of the
island in 1974, toward the southern government-controlled part of
the Cyprus Republic would mean war between the two NATO allies.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Disarmament Expanded to Include 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament (CD)
overcame a long-standing dispute today by deciding to admit 23 new
members in a bid to "reflect the political reality in the
post-Cold War era," as diplomats here put it.
</P>
<P>
The 23 new members are Austria, Bangladesh, Belarus, Cameroon,
Chile, Colombia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
Finland, Iraq, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, the Republic of Korea,
Senegal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Syria,
Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of membership was viewed as a major progress of
the CD since the issue was first raised three years ago. CD
President Munir Akram told reporters today that the immediate
benefit of the expansion is that it will add to the prospect for
wider adherence to the nuclear test ban treaty currently under
negotiation at the CD.
</P>
<P>
In the larger prospective, he said, the participation of more
significant countries both politically and militarily "will enable
the conference to make more meaningful contributions to the
promotion of disarmament both in nuclear and conventional
aspects."
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that a solution of the CD expansion issue
had been merely delayed by the U.S. objection to the membership of
Iraq for reasons that Iraq is still under sanctions of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise to solve the problem, the CD decided today that
the 23 new members would have no individual right to block
consensus at the CD in the next two years. After that period, the
other 22 new members except Iraq will automatically have the right
to veto. Iraq will be granted the right only when the U.N.
sanctions are lifted by then.
</P>
<P>
As the world's only multilateral arms control body and
negotiating forum, the Geneva-based conference consisted of 38
members before the expansion, representing a delicate geographic
balance. Any member of conference can break the required consensus
on any decision.
</P>
<P>
The Chemical Weapons Convention concluded in 1992 is the first
multilateral treaty negotiated by the CD, which was established in
1978 following a recommendation of a special session of the U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty has been under
negotiation at the CD for the past two and half years and is
expected to be concluded by the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Visa Exemption for HK Residents after 1997 urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his talks held here today with Thai deputy foreign minister
Charas Puachuay, Lu ping said that in order to maintain Hong
Kong's position as an international financial and trade hub after
1997, China hopes that free visa arrangements for Hong Kong
residents will continue after July 1, 1997, when Hong Kong returns
to China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said that after July 1, 1997, passports of the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China will
be issued to those Hong Kong permanent Chinese residents who were
either born in Hong Kong or have lived continuously in Hong Kong
for no less than seven years, and the SAR passports will be issued
exclusively by the SAR immigration authority.
</P>
<P>
During his visits to Japan, Singapore and Malaysia, Lu Ping
made similar requests and those countries indicated that they have
no intention to change after 1997 the existing visa exemption
arrangements for Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Thai foreign ministry, Lu Ping arrived
here on Saturday on a four-day visit to Thailand to explain
China's policy on Hong Kong after July 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Kills 6 Palestinians in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and 15
others wounded in an explosion in a refugee camp near the southern
Lebanese port city of Saida this morning, the state-run National
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted police sources as saying that the explosion
took place inside the house of a military cadre of the PLO's
Fatah faction on the western boundary of the Ein Hilweh camp, 45
kilometers south of Beirut, at 7:30 a.m. (04:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The two-story building was completely destroyed and six
neighboring houses badly damaged, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were supporters of Fatah, but the
owner of the house, Nahil Khatab, escaped the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are under way to find the reasons behind the
explosion, and the police sources said that it was probably
caused by a fire inflamed by gas leaked from jugs. The fire spread
to the depot and detonated the ammunition, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
After the blast, followers of Fatah removed ammunition from
under the rubble of the collapsed building, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Ein Al-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in
Lebanon with an estimated population of 70,000, is a hot bed
for inter-Palestinian armed clashes, and the Lebanese army has
refrained from deploying in the camp in order not to be
involved in the contention.

<HEADLINE> No Further Progress in Maritime Transport Service Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States refused yet to
make an offer, while the European Union and Japan suggested
continuing the maritime transport services negotiations beyond the
June 30 deadline.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the ongoing talks aimed to
liberalize the global maritime transport market, the United
States, not satisfied with the offers made by many of the
participants, still refused to make an offer.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated the position last Friday. On June 4, 24 countries
made package offers only in order to lead to a U.S. matching offer
and gave Americans 10 days of time to consider.
</P>
<P>
At today's group meeting, the EU said it was disappointed about
the U.S. response and it was interested in consulting delegations
on the possibility of continuing the talks before 2000 when the
next round of services sector negotiations is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Japan suggested the continuation of the maritime talks beyond
June 30 or an extension of the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Maritime talks are one of the three services talks left over
from the Uruguay Round multilateral trading talks under the former
GATT. Because of U.S. dissatisfaction over offers from others,
only limited success was made in the financial and telecoms
services talks last year.
</P>
<P>
Trade sources said that with Thailand and Turkey having newly
submitted their offers, the number of countries making offers in
the maritime talks so far totaled 29.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Efforts Against Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has said it is
upbeat about the entry into force of the Convention to Combat
Desertification (CCD) by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 31 countries have ratified CCD, and the number of
countries ratifying the convention is likely to reach 50 by the
end of the year, enabling the Convention to take effect, according
to a U.N. press release issued on the World Day to Combat
Desertification, which fell on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. urged speedy process towards ratification of the
Convention, adding that desertification persists globally,
affecting the livelihoods of about 1 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that the continents lose 24 billion tons of
topsoil each year. Over the last 20 years, as much has been lost
worldwide as covers the entire cropland of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Desertification now damages about 70 percent of the 5,200
million hectares of drylands used for agriculture, or almost 30
percent of the total land area of the world.
</P>
<P>
The economic loss it causes is estimated at 42 billion
U.S. dollars every year. Africa alone accounts for 9 billion
dollars, with over a million hectares, or 73 percent of its
drylands, being affected by desertification.
</P>
<P>
About 5.2 billion hectares of useful drylands worldwide have
already suffered erosion and soil degradation. In all, more than
110 countries have drylands that are potentially at risk of
desertification.
</P>
<P>
The problem affects 1.4 million hectares of drylands in Asia,
and 74 percent of those in North America. France, Greece, Italy,
Spain and Portugal are the five of European Union countries most
severely affected.
</P>
<P>
Climate variations such as drought is viewed as part of the
cause of desertification. However, desertification is essentially
a man-made problem, arising from overuse of land, overgrazing,
poor irrigation methods and deforestation.

<HEADLINE> Torrential Rains Hit Yemen, Kill 80 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains hit Yemen with
streams engulfing most of the Yemeni provinces over the past two
days, killing 80 people and causing serious material losses.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary data compiled by a Yemeni ministerial
committee, the torrential rains led to the collapse of 66 houses
and seven government establishments, washing away large tracts of
agricultural land and 15 water projects along with related
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The rains also destroyed three main bridges, one of which is
the Ashran Bridge that connects the provinces of Shebwa and
Hadramout. Besides these, school and hospital buildings, roads,
water and electricity as well as telecommunication networks have
also been damaged.
</P>
<P>
In view of the extensive human losses and material damages in
the provinces of Shebwa, Hadramout, Maarib and al Jofe, Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh ordered urgent assistance be rushed
to the victims. A ministerial committee has been formed to inspect
the inflicted areas and restore roads and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Tents and blankets were distributed to displaced people and
medical drugs made available. Injured people were rushed to the
state hospital in Sanaa.

<HEADLINE> Over 7.6 Million Perinatal Deaths Occur Annually Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 7.6 million babies fail to
make it through the late stages of pregnancy, birth and the first
week of life annually worldwide, the World Health Organization
(WHO) said today.
</P>
<P>
The WHO described it a warning sign which appeals for better
care for pregnant women and newborns, especially in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to newly-published WHO document titled "Perinatal
Mortality", almost 4.3 million babies die before or during birth
and another 3.4 million die within the first week of life every
year in the world.
</P>
<P>
The WHO also noted that although the number of babies who die
during the first year of life has decreased substantially during
the past decade, the number of babies who are born dead or die
within the first week of life has remained virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Most notably, about 98 percent of perinatal deaths take place
in developing countries, where 57 out of every 1,000 babies born
are either born dead or die within the first week of life, five
times the rate in developed countries where the perinatal
mortality rate is estimated to be only 11 per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said the high rates in developing countries reflect the
vicious circle of resource-poor settings, including poor nutrition
status of women, insufficient prevention of complications of
pregnancy, and too few properly supervised deliveries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, perinatal deaths can be reduced only when pregnant
women receive better care, especially skilled attention during
delivery and when the needs of the newborn are better met, which
include hygienic conditions for delivery, warmth, immediate
breastfeeding, resuscitation when necessary and treatment of
infections, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the duty of the international community to support
countries that wish to make a difference for mothers and their
babies," said the U.N. specialized health agency.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO document, the highest perinatal mortality
rates are found in western, central and eastern Africa, about 80
per 1,000 births, with south-central Asia closely behind, about 66
deaths per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
High levels of perinatal mortality are found in the same places
where maternal deaths are high. Preventive measures to reduce
perinatal deaths, therefore, also help prevent maternal deaths and
morbidities, the WHO said.

<HEADLINE> Police Fail to Find Missing Crewmen of Capsized Freighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's maritime police made
no progress in their three-day-long search at the sea for the 26
sailors missing from a Cyprus-registered freighter, police sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Cyprus-flagged ship "Annaspiratou" collided in
thick fog with a Greece-flagged freighter "Polydefkis" about 10
kilometers off the coast of South Korea's Kyongsang Province on
June 15.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot ship sank after the collision with all the 26
crewmen missing, while all 12 crewmen of the Greek freighter were
reported safe.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that oil is continuing to spill out of
Annaspiratou and there are no reports of the whereabouts of the 26
sailors.
</P>
<P>
A dark brown 100-meter-wide and three-kilometer-long oil slick
of Bunker C oil is spreading near the scene of the accident, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 South Korean vessels are working to contain the
spill but ran into problems caused by 2.5-meter waves and dense
fog, the sources said.

said in a preliminary report.

with the United States also declined 39.6 percent to 167.68
billion year (1.677 billion dollars), falling for the 15th
straight month, it said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Condemns Israel's Abduction of Journalist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon condemned today the
Israeli abduction of a Lebanese journalist from Israel's
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon, and called for
an international interference for his release.
</P>
<P>
Ali Daya, correspondent of the Beirut-based Safir daily which
is one of the most popular newspapers in Lebanon, has been moved
by the Israeli occupation authority to Israel for interrogations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Information Minister Farid Mkari described the
abduction as "a step coming within the Israeli aggressions
against the Lebanese and reflecting the pressing climate in which
the residents in the border strip are living."
</P>
<P>
"This operation, which is added to the series of Israeli
violations against the Lebanese, should be condemned and
denounced," he added, "we call on the humanitarian institutions
and international organizations to act to find out the fate of
Ali Daya and to secure his release."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said that his government
"strongly denounces the abduction of Ali Daya by the Israeli
occupation army."
</P>
<P>
"This unjustified terrorist act" against a journalist when he
was doing his job on the occupied Lebanese land proves Israel's
"full contempt of freedom and human rights," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
Ali Daya is also a correspondent of the Agence France-Presse
(AFP).
</P>
<P>
"We are demanding the help of all international and
humanitarian authorities for his immediate release," he
underlined.

<HEADLINE> Ex-South Korean President Denies Role in Crackdown of Revolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan today denied he had sent troops to crack down on a civil
uprising in the city of Kwangju in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun made the claim at the 14th trial of mutiny and treason
cases involving him and another former president, Roh Tae-woo, as
well as some of Chun's fellow generals and colonels at the Seoul
District Court here today.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court were Chun and Roh as well as Chun's
11 close aides, including Hwang Young-shi, former first army corps
commander.
</P>
<P>
"The troops dispatch was based exclusively on a decision made
by the then martial law command at the recommendation of Chin
Jong-chae, commander of the second army," Chun said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the suppression of the uprising in Kwangju,
capital of the South Cholla Province, was personally commanded by
Chun Woong, commander of the 31st division stationed near Kwangju.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
and Roh have been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both. They
were charged for their roles in the military revolt on December
12, 1979 and in the bloody crackdown of the civil uprising in
Kwangju May 18, 1980, which protested against the martial law.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the country
until February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in
February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, have also been
indicted on graft charges for receiving illegal funds from
businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
The next trial session will be held on June 20, during which
the court is expected to look into evidential items relating to
the 1979 revolt and review the list of witnesses offered by both
the prosecutors and defense lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Policeman in Kosovo Wounded by Unknown Gunman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A Serb policeman was wounded in
Yugoslavia's southern province of Kosovo and Metohija late Sunday
as an ethnic Albanian opened submachine-gun fire on him, the
Tanjug news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Goran Mitrovic was wounded in the leg around 22:00 local time
(2000 GMT) in a street near the bus station in Podujevo, a town
in Kosovo and Metohija, where the Albanians make up more than 90
percent of the 2 million population.
</P>
<P>
"An intensive search for the terrorist was underway," Tanjug
said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, some 10 cases of assaults on Serb
policemen in and around Podujevo have been registered, the agency
added.
</P>
<P>
Five people were killed and another five wounded in a series of
terrorist attacks carried out throughout Kosovo and Metohija in
April by unknown terrorists and the police are still looking for
those responsible for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
An illegal ethnic Albanian terrorist organization that calls
itself the Liberation Army of Kosovo claimed responsibility for
the latest attack, Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The organization, unknown up to this point, announced a series
of similar terrorist actions in a BBC program in Albanian
language.
</P>
<P>
An ethnic Albanian separatist movement has for decades been
active in Kosovo and Metohija trying to break the province away
from Yugoslavia and merge with neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, more than 150 people have died in clashes with
police or as a result of repression in Kosovo and Metohija.

<HEADLINE> Likud Submits Official Policy Guidelines To Knesset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The official policy guidelines
prepared for the incoming Likud government has been submitted to
the Israeli parliament, Knesset, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
According to the platform, the rightwing government, to be
formed by prime minister-elect Benyamin Netanyahu Tuesday, will
have a different approach to the peace process in striking
contrast to the outgoing Labor-led government.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Golan Heights, the incoming government
views Golan as an essential region for state of security and for
preserving water resources. Preserving Israeli sovereignty over
the Golan Heights will serve as basis for any arrangements with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
On relations with the Palestinians, the government will
propose to the Palestinians to run their life freely in the
framework of self-rule, but will oppose the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state or any foreign sovereignty west of
the Jordan River. It will also object the rights of return of Arab
population in the section of the land of Israel west of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israel will carry on negotiations with the Palestinian
Authority on a permanent arrangement on condition that the
Palestinians fulfill their commitments in their entirety.
</P>
<P>
The Likud-led government pledges to strengthen settlement
throughout the land, to expand it and develop it. Jewish
settlements will continue to be tied to the state of Israel with
the Israeli government responsible for the existence and security
of the settlements and for the security of their residents.
</P>
<P>
On Jerusalem, the government will crush any attempts to harm
the unity of Jerusalem and will prevent any activity which is not
in line with its exclusive Israeli sovereignty in the
city. Special resources are to be provided, together with the
municipality, to speed up construction in Jerusalem and its
environs, to improve municipal services for Jews, Arabs and
others, and to strengthen the social and economic status of
"Greater Jerusalem."

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian financial market
braced itself against the shock waves of the Sumitomo "rogue"
trading and recovered much of the previous losses today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Stock Exchange's (ASX) main indicator, the All
Ordinaries index, rallied 20.8 points, or near one percent to
2228.3 points today, more than offsetting the loss of 8.7 points
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Trade value in the stock market also picked up to a healthy
771.2 million Australian dollars (609.2 million US dollars) from a
subdued 520 million Australian dollars (411 million US dollars)
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed the rally to steady copper prices at
the London Metal Exchange (LME). Copper prices at LME passed the
crucial moment of June pricing on Monday without plummeting into a
free fall. Spot price of copper remained well above the
"dangerous" level of 1900 US dollars per ton as set by
international analysts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sumitomo Corp of Japan has promised not to dump
its one-million-ton copper stockpile to cover the losses of 1.8
billion US dollars in the past decade due to unauthorized copper
trading.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to joint efforts of trading houses, brokers, banks and
copper producers all over the world, an immediate market meltdown
has been averted after the revelation of the Sumitomo scandal on
Friday, which was larger in value than the Leeson case.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar, which is closely co-related to commodity
prices, remained steady today at 79.18 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Share prices of three of the four biggest copper producers in
Australia recovered part of yesterday's losses. MIM gained one
cent to 1.65 Australian dollars after losing six cents yesterday.
West Mining Corp added 18 cents to 9.05 Australian dollars after
easing nine cents on Monday. CRA, or RTZ-CRA, rose nine cents to
19.64 Australian dollars after dropping 25 cents yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The remaining major copper producer, BHP, also saw the fall of
share prices, closing six cents lower at 18.26 Australian dollars,
compared with yesterday's fall of 33 cents.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts had already predicted that the impact of the
Sumitomo incident on Australia's copper exports would be limited.
</P>
<P>
Copper prices had been depressed for weeks before the rogue
trading at Sumitomo Corp came into light. Investors had already
factored in a dismal outlook for copper prices in the next two or
three years. The incident has just put frost on snow.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that demand-supply relations were the major
factor for the weakening of copper prices.
</P>
<P>
World copper production is expected to increase by 900,000 tons
in the next fear years, much more than the market can absorb.
</P>
<P>
However, Australia's copper exports are expected to grow. In a
forecast released today, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics (ABARE) said that the value of copper exports
would grow by ten percent to 880 million Australian dollars (695
million US dollars) in the fiscal year of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
BHP, the world's second largest copper producer, and CRA boast
the lowest cost of copper mining in the world. BHP is running
several major copper mines in the Americas. Its giant Escondida
mine in Chile will expand production from the present 600,000 tons
to 800,000 tons next year. Substantial increase in export volume
will offset the decrease of unit prices.
</P>
<P>
Above all, most copper trades are done in futures. Therefore
Australian copper producers would still receive higher prices that
were contracted months ago even if there were a landslide in spot
copper prices.
</P>
<P>
However, statistics reminded the Australians how near they had
come to the verge of market collapse.
</P>
<P>
The panic dumping of copper caused the All Resources index at
the Australian stock market to fall 19.2 points, or 1.3 percent on
Monday, wiping out one billion Australian dollars (792 million US
dollars) from stock value of the four mining giants.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said that oversupply of copper in the long-term
would force high-cost copper producers, such as MIM, to close
down.
</P>
<P>
Local investors are still waiting to see the final outcome of
the Sumitomo incident. They pay much attention to mid-term
factors, such as the increase of world copper production and
economic recovery in the United States and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets Philippine Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said today the China has maintained good
contacts, consultations and cooperation with ASEAN countries in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
He told a delegation from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
House of Representatives of the Philippines that China is also
happy to see the rapid development of Sino-Philippine friendly
ties, especially bilateral economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Last year, bilateral trade volume registered a record 1.3
billion US dollars, exceeding 1 billion US dollars, which was the
aspiration of Philippine President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by committee chairman Jaime C. Lopez,
arrived in China for a visit last Saturday at the invitation of the
Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
As neighbors, Qian said, the two countries should solve their
problems through peaceful negotiations, and if some problems could
not be solved immediately, they could be put aside for a while,
and should not become obstacles to the smooth development of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that good exchanges and cooperation between China's NPC
and Philippine' congress help the development of bilateral ties as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also pointed out that as China's economic development
requires a peaceful international environment, safeguarding world
peace and pursuing the development of good-neighborly friendship
with its neighbors have become the focus of China's foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the so-called "China threat" theory as
erroneous, noting that if China did not develop its economy, and
its 1.2 billion population remained poor, this in itself would be
a threat to the world.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the development of the Chinese economy will be
beneficial to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and
in the world at large, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also gave a briefing on the Chinese government's stand on
Sino-US ties, the issue of Taiwan, China's resuming exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, as well as a comprehensive prohibition
of nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
Lopez said that the Philippine government always attaches great
importance to its ties with China. The China visit by President
Ramos and other senior leaders of the country in recent years
demonstrated its willingness to pursue closer and more harmonious
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government adheres to the one China policy,
accepts the government of the People's Republic of China as the
sole legal government of China, and considers Taiwan an
inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries should strengthen understanding
to bring into full play their economic potentials.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his hope that China would play a greater role
in international affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China, the country's largest state-owned bank, has set new
targets for its foreign exchange business to meet intense
competition in and out of the country, a senior bank official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the bank will try to improve three
ratios, the ratio of foreign exchange assets to the bank's overall
assets, the ratio of foreign exchange profits to its overall
profits, and the ratio of foreign exchange assets of the bank's
overseas subsidiaries to its overall foreign exchange assets.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also manage to raise the efficiency of its
foreign exchange management, and give priority to the development
of foreign exchange brokerage business, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, he said, the bank will take effective
measures to turn itself into a state-owned commercial bank, and
seek an intensive mode of operation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the bank has already adopted a unified
legal person system, under which the head office serves as the
center of management, capital allocation, capital liquidation, and
decision-making, while the subsidiaries do business in line with
the head office's authorization.
</P>
<P>
"It will build up a self-restraining and risk-proof system,
strengthen head office control over foreign exchange assets,
and step up the supervision on foreign exchange transactions,
international settlement, and foreign credit guarantees," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that his bank will improve its internal
management, enlarge its foreign exchange deposits, and achieve
automation in the foreign exchange business.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the bank plans to do international settlements
for 22 percent of China's overall foreign trade, and handle 15
percent of the country's exchange settlement and sales business
next year.

<HEADLINE> Land Added-Value Tax to Be Levied in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Municipality will start to
levy a land added-value tax from October 1, 1996, local government
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to promote restructuring of investment in the
real estate industry and strengthen the government's macro-control
over real estate development and the property market, in order to
curb speculation and undue huge profits, said Sun Zhengwu, deputy
director of the Beijing local taxation bureau.
</P>
<P>
The tax levied for land added value falls into four different
categories; the bigger the amount of the added value, the more tax
will be levied, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the profits rate of the city's real estate
industry has dropped gradually over the past few years, declining
from 60 percent a few years ago to 8.6 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected to drop to a minimum," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He said that tax levied for land added value will not exert a
big influence on the development and trade of real estate, nor
trigger a hike in housing prices. enditem

BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China is spreading the use of a
farm chemical which can kill both weed and pests, but nourish
plants.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held today by the Scientific Achievement
Application Office under the The State Science and Technology
Commission, the new product was introduced to traders of farm
materials across the country.
</P>
<P>
The farm chemical kills weeds and pests by disrupting the
composition of protein inside weed and pests.
</P>
<P>
The chemical in the form of powder, developed by Puzhou
Science and Technology Company under the Qinghua University, can
be applied to rice, wheat and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Experimental application in Beijing and Hebei province shows
the low-cost product is easy to use, effective and safe to plants,
humans and livestocks.
</P>
<P>
The farm chemical has been exported to Singapore, Thailand,
Mongolia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
According to reports issued by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization, about 35 percent of the world's annual
grain output is lost because of weed and pests.
</P>
<P>
Estimates by experts say China loses about a quarter of its
annual grain output to weed and pests.

<HEADLINE> Western Assistance to Developing Countries Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Aid from Western industrialized
countries has been on the decline for two years running, a report
by a committee of the OECD said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries among the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) provided 59 billion
U.S. dollars in aid to the developing countries in 1995, compared
with that of 59.2 billion in 1994, the OECD's Development
Assistance Committee said.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar last
year, the real value of the Western aid was 53.7 billion dollars,
9.3 percent less than that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 figure was already 8 percent less than that of 1993,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's total foreign aid amounted to 14.5 billion dollars last
year, the highest in all Western nations. It was followed by
France and Germany, which provided 8.4 billion dollars and 7.5
billion dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The United States, offering only 7.3 billion dollars of aid
last year, made the deepest cut in its foreign aid program.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the aid in the gross national product of
seven most developed Western countries has also declined.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangdong Province has
vowed to help its last 800,000 people locked in poverty, living
primarily in 16 mountainous counties, shake off poverty by 1997.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 the number of poor people in the
economically prosperous province dropped considerably, down from
four million five years ago, thanks to the country's aid-the-poor
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has expressed its determination to
allocate an additional 200 million yuan to boost the province's
aid-the-poor fund.
</P>
<P>
Eight coastal cities, all economic stars of the province, are
poised to forge partnerships with the 16 counties, pledging to
start 70 support projects, involving a total of 150 million yuan
of investments.

<HEADLINE> Japan's GDP Grows 2.3 Percent in Fiscal 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's real gross domestic product
(GDP) grew an impressive 2.3 percent in fiscal 1995 ending on
March 31, reversing an almost zero growth in the previous three
years, the government said today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese GDP rose 0.4 percent in fiscal 1992, 0.2 percent
in fiscal 1993 and 0.5 percent in fiscal 1994.
</P>
<P>
Japan's inflation-adjusted GDP grew 3 percent in the
January-March quarter from the previous quarter, the highest in 23
years since the January-March quarter of 1973, the Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The 2.3 percent GDP growth, the highest since a 3.1 percent
increase in fiscal 1991, is much higher than the government's
target of 1.2 percent set for the year's growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
EPA Vice Minister Makoto Kobayashi told reporters: "Japan's
economy is just crossing the threshold of a self-sustainable
recovery."
</P>
<P>
If the economy continues growing at the January-March rate, it
will be possible for the government to attain its real GDP growth
forecast of 2.5 percent for fiscal 1996 that started April 1, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The nation's real GDP for the reporting quarter totaled 478,413
billion yen (4,784.130 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the 3 percent GDP growth for the January-March period,
domestic demand contributed to an increase of 3.4 percentage
points while external demand pushed down the growth by 3 percent,
the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
The 3 percent growth follows an increase of 0.6 percent in the
April-June and July-September periods, and of 1.2 percent in the
October-December quarter.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Controls Public Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
formulated a three-year strategy to control public spending which
will see significant reductions in budgetary allocations for some
ministries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published on Tuesday, the Standard Chartered
Bank Zimbabwe Ltd said that the government is faced with tough
choices to curb spending and reduce the budgedt deficit which
will remain close to 10 percent of the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) during the 1995/96 fiscal year which ends this month.
</P>
<P>
''A major reduction in the budget deficit in 1996/97 is
central to the government's hopes of securing a new agreement
with the IMF (International Monetary Fund),'' it said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has yet to resume talks with President Robert Mugabe's
government on the resumption of key balance-of-payments aid whose
disbursement was suspended last September due to fiscal problems.
</P>
<P>
Though export receipts this year can be expected to narrow the
deficit, they are, however, likely to be little changed from last
year, at around 300 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Housing Starts in U.S. Fall in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The housing starts in the
United States fell by 4.7 percent in May resulting from the
steadily rising mortgage rates, the Commerce Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that construction of new homes and
apartments totaled 1.43 million at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate, down from a revised 1.51 million in April.
</P>
<P>
The housing starts rate in May was the lowest since last
December when it also was 1.43 million.
</P>
<P>
The drop of the housing starts in the nation indicates a
significant decline as higher mortgage rates take their toll on
this interest rate-sensitive sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.09 percent in May,
more than a full percentage point higher than the 7.03 percent
average in January, surveys by the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp showed. They reached 8.39 percent last week, highest in more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that for every 1 percentage point increase in
rates, 250,000 to 300,000 families are priced out of the market.
</P>
<P>
Applications for building permits, often a barometer of future
activity, dropped 1.9 percent to 1.43 million, the first decline
in four months.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, starts rose 0.9 percent in the South but they fell
elsewhere. The starts were down by 13.7 percent in the West, by
8.8 percent in the Northeast and by 3.4 percent in the Midwest.

<HEADLINE> Party Approves New Publication of Political Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee has approved a new publication of its recent
major documents.
</P>
<P>
"Selected Important Documents Since the 14th CPC National
Congress", first volume, is a collection of political material
made by top decision-makers between October 1992 and September
1994.
</P>
<P>
The book, compiled by the Party Literature Research Center of
the CPC Central Committee, contains 68 articles, including regular
files, laws, regulations as well as reports and speeches made by
Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Publishing House, the publisher, the
book will give people an idea about the progress achieved in the
Chinese economy and society, thanks to the leadership of the Party
Central Committee with general secretary Jiang Zemin at its core
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
It is the Party that has set a guideline that all the Communist
Party members should be armed with the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics put forward by Deng
Xiaoping, and made a decision to build a socialist market economy,
the book shows.
</P>
<P>
The book also records many other measures the Party has adopted
to reform the economy, improve people's spiritual lives, and
maintain a clean government, .
</P>
<P>
The 14th CPC National Congress, held between October 12 and 18
in 1992, was especially important in the Party's history as it
decided that the pace of reform and opening should be sped up, and
that the establishment of a socialist market economy must be the
goal of China's economic reform.

HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral consultations will
take place in Hong Kong tomorrow between Hong Kong and the United
States over US's unilateral decision to impose additional import
document requirements on a number of textiles and clothing
products from the territory.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said today that "during the
consultations, we will reiterate Hong Kong's position which the
Secretary for Trade and Industry has put to the US government in
her letter of June 14."
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the secretary raised fundamental objections to
the US unilateral decision. She also requested the US to defer the
implementation of the measures to enable Hong Kong and the US to
discuss the matter with a view to finding a mutually satisfactory
solution, he said.
</P>
<P>
US Customs announced on June 13 its decision to impose import
measures with effect from June 17, on five types of products from
Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Condemns Japanese Diet Resolution on Nuclear Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- It is entirely unjustified for the
Japanese Diet to adopt a so called resolution on China's limited
nuclear test in total disregard of China's reasonable proposition
in this regard and the enormous efforts it has made for the
advancement of nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang made this
remark at a routine news briefing here today when asked to comment
on the resolution adopted by the Japanese Diet recently to protest
against China's limited nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
"Such a resolution is unacceptable to the Chinese side." Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Japan, as a country under the nuclear
umbrella, should understand China's position of carrying out
necessary and limited nuclear tests under nuclear threat.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Japanese side would proceed from the overall
interest of Sino-Japanese relations and approach the issue with a
somber mind, " he noted.

BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said today
that China attaches importance to its ties with Guinea and is
willing to cooperate with Guinea in every form.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while meeting in Beijing with Guinean
President Lansana Conte, during which the two leaders reached a
consensus on further developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that Guinea was the first African country south of

Sino-Guinean ties have stood the test of time since the two were
diplomatically linked 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Conte told Li that his country has consistently adhered to "one
China" policy and supports China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Guinea firmly safeguards its sovereignty
and territorial integrity, and opposes any foreign interference in
its internal affairs.

pursued by Guinea, and he expressed his thanks for Guinea's support

Chen said China has, over the past four years, conducted two
rounds of nationwide oil and gas surveys in which systematic
prospecting was done in 76 basins, and in 26 of them, oil and gas
flows of industrial development were obtained.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 China started the second round of nationwide oil and
gas surveys and breakthroughs were made in 1979 in the Pearl River
Estuary basin in the South China Sea by sinking the very first oil

</P>
<P>
Again in 1983 China built the first high-yielding oil and gas
gush well in the East China Sea.
</P>

Over the past five years, he said, China has made a series of
breakthroughs in regions including the Tarim Basin, the East China
Sea and Sichuan Province and verified oil reserves, plus those
estimated, totaled 145 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Therefore China will pay attention to onshore and offshore
exploration and development operations, and at the same time
intensify prospecting and strive for a simultaneous development of
oil and gas, while placing the focus on the development of gas to
verify more oil and gas reserves in the coming five years, known
as China's Ninth Five-Year Plan period.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Spokesman Denies Yeltsin Meeting with Gromov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for Russian President
Boris Yeltsin today denied media reports that the president is to
meet General Boris Gromov, who is believed to be the most possible
replacement for dismissed Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such meeting on the work schedule of the
president," spokesman Sergei Medvedev told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Yeltsin sacked Grachev from his post in a
reshuffle aimed at bringing in general Alexander Lebed, who
finished third in Sunday's first round presidential elections and
could give vital support for Yeltsin to win the forthcoming
run-off.
</P>
<P>
Army General Mikhail Kolesnikov was named as acting Defense
Minister. Kolesnikov, 57, has been Chief of the General Staff of
the Russian Armed Forces and First Deputy Defense Minister.
</P>
<P>
But sources in the Kremlin said that Yeltsin may already begin
consultations with possible candidates for the post of defense
minister today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Yeltsin had scheduled a meeting for today with
his main campaigners including Gromov, but failed to say
definitely whether such a meeting would take place.
</P>
<P>
According to Itar-Tass news agency, there are four candidates
who may become the new defense chief, and they include former
Defense Ministers Gromov and Valery Mironov as well as current
First Deputy Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin and Kolesnikov, who
is currently acting defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Both Gromov and Mironov fell out of Grachev's favor for open
criticisms of the Chechen war and of the poor army reform.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin met with Gromov on the eve of Sunday's elections and
mass media here immediately viewed him as the most likely
successor to Grachev.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who reportedly demanded a dismissal of Grachev in
exchange for his support for Yeltsin in the second round of the
elections, said in a TV interview that, had Gromov headed the
Defense Ministry, the situation in the army would have not been as
bad as it was with Grachev.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Approves Plan for Implementing Chechen Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
approved a plan for implementing the accords signed earlier by the
federal authorities and Chechen separatists, a high-ranking
Russian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Kadannikov, Russia's first deputy prime minister, said
that the plan of actions was drawn up and submitted to the
president by the State Commission for Settling the Chechen Crisis,
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the document, working groups from both sides will work
out a detailed mechanism for withdrawing the federal troops from
Chechnya, disarming the Chechen fighters and reciprocally
releasing people detained unlawfully.
</P>
<P>
"Everything must be done to end the hostilities and to begin
the implementation of the protocols recently signed at Narzan,"
Kadannikov said.
</P>
<P>
This calls for further promotion of the intra-Chechen dialogue
and expansion of contacts between the leadership of the republic
and the armed opposition, he added.

<HEADLINE> Power Company Set up for A National Integrated Power Grid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China today made a major step in
the building of a national power grid with the setting up of the
State Power Grid Development Company in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The company, solely invested by the state, has a registered
capital of 2.5 billion yuan (about 301 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Power Industry will exercise a shareholder's
rights, and at the same time manage the company, said minister Shi
Dazhen.
</P>
<P>
At today's inauguration ceremony, Chinese vice-premier Zou
Jiahua said that the establishment of the company is an important
decision of the State Council, China's highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
Zou said that construction of power grids, which need overall
planning nationwide, has become a significant issue in the
country's development of power.
</P>
<P>
At present China has 12 major local power grids, but a national
power grid has not come into being.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stage, the company will be in charge of the
Three Gorges Power Grid System's investments, construction and
management, making sure that construction of the system keeps in
pace with the development of the Three Gorges Project, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic Three Gorges hydro-electrical power project is
expected to have an installed generating capacity of 18.2 million
kilowatts when it is completed in 2009.
</P>
<P>
In China, construction of power plants and power grids are
separated from each other after the reforms of the power industry
sector.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Power Grid System, the largest project China
has ever launched in power transmission, will link nine provinces
and cities along the Yangtze River, and help transmit electricity
from western part to the east, and connect central and eastern
power grids, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The company will also coordinate relevant power grid
administrations or provincial power companies in raising money,
and will be responsible for planning, building and managing
projects for the connection of major local power grids, as well as
perform other duties.

<HEADLINE> Samsung to Invest in Kazakh Copper Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, Kazakhstan, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Samsung
Company today signed an agreement to purchase 40 percent of the
shares of a Kazakh state-owned copper company.
</P>
<P>
Samsung is to invest one billion U.S. dollars within a period
of 15 years in the Zezkazgan non-ferrous metallurgical company to
help bail it out of its current economic dilemma.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean company will also pay 300 million dollars in
debt for the Kazakh company.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Garri Shtoik signed the agreement
on behalf of his government.
</P>
<P>
In late 1994, Kazakhstan decided to allow foreigners to invest
in large-scale state enterprises and participate in the operation
and administration of loss-making state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
So far, upwards of 50 state enterprises have been partly bought
by foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief on Importance of Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid said here today that the call for the convocation of
the Pan-Arab summit came at a most appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
It is high time for Arabs to come together and unify their
stands to protect the Middle East peace process and push it
forward in the right direction, Abdul-Meguid was quoted as saying
by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia called for
convening the summit after their two-day meeting in Damascus,
Syria, earlier this month. Twenty-one of the Arab League's 22
members are expected to participate in the summit to be held in
Cairo from June 21-23.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait in 1990 split the Arab world, is
the only Arab League member that has not been invited to the
summit, which will be the largest gathering of Arab leaders in six
years.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the summit is particularly important with the
looming threats to the peace march, the Arab League chief said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the new Israeli government would implement
all international resolutions concerned to continue the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu would form a
right-wing government today.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid called for removing all obstacles blocking
promotion of inter-Arab cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to come up with mechanisms and formulas
for upgrading Arab joint action in economic spheres.
</P>
<P>
"This necessitates adopting immediate steps to set up an Arab
economic grouping capable of serving Arab interests and facing
future challenges," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Continues Search for Boat Carrying Liberian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said today that it has resumed
search for a missing ship that carried Liberian refugees after
suspending the operation last weekend due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesperson Ron Redmond told a press briefing this
morning that the UNHCR-chartered aircraft is looking for the ship
off the coast of Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR staff in Abidjan reported earlier this morning that the
weather was much improved, Redmond said. Cloudy weather had been
hampering the searching effort since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire has also sent ships to look for the boat that
carried 450 people, half of them Liberians fleeing the conflict in
the capital of Monrovia, Redmond said. He added it was hopeful
that the ship would soon be located.
</P>
<P>
The ship was reportedly last seen adrift off the coast of Cote
d'Ivoire and Liberia Saturday after Ghanaian authorities refused
to let it dock at the port of Takoradi last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ship left Monrovia on May 26 and arrived on May 30 off
Ghanaian coast. On June 1 it arrived at Lome of Togo and was
turned back on June 3 after receiving water, fuel and food.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, reports from UNHCR staff in Monrovia said
that food is in short supply in the city, where conflicts broke
out in April. A sack of rice which was sold for 20 U.S. dollars
two months ago now cost 75 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Redmond voiced concern that as the humanitarian situation
continued to deteriorate in Monrovia, more and more people would
try to leave Liberia.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and two
others injured when gunmen attacked an ICRC convoy leading to
Jilib, 350 km south of here, yesterday.
</P>
<P>
All the victims were reported to be Somalis working for the

According to reports, the assailants also hijacked one of the
convoy's two vehicles carrying humanitarian delivery to the town
of Jilib.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles left Mogadishu two days ago to their office in
Jilib.
</P>
<P>
The area surrounding Jilib has been a battlefield for the

<HEADLINE> Palestinians React Strongly to Likud's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leaders have
sharply criticized the policy guidelines of Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu, which were published today in
the Israeli press.
</P>
<P>
The policy guidelines showed that Netanyahu's new government
will oppose the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,
retain sovereignty in the Golan Heights and Jerusalem, strengthen
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and reject the
right of return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), said that the policy guidelines of the
Netanyahu-led government contradict the Oslo peace agreement
signed in 1993 by the Labor-led Israeli government and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Palestinian Authority (PA) is reserving
its judgement until the new government is set up and its
negotiating team on permanent status talks on Jerusalem formed.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala, speaker of the legislative Palestinian Council,
pointed out that the guidelines aspire to murder the current
peace process. He warned that if Israel wants to give up peace,
the Palestinians will have to investigate other options.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, member of the Palestinian Council and PA
minister of education, said that it is impossible for the Likud to
talk about the peace process on one hand, and, on the other hand,
advocate expansion of Jewish settlements and reject the
establishment of a Palestinian state and the negotiation of the
status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question of whether the peace process will come
to an end, Ashrawi said that the new Israeli government will not
live in an international vacuum and will come under pressure
domestically and internationally.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi was spokesperson of the Palestinian delegation at the
Madrid Conference in 1991. Her counterpart on the Israeli side
was Benjamin Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Arafat Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today in Beijing that the Chinese government and people will
continue to support the Middle East peace process and the just
struggle of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat this
afternoon, Jiang said the current visit of Arafat will further
promote the all-round development of Sino-Palestinian friendly
relations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, noting this is the first time he came to China directly
from Palestine's own territory, said he expects the visit to yield
"positive results."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the founding of Palestine's autonomous transitional
government marks an "important step" in the Palestinian people's
struggle for restoring their national legal rights, and "the
Chinese government and people heartily rejoice at that."
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, progress has been made in the Middle East
peace process, Jiang said, adding he believes that to realize the
goals of peace and stability at an early date represents the
strong wish of all people in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang wished that positive results be made at the forthcoming
Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the Palestinian people hope that the Arab summit
will help promote the Middle East process.
</P>
<P>
Palestine will, as always, stand for the promotion of the
Middle East process and adopt a flexible attitude in striving for
fair, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region, the
Palestinian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Arafat also exchanged views on regional and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in China last night as Jiang's guest. This is
Arafat's 10th China visit, and his first trip in this country
after he was elected president of the Palestinian National
Authority in January.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Jiang congratulated Arafat on the election.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks the two heads of state attended the signing
ceremony of two documents between the two governments, namely the
Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement and the Banking
Agreement on Accounting Procedures for the implementation of the
previous agreement.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Urge Ban on Killing of Small Whales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Animal charities are demanding a
halt to hunting small whales, dolphins and porpoises as well as
the trade in their meat, as the International Whaling Commission
held its annual meeting in Britain, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists pointed out that thousands of small whales,
dolphins and porpoises are being killed because of lax rules and
flagrant breaches of international agreements, according to The
Times.
</P>
<P>
Allan Thornton, chairman of the London-based Environmental
Investigation Agency, said that the worldwide ban on commercial
whaling, which covers the 12 large species, should be extended to
68 smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
Protectionists also called on the commission to introduce
tougher controls on fisheries, including a crackdown on illegal
Irish driftnetting which, it is claimed, can kill up to 50
Atlantic white-sided dolphins in a single trawl.
</P>
<P>
Driftnets, large versions of which were banned by the United
Nations in 1992, continue to claim the lives of thousands of small
whales, dolphins and porpoises around the world.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of international treaties, some fishing fleets,
including those operating in the Mediterranean and the Pacific,
are still using giant nets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of harbor porpoises continue to be killed
in British and Irish waters, caught in gill nets set to catch hake
on the Celtic Shelf, southwest of the British Isles.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists are also alarmed that successful agreements in
the eastern Pacific, designed to reduce the deaths of dolphins
from tuna boats, may be relaxed.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares for Another National Petroleum Corporation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China is to establish a third
national petroleum company later this year to boost its fuel
output, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new company follows in the footsteps of China Oil and Gas
Corporation and China National Offshore Oil Corporation, a senior
official from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing "China Petroleum Conference '96" which opened
today in Beijing, Chen Zhouqi, vice-minister of geology and
mineral resources, warned that for eight consecutive years China's
national output of oil grew at an average of one to two
percent annually, but consumption continued to rise at seven to
eight percent each year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 export of crude oil was, for the first time,
outstripped by imports, he said. The imbalance between supply and
demand has been growing from bad to worse, thus stemming the
development of the national economy. The existing bases for oil
and gas prospecting and development are too few, hence the
increasingly great difficulty for finding additional reserves.
</P>
<P>
To introduce competitiveness to boost output, the State
Council, China's highest governing body, has approved the
establishment of the new company, which has been under
preparations at the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
When the company, to be based at the Bureau of Petroleum and
Marine Geology of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources,
is established, it will undertake the prospecting and development
of onshore and offshore oil and gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the corresponding measure to boost the country's petroleum
industry, China will also build one or two major oil-gas chemical
enterprises to lay a solid foundation for the development of
the national company, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest assessment of China's oil and gas
resources, the total volume of China's oil resources amounts to
88.8 billion tons.

MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Cases of child abuse in the
Philippines will continue to rise unless the government takes
effective measures to reduce them, according to the Department of
Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).
</P>
<P>
A report from the DSWD said that child abuse cases reached

percent of these cases involved sexual abuse and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The report said the cases of abuse and violence against
children also include physical and psychological abuse.
</P>
<P>
Many of such abuse cases are being committed by those who are
children's protectors such as their parents, step parents and
guardians.
</P>
<P>
The DSWD suggested that the government should form child safety
monitoring teams in every community so as to reduce such abuse
cases.

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov Still Wants to Meet Lebed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov today said that he still intends to talk with
Alexander Lebed, now hailed as a kingmaker as the Russian
presidential race was forced into a one-on-one showdown.
</P>
<P>
"It is not late yet," said Zyuganov outside the State Duma
(lower house of the Russian parliament).
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov is to compete with President Boris Yeltsin in a second
round of the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The switch of supporters of the retired general is widely seen
as decisive in the runoff elections as both Yeltsin and Zyuganov
were wooing the backers of Lebed who surprisingly finished third
in Sunday's presidential poll with 14.7 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was leading the poll with 35.06 percent of the ballots
while his arch-rival Zyuganov was trailing by 31.96 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian elections law, Yeltsin and Zyuganov
have to face off each other in a runoff to be held no later than
15 days after the final vote count is made known.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Yeltsin has appointed Lebed as secretary of the
state security council and presidential assistant for national
security.
</P>
<P>
The retired general will be inaugurated in his post at a
meeting of the Russian security council which is to be held on
Thursday, according to Sergei Medvedev, Yeltsin's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman described as "pointless" the planned
meeting between Lebed and Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
"Certain confidence or even assurance of Zyuganov that he will
automatically win over the biggest part of Lebed's electorate
remains nothing more than an election slogan," Medvedev said.
</P>
<P>
Though Zyuganov announced on Monday he was ready to meet Lebed
and other presidential candidates, the retired general said that
most of his votes will now go to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that no less than 80 percent of my voters would
understand me and follow me," Lebed told the press after accepting
the appointment made by the incumbent president.
</P>
<P>
The retired general made it clear that he supports Yeltsin
despite all the mistakes he had committed in reforms.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Between Zyuganov, Lebed Pointless: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian presidential spokesman
today described as "pointless" the planned meeting between retired
general Alexander Lebed and Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Medvedev, press secretary of President Boris Yeltsin,
made the remark after Yeltsin had appointed Lebed secretary of the
Russian security council and presidential assistant for national
security.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Today's events have reshaped the country's political
map," referring to the meetings between Yeltsin and Lebed on
Monday and today.
</P>
<P>
"Zyuganov's confidence that he will automatically win over the
biggest part of Lebed's electorate remains nothing more than a
campaign slogan," Medvedev told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
Both Yeltsin and Zyuganov were wooing the backers of the
retired general who finished third in Sunday's presidential poll
with 14.7 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin led the poll with 35.06 percent of the ballots, with
his arch-rival Zyuganov trailing by 31.96 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Zyuganov have to face each other in a runoff no
later than 15 days after the final vote count is made known.
</P>
<P>
The switch of Lebed's supporters is seen as decisive in the
runoff elections.
</P>
<P>
Though the Communist Party chief announced on Monday he was
ready to meet Lebed and other presidential candidates, Lebed said
most of his votes will now go to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that no less than 80 percent of my voters would
understand me and follow me," Lebed told the press after accepting
the appointment made by the incumbent president.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he supports Yeltsin despite all the
mistakes he had committed in reforms.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov is reportedly offering Lebed the post of prime
minister if he wins but the latter may be a little slow to act.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev disclosed that the meeting of the Russian Security
Council "which Lebed is going to preside is to be held shortly, to
my knowledge, on Thursday."
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman said that the post of secretary of
the security council will give Lebed "broad opportunities to
fulfill his promises to voters."
</P>
<P>
As presidential assistant for national security, Lebed will
also enjoy broad powers, Medvedev added.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma (lower house of
the Russian parliament), however, told reporters that Lebed's
appointment do not mean that his electorate will vote for Yeltsin
in the runoff.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's alliance with Yeltsin was viewed by Seleznyov as an end
to the general's political career.
</P>
<P>
"This is an end for Lebed as a politician," he said,
attributing his third-place finish in Sunday's polling to the
charisma of the retired general, who was described as having no
political party or public movement behind him.

<HEADLINE> New Commission to Monitor Gene Research in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A new advisory commission is to be
set up by the British government to oversee major developments in
human genetics.
</P>
<P>
The move marks a change in what many see as the most important
and fast-moving scientific field, The Daily Telegraph reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The commission will monitor gene patenting, genetic medicines,
the use of genetic information by the insurance industry and
employers, as well as such ethical issues as the potential to
create a "genetic underclass" and "designer babies."
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission, a
group of eminent individuals who will report to ministers, came on
Monday in response to an outcry from the House of Commons Select
Committee on Science and Technology that proposed the body last
July.
</P>
<P>
The membership of the new commission, which will have a joint
secretariat provided by the Office of Science and Technology and
the Department of Health, will be announced as soon as possible
but will include the chairmen of the Gene Therapy Advisory
Committee and the new Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing.
</P>
<P>
Britain will demand that the cost of a Europe-wide research
program be capped at 10.9 billion pounds (16.7 billion
U.S. dollars) and that the program be given clear objectives to
enable its value to be judged in terms of money.
</P>
<P>
Britain's contribution toward the European Union research
budget has increased to 376 million pounds (577 million dollars)
last year.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The American Chamber of Commerce
 in Hong Kong (AmCham) applauded the resolution to the
16-month-long Sino-US trade dispute over intellectual property
rights.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States struck a last-minute deal on the
issue Monday and canceled tit-for-tat sanctions that could have
triggered a devastating trade war.
</P>
<P>
Mark Michelson, chairman of the AmCham, told Xinhua today: "It
is a classical win-win situation."
</P>
<P>
The American businesses will benefit from China's clear
commitment to protecting intellectual property, and thus become
more competitive on the world's largest market, according to
Michelson.
</P>
<P>
"It is good for Chinese companies who want to move up their
technology scales," said the chairman. He believed that the
solution will eventually allow the transfer of technology and add
great competitiveness to Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
Michelson said that this time China and the Untied States got
on the right track to settle down their disputes through
dialogue. He hoped that the pattern could be followed in resolving
other issues between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Armed Robbers Attack Gold Shop in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Three armed robbers snatched a total
of 600,000 Patacas (about 75,900 US dollars) worth of gold ornaments
from a gold shop in Macao on Monday afternoon but no one was
injured, the "Macao Daily News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The robbery happened at about four o'clock Monday afternoon in
a gold shop called Sam Lung Jewelry and Gold Shop when three
pistol-wielding men broke the showcases and grabbed gold necklaces and
wrist laces and ran away.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that the three men were between 1.60 meters
and 1.70 meters high and were in their 30s. Their faces were
uncovered and they all spoke Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
Police have found one handle-broken hammer and took away video
tapes for investigation.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it was the second time the gold shop was
robbed. Three young men holding pistols and knife robbed the shop of
about one million Patacas (about 126,582 US dollars) worth of gold
ornaments on last December 26. The shop-owner installed video
cameras after that robbery.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President: Solution to Cyprus Problem is </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
has said that a solution to the Cyprus problem that would
guarantee permanent peace and security for all the people of the
island is indeed possible.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Monday night in a statement at
the National Press Club in Washington after he held talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Cyprus news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"My message is really simple and one that is underscored by the
U.N. resolutions on Cyprus, namely, that a negotiated solution of
the Cyprus problem is a matter of urgency," Clerides said,
stressing that a solution guaranteeing "permanent peace and
security for all the people of Cyprus is indeed possible."
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Clinton's personal interest and his commitment to
work hard to end the division of Cyprus, President Clerides said
the U.S. is in a "unique position to exert the necessary
influences toward Turkey, whose military occupation of part of
Cyprus is the single greatest obstacle toward a solution."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the issue of security must be given "top
priority" as it is of paramount concern to both the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
"The guarantees of the past have tragically failed," he said,
adding that it is in this context that he has presented a
comprehensive proposal for the demilitarization of the Republic of
Cyprus and the establishment of a multinational force under a
neutral commander, which can include both Greek and Turkish
forces.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides is currently on an official visit to the
United States. He is expected to have talks today with
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
He will then fly on to London for a meeting on Wednesday with
British Premier John Major.

<HEADLINE> West Told Not to Interfere in ASEAN Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today told the
western countries not to interfere in the issue of whether Myanmar
should be allowed to become a member of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said at a
press conference here today: "This is a matter for Myanmar whether
it wishes to join ASEAN or not and it is a matter for ASEAN
whether Myanmar should be a member of ASEAN or not."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent statements by US special envoys who
visited several Asian countries that Myanmar could destabilize
Southeast Asia if it was allowed to join regional groupings under
present political situation in that country.
</P>
<P>
"We are able to decide what is in the best interest of ASEAN
and I don't think we need to be told by anyone," Abdullah said
after meeting visiting Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodia and Laos have official
observer status which Myanmar is expected to get in July this
year.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the latest political development in Myanmar would
affect its bid to join ASEAN, Abdullah said: "It does not in any
way disqualify them to be a member of ASEAN."

<HEADLINE> Yemen Asks for Aid to Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yemeni government has appealed
to international and regional humanitarian organizations to give
urgent aid to five Yemeni provinces that have recently suffered
devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
An official source in the Yemeni Cabinet Office told the Sanaa
News Agency of Yemen Monday that "in recent days, government-
appointed committees have been doing rescue, accommodation and
relief work in the provinces of Shabwah, Ibb, Hadramaut, Ma'areb
and Jawf, which have recently suffered heavy casualties and damage
as a result of torrential floods."
</P>
<P>
"Many roads, water-wells, bridges and electricity and water
networks have been destroyed, large areas of farmland have been
inundated, a large number of cattle heads have been lost and
many public and private buildings have been totally or partly
damaged," he added.
</P>
<P>
The floods in eastern Yemen caused by heavy rain have killed
more than 100 people and damaged oil production equipment,
according to Yemeni state-run television reports.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the Yemeni government would continue doing
its best to alleviate the effects of these disasters and rebuild
what has been devastated.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Restrict Cigarette-Smoking Through Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to expand its non-smoking
areas, ban all forms of cigarette advertisement and impose more
severe punishment on violators, according to a proposed law on the
restriction of cigarette-smoking.
</P>
<P>
The revised new law on restricting smoking is now under
discussion at the Legislative Assembly of Macao, and is expected
to be adopted soon.
</P>
<P>
The new law bans smoking in all sanitary places, whether public
or private, schools, public reception places, places producing or
trading inflammables, closed areas like gymnasium, theaters and
cinemas, museums, libraries, reading rooms, meeting rooms,
exhibition halls and big commercial buildings, buses and taxis,
elevators and eateries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new law rules that warnings of the harm of
cigarette and the amount of nicotine or tar contained in a piece
of cigarette should be marked clearly on the package of cigarette
products.
</P>
<P>
Macao adopted a similar law on the restriction of smoking in
1983, but the law failed to curb smoking in public places because
it "cannot intimidate violators," as some people said.
</P>
<P>
That will be changed soon as the new law stipulates in detail
the punishment to be imposed on violators.
</P>
<P>
Macao imported a total of 160 million packs of cigarettes in
1994, four times the figure in 1992, showing that the number of
smokers in Macao is growing.
</P>
<P>
Another survey conducted in 1994 also show that there were
about 14 smokers out of 100 people in Macao, and the sex ratio of
smokers between man and woman was 12 to one.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Pakistani Oil Company to Be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Oil and Gas Development
Corporation (OGDC), the only enterprise now 100 percent owned by
the Pakistani government, is expected to be converted into a joint
stock company soon.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five years after its establishment, the OGDC will
eventually change its name into the Oil and Gas Development
Corporation Limited in line with the government's economic reform
policies.
</P>
<P>
The federal cabinet has finally decided to go ahead with the
much-talked privatization process of the OGDC, despite the
resistance from within the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
As many as 49 percent of the OGDC shares will be floated on
both the domestic and overseas markets, Ghulam Haider, a public
relations officer of the OGDC told Xinhua here today during an
exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Banking Consortium and the Natwet of Britain have
been appointed as the financial adviser and the lead underwriter
respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Haider, the financial evaluation is expected to be
completed within one year, after which the privatization of the
company will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Pakistani government embarked upon the ambitious
privatization process in late 1989, more than 100 state-owned
industrial units have been privatized, he said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to sell the OGDC shares is believed to be the most
important and challenging step taken by the government so far in
the process of privatization, said Haider.
</P>
<P>
The OGDC, the largest crude oil producer and the second largest
gas producer in the country, operates 17 oil fields, nine gas
fields and three condensate gas fields.
</P>
<P>
The company has shown greater vitality in its operations in the
past year. Its profit is expected to be doubled to four billion
rupees (about 114 million US dollars) in the current fiscal year
ending this month.
</P>
<P>
Haider expressed belief that with more participation of private
sectors in the OGDC, the company will play a more important role
in development of the national economy and enter the new century
as an internationally competitive enterprise.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
steady against the US dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar remained unchanged against the greenback
at 79.18 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Local traders said that the Australian dollar seemed to have
stabilized after the news that Japan's copper trading house
Sumitomo suffered 1.8 billion US dollars of losses due to
unauthorized trading, driving down world copper prices sharply.
</P>
<P>
The US dollar weakened to 108.44 yen against the Japanese yen
on the news that Japan experienced a higher than expected growth
rate in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was traded at 85.83 yen against the
Japanese yen from 86.41 yen on Monday.
</P>

stability in the final stage of its transition.
</P>

states in the world, China and the United States need to enhance
their cooperation in economic and political fields.

Meanwhile, many of Hong Kong-based newspapers, including Wen
Wei Po, Hong Kong Economic Times, Hong Kong Commercial Daily, Tin
Tin Daily News, Ta Kung Po and Oriental Daily News, carried
editorials or commentaries to express welcome to the Sino-US IPR
agreement.

the importance of protecting intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
It said that the United States should not ignore China's
progress in IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
It called on the United States and China to enhance their
cooperation which will benefit not only themselves but also the
Asia-Pacific Region and the whole world.
</P>
<P>

set up a harmonious dialogue mechanism so as to avoid unnecessary
troubles.
</P>
<P>
It said that the exchanges and understanding between the two
sides will be good to the two sides as well as the world

14, and her brother Zhou Yue, 12, were orphaned nine years ago and
had difficulties in life and in attending school.
</P>
<P>
Su was shocked, and promised to help the two children. He wrote
an article saying that in Linhai, none of the poor households are
allowed to remain in poverty, none of the children can be absent
from school, and none of the orphans should be unhappy.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 500 cadres have provided assistance to the
poor rural households, and more than 100 orphans have found new
"parents".

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Lift Bread Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is considering to lift the
government's subsidies on bread, the staple food for Jordanians,
which are the main cause of the government's budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
A committee in charge of the issue will decide to implement the
new policy, which will eventually lead to an increase of bread
price by 200 percent, Minister of Supply Muneer Suber was quoted
by today's English-language daily Jordan Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
The committee has been at work for the past two weeks and will
issue a recommendation to the cabinet "in the next two months,"
Suber said.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the government has promised that the lifting will
not affect the poorest fragments of the Jordanian society.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to make sure that subsidies for the poor will be
maintained," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bread is sold at less than a third of the cost, making great
burden to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
With one-kilogram bread costing just six U.S. cents, the
average consumption per head is about 115 kilograms a year, which
is among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Government subsidies make bread so cheap that many people use
it for feeding animals.
</P>
<P>
Together with huge consumption of flour (over 400,000 tons
per year) and record world grain prices as well as limited
domestic food output which meets only 5 to 8 percent of the needs,
the import bill has already more than doubled in less than a
year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the government paid over 97 million Jordan dinars
(about 145.5 million U.S. dollars) in subsidies on food imports,
including barley and maize for animal fodder.
</P>
<P>
Official forecasts show that government subsidies for the
current fiscal year are expected to reach up to 190 million
dinars (about 285 million dollars), exceeding by four-fold
the 38 million dinars allocated by the state budget for
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The current food ration program was launched to help the
population of 4.2 million, most of them poor, after riots in 1989
which were triggered by a rise in the price of bread recommended
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The food subsidy program is a crucial part of the Kingdom's
social safety net, with many officials and economists arguing
that it is vital for social stability in the debt-ridden country.
</P>
<P>
The government has already restricted ration cards to families
earning a maximum of 500 dinars (about 700 dollars) per month in
an effort to stop more wealthy Jordanians from receiving
subsidized sugar, rice and milk.
</P>
<P>
But to the dismay of the government, nearly 87 percent of
the Jordanian households applied last year for 1996 ration cards.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the lifting of subsidies will target
at "around 1.5 million people from tourists and foreign
residents passing through Jordan every year to wealthy
Jordanians."
</P>
<P>
However, no one could specify how to identify the different
categories of wealthy Jordanians, tourists, foreign residents and
poor Jordanians.

<P>
DALIAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- When the harmonious strains of the
well-known "the Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss suddenly turned
sour, orchestra conductor Keishiro Takaoka turned around and
explained to his audience, "It's our first rehearsal."
</P>
<P>
This was a scene at the rehearsal hall of the Youth and
Children Culture Palace, where an orchestra has formed consisting
of dozens of foreigners who work or study in this coastal city of
Dalian, and local residents from all walks life.
</P>
<P>
Aged 10 to 70 years, the musicians rehearse on weekends and
perform on holidays in this port city in north China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
Keishiro Takaoka, 50, president of Dalian Rihong Steel Sheets
Processing Co. Ltd., is as good a clarinetist as he is a
conductor.
</P>
<P>
"I take part in the rehearsal every week because I have made
many friends who love music here," he said.
</P>
<P>
His friend, Tsuyoshi Seki, president of Konica (Dalian)
Co. Ltd., said that they didn't know each other when they were
neighbors in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"We are partners in terms of loving and playing music," he
added.
</P>
<P>
There are no language or race barriers in the world of music,
said Fuji Moto Kaishuhiko, another clarinet player in the
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
Fuji, accompanied by his wife at the rehearsal hall, recently
got married.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra is attracting many people, although the members
have to provide their own musical instruments and sponsor the
performances.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Premier Leaves for UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti left here today for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and
Bahrain for consultations with their leaders ahead of the Arab
summit to be held in Cairo Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister is expected to carry messages from
King Hussein to the leaders of the UAE and Bahrain dealing with
pan-Arab issues and the Arab summit, the first of its kind in six
years.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti will brief the leaders of the two Gulf states on
Jordan's position vis-a-vis the new Israeli government headed by
right-wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu and the Kingdom's
stands toward the Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Kabariti's talks in the UAE and Bahrain
would also deal with Jordan's charges that Syria was behind a
series of attempts of sabotage in the Kingdom, today's
English-language daily, Jordan Times, reported.
</P>
<P>
The summit was called by the leaders of Syria, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia following the victory of the Likud leader in May 29
elections on a "no-concessions to the Arabs" platform, ousting
incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres, the architect of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, who returned home Sunday after a visit to the United
States where he attended King Hussein's talks with U.S. President
Bill Clinton, is expected to return home before leaving for Cairo
Thursday to attend a foreign ministers' meeting ahead of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
He also holds the foreign affairs portfolio in the government
which he set up in February.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan, China's Important Chemical Building Material Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China aims to build southwest
Sichuan Province into one of the country's important chemical
building material production bases by the end the year.
</P>
<P>
Chemical building materials, such as PVC plastic doors and
windows, are new generation items replacing wooden, cement and
steel fittings.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 the State Council formed an office responsible for
building three plastic building material bases in Chengdu, capital
of Sichuan Province, Zhuzhou in central Hunan Province and in
Baoding in north Hebei Province. The construction work was called
"901" project.
</P>
<P>
One of the project's trial enterprises, the Sichuan Huasu
Building Material Company, a Sino-foreign joint venture, invested
119 million yuan in the first phase of its construction, importing
equipment from Germany and Austria.
</P>
<P>
Huasu is expected to go into operation next month, to produce
6,000 tons of PVC plastic doors and windows a year, and to fix
100,000 square meters of doors and windows.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture plans to pour 100 million yuan into its
second phase from late 1997 to early 1998, to lift its annual
production capacity of PVC plastic products to 12,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the company is expected to complete its third
phase which will cost 130 million yuan, to increase its production
capacity to 20,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Obtaining full support from the State Council and local
authorities, the company has received 50 million yuan of
preferential loans from the State Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the turn of the century the application
rate of plastic doors and windows in China will rise from the
current three percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
China will put more efforts into improving the "901" projects
to promote the country's use of chemical building materials.

<HEADLINE> Mango Brings Wealth to Ethnic Minority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The tropical mango is bringing
economic prosperity to people of the Li nationality, an ethnic
minority that lives mostly in China's southernmost island province
of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
There are about 10,000 mango trees in the Changjiang Li
Autonomous County in Hainan, which is called "the hometown of the
mango" because of its 1,000-plus-year history of mango planting.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by the typical tropical monsoon climate, mangoes
grown in Changjiang have a beautiful shape, bright color, fragrant
smell, and juicy and sweet flesh. The county now leads the
province and the country in planting area, output, varieties, and
quality of mangoes.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the county has expanded its mango planting
industry, with an investment of nearly 20 million yuan in 1995.
It now has 100,000 mu (7,000 hectares) of mango orchards in which
more than 40 varieties of mangoes are planted. The fruit from
these orchards can be bought in Beijing and Tianjin in north China.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the year 2000, Changjiang county could
take in more than 200 million yuan (24 million U.S. dollars) for
mango planting alone, and the average income for local farmers
could reach 1,000 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Mangoes ripen in June. On June 8, the county hosted its first
Mango Festival, which attracted millions of yuan in investment for
the planting, processing, and selling of the fruit.

SHIJIAZHUANG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Engineers in northern China
have succeeded in gasifying underground coal to achieve a

According to specialists, traditional coal mining can dig out

actions are able to raise extraction rates by turning underground
coal directly into combustible gases.

</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will hold a press conference
Thursday to release a statement detailing the framework, the

</P>
<P>
The statement will call for the creation of an investment fund,
using money contributed by the creditor financial institutions, to
offset the taxpayers' burden in the Jusen liquidation scheme, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The fund, with an initial amount of 700 billion yen, will
operate for 15 years to cover the 685 billion yen envisaged under
the fiscal 1996 national budget for the Jusen liquidation plan,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The statement will call for the Bank of Japan and the largest
collective Jusen creditors, agricultural-related financial
institutions, as well as the Jusen's founding banks, to put up all
the money required for the investment fund, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It will also require agricultural financial institutions and
creditor banks to consider giving up receipts of interest earned
on their lending to Jusen firms during the January-March period,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The statement will propose taking strong measures to recover
bad loans which will be left over after the planned liquidation of

<P>
He said the commission would cooperate with international and
local human rights organizations on improving the human rights
situation in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Abacha also seized the opportunity to say that there is no
absolute rights in any human society, pointing out that ''our
rights are of necessity limited by those of other individuals and
the larger needs of our society as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
Critics accused the Nigerian military government of violating
civil rights by arresting at will any citizen suspected to be
against the law. In an anti-crime decree, Abacha ordered that the
military task forces have the power to arrest any person
suspected to be drug-dealers, armed robbers or to have committed
any acts violating the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Responding, the general said: ''no one could be allowed to
place himself above the law without repercussions the nation
would find itself in a state of anarchy if crime is allowed to
thrive.''
</P>
<P>
He said strict measures are necessary in this particular time
to arrest the grim situation when armed robbery and drug
trafficking are going rampant in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, chairman of the human rights commission,
Justice P. K. Nwokedi, pledged to justify the confidence reposed
in the organ and to perform their duties faithfully.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Rationalization Exercise Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A brigade headquarters and six
battalions have so far been disbanded as the Zimbabwe National
Army's rationalization and reorganization of its units near
completion, the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was done in line with ZNA's commitment to reduce
the size of the army from 51,000 to a manageable 40,000,
''following the dictates of the prevailing economic situation in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
Buildings at the affected barracks have since been handed over
to the Ministry of Public Construction and National Housing.
</P>
<P>
The last phase of the reorganization would involve the

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai No.1 Department
Store, the largest of its kind in China, has become a member of
the Intercontinental Group of Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
The group now has a membership of 28 of the biggest department
stores in the world, with total sales of 60 billion US dollars in
1995, said Zhang Yinqi, general manager of the Shanghai No.1
Department Store Company.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the group is to promote exchanges, co-operation,
mutual purchase, mutual benefits and interest, and common progress
between its members.
</P>
<P>
IGDS membership has shortened the distance between China's
department store sector and the international market, said Zhang
Guangsheng, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commerce Commission.
</P>
<P>
"It helps domestic businesses learn from advanced management
and sales in foreign countries, and develop relationships with
foreign counterparts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai No.1 Department Store achieved a sale totaling
about 400 million US dollars, ranking the first in the country,
while the smallest among the IGDS members has a sale of at least
one billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the prospects of China's market and its commodities in the
sector of international department stores are good. The Chinese
goods selling in some European members of the IGDS account for
about ten percent of the total sale. enditem

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names Lebed as Security Council Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSOCW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today named retired general Alexander Lebed as secretary of the
Russian Security Council and the presidential national security
aide, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
By this step, the president clearly wants to win Lebed's
support in the second round of the presidential elections. In
Sunday polls, Lebed took third place with 14.71 percent of votes,
only after Yeltsin with 34.82 percent and Communist party Leader
Gennady Zyuganov with 32.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
In opinion of experts here, Lebed, "a dark horse" in the polls,
became a kingmaker capable of swaying voters in favour Yeltsin or
Zyuganov in another voting for early July.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, 46, born into a Cossack family, began his military
career in 1973 and rose swiftly in the ranks. During the August
events of 1991, he took Yeltsin's side and defended the White
House in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, he was dispatched to head the 14th army stationed in
Moldova, where he calmed down a bloody conflict between the former
Soviet republic and its breakaway Dniester region.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebed stepped down from this post in 1995 to
officially protest the downgrading of his unit. Many analysts have
viewed this resignation as a clear display of Lebed's political
ambitions.

<HEADLINE> Whampoa Military Academy in Guangzhou Being Renovated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters of the Whampoa
Military Academy in Guangzhou, capital city of south China's
Guangdong Province, is being reconstructed to restore its original
site, the Shanghai-based "Wen Hui Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The academy was established in 1924 by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, leader
of the 1911 Revolution that overthrew the rule of the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911) and the founder of the Kuomintang Party during the
institution's early days. It inspired many famous, high-ranking
officers and numerous historic incidents have occurred there.
</P>
<P>
For decades, the academy has been well protected as a site of
historical relics. Over the past several years, the local government
has spent millions of yuan toward renovation.
</P>
<P>
The current renovation will focus on the headquarters and some
education buildings. The project is expected to be completed in
about five months.

<HEADLINE> New Plan to Eliminate Budget Deficit Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A new plan aimed at
eliminating budget deficit in Kuwait by the year of 2000 was
drafted out by a governmental economic reform body.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which was agreed at a meeting held by the Higher
Committee for Development and Economic Reform Monday, envisaged a
state expenses cut of 35 percent, non-oil revenues increase of 63
percent and an oil revenues rise of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Nasser
al-Roudhan, who also serves as the chairman of the committee, said
after the meeting that the plan is supposed to be implemented
starting from the current fiscal year up to the end of the
1999-2000 fiscal year to cut the deficit to zero.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is running an actual deficit of about 4 billion
U.S. dollars this fiscal year comparing with 4.36 billion
dollars. Its public spending is currently at 4.5 dinars (about
14.85 billion dollars) while revenues is not more than 3.5
billion dinars (11.55 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
An average annual deficit reduction of 250 million dinars (825
million dollars) would be needed to eliminate the deficit by the
century end based on the current five-year plan beginning from
1996-97 fiscal year, according to an official report released last
month.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations including cutting expenses and increasing
non-oil revenues would be implemented once they have been approved
by the Parliament, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts to offset the budget deficit would be made
jointly by all government sectors and cooperation of
international consultancy agencies would be invited, adding that
the International Bank had played a leading role in studying the
deficit in the emirate.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's budget deficit was structural and linked to the
domination of the public sector in various economic activities
and national work force problems, Roudhan said.
</P>
<P>
Parliament members have been calling the government to
consider cutting down its spending and finding other revenue
resources beside oil which accounts to more than 80 percent of
the country's revenues.
</P>
<P>
Roudhan said on May 8 that the draft budget for the next fiscal
year beginning July this year envisages levying of charges and
repricing of public services and "specific percentages were
proposed."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait also plans to cut in defense spending by 20
percent.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Import f-5 Fighter-Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Botswana, in a move that
represents a massive increase in defense spending, has agreed to
purchase a squadron of 13 f-5 fighter-bomber aircraft from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The deal is worth 50 million U.S. Dollars and could put
Botswana ''roughly on a par with South African air
capabilities,'' a local daily ''the Star'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
This follows a deal announced in January in the Netherlands
under which Botswana will spend 63 million Dollars for 50 German
Leopard tanks, 200 troop carriers and a variety of weaponry. In
addition, Botswana is buying 36 British Scorpion tanks, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Exactly why Botswana needs heavy armor and the ability to
strafe and bomb is unclear. The Botswana government could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper quoted a reporter for an Botswana newspaper
Mr. Mmegi as saying that he was told by the Botswana government
that it needed the tanks to help with anti-poaching and
border-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
The sudden surge in arms spending drew sharp criticism from
Namibia and an announcement that Namibian President Sam Nujoma is
scheduled to fly to Germany this week for high-level talks.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab has criticized
Botswana's arms purchases as ''provocative and unnecessary''.
</P>
<P>
''It is the interests of all of us in the region to refrain
from anything that looks like a military build-up because that
could lead to tensions and misunderstandings and provoke an arms
race which is the last thing southern Africa wants,'' said
Gurirab.
</P>
<P>
Tension have long simmered between Namibia and Botswana over a
tiny dispute island on the border between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Expert: "Loulan Beauty" Locals Know How to Preserve Their Departed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- In ancient Egypt they mummified
their dearly departed. But in China experts have discovered that a
special coating material was used generations ago to preserve
people who had passed away.
</P>
<P>
And the new discovery could explain the reason for the
so-called "Loulan Beauty", a woman who died over 3,800 years ago
but is still perfectly preserved.
</P>
<P>
When Tian Lin, an expert on cultural relics in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region was carrying out a thorough routine protection
procedure on the world famous "Loulan Beauty," she found tell-tale
signs of a special coating material on her body.
</P>
<P>
The discovery challenges the opinion accepted by international
archaeological circles. Overseas experts believe that the ancient
bodies discovered in Xinjiang were all naturally dried up.
</P>
<P>
Tian, an expert on ancient bodies at Xinjiang Museum, said she
discovered protein coating materials on the body of "Loulan
Beauty," which was discovered in early 1980s in ancient Loulan
country area. She is one of the most well preserved bodies rarely
ever found in the world.
</P>
<P>
She said the coating materials were hard to spot as they are
very thin and were applied 3,800 years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to sample tests, the experts have ruled the
possibility that the coating material was made of inorganic amylum
substance.
</P>
<P>
Though Chinese experts do not know what the coating material is
made of, it is possibly made from an animal protein substance.
</P>
<P>
Tian said she had earlier discovered three well preserved
ancient bodies with a grey-yellow colored coating of just 0.1mm to
0.5 mm thick materials.
</P>
<P>
The three preserved bodies were discovered in a group of
ancient tombs in Xinjiang dating back to 10th century B.C..
</P>
<P>
So far coating materials have only been discovered on ancient
bodies in Qiemo County and ancient Loulan country area. The
ancient human remains found in other areas in Xinjiang are all
naturally dried up.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is on the ancient "silk Road" and is an area with most
well preserved ancient bodies.
</P>
<P>
Tian believes the coating may have been a local custom for
funerals. However she doesn't rule out the possiblily that local
people at that time already knew that animal protein was good for
preserving dead bodies.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The government is
underutilizing local consultancy skills while spending billions
of Shillings on hiring foreign consultancy services.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Association of Consultants (TAC) Chairman Aloyce
Mushi made the remarks here on Monday at a one-day development of
consultancy skills workshop.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should make maximum use of local
consultants to avoid the high expenses incurred on the foreign

<P>
He further said Tanzania spends over 300 million US Dollars
annually on foreign consultants, according to a recent study
carried out by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The TAC Chairman added that the government should respect the
available local consultancy services and exploit it to the
maximum.
</P>
<P>
"For any nation to prosper first and foremost it must
appreciate that human resource is a key factor in the development
process," underscored the TAC boss.
</P>
<P>
He requested the government to ensure that no project is
carried out in the country without the involvement of local
consultants.
</P>
<P>
Foreign expertise is only employed where no local consultants
are available, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Konka TV Group Announces Large-Scale Price Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- One of China's three major
television set manufacturers, the Shenzhen-based Konka Group,
has announced a sharp price cut in Beijing, according to today's
"People's Daily Overseas Edition."
</P>
<P>
Konka cut the price of all its TV sets, ranging from the
14-inch to the 29-inch size. The maximum amount of reduction is
1,200 yuan (about 150 U.S. dollars), 20 percent of the original
price.
</P>
<P>
The group also promised a three-year, post-sale quality
guarantee for all its products.
</P>
<P>
Business experts regarded this as Konka's answer to the
challenge of its chief rival, the Changhong Group from southwest
China's Sichuan Province, which slashed its prices in March in a
move to gain a 27 percent share in China's color TV market.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, Konka announced a similar price reduction in
Nanjing, the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, according to
today's "China Youth Daily."
</P>
<P>
It received an immediate response from the Nanjing-based Panda
Electronics Group, which on June 15 sharply cut prices on all of
its products, including two new models that entered the market
this year.
</P>
<P>
Before Konka announced its price cut, the Panda Group had
declared that it would not lower the price of its products to
promote the sales. Heads of the group said that they were forced
to do so in order not to disappoint and lose local consumers.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that a price war has broken out between
domestic TV makers, adding that it is inevitable, as the supply of
domestic color TVs in China has far exceeded the demand.
</P>
<P>
China now has 90 color TV factories with an annual
manufacturing capacity of 36 million sets, while the market demand
lags far behind at about 16 million.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Changhong, Konka, and Panda have an overall
domestic market share of nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that the price war will lead to a major
market reshuffle, as well as the bankruptcy of a number of small
TV manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Most consumers welcomed the price war, which would save them a
lot of money, according to the "China Youth Daily."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Makes Clear Lebed Will Be His Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today actually confirmed the media rumours that he had meant
General Alexander Lebed when speaking about a possible successor
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Although the president again refused to name the man
concretely, he said that the reporters, who listed Lebed as his
successor, was correct in their guesses.
</P>
<P>
After he announced that Lebed was appointed the secretary of
the Security Council and the aide of the president on national
security, Yeltsin said "you are thinking correctly" but added that
"it is too early to speak about that."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, the meeting between Yeltsin and Lebed
lasted for only a minute or two, sources close to the Kremlin
said, adding that they shook hands and the president took out a
draft decree.
</P>
<P>
"According to our agreement I am signing the decree on your
appointment as the secretary of the Security Council and as the
aide of the President of Russia on national security," Yeltsin
said and signed the document.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was, evidently, reached during the Monday meeting
between the two politicians.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary results of Sunday's presidential
elections, Lebed took third place with 14.71 percent of the votes,
only after Yeltsin with 34.82 percent and Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov with 32.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The top two candidates, Yeltsin and Zyuganov, should race in
the second voting scheduled for early July. Thus Lebed became a
kingmaker in the new round of the polls.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters in the Kremlin, Yeltsin said: "This is not a
simple appointment. This is a combination of two politicians and
two programs." By this step Yeltsin clearly wants to win more
support from Lebed and his backers in the second round of the
polls, with an aim to win the final victory over Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov was probably late to take steps, though he announced
on Monday that he and his team would discuss further moves
including consultations with Lebed and other presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yeltsin also said today that he hopes to win over the
votes of liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky, who won fourth place
with 7.41 percent of the votes on Sunday, but has not met him yet.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet held talks with him," Yeltsin told reporters,
adding that he did not yet know who Yavlinsky was going to
cooperate with.
</P>
<P>
Hoever, he expressed hope that he would find "a common language
with Yavlinsky."

harbor on the Black Sea coast in January this year, is expected to

the route of a ship" and "manufacturing and possessing explosives."

The prosecutors claim that although no organization connections
of the defendants had been established, the hand signs that they
had used during the hijackers were identical to those of members
of the outlawed Islamic Great Eastern Raiders Front (IBDAC). The
defendants, on the other hand, insist that the hand signs
signified the name of God and was used extensively by all
Chechnian fighters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the loads that were observed being thrown into
the sea before the surrender of the hijackers were claimed to be
explosives by the prosecution, while the defendants claimed that
they were cans and bottles of soft drinks.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Start Party Registration Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military government is
to start the political party registration process on Wednesday in
a major step to execute its promise to hand over to civil rule by
1998.
</P>
<P>
The registration guideline, released by the National Electoral
Commission of Nigeria (NECON) on Monday, barred any serving
public officer from partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
And any political party seeking registration must have a
minimum strength of 1.2 million members nationwide and pay a
non-refundable fee of 500,000 Naira (5,500 U.S. Dollars),
according to the rule.
</P>
<P>
NECON Chairman Summer Dagogo-Jack described the requirement as
''a fundamental prerequisite for political registration."
</P>
<P>
''It is a strict condition for registration that membership of
a political party should exclude persons below the age of 18
years, members of the armed forces, police, security agencies,
and public servants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
''The applicant party has to clearly show identifiable
administrative and organizational structure, and must be so
organized in at least two thirds of the local governments in each
state of the country, including capital Abuja,'' the NECON
chairman added.
</P>
<P>
The registration peocess, to be started tomorrow, will be
ended at the end of August.

the presidential election in September, 1998 and to hand over to
an elected civilian government on October 1, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Serf's Offsprings Live Happy Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Village head Wangzha was the first
person in his Tibetan village to attend school after the peaceful
liberation of Tibet in 1951.
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Lhasa Teachers College he opened the
first school in Shexing village of Deqen county, southwest China's
Tibet Autonomous Region, where he had grown up.
</P>
<P>
He helped pave the way for education for the next generations
of village children.
</P>
<P>
Having taught for more than 20 years in the school, Wangzha
said proudly that at present, more than 80 percent of school age
children in his village have attended school. The school has
opened courses in Tibetan language, Chinese and Mathematics.
</P>
<P>
Wangzha continued that students study at school during the day,
while in the evening, the school becomes a classroom for adults
who are eager to learn science knowledge. That's why Shexing
village has made consecutive harvests during recent years.
</P>
<P>
Wangzha's life has spanned the days when the feudal system
ruled supreme in Tibet, to the days when local people were freed
from a life of serfdom.
</P>
<P>
The recent harvest time brought home to Wangzha the dramatic
change that has occured over just a few decades.
</P>
<P>
"What we are proud of is that what we produce belongs to
ourselves, while it was only a dream of our ancestors 40 years
ago," said Wangzha proudly.
</P>
<P>
Wangzha spoke happily as he talked about the harvest in his
village.
</P>
<P>
Wangzha said that his village produced 1.31 million yuan in
gross domestic product, with 50 percent coming from agricultural
produce.
</P>
<P>
The village's grain output exceeded one million kilograms. Per
capita income reached 600 yuan, the highest ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
Shexing village was once the manor of the 14th Dalai Lama's
mother.
</P>
<P>
Wangzha's father Cedain, who was one of the 40 serfs of the
Shexing Manor, recalled his life at that time.
</P>
<P>
He said, "When we were young we just knew to work hard for the
serf owner and there was nobody who had ever changed his fate,
since we were just talking tools at that time."
</P>
<P>
The old man continued, "We also tried to escape exploitation
and oppression from the serf owner. But those who were captured by
serf owner had their fingers or legs cut off, or were thrown into
rivers."
</P>
<P>
Choking with sobbing emotion, Cedain said that it was the
Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army who
saved him from a life of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
As they became wealthy, many households in Shexing village put
carpets on their living room floors, and bought color TVs and
audio sets.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Proceeds Normally in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy was stable
last month, showing a flourishing retail market and further easing
in prices.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau said that China realized a total
retail sales volume of 189.8 billion yuan last month, a growth of
12 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's retail price index and consumer price index
annually rose 6.5 percent and 8.9 percent respectively from the
same month of the previous year. Inflation became less serious
mainly because vegetables were cheaper in May, according to the
bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said in a report that China produced 164.3 billion
yuan worth of industrial goods in May, up 13.1 percent from the
same month of last year, adding that the state-owned sector grew
the slowest, at 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that China invested 103.3 billion yuan on fixed
assets last month, 24.1 percent higher than in the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
During the period of January to May, China's fixed assets
investment amounted to 312.6 billion yuan, 16.5 percent more than
the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The monthly report said that because of interest rate cuts on
May 1, China's banks and other financial institutions received
119.2 billion yuan of deposit last month, marking a decrease of
10.4 billion yuan from the May last year.
</P>
<P>
China's banks loaned 56.2 billion yuan of loans last month,
12.3 billion yuan more than in May of 1995. 19.5 percent of the
total loan, or 11 billion yuan, are long and medium-term loans.
The rate was 10 percent for the previous four months.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the report said, China exported 12.16 billion U.S.
dollars worth of goods, 5.3 percent down from the same month last
year, while it imported 12.01 billion U.S. dollars of goods, up
4.4 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
China suffered a trade deficit of 150 million U.S. dollars last
month.

<HEADLINE> Switching System Adopts Motorola CDMA Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's mobile phone switching
system has adopted Motorola technology to catch up with the global
trend that practices code division multiple access (CDMA).
</P>
<P>
The switching machine, SP 30, newly-developed by the
Xi'an-based Datang Telecom Co., was linked to a Motorola CDMA base
station on June 13. Vice Governor Fan Xiaomei of Shaanxi Province,

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has
developed a plan to seek overseas investment as the main funding
source for the construction of 12 major tourist projects.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hui People See Great Changes on Their Dining Tables (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a local grocery store, the once-popular large china bowls
now quietly gather dust on the shelves. Fan Guoliang, the
storekeeper, said that nowadays only schoolchildren eating in
canteens would use large bowls.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, it was difficult for the Hui people to afford
noodles or rice, which were usually eaten with a bowl of salty
soup or pickles. When disaster or famine struck, they lived on
corn provided by the state, or edible wild herbs.
</P>
<P>
With the rise in their incomes, the menus of the Hui people
have been greatly enriched. A number of greenhouses have been set
up across the region to produce fresh vegetables in all seasons,
while mutton, beef, and fish, all seldom seen in the past, appear
frequently on the dinner tables.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yizhen, a farmer from the Sanying Village, said that his
eight-member family spends more than 1,000 yuan (some 120 US
dollars) monthly on meat, eggs, and vegetables. The expenses are
higher during festivals or when guests visit.
</P>
<P>
"We still eat corn and wild herbs," he said, "but only to
change the taste and have fun."
</P>
<P>
It is the custom of the Hui people to treat guests with four
traditional dishes -- dried fruits, sesame oil, Sanzi (deep-fried
dough twist), and honey.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, however, many Hui people were unable to afford
even these four simple dishes.
</P>
<P>
"I had to use brown sugar to replace honey, which I could not
afford because I was too poor", recalled Ma Wenjun from Xiguan
Village of the Haiyuan County.
</P>
<P>
Ma is now one of the richest men in his village. Driving a
truck of his own, he can earn over 100,000 yuan (some 12,000 U.S.
dollars) a year through private transportation.
</P>
<P>
It is out of question for him to present only the four
traditional dishes when guests come to his house: if guests arrive
during the festivals, he said, he would serve an additional four
dishes to provide a large feast.
</P>
<P>
"It has become the common practice among the Hui people turning
rich in the past decade to treat their guests with eight dishes,
adding meat, fish, and vegetables to the four traditional dishes,"
Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Hui People See Great Changes on Their Dining Tables (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- People of the Hui nationality are
using smaller but more delicate rice bowls, eating more meat and
fish, and treating their guests to more dishes than they did 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Hui nationality is a major component of the Chinese
moslems, with the third largest population among the 55 ethnic
minorities in China. They live primarily in the northwestern
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This region was once one of the poorest in the country, and Hui
people nearly starved. However in recent years the state has made
large-scale investments and issued many preferential policies to
help the region rise from poverty.
</P>
<P>
Though still no match to the booming coastal regions, great
changes have taken place in the area. The most conspicuous of
these are the dining tables used by the Hui people.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, a large bowl made of crude china, which had a
diameter of 20 cm and cost thirty fen (4 cents), was the most
popular tableware of the Hui.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, we didn't have enough food to eat, and had to
have thin gruel for most of our meals," recalled Ma Zhanguo, a
farmer from the Erbaihu Village of Haiyuan County.
</P>
<P>
With seven children to feed his family often ran out of food
before the autumn harvest, and he was forced to borrow food from
neighboring villages.
</P>
<P>
"To eat with a large bowl could help ease the sense of hunger,"
he explained.
</P>
<P>
In 1981 changes occurred when the system of contracted
responsibility, linking remuneration to output, was introduced in
Ma's village.
</P>
<P>
Also the central government suspended the state compulsory
purchase of food in his village for 15 consecutive years, and
helped build a reservoir, which turned a quarter of his farmland
into water paddies.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 the county established an agricultural products fair,
funded by the state. Ma became a broker and two of his sons went
into business trading animal skins and livestock.
</P>
<P>
"Now all my sons have found wives and we have bid farewell to
thin gruel," he said, adding that the 20-year-old large bowls have
been replaced by smaller ones made of refined porcelain.

Kazakhstan, particularly concerning the border trade, have proved
the great potential for cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Georgi, who is here on his first trip to China, said Kazakhstan
is willing to develop good-neighborly ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan adopts the same principles as China in dealing with
various nationalities' affairs, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Develops Folk Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Herbal medicines used to cure
local ethnic people in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region now are available throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Following a decade of efforts to develop traditional
therapeutic methods, Guangxi has become one of the country's
leading herbal medicine production bases. Its neighboring
provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan also practice herbal
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region can provide 30,000 tons herbal medicines
annually to the whole country worth of 1.2 billion yuan-worth. And
a group of books about unique therapeutic methods adopted by
ethnic people has been published.
</P>
<P>
Just as China's Han people have adopted herbs to treat
diseases, ethnic minority groups in Guangxi, such as people of the
Zhuang, Yao and Miao, have a long history of using herbal
remedies. Researchers have discovered 4,620 types of herbs that
have been used by folk doctors.
</P>
<P>
Medical research departments in Guangxi have collected more
than 50,000 folk recipes and a number of hand-written copies, rare
books and relics about illness treatment from locals.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have found nearly 5,000 well-known folk doctors
with proven folk medicine skills across Guangxi. Many of them have
been hired by local hospitals and health care institutes.
</P>
<P>
In Guangxi, ethnic doctors usually practice methods of
treatment that include initial observation and pulse reading,
followed by a prescription for herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
In order to expand the influence of folk medicine, Guangxi has
trained more than 5,000 people to further research and use these
therapeutic methods.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry has
accused Britain of attempting to sow seeds of tension in the
Persian Gulf and acting as "guardians" of other countries, Iran's
official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi has rejected the
statement by British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Jeremy
Hanley that Iran incited violence in the Persian Gulf, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that some aging British diplomats still have the
notion of being protectors of regional countries," Mohammadi was
quoted by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
His statement was also carried on the front page of the
English-language daily Tehran Times, which has strong background
of the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi, terming the remarks of the Britain's official as
"irrelevant," refuted the attempts to involve the Islamic
Republic of Iran in the crisis in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Iran's offer of mediation between the Bahrain
government and people is ample proof of Iran's good will and
concern for stability in Bahrain."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed Hanley's allegations as "part of London's colonial
and seditious policies in the sensitive Persian Gulf region,"
saying that "such remarks indicate which country is behind the
sedition and mistrust in Bahrain."
</P>
<P>
Hanley, in an interview Monday in the Bahrain capital of
Manama, said Iran should stop what he called "creating tension and
instability" in Gulf states such as Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain Information Minister Mohammed al-Muttawa had recently
announced that Iran was involved in a plot to overthrow the
Bahrain government.
</P>
<P>
The tension in relations between Iran and Bahrain broke out
due to the religious riots in Bahrain in October 1994.

FUZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Xiaocuo, a coastal town in east
China's Fujian Province, is rapidly becoming one of the country's
larger industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 340,000, Xiaocuo, covering 319 square
kilometers of land areas and 105 square kilometers of sea area,
aims to turn itself into a leading industrial base after the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
A fine natural port, Xiaocuo has more than 10 kilometers of
coastal line, along with a 10-meter-plus deep sea area.
</P>
<P>
A 100,000-dwt crude oil wharf, and three finished oil wharfs,
ranging from 5,000-dwt, 3,000-dwt to 1,000-dwt, have now gone into
operation in Xiaocuo.
</P>
<P>
Last year, all of Xiaocuo's wharves' handling capacity reached
5.58 million tons, ranking Xiaocuo among the country's
medium-sized harbors.
</P>
<P>
Xiaocuo received approval from the State Council to be listed
as one of China's major ports.
</P>
<P>
It plans to expand the handling capacity of its 100,000-dwt
crude oil wharf to 250,000 dwt, and to build a 50,000-dwt
container wharf, a 100,000-dwt coal wharf, and a 100,000-dwt grain
and edible oil wharf over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian Oil Refinery Chemical Industry Company in the
Xiaocuo Industrial Development Zone plans to raise its annual
crude oil-processing capacity from the current 2.5 million tons to
four million tons by the end of this year, and 10.5 million tons
during the 1997-2000 period. It also intends to build a 70,000-ton
polypropylene project this year.

<HEADLINE> 55 Percent Increase in SADC Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- With this harvesting season coming
to an end, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) food
security early warning unit forecasts a regional grain yield of
25.2 million tons, a 55 percent increase from last year.
</P>
<P>
The unit said on Monday exceptionally good rains after several
years of drought had enabled all the countries to increase
production of maize, wheat, sorghum and millet.
</P>
<P>
Of particular note is the upswing in maize, the staple food,
whose production would increase by 72 percent from last year to
more than 19.44 million tons.
</P>
<P>
While people in other countries were expected to consume all
the maize and import, South Africa and Zimbabwe will export
surpluses of 2.95 million tons and 200,000 tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
An abundance of irrigation water was expected to increase
regional wheat output from 2.33 million tons last year to 2.866
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Output for sorghum and millet was forecast to rise by 15
percent to 2.35 million tons but rice production was expected to
fall by nine percent to 544,000 tons.

Last year, in the Dongmen Village of Wenling City by the East
China Sea, farmers built three seaside villas at their own
expense, which housed ten aquatic experts and technicians from
Zhejiang and the neighboring Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The village specializes in marine aquaculture, which last year
brought about an average income of over 2,000 yuan for the
villagers.
</P>
<P>
"It is all for the knowledge taught by the experts that we are
now able to live a good life," the villagers said, adding that
their fish and shrimp have not died from disease since the arrival
of the experts.
</P>
<P>
They said that they often went to the villas, sometimes in a
group of 40 to 50, to seek advices from the experts, whom they
called "mammoths of science and technology." One of the experts
has remained in the village for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
"The experts are all warm-hearted and very helpful," they
said. "Every time they went back to the homes in cities we started
to worry for our fish and shrimp."

<HEADLINE> Tourism Hikes up Economy in Taihang Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Increasing tourism is
becoming a catalyst for the economic take-off of the previously
underdeveloped Taihang Mountain areas in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
The natural beauty of the scenic Taihang Mountain remained
untapped for a long time. But China's opening up and economic
reform have triggered the development of tourism there.
</P>
<P>
To date, almost every county along the over 800-kilometer-long
Taihang Mountain Range in Hebei has formed a tourism zone,
allowing travelers the opportunity to view scenic peaks and caves.
</P>
<P>
Due to successful promotion, the Yesanpo Scenic Zone, which is
under state protection, has received more than 3.5 million
tourists, most of them from Beijing, Tianjin and Baoding. The zone
has brought jobs to 2,000 rural families in 20 villages.
</P>
<P>
The Zhangshiyan Scenic Area, also protected by the state, last
year earned one million yuan (120,480 US dollars) in tourism
income from the sale of entry tickets alone.
</P>
<P>
A karst cave discovered in 1988 in Lincheng County brought an
annual income of 1.7 million yuan from entry tickets the first
year it opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
Six counties are now pooling their resources to build a
5,000-square-kilometer forest park in the Taihang Mountain
area.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Reiterates China's Policy on Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese official Lu Ping
has reiterated here that Hong Kong's stability and prosperity will
be maintained after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty in
1997.
</P>
<P>
This message was conveyed to the Thai public by Lu Ping,
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council of China, at the headquarters of the Bangkok Bank Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
Addressing some 200 Thai government officials, businessmen,
journalists and scholars, Lu said that Hong Kong will enjoy a high
degree of autonomy and the Hong Kong people will be ruling Hong
Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Except for foreign and defense affairs, which will be handled
by the central government, everything will remain the same: the
legal system, the existing lifestyle, the currency, the economic
policies and so on, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of end of democracy in Hong Kong after
1997," Lu stressed. The Basic Law clearly stipulates that the pace
of democratization of elections in Hong Kong will be conducted in
a gradual and orderly way, with universal suffrage as its ultimate
aim, he said.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the Legislative Council, the progress should be
made from the zero base level of 1984 to a specified level by
2007, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The terms of office of the incumbent legislative council
members will end automatically in 1997, because the British side
unilaterally changed the system for the 1995 election in violation
of the Basic Law and related agreements reached between China and
Britain, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
On rule of law in Hong Kong after 1997, Lu said that the
Chinese government is well prepared to go through a smooth
transition in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
"After 1997, laws practiced in Hong Kong will be entirely
different from those practiced on the mainland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will rest on its own legislative power and laws
previously in force in Hong Kong, such as the Common Law, rules of
equity, ordinances, will be maintained, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong police will continue to carry out their duties
beyond 1997 and the current system of laws will continue beyond
1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said that because Hong Kong's legal and judiciary
systems are so different from those in China, there had to be
provisions in the Basic Law for the different systems to continue
after 1997.
</P>
<P>
China's top official in charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs
denied the rumors that there will be a major reshuffle of the
civil service in Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's civil servants are a very important component of
the success of Hong Kong and they are welcomed to stay and
continue to work for Hong Kong beyond 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing confidence in Hong Kong's future, Lu said: "the
rumor of massive exodus of people and capital again bears no
relationship to what is happening."
</P>
<P>
The most expensive piece of land sold in Hong Kong for more
than 500 million US dollars in March this year speaks for
investors' confidence in Hong Kong, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the total number and value of Hong Kong
residential properties purchased in 1995 increased by 30 percent
and 45 percent respectively over the corresponding period in 1994,
indicating Hong Kong people's confidence.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong people's nationality and permanent resident status
in future, Lu said that the current status should continue and
that individuals who have acquired a permanent resident status in
Hong Kong should be allowed to keep their status.
</P>
<P>
Lu arrived in Thailand last Saturday, the last leg of his
four-Asian-nation tour on a mission to brief the countries on
China's policy on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He earlier this month visited Japan, Singapore and Malaysia and
is scheduled to leave here for home Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reports US Provocative Activities in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran has lashed out at the United
States for locking two Iranian battleships with its radars and
creating nuisance to an Iranian helicopter in the Persian Gulf,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency published a letter by Iran's Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Kamal Kharrazi to the
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Iranian government, which was delivered on
Monday, listed U.S. violations against Iranian interests in the
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that between 11:30 and 11:45 hours on 27 January,
1996, the U.S. warship Grubkeiv 69GC at the position of seven
miles north of Abuzar oil platform locked its radar for an
Iranian battleship whose position was 2915n and 4927e for a period
of one minute.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the report said, the U.S. Aircraft PBF got
closer to the Iranian battleship Tabarzin and locked its radar
for a period of one minute.
</P>
<P>
It said "the U.S. government's actions of creating nuisances
and violating the airspace and territorial sea of Iran have been
a hindrance for the Islamic Republic of Iran's sea patrolling
aircraft and helicopters in performing their assigned duties."
</P>
<P>
"Such measures are nothing but a clear indication of the
violation of the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
With regard to other instances of American provocations, the
report cited the incident happening on February 8, 1996, when an
Iranian helicopter with registration Mark EP-HTK, in flight from
Frouzan oil platform to Bushehr, was forced to return to the
platform due to the frequent warnings and preventive measures of
U.S. warships.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities regard the presence of U.S. military
forces in the Persian Gulf as a grave threat to the security of
the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
They claim that Americans have no reason to attack Iran and the
Iranian army is able to crush any foreign threat.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Dadbin, Commander of the Ground Forces of the Iranian
Army, warned early this month "Iran's Ground Forces enjoy the
maximum standard of military preparedness to crush any foreign
incursion into Iran and nip any threat against the country's
territorial integrity in the bud."
</P>
<P>
He warned "Americans should think twice before attacking us. I
believe no country in the world would dare to attack us."
</P>
<P>
"Neither the international climate nor America's situation
allows it to seek adventurism against Iran for the time being,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Military Team in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A seven-man Rwandan military team
has been in Uganda on issues of influx of over 2,000 Tutsi
refugees from Zaire into Kisoro district in southwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"The New Vision" reported today that the team composed of
officers from the Rwandan Patriotic Front/ Army (RPF/A) arrived
in Kisoro on Sunday and visited Nyakabande camp, near Kisoro town
where the refugees had temporarily resettled after the Hutu
militia from refugee camp in Zaire drove them away.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials of the team refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, mainly from north Kivu province, began trekking
into Uganda last Thursday after their homes in Zaire were
attacked by suspected exiled Hutu militia and alleged Zairean and
former Rwandan troops.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Tutsi refugees are today to be transferred from
Nyakabande to a transit camp at Nyakabande airstrip, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan refugees had formerly settled in the camp from 1974 to
1994.
</P>
<P>
Haji Rutale, resident District Commissioner of Kisoro was
quoted as saying the International Committee of the Red Cross,
the World Food Program (WFP) and the United Nations' High

<HEADLINE> NZ Largest Airport Closes after Volcano Eruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Auckland Airport, the largest
in New Zealand, has closed because of ash fallout from Mt.
Ruapehu, which erupted Monday and today.
</P>
<P>
Airport company spokeswoman Susan Huria said the airport closed
from 5:40 p.m. today, and at this stage, she believes the airport
will not reopen at least until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The closure will affect both domestic and international
flights. Huria said she is unsure where flights which are due to
touch down in Auckland will be diverted to.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Civil Aviation Authority has ordered the closure
of all airports in the northern part of North Island, as the ash
fallout has reached as far as Kerikeri, 750 km north of the
volcano standing 2,797 meters above sea level on central North
Island.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NZ scientists said the eruption of Mt. Ruapehu is
not going to get bigger. But it is likely to remain at the same
level for a few more days.
</P>
<P>
Although there has been strong activity and the crater lake has
been destroyed, no lava has flowed from the volcano, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists have discovered a
large tomb in southwest China built during the Song Dynasty
(960-1279).
</P>
<P>
The tomb, located in Huaying City of Sichuan Province, belonged
to a senior official and his wife. It consists of six funeral
chambers that contain corpses together with several pieces of
silver, bronze and pottery.
</P>
<P>
The main chamber is 5.5 m by 3.5 m by 4.5 m, with a
five-meter-long entrance. The deceased in the tomb is An Bing, who
was a senior member of the highest military department of the
imperial court.
</P>
<P>
He also dealt with military and political affairs in
Sichuan. His deeds have been recorded in historical documents.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was accidentally discovered in February by
farmers. The excavation is still underway.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the State Relics Bureau said that the excavation
might lead to the most important archeological discovery of the
Song Dynasty this year, because of its unusual size and
state-of-the-art decorations.
</P>
<P>
The Song Dynasty represented one of the most important periods
in Chinese history because of its flourishing economy, science and
literature. The dynasty was buried by invaders from Mongolia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A six-month project to educate local
residents about the protection of cultural relics has been
launched in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The project will provide a detailed introduction of the
world-famous historical relics discovered on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, the highest plateau in the world with a total area of 2.3
million square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Among the historical relics in Tibet are the Potala Palace,
which is the largest and most renowned example of ancient
architecture in the region, the Johkang Temple, one of Tibet's
oldest buildings, as well as ancient castles, tomb groups and
frescos.
</P>
<P>
To capture the Tibetan people's interest and arouse their
concern, an exhibit will be held to feature the great
archeological discoveries there since the founding of new China in
1949, as well as to explain existing problems in renovation work.
</P>
<P>
There is a great need to spread general knowledge of relic
preservation throughout the public, especially those in rural
areas. Illustrated posters also will be published to educate
residents how to handle their discoveries of historical relics,
and how to sell antiquities collected at markets, as well as the
ethical principles people should obey when they restore ancient
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers, TV stations and broadcasting stations have
been involved in the project.

<P>
KUNMING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Xishuangbanna, a beautiful resort
on the border area in southwest China's Yunnan province, is
cooperating with neighboring countries to improve water and land
transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture borders on Laos and Myanmar, and has easy access
to southeast Asia through the Lancangjiang-Mekong River.
</P>
<P>
China has been harnessing the water courses of the Lancangjiang
River since the 1970s. The harnessing project is due to be
completed in 1998, which will allow ships of 200 to 300 DWT (dead
weight tonnage) to sail on the river all year.
</P>
<P>
With increasing cargo transport, Lancangjiang-Mekong River is
becoming a "golden waterway" connecting China to southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Xishuangbanna has cooperated with Laos and
Myanmar to build new roads in order to create a better environment
for bilateral economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
A highway from Phong Saly to Namtha in Laos, built in
cooperation with a Xishuangbanna company, was completed last
May. The highway will provide a smooth passage from Xishuangbanna
to the hinterlands of Laos, and then to Vietnam and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture is also helping build two highways in Myanmar,
which will provide better transport channels to Myanmar and then
to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Farmers Build Villas for Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in east China's Zhejiang
Province have built beautiful, cozy and comfortable villas for
experts who came from the cities to help them achieve prosperity.
</P>
<P>
At the entrance of the Lijiayang Village in Taizhou City in
southeastern Zhejiang, three villas are drawing the attention of
passersby. Each villa has glazed tiles on the roof and the walls,
and a large lawn in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
Every apartment in the villa has three rooms and a guest hall,
as well as all the modern facilities -- a telephone, a color TV,
an air conditioner, and a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
These villas belong to the Jili Group, a township enterprise
based in the village, which became successful through the
manufacture of refrigerator and motorcycle parts.
</P>
<P>
Luo Xiaoming, deputy general manager of the group, said that
since 1994, his group has built more than 150 elaborate apartments
for the experts from the cities, who either paid periodical visits
to or stayed in the village to provide technological consultation.
</P>
<P>
The "experts' villas," as they are called by the villagers, so
far have accommodated some 100 senior engineers and professors, he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
"We farmers know little about modern science and technology, so
the assistance of the experts is indispensable for our success in
running the factory," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect enthusiasm and creativity from a person if you
don't create a good environment for him to work and live in," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The value of the experts is not only perceived by the heads of
township enterprises, but also sensed by ordinary farmers who are
eager to improve themselves through science and technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's rubber production
reached 11,000 tons in the first five months this year, up 37.5
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Cambodian Rubber Department Teng Lao attributed
the increase to labor reforms and ideal weather conditions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the "Cambodia Daily" today said the rubber revenues
are not increasing at the same rate because of illegal exports to
Vietnam and theft of latex by local residents.
</P>
<P>
About five million U.S. dollars of the government's 1995 rubber
revenues were reinvested in the sector while another one million
earmarked for tax.
</P>
<P>
In order to further improve rubber production, the newspaper
said, at least three of all the six state-run rubber plantations
will be sold to companies from France, Malaysia and
Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> "Services for Lovers" the Rage in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Madame Xue and her husband prefer
to spend weekends at one of Shanghai's fine dining establishments,
the "Napolean Restaurant."
</P>
<P>
"We like the light music, delicious food and romantic and
loving atmosphere here," said the university teacher, who is in
her thirties.
</P>
<P>
In fact, restaurant owners are not the only business people who
are eager to cater to the interests of people in love in China's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
Business circles said that a new industry of "services for
lovers" has developed here and is expected to boom soon.
</P>
<P>
The New World Leather Company, which recently opened for
business, uses two stories of its department store to sell pairs
of matched bags, which draw an unending stream of customers.
</P>
<P>
Watches and clothes made for couples are on display all over
Shanghai these days. And owners of luxury cinemas never worry that
their expensive tickets will keep customers away, because they now
offer seats especially for lovers.
</P>
<P>
A new chocolate advertisement says that it is to be given "to
the dearest." It sells well in the market.
</P>
<P>
Photo studios who take wedding photos with artistic touches
have become a lucrative business. They not only attract young
newlyweds, but also many middle-aged and even elderly couples who
want to make up for what they missed in the past.
</P>
<P>
"We only took simple black and white photos when we married
thirty years ago," a woman explained.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that services for lovers are no more than a
means of marketing used by business people. But to some extent,
they have helped strengthen happy family ties and promote and
improve emotional understanding between couples and lovers.
</P>
<P>
The new trends reflect the Shanghai people's aspiration for
romance and affection in an increasingly industrialized and
commercialized society, they said.

<HEADLINE> Girl Doing Well After Ankle Joint Transplantation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A seven-year-old girl who
sustained critical injuries in a traffic accident had emergency
surgery to transplant her right ankle and foot to her knee.
</P>
<P>
The operation at the No. 6 People's Hospital was reportedly
successful and the wound is healing well. Doctors said the ruddy
skin tone around her knee indicates the transplanted limb is in
good condition.
</P>
<P>
The girl, Fang Xiao, was run over by a car June 1st. The
vehicle's wheels smashed her right knee joint and lower leg, but
the right ankle and foot remained intact, according to today's
"Wenhui Daily."
</P>
<P>
When she arrived at the hospital, the surgeon on duty suggested
the crushed parts of her leg be amputated.
</P>
<P>
But professor Zeng Bingfang, head of the orthopedics
department, chose to perform a transplant to connect the ankle
joint and foot to the upper leg -- at a 180 degree turn, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the transplant, the first of its kind in the
world, will make it much easier for the girl to walk with an
artificial limb.
</P>
<P>
The complicated seven-hour surgery, which involved microsurgery
for the replantation of the severed limb, has proved successful,
according to the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in harnessing
ten percent of its desert lands, the "People's Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Trees covering a total of 10 million ha have been planted in
the northeastern, northern and northwestern areas to relieve the
damage caused by sandy storms.
</P>
<P>
Forest coverage in these areas has been raised from five
percent in 1970s to the current nine percent, and accordingly, 11
million ha of farmland have been saved from sand damage.
</P>
<P>
China is a country facing severe threat of desertification,
which causes losses of 5.4 million yuan. In addition, calamities
such as drought and sand storms occur frequently.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, China began its efforts to discover methods that
would harness the desert areas. In the 1990s, the control of
deserts has become part of the overall program for national social
and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the Chinese have developed more than 100
successful techniques to curb desertification, such as aerial
sowing, setting up sand barriers, planting trees in deep holes,
and cultivating plant species fit for growth in the desert.

<HEADLINE> U.S. ValuJet Airlines Suspends Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ValuJet Airlines agreed to
suspend its flights at midnight Monday after a federal inspection
found "several serious deficiencies" in its operations, said a
senior official from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
</P>
<P>
"We asked them to cease operations and they agreed to do so,"
FAA chief David Hinson said.
</P>
<P>
However, the airlines called the action "grossly unfair"
because it was unable to respond to the FAA concerns raised during
an intensive 30-day investigation and it said that it hoped to
resume service within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The FAA's investigation was launched after the airlines' Flight
592 crashed in the Florida Everglades on May 11 that killed all
110 people on board.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
But the authorities suspect that the oxygen canisters on board
may have caught fire and brought the plane down.
</P>
<P>
According to Hinson, ValuJet had failed to establish the
airworthiness on some of its airplanes. It has system-wide
deficiencies in maintenance program and lacks engineering
capability.
</P>
<P>
"The agency's 30-day intensive inspection found several serious
deficiencies in ValuJet's operations," said Hinson, adding that
the airlines will halt flights until it can demonstrate
"appropriate corrective action."
</P>
<P>
ValuJet started operations in October 1993, offering discount
fares that attracted passengers from the major carriers.
</P>
<P>
Within two years, it has extended its services to 31 cities in
19 states. Its aircraft fleet grew to more than 50 planes, but
with an average age of 25 years.

BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Central government departments in
China have started a campaign to dismiss unqualified public
servants in order to maintain a high-quality group of public

dismissed to date. They include section chiefs and deputy heads of
sections, newly-recruited college graduates and post-graduates.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "China Youth Daily," some of these public
servants were dismissed for abusing their rights to gain personal
profit, or violating disciplines of public servants; some were
found performing their duties incompetently, or taking a leisurely
attitude toward their work.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Statistics showed mixed
development in different sectors of Nepal's economy during the
past 10 months, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Monetary restraint had been maintained during the first 10
months of the 1995-96 fiscal year while price pressure on food and
beverage led to some acceleration in inflation rate, Nepal Rastra
Bank said in a press release published Monday.
</P>
<P>
Exports continued to pick up during the period while import
growth declined somewhat, leading to deceleration in the growth of
trade deficit, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
In the monetary sector, it said that money supply increased by
12.3 percent during the 10-month period, compared with 20.5
percent in the same period last pear.
</P>
<P>
Price index was up 9.1 percent in mid-May 1996, compared with
6.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Higher growth in expenditure led the fiscal deficit to rise
95.9 percent to 5.9 billion rupees (over 100 million US dollars)

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Ready for Repolling in 27 Constituencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is ready for repolling
Wednesday in 122 polling centers of 27 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The country held its seventh parliamentary elections on June
12. Although the Election Commission (EC) has announced the
results of 273 constituencies, 27 constituencies have to conduct
repolling because the voting there on June 12 was suspended due to
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Fresh ballots and other necessary papers for the repolling have
been sent to the concerned districts, sources said, adding that
manpower would be increased manifold in each center for
maintaining law and order in Wednesday's repolling.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the police and other para-military law-enforcing
agencies, army personnel will also discharge their sacred duties,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
With the stage set for repolling, Chief Election Commissioner
Abu Hena Monday night urged all citizens to be on maximum alert so
that no untoward incident takes place during the voting.
</P>
<P>
"Only cooperation from people can ensure security in the
polling centers," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Zyuganov Gear up for Presidential Runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The top two runners in Sunday's
first round Russian presidential election, President Boris Yeltsin
and his archrival Gennady Zyuganov, are busy wooing their
unsuccessful opponents ready for a cliffhanger second round next
month.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results released today by the Central Electoral
Commission gave Yeltsin first place among all 10 presidential
candidates with 34.82 percent of the vote counted. He was trailed
closely by his main challenger, communist leader Zyuganov, with
32.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's election law, a runoff will take place between
the two frontrunners within 15 days after the announcement of the
official poll outcome because no one has won more than half of the
votes cast in the first round. The candidate with the highest of
number of votes in the runoff will become the new head of the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the defeated candidates and voters absent in the
first round will decide the fate of Yeltsin and Zyuganov, who
both fully mobilized their own supporters in the first round,
analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout in Sunday's poll was 70 percent of the more than
100 million eligible voters nationwide. The remaining 30 percent
will be a strong and possibly decisive force in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Among the eight defeated candidates, retired general Alexander
Lebed, economist Grigory Yavlinsky and Liberal Democratic leader
Vladimir Zhirinovsky will be crucial to both Yeltsin and Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Lebed came in a surprising third place in Sunday's polls with
14.71 percent of the ballot, leaving both Yavlinsky and
Zhirinovsky far behind with 7.4 percent and 5.94 percent
respectively. The other five candidates failed to pass the
one-percent hurdle.
</P>
<P>
Several hours after a televised speech to the nation for more
support in the second round, Yeltsin held talks with Lebed in the
Kremlin on possible cooperation in the second round. Yeltsin aides
said he also plans to meet with Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yeltsin was trying to set a runoff date in his
favor. In a bill tabled to the State Duma (lower house of
parliament) today, he proposed declaring July 3, a Wednesday, a
public holiday for the runoff.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the proposed date was helpful to Yeltsin whose
supporters in urban areas may take a holiday rather than take part
in the runoff in a country where elections are traditionally held
on Sundays. But the bill is very likely to die in the Duma, where
the Communists and their allies enjoy a majority.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov, in a joint appeal to Lebed, Yavlinsky and
Zhirinovsky, promised to form a government people can trust, which
represents the interests of people from all social classes, if
elected as the new boss of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Lebed and Yavlinsky will probably join Yeltsin's
camp, with Zhirinovsky siding with Zyuganov in the second
round. But they cautioned that the runoff remains uncertain even
if the three power brokers choose sides now, because it's unclear
whether they can influence their supporters.

WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) --The International Finance Corp.
(IFC) has signed a 250 million U.S. dollars financing package for
Venezuela's largest telecom company, Compania Anonima Nacional
Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV).
</P>
<P>
CANTV is Venezuela's national and international
telecommunications carrier, which was partly privatized in 1991
when a 40 percent shareholding, with management control, was sold
to a consortium led by GTE Corporation USA with 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, CANTV spent some 2.3 billion dollars in
modernization and expansion as part of a 9-year program projected
to cost a total of 4.2 billion dollars. By the end of last year,
the company had enlarged its network by 50 percent to about 2.46
million lines in service.
</P>
<P>
The proposed IFC financing will support its expansion and
modernization program for 1996 and 1997, which has a total cost of
620 million dollars and includes installation of 658,600 new
digital telephone lines, 12,700 new public telephones, expansion
of the cellular telephone network, and other improvements.
</P>
<P>
The IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, and the largest
multilateral source of equity and loan financing for private
sector projects in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> ICBC To Handle Loans for Ling'ao Nuclear Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) and the State Development Bank (SDB) signed an
agreement here Monday which will allow ICBC to be SDB's agent in
handling a huge sum of foreign exchange loans for the Guangdong
Ling'ao Nuclear Power Station.
</P>
<P>
The Ling'ao Nuclear Power Station, to be the second largest
nuclear plant in Guangdong when completed, will have a total
investment of 4.5 billion dollars, of which 4.1 billion will come
from foreign funds, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
SDB will be responsible for raising the 4.1 billion dollars
from abroad to import major equipment for the nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
However, SDB is just a policy-oriented bank, and does not have
subsidiaries to handle the loans directly for China's major state
projects.
</P>
<P>
Domestic banks competed for the right to handle the foreign
funds, and ICBC won. ICBC will also be responsible for providing
working capital loans for the project.
</P>
<P>
Xie Duyang, vice-president of ICBC, promised that his bank will
provide high-quality, full banking services for the nuclear
project, and expressed his wish to further cooperate with SDB in
future.
</P>
<P>
Before power plant agreement was made, ICBC has been entrusted
by SDB to handle its loans totalling 7.03 billion yuan (846.9
million dollars) for 350 state projects.

<HEADLINE> Council of Europe Meet on Migration in Warsaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from 39 Council of
Europe (CE) countries met in Warsaw monday to tackle the issue of
migrants and their integration in society.
</P>
<P>
The two-day CE conference, the first of its kind to be held in
Central and Eastern Europe, aims to regulate movements of migrants
and to help Central and Eastern European countries to adapt their
immigration policies to CE standards.
</P>
<P>
"Zero migration is not a realistic goal...in a free and
democratic Europe," Daniel Tarschys, the Council's Swedish
secretary general, told the sixth conference of European ministers
responsible for migration affairs.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of foreigners arriving and settling in
Central and Eastern European countries is comparably smaller, the
problem of their relations with society in the country of
settlement is increasingly significant, Polish Interior Minister
Zbigniew Siemiatkowski said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the key to solve the problem is to draw
experience from the West and to cooperate with Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Poland has traditionally provided emigrants but now has
growing numbers wanting to settle on its territory, notably from
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the CE show that in 1994, immigrants accounted for
18.6 percent of Switzerland's population, followed by Belgium with
10 percent and Austria with 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In West European countries, Germany had the largest number of
immigrants, totaling 6.8 million and accounting for 8.6 percent of
its population.

<HEADLINE> More Ocean Disasters Forecasted This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- More oceanic natural disasters are
expected to hit areas of coastal southeast China this year,
potentially making 1996 a year of severe oceanic disaster, experts
have warned.
</P>
<P>
And the damage likely to be caused may be much more serious
this year than last year, according to a report from the
Beijing-based China Ocean News over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
There have been signs of more such calamities occurring in
western parts of the Pacific Ocean as the usually warmer sea
temperature east of the equator has been dropping while
sub-tropical high pressure over the Northwest Pacific is predicted
to be weaker this year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, this summer and autumn, typhoons, tropical storms
and other oceanic disasters are likely to bring severe damage to
some coastal areas in the eastern Guangdong, Zhejiang and Fujian
provinces, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Storm tides were also predicted in the Bohai and Laizhou bays,
they said, adding that the number of days with destructive waves
of above four meters high will be more than in 1995. Huge waves or
fierce breakers are quite likely to affect parts of the Taiwan
Straits and the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The experts urged coastal authorities to prepare for
damage-limitation measures since considerable destruction has been
caused by oceanic disasters in China's prosperous coastal areas in
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, nine tropical cyclones hit China's coastal regions,
leading to serious economic losses in Guangdong Province and the
Gugangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain accompanying the storms claimed the lives of
200 people, damaged or destroyed more than 700,000 houses,
inundated over two million ha of farmland and left direct economic
lossed of more than 15 billion yuan (about 1,807 million US
dollars), according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
To provide more accurate forecasting of such disasters, the
State Oceanic Forecast Observatory has intensified its monitoring
effects by using some of the world's most advanced forecasting
services and by ensuring prompt data-processing and transmitting.
</P>
<P>
The observatory has appealed to local authorities to raise
their awareness of the increasing threat posed by such disasters
and urged them to try every means to minimize the risks by working
out prompt counter-measures.

<P>
DHAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Awami (people's) League (AL),
the leading party in Bangladesh's seventh parliamentary elections
held on June 12, has prepared a list of leaders who are likely to
get berths in the new cabinet, AL sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to official results of the poll announced by the
Election Commission, the AL has won 134 out of the 273
poll-completed constituencies, its arch rival, the ex-ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), won 104 seats, the Jatiya
Party (JP) won 29 seats and some other small parties and an
independent candidate got the remaining 6 seats. Repolling in the
other 27 constituencies is scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With the support of JP's 29 seats, a lone seat of a smaller
party and that of an independent member, the AL's total strength
has already reached 165, which is more than the 151 seats required
for an absolute majority in the parliament to form the new
cabinet, an AL leader said.
</P>
<P>
The JP Monday formally wrote to President Abdur Rahman Biswas,
requesting him to invite the AL to form the government.
</P>
<P>
The AL leader said: "We are now awaiting the President's call
to form government. We believe the President will invite us to do
so."
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, President Biswas told some Western envoys in
Dhaka that he would spare not a moment to install the new
government in accordance with the constitution as soon as the
election process is completed.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Parliament Secretariat disclosed that
after gazette notification of the results of parliamentary polls
of 273 seats, the secretariat has started the process of
organizing the oath taking of the new members of the parliament,
which will be held on June 22 and 23.
</P>
<P>
A new cabinet headed by AL chief Sheikh Hasina is likely to
take oath on June 24, a senior AL presidium member said, adding
that the AL is planning to form a 25-member cabinet and the size
of the cabinet will be expanded later.

<HEADLINE> Austrain, Belgium PMs Urge Britain to Call Off Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Prime Minister Franz
Vranitzky today called on Britain to abandon its non-cooperation
policy with the EU over "mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
During talks with his Belgian counterpart, Jean-Luc Dehaene
today on the agenda of the upcoming EU summit in Italy, he said
Britain should call off its strategy of blocking EU decisions and
instead keep talking to the EU to try and solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Britain has withdrawn cooperation from EU decision-making over
a EU-imposed worldwide ban on exports of British beef following
revelations of a possible link between "mad cow" disease, or BSE,
and its human equivalent CJD, a fatal brain disease.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said that the European Union (EU) summit on June
21-22 in Florence, Italy, should focus on issues such as boosting
employment, the progress in establishing a monetary union, an
agreement on a common exchange rate, a common European security
policy and the expansion of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene said good bilateral relations between EU members are of
vital importance to the development of the EU and Europe.
</P>
<P>
British beef is a health problem not a political problem and
Britain should rely on the EU to solve the problem, instead of
imposing a non-cooperation policy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the "European forum" sponsored by the Austrian
Foreign Ministry Sunday, Dehaene, who is on a two-day visit,
elaborated on Belgium's policies on the EU and the integration of
Europe.

<P>
HELSINKI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 500 scientists from 48
countries got together for the first time to find ways of
improving global cooperation and service to the public.
</P>
<P>
During the first World Conference on Science Centers, which
ended today in Vantaa, a city close to the capital, they discussed
how to use science centers as a tool of social education and how
to show their high-tech achievements to the public.

<HEADLINE> Thai Navy Freezes Submarine Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai navy has suspended its
plan to procure two diesel-powered attack submarines after Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-archa convinced the naval chief that the
government did not have the budget to finance the purchase.
</P>
<P>
Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Orajet Siridej had informed his
subordinates of the decision to defer the purchase of submarines,
at least for the time being, an informed navy source was quoted
today by local newspaper Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The navy had revised its proposal, agreeing to settle for just
one submarine with a five-year tied-over fund of 7.5 billion baht
(300 million US dollars) after its earlier plan to procure
simultaneously two attack submarines worth 17 billion baht (680
million US dollars) over a seven-year period was rejected by the
Budget Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Navy Chief of Staff Vinai Intarasombat, meanwhile, confirmed
the report, saying the navy realized that financing for the
project was not possible under the current budgetary constraints.
</P>
<P>
The navy has maintained the acquisition of submarines was vital
to national security.

<HEADLINE> Argentinians Protest Planned Nuclear Waste Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- About 1,300 people took part
in a march in southern Argentina today to protest against the
building of a nuclear waste facility in the region.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, including provincial and national
legislators, traveled on foot and in more than 100 cars from
Trelew, Puerto Madryn and other cities to the town of Gastre in
southern Chubut province. Gastre is 450 kilometers from Trelew.
</P>
<P>
The march was organized by the Chubutan Antinuclear Movement
and the Chubut Students Committee with the support of
environmental organizations and provincial and national officials.
</P>
<P>
Last week, some 4,000 people in various cities in Chubut
demonstrated against a ruling by parliamentary committee that the
nuclear waste facility should be sited in Gastre on Argentina's
undeveloped Patagonian plateau.
</P>
<P>
Chubut Governor Carlos Maestro, who joined the march, and
several legislators have said that they will urge the Chamber of
Deputies to revoke the ruling when it comes up for debate on June
19.
</P>
<P>
But asked about the demonstrations by local reporters,
Environment Minister Maria Julia Alsogaray said that the
government had not drafted a bill on putting the nuclear waste
disposal unit in Gastre.
</P>
<P>
"There are studies underway but there are no bills," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Almost a quarter of cars on the
roads in China are privately owned.
</P>
<P>
The number of cars owned by individuals in China has exceeded
2.5 million, accounting for 23.8 percent of the country's auto
ownership.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts have predicted that individuals will gradually
replace government institutions and enterprises as the mainstay of
auto buyers.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that purchase of cars by individuals
recorded a fast growth since 1992, with an average annual increase
of 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
To date 80 percent of the medium-sized auto vehicles and over half
of small cars are being sold to individuals.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Ministry of Machine Building Industry
urged auto manufacturers to turn out more cars with low prices, low
fuel consumption, and multi-purpose vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Trying to Trace 12,000 Missing Persons in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) is trying to trace more than 12,000 people
reported missing during the war in Bosnia with a public campaign
appealing for information on their fate.
</P>
<P>
"The ICRC has collected over 12,000 substantiated individual
tracing requests, and is trying to get information on these
missing persons so as to provide their families with definite
answers with regards to their fate," France Hurtubise, press
officer with the ICRC's Belgrade office, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
So far, little progress has been made as the former warring
parties in Bosnia were not cooperating with the ICRC, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe most information lies within the party factions in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but they are slow in opening their files," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement, the parties are obliged to
provide information to the ICRC, which has been entrusted with the
task of collecting all relevant information on the missing persons.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC estimates that the number of missing persons in Bosnia
could be as many as 20,000, most of whom might be reasonably
assumed to be dead, Hurtubise said.
</P>
<P>
But she also blamed relatives for not informing the ICRC when
the missing person turned up.
</P>
<P>
"Someone who has been reported missing would have returned to
his hometown but has not informed the ICRC about his return. The
wife is so happy to see her husband come back that she does not
think of canceling the missing request," and the man is still
listed as missing, Hurtubise said.
</P>
<P>
Others listed as missing might still be alive but were in
hiding.
</P>
<P>
"With this campaign, we hope people will inform us that they
are not missing any more," the ICRC official said.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, which started on June 12 and will last at
least two years, the list of names will be distributed to ICRC
offices throughout the former Yugoslavia and countries which have
received refugees from the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC is also posting the names on the Internet to reach as
wide a readership as possible. In Bosnia, local radio and
television networks will broadcast "missing persons" bulletins.
</P>
<P>
But as the issue was highly political and many factors could
affect the tracing, obtaining complete information "is a very,
very long, complicated and painful process and a lot of work has
to be done," Hurtubise added.
</P>
<P>
She said missing persons also presented social and legal
problems for their families.
</P>
<P>
"Until there is definite proof that her missing husband is
dead, a woman would believe or hope that he is still alive. Before
there is a clear answer about the fate of the missing persons,
their spouses cannot get married again or inherit the property,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"Families have the right to know what happened to their
relatives. Without such answers, peace and reconciliation might be
difficult to achieve," she added.
</P>
<P>
To speed the process, an ICRC-chaired Working Group on Missing
Persons was set up in March in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The group, which meets once a month, is composed of officials
from the office of the High Representative, who is the chief
civilian administrator of the Dayton accord, the three ethnic
parties in Bosnia, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in
the Former Yugoslavia, the NATO peace Implementation Force (IFOR),
and representatives of the missing persons.
</P>
<P>
So far, the group has managed to ascertain the fate of some 500
missing persons, mainly from information provided by the former
warring parties in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Urged to Curb Sea Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's third largest municipality
has been urged to take more effective measures to control its
offshore sea water pollution, according to "China Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
An environment inspection team sent by the National People's
Congress Standing Committee, China's highest legislative body,
urged Tianjin to implement regulations concerning pollution
control and prevention in the city's main drainage channels into
the Bohai Bay as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, a leading industrial city and busy port of north
China, has discharged more than 1.1 billion tons of waste water to
the sea.
</P>
<P>
"This discharge has already exceeded the capacity of the sea
area near Tianjin, which has been polluted mainly by overly
nutrient-rich water resulting in the occasional red tides which
have occurred in recent years," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Because the city is situated in the inner section of the Bohai
Bay, it is not easy for sea water to move rapidly away from the
coast, and thus natural cleaning process of sea water is
relatively weak.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhenhuai, leader of the inspection team, told the
municipal government that the treatment of industrial waste water
and household sewage should be improved to reach state standard
and that the total quantity of waste water discharged into the
city's sea area should be properly controlled.
</P>
<P>
Existing dams and dykes may also need to be strengthened along
the city's coastline, he said.
</P>
<P>
Offshore oil exploitation and pollution from shipping should be
carefully monitored and emergency systems to cope with possible
pollution accidents should be set up as soon as possible, Yang
urged.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hardly Changed Against Yen in Early Tokyo Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar was hardly changed
against the yen in Tokyo early Tuesday from its level in New York
late the previous day, due to the absence of market-moving factors.
</P>
<P>
Traders said they expect the dollar to remain in a narrow range
during the day, the Kyodo news service reported.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was traded at 109.05-08 yen at 0900 a.m. (local
time), almost unchanged from late Monday's quote of 109.00-10 yen
in New York, but slightly up from 108.80-90 yen in London late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was traded at 108.98-109.00 yen at 0500
p.m. (local time) in Tokyo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In New York on Monday, the German mark was bought against the
dollar on the news that Russian President Boris Yeltsin was
maintaining a narrow lead over his rival Gennady Zyuganov in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
However, the strength of the mark against the dollar had little
influence on dollar-yen trading, traders was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
They said Tokyo market participants generally retreated to the
sidelines amid a lack of fresh incentives.

<HEADLINE> Rural Beijing Uses Biological Preparation in Pest Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Vegetables produced in suburban
Beijing have higher hygienic standards than before, thanks to the
use of biological preparation in pest control.
</P>
<P>
A survey by Beijing Municipal Agricultural Bureau on nine
varieties of vegetables, including tomatoes, cucumbers and
cabbage, shows that no organic chlorine or phosphorus are found on
their leaves, and the residue of mercury, cadmium and other heavy
metals all are lower than the state-set standard.
</P>
<P>
To protect the environment, Beijing forbid the use of organic
chlorine and other organic chemical elements in pest control in
the 1980s. Farmers were encouraged to use biological preparation
instead of pesticide to prevent vegetable and plant diseases.
</P>
<P>
Trichogrammas have been widely used to prevent corn borers in
suburban Beijing since the early 1970s. The city also set up
factories to breed trichogrammas in the counties of Miyun and
Shunyi.
</P>
<P>
Trichogrammas have also been used to kill bollworms,
defoliators and other plant pests.
</P>
<P>
To protect drinking water quality in this Chinese capital,
industrial plants for producing biological preparation have been
established in Miyun, Tongxian and Changping counties in suburban
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At present, biological preparation has been used for the
prevention and cure of more than 30 kinds of vegetable and plant
pests and diseases.
</P>
<P>
The pest control is carried out on an area of over 33,000
hectares annually, and saves 15 tons of chemical pesticide.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The price of OPEC oil continued its
gradual recovery last week, edging up to 18.30 U.S. dollars a
barrel from 18.14 dollars at the beginning of June, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced
today.
</P>
<P>
But that's still less than the oil cartel's benchmark price of
21 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The price of OPEC oil price dropped more than two dollars from
20.24 dollars a barrel in April on the prospect of the return of
Iraqi oil to the export market following its oil-for-food deal
with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A limited lifting of sanctions in place since the Gulf War in
1991 will allow Iraq to export some 800,000 barrels of oil a day
in July and August to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices had been rising since the end of 1995, when prices
were some 16.49 dollars a barrel, partly due to strong Asian
demand, which had helped soak up over-production by OPEC members,
and low oil stocks by major consumers.
</P>
<P>
But the return of Iraqi oil should be enough to tip the world
market into oversupply in the second half year, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
That extra production, together with quota violations within OPEC
is likely to drive production some 1.4 million barrels a day over
the oil cartel's self-imposed ceiling of 24.5 million barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
Although the trend of rising demand from Asia is expected to go
on in the second half of this year, it will be outpaced by
increased supply, say oil analysts.
</P>
<P>
The situation will be exacerbated by rising output from oil
producers outside OPEC.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Stimulant Exhibition Opens in Vienna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- With the '96 Atlanta Olympics
around the corner, an exhibition opened here today aimed at
combating the use of stimulants by youngsters and athletes.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, President of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) Juan Antonio Samaranch and
Giorgio Giacomelli, executive director of the UN Drug Control
Program attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The battle against stimulant use began at the 19th Olympics in
in Mexico City in 1968 and has made considerable progress since
the '88 Seoul Olympics, said Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
But the IOC has not yet won the war and stimulant use still
exists among athletes and the most advanced techniques will be
used to weed out abusers during medical tests in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said young people sometimes take stimulants to escape
unemployment or family troubles. "We must offer them other
choices, and among them sport is the most important one," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will move on to New York and Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Summit Not to Be Fruitful: Former French PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Former French Prime Minister and
current Mayor of Lyon Raymond Barre said here today that the
coming G-7 Summit will not "make a significant commitment for the
future."
</P>
<P>
The G-7 Summit, set to be held between June 27 and 29 in Lyon,
France, is only a regular annual meeting, and "will not have
instant results," Barre said at the News Club in Lyon.
</P>
<P>
The Group, which is made up of seven most developed
industrialized countries -- the United States, Japan, Britain,
Germany, France, Italy and Canada, holds a summit every year to
discuss major political and economic issues in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the former French prime minister, the only result
of this year's Summit is to change it into a G-8 body which will
include Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is now in the presidential
election campaign, will attend the summit from the afternoon of
June 28 to participate in talks on some issues, instead of merely
appearing in the closing dinner last year, said Barre.
</P>
<P>
"Who knows whether it is good or bad for Yeltsin," the mayor of
Lyon added.
</P>
<P>
As the mayor of Lyon, Raymond Barre welcomed the G-7 Summit to
be held in Lyon, which will be beneficial to the city's economic
development.

<HEADLINE> National Meeting to Be Held on Improving Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China will probe ways to beef up
its environmental protection law enforcement at a national
conference to be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, said the meeting, the fourth since 1949 when the
People's Republic of China was founded, will discuss ways to
implement environmental protection laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is part of the country's efforts to limit, by the
year 2000, its annual discharge of 12 major pollutants below that
of 1995, the director said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 years, China's gross national product (GNP) has
grown by ten percent each year, but has avoided a deterioration in
the environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xie stressed that the fulfillment of China's five-year and
15-year environmental protection goals will be an arduous task.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the country's environmental pollution and
degrading eco-system has produced a serious situation, because of
China's huge population (1.2 billion), rapid economic growth,
low-level production technology and poor management and waste of
resources.
</P>
<P>
China has taken a number of measures to curb environmental
pollution, such as improving the efficiency of resources, closing
polluting plants and introducing clean production technology.

policy-oriented banks established in 1994, has arranged for one
billion yuan in special loans for summer harvesting.
</P>

traffic scheme, the unified vehicular volume reduction program, in
an attempt to reduce the traffic congestion during the rush hours
in the Philippine capital.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme involving all streets in Manila, all public
and private vehicles will be banned from the roads in Metro Manila
from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday depending on the last
digit of their plate numbers.
</P>
<P>
The scheme bans public and private vehicles, including
motorcycles and tricycles, with plate numbers ending in 1 and 2 on
Mondays, 3 and 4 on Tuesdays 5 and 6 on Wednesdays, 7 and 8 on
Thursdays and 9 and 0 on Fridays. Saturdays and Sundays are
excluded.

<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Under a restructuring plan,
China's 13 national orchestras, ballet companies and Peking Opera
theaters will be consolidated into 10 ensembles, cutting both the
number of companies and of contracted artists.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "China Daily", the government
restructuring plan aims at improving financial efficiency and
introduce competition on China's performing arts groups.
</P>
<P>
For decades, members of these troupes have enjoyed life-long
tenure once admitted. The result has been too many full-time,
salaried members and too many troupes for the government to
support.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, artists in these State-supported troupes and
theaters have few chances to perform, leading to a decline in
artistic standards.
</P>
<P>
At a working conference yesterday in Beijing, Ai Qingchun,
vice-minister of the Culture said that the 77 positions of the
newly rebuilt China Symphony Orchestra have attracted 217
applicants, including eight overseas Chinese artists from the
United States, Britain, Switzerland and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Australian Coalition Government's Support Rate Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's coalition government
saw its supporting rate dropped sharply in the last three weeks,
though it was still enjoying a comfortable lead over the
opposition Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The results of Newspoll conducted last weekend showed the
coalition Government enjoyed the support of 48 percent of voters,
down seven percentage points from the 55 percent three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
In the same time, Labor improved its supporting rate to 40
percent from 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
The coalition's eight-percentage-point lead over Labor was just
the same as what it achieved on the election day of March 2, but
it was more than halved from the record levels in the three months
after the election.
</P>
<P>
The government enjoyed an average lead of 19 percentage points
in the three months since March 2.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister John Howard still stands out as the
better prime ministry in comparison with Labor leader Kim Beazley.
Some 52 percent of voters thought that Howard was better than
Beazley as the prime minister, while 22 percent thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The Australian newspaper said that the coalition government's
honeymoon was nearing its end. The Newspoll showed that Howard's
satisfaction rate dropped seven percent to 53 percent, while his
dissatisfaction rate rose the same amount to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though the coalition government still enjoyed strong support of
voters, its move to cut education budget and force state
governments to increase taxes brought it down from the support
levels seldom enjoyed by any federal government in the country's
history.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia: Florence Meeting Helps Strengthen Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government said
today the Florence conference assessing the implementation of the
Dayton agreement over the past six months represented a further
contribution to the strengthening and affirmation of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Adopting a report on a Yugoslav delegation's participation in
the conference on June 13-14, the government stressed the
importance of the implementation of the Dayton agreement,
especially of holding free elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina in
September and securing freedom of movement and return of refugees,
the Information Secretariat said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The government has instructed the Foreign Ministry to continue
its diplomatic activities aimed at promoting peace process and
normalizing relations with the former Yugoslav republics, it said.
</P>
<P>
The office of Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic also said
today that intensive activities aimed at normalizing the
Yugoslav-EU relations should continue and instructed the Foreign
Ministry to set up a inter-departmental group to work on this
issue, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Adopting a report by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic on talks with a EU delegation in Belgrade on June 7-8,
the Yugoslav described the talks as very successful.
</P>
<P>
At the talks with the EU delegation, headed by Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini, the two sides agreeed on further
activities in the implementation of the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted the Yugoslav delegation as saying that the
EU platform on strengthening regional cooperation and good
neighborly relations in the former Yugoslavia was based on the
principles of equal treatment of Yugoslavia in comparison with the
former Yugoslav republics.
</P>
<P>
After four years of isolation, Yugoslavia has been trying to
normalize relations with major world organizations so as to be
reintegrated into the international community. It has been
recognized by many European countries but has yet to be readmitted
into the United Nations and the key international financial
institutions.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, KEDO Sign Transportation, Communications protocols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led Korean Peninsula
Energy Development Organization (KEDO) and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) have reached an agreement on protocols
for transportation and communication related to building two
light-water reactors in DPRK, a spokesman for the KEDO said today.
</P>
<P>
The accord was the result of the talks between DPRK and KEDO
which began on April 16 in New York, consortium spokesman Jason
Shaplen told reporters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The deal was part of a nuclear framework agreement between
Washington and Pyongyang on freezing DPRK's current nuclear
development program in exchange for two light-water reactors
provided by the United States. The light-water reactors are
considered to be less suitable for producing plutonium for nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
In May, KEDO, which represents the U.S., Japanese and South
Korean governments, and DPRK reached agreement on the text of a
protocol on the juridical status, privileges, immunities and
consular protection for KEDO in DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Shaplen disclosed that the protocols on the transportation and
communications of KEDO in DPRK had been initialed and would be
signed "in the near future."
</P>
<P>
The agreement on protocols is believed to a sign of the smooth
implementation of the nuclear framework agreement signed in 1994
after nearly three years of difficult negotiations between the
U.S. and DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Women Demand Truth About Missing Serbs in Banja Luka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 women today protested in
Banja Luka to draw the international community's attention to the
slow resolution of the issue of the large number of imprisoned and
missing Serb soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The mothers and wifes blocked the regional office of the
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in northwestern Bosnia to show
their resentment to the eight-month uncertainty about the fate of
1,150 missing Serb soldiers and 805 civilians following last
year's Muslim-Croat offensive in northwestern Bosnian.
</P>
<P>
The women said they would continue the blockade the OSCE office
on Tuesday, according to Tanjug news agency report.
</P>
<P>
Mothers and wives of the imprisoned Serb fighters appealed to
the international community to exert pressure on all the three
sides in the Bosnian conflict to release all imprisoned persons
and to learn the truth about the number of killed soldiers and
where they were buried.
</P>
<P>
The acting head of the OSCE office Ronald Dreyer told the
demonstrators that Russian ambassador from Sarajevo Vladimir
Ivanov was in Banja Luka to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The assembly of the association of families of imprisoned and
missing Serb soldiers and civilians said that the international
community has not carried out the provisions of the Dayton
agreement to release all prisoners of war by January 19 as some
Serbs were still detained by the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
The association also charged the ICRC for biased treatment on
listing missing persons in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the list of 11,000 missing persons compiled by
the International Committee of the Red Cross includes only 350
persons from Republika Srpska supports the claim that the
international community does not eqaully treat all parties in the
conflict," Tanjug quoted the association as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC has recently launched a campaign to collect
information about the 11,000 missing persons in the war in Bosnia,
most of whom were believed to be dead.

NEW YORK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Stocks were mostly lower today in
dull trading, but the Dow Jones industrial average managed a rise
of 3.33 points to close at 5,652.78, finishing a five-session
losing record.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,094 up, 1,215 down and 828
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 298.32 million shares, sharply down from
385.94 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.28 to 356.92, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.68 to 665.17.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.98 to 1,208.20, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 3.32 to 590.53.
</P>
<P>
In the bond market, interest rates were hardly changed until
mid-afternoon, when the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond edged
lower to 7.06 percent from late Friday's 7.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stocks now have failed to rally on improving interest rates for
several sessions.
</P>
<P>
Investors have been frustrated by a series of conflicting
signals on inflation, with most fearing recent indications of
rising payroll and wage levels, which could translate into too
much consumer demand, pushing up prices. Many analysts expect the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in early July to slow
borrowing and spending.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows AIDS Slowing Economic Growth In Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- AIDS will substantially reduce
economic growth in Southern Africa and could affect the growing
economies in some Asian countries as the epidemic gains a foothold
there, a research report said today.
</P>
<P>
The study, released by the Washington-based International Food
Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), was based on statistics from
the United Nations, World Bank, and U.S. Bureau of the Census to
explore the cost of AIDS and the impact on population and economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
To date, it said, the most devastating effects of AIDS have
been concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the growth of gross
domestic product per capita could decrease by as much as 1.4%.
</P>
<P>
The report also warned that with the high level of trade and
migration among Asian countries, the economies of Asia are likely
to suffer if the disease spread throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed that by the year 2000 most new HIV infections
would occur in Asia, and newly reported AIDS cases quadrupled in
Thailand, tripled in Myanmar, and almost doubled in India between
1992 and 1993, the report said.
</P>
<P>
IFPRI was established in 1975 to identify and analyze policies
for meeting the food needs of the developing world, it's one
organization supported by an informal international agricultural
association of 40 countries.

<HEADLINE> Canada Announces Measures to Oppose U.S. Anti-Cuban Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government announced
today measures to counterattack the U.S. anti-Cuban law in a bid
to protect its own interests.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and Minister
for International Trade Art Eggleton announced that the Canadian
government will introduce legislation amending the Foreign
Extraterritorial Measures Act (FEMA) against "foreign measures
such as the U.S. Helms-Burton Act".
</P>
<P>
This announcement was made hours after the U.S. government
published guidelines for its tough new anti-Cuba law in the
Federal Register this morning.
</P>
<P>
Publication of the rules means that the U.S. government has put
into effect the Helms-Burton law that seeks to tighten embargo of
Cuba by punishing those who do business with or invest in the
Caribbean island country.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act permits lawsuits to be launched in U.S.
courts against Canadian and other foreign firms allegedly
"trafficking" in property expropriated by Cuba from American
nationals.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for restrictions on temporary entry into the
United States of corporate officers and controlling shareholders
of these companies, along with their spouses and minor children.
</P>
<P>
The proposed FEMA amendments will allow Canadian companies sued
under the Helms-Burton Act to countersue in Canada.
</P>
<P>
FEMA became law in February 1985 and was designed to defend
Canadian interests against attempts by foreign governments or
courts to apply unreasonable laws or rulings in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"The Helms-Burton law flies in the face of international legal
principles," Eggleton said. "The FEMA changes will give Canadian
companies more legal tools to protect themselves against U.S.
court claims under Helms-Burton. "
</P>
<P>
He vowed that the Canadian government will continue to defend
Canadian interests strongly, including through the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) process.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton noted that Canada will request a ministerial-level
meeting of the NAFTA Commission.
</P>
<P>
Canada has held two rounds of consultations with the United
States on the Helms-Burton Act under the NAFTA dispute settlement
process.
</P>
<P>
Before going to a dispute settlement panel, the issue must be
raised at a meeting of trade ministers at a NAFTA Commission
session. Canada would be in a position to request a NAFTA panel 30
days after the Commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
Canada has objected strongly to both the claims provisions and
those relating to the denial of entry of the U.S. act before and
after it was passed by the Congress and signed into law by
President Bill Clinton in March,
</P>
<P>
It has also been working with other countries in opposing the
U.S. law in regional and multinational organizations.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Economic Cooperation Will Raise to a New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Based on an extensive economic
complementarity between China and Britain, China believes that the
Sino-British economic cooperation will surely be raised to a new
height.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Chen Jinhua, the Chairman of China's
State Planning Commission in his speech delivered to the Royal
Institute of International Affairs here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, entitled "The 9th Five Year Plan of China and
The Development Priorities for Sino-foreign Economic Cooperation",
the chairman gave his audience a brief account of the current
economic situation in China, the 9th Five Year Plan and the
Long-term Targets for the Year 2010 and the development priorities
of Sino-foreign economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
referring to the Sino-British trade and economic relations,
Chairman Chen said "the United Kingdom is among the first major
partners in the Chinese foreign trade cooperation. Since the
implementation of the reform and open-up policy in China in 1979,
the Sino-British bilateral trade has further expanded with the
trade volume increasing from 764 million US dollars in 1980 to
4.76 billion US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"From 1979 to the end of 1995, a total of 1474 joint venture
projects were signed between the two countries with a negotiated
envestment of 9.38 billion US dollars of which 2.21 billion US
dollars was actually invested," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Recalling Michael Heseltine, British Deputy Prime Minister's
visit to China last month, the chairman said, during his visit,
broad contacts were made and number of important contracts were
signed between Britain and China, marking a new and healthy
momentum in the Sino-British economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In his conclusion, the Chairman said, based on an extensive
economic complementarity between our two countries, there exist a
huge potential and a broad prospect for the two countries to
engage in multi-forms of economic and technological cooperation
according to the principle of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that with the joint efforts from both
sides, the bilateral economic cooperation will surely be raised to
a new height.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Plans Middle East Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher is expected to take a trip to the Middle East next
week to see if Israeli Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu
could pursue the peace process that the U.S. and the outgoing
Israeli Labour government have carefully nurtured.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State did not explicitly indicate his upcoming
journey during a press conference on monday, but the remarks on
his intention to meet with the Likud leader left little doubt that
a trip is in the works.
</P>
<P>
He told the press conference that he spoke to Netanyahu last
Friday in a telephone conversation that he "looked forward to meet
with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his team in the near future".
</P>
<P>
Asked what was his comment on the peace policies Netanyahu's
Likud Party announced over the weekend, the Secretary of State
said: "We've not had an opportunity to discuss with him the
policies he'll be following. Until we have that opportunity, I
think it would be much premature for us to comment on any of his
particular policy positions. We look forward to an opportunity to
discuss with him the guidelines that he's laid down."
</P>
<P>
The guidelines declare that Syria's Golan Heights, seized
during the 1967 war, would not be returned in exchanged for peace
and that Palestinians would not be allowed to form a state in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip with any part of Jerusalem as its
capital, which amount to casting aside the possibility of reaching
a treaty with Syria or making further concession to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
that is in contradiction with U.S. intended peace process by
swapping land for peace.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Christopher is expected to visit Israel,
Egypt, Jordan and possibly Syria.
</P>
<P>
His Middle East trip will probably start on June 24 and stay
there for about five days before leaving for Lyon, France, to
attend the annual G-7 economic summit.

WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will dispatch a special envoy to Cyprus next month to seek an
earlier and comprehensive settlement of the long-standing Cyprus
problem, the White House announced said today.
</P>
<P>
"The United States intends to intensify its efforts...to narrow
the differences between the two communities on Cyprus, leading to
a comprehensive settlement," the White House said in a statement
released after a meeting between Clinton and visiting Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean island nation has been virtually partitioned
since Turkish troops landed in the northern part in 1974 after a
short-lived coup in Nicosia backed by the Greek military junta
then ruling Greece.
</P>
<P>
Athens and Nicosia have been calling for an earlier
reunification of the island and withdrawal of the Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
The White House said that special envoy Richard Beattie's talks
in the region will emphasize security issues.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Russian Election Important Thing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today
praised the Russian presidential elections as a significant thing
in the country and expressed the support for the result of the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very significant thing for Russia to have this
elections," U.S. President Bill Clinton said during a
picture-taking session at the Oval Office at the White House.
"This has never happened in a thousand years."
</P>
<P>
While praising Russian President Boris Yeltsin for abiding by
the rules of democracy, Clinton gave a de facto endorsement for
him, saying that the United States supports candidates who
advocate "democracy and free-market reforms."
</P>
<P>
With more than 95 percent of the votes counted, Yeltsin
reportedly led Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov by
some 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
A runoff, scheduled to be held by July 7, is required since
neither candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher described the
Russian elections as "a significant milestone" and stressed that
Washington's policy towards the upcoming runoff would remain
constant.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy towards Russia is deeply rooted in American
interests...Our approach to the runoff will be the same as our
approach to the first round," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to stress our support for the democratic
process and for political and economic reform (in Russia)," he
added.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed by KDP in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed by
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) forces in northern Iraq, the
semi-official Anatolia News agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the killed people include a leading
political figure and one of the leaders of the Surci family,
Hussein Surci.
</P>
<P>
The killing was resulted from clashes which broke out on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Messud Barzani-led KDP accused the Kurdistan Conservative Party
(KCP) of spying and encouraging hostilities in the region, and
in return the KCP accused the KDP of attacking its village,
said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Surci was a leading figure of the pro-British KCP, which is at
loggerheads with the KDP, said Sehzad Saib, the Ankara
representative of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the two parties forged a peace agreement, but
on Sunday KDP forces attacked a pro-KCP village in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saib said that the KDP intended to control the entire northern
Iraq and for that reason they have been attacking the KCP.
</P>
<P>
The KCP was established in Ankara after the Kurdish
uprising against the Iraqi government in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Makes Representations About Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has made
appropriate representations to international organizations about
Turkey's military manoeuvres in the area which incorporate
Cyprus' northern and eastern shores, Defence Minister Costas
Eliades said here today.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the Turkish military exercises code-named
"Thalassolykos" (Sea Wolf) and "Efessos", which started today in
the Aegean, and covered areas north and east of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Turkish exercises are being
monitored and all appropriate measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the four Greek military aircraft flew over Cyprus
early this afternoon as part of training within the joint
Greco-Cypriot defense policy, Eliades said "the joint defense
pact is being implemented and moves on within the deadlines set
and nobody can neutralize either this pact or our defense
cooperation with Greece."
</P>
<P>
Today's flights are part of training exercises within the
joint defense pact and they are a usual phenomenon, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the F-16 flights had anything to do with the ongoing
Turkish manoeuvres in the region, the minister replied "our
exercises bear no relation to the Turkish manoeuvres."
</P>
<P>
The Defence Minister confirmed that there were other Greek
military aircraft "in the wider vicinity of Cyprus" but gave no
further details.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides, who is
currently accompanying President Glafcos Clerides to his U.S.
trip, told the Cyprus Radio that the Turkish exercises coincided
with today's talks in Washington between President Clerides and
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said President Clerides will raise the issue
when he meets U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher Tuesday.

<P>
ANKARA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish foreign ministry said
here today that there is no military build-up from the Turkish
side of the Syrian-Turco border.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Deputy spokesman Nurettin Nurkan told
reporters that he was unable to confirm the reports that on the
Syrian side of the border troop movements are taking place.
</P>
<P>
Answering to a question about Arab league Deputy
General-Secretary Muvaffak Al Allaf's statement that it would be
a serious development if Turkey made an incursion into Syria,
Nurkan said that Turkey did not constitute a threat to its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have good relations with Syria. There
is a specific condition for improving our relations with Syria.
They have to stop their support of terrorism," said Nurkan,
adding that there is no " hot pursuit" plan in the Syrian
territory.
</P>
<P>
Hot pursuit is the term used for chasing terrorists into other
countries.

Turkey has been accusing Syria of its support for the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) which has been fighting for self-rule
in southeastern Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Turkey sent its government troops into northern
Iraq in hot pursuit of the PKK rebels and killed more than
200 PKK rebels in the Turkish military operations.

<HEADLINE> US Carrier to Remain Permanently in East Asia Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States is planning
to keep its Japan-based aircraft carrier permanently in East Asia
waters and cancel its annual training deployment to Middle East
ports.
</P>
<P>
The plan, coming after a U.S.-Japan summit last April in Tokyo
on security ties of the two countries, shows yet another sign that
the U.S. is determined to increase its naval presence in the East
Asia against the so-called "volatile" situation in the region, the
Washington Times today quoted military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UUS Independence, berthed in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, has
made an annual "show the flag" and training voyage to Middle East
waters since 1991, leaving out of the East Asian region for weeks
each year.
</P>
<P>
However, this year's cruise to the Middle East has been
canceled and there are no plans to resume it in the coming years,
the Washington Times quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said East Asia was "strategically volatile at
present that it could not risk having the carrier out of the
area in case a crisis erupted."
</P>
<P>
Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported Sunday that the U.S. Navy
command in Yokosuka had said the change was to have the carrier
increase the navy's presence in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese Navy command spokesman told Kyodo Sunday that the
new policy "allows the UUS Independence to contribute additional
U.S. naval presence in this important part of the world and react
more quickly to situations before they become a crisis."

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) today urged Nigeria to revive its national program on
immunization to reduce deaths from epidemics in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a rally to mark the 1996 African child day here, UNICEF
representative in Nigeria Ibrahim Gall said that epidemics caused
by such diseases as meningitis, cholera and measles have killed
more than 10,000 people across the country so far this year.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria the immunization rate "has fallen to an estimated
36 percent, far below that of some of its smaller neighbors in
West Africa", he was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNICEF representative, intensive immunization
would help Nigeria avoid the deaths from the deadly ailments.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that wars during the past ten years have
claimed the lives of about two million children in the world.
</P>
<P>
The situation, he said, has also left about four to five
million disabled, two million homeless, about a million orphaned
or separated from their families, and about ten million
"psychologically traumatized" during the period.
</P>
<P>
So it is appropriate that the African Child Day this year is
celebrated with the theme of "a world without wars", he added.

JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Assistant
Secretary-General for peacekeeping operations Manfred Eisele said
today in Windhoek it must be made clear to Angolans that they
have the solution to the conflict "in their hands".
</P>
<P>
He told a media briefing that the UN verification mission to
Angola (UNAVEM 3) had created the pre-requisites for a peaceful
settlement, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is now for the parties to the conflict to grab this
opportunity and make the best use of a situation, which the world
has created at an expense of over 250 million U.S. Dollars a
year," said Eisele.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be "foolish" if parties to the Angolan
conflict would let such an opportunity slip by.
</P>
<P>
Eisele, who was on a short visit to Namibia to participate in
a forum on peacekeeping operations, said Africa had enjoyed a
fair share of the UN attention and budget.
</P>
<P>
"I think the African peacekeeping operations are centre stage
and will, unfortunately, remain so for quite a while," he added.
</P>
<P>
He described Namibia and Botswana's practice of taking the
Kasikili Island dispute to the international court of justice in
the Hague as the "second best solution".

LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Mauritanian ambassador to
Nigeria today called for increased economic cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Kettab Lemine said that private investors from both

cement) and iron ore in Mauritania for economic and trade

</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, Nigeria's large market, strong
manufacturing base and rich mineral resources are good
opportunities that could be exploited by both sides for mutually
beneficial economic ventures.
</P>
<P>
Another field of cooperation is livestock production and
processing, using cattle from Mauritania and Nigerian know-how,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mauritania could virtually buy petrol from Nigeria for its own
needs, the envoy added.

NEW YORK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- I.B.M. is planning to start
selling laser printers designed to be attached to networks of
personal computers -- five years after it moved out of the printer
market.
</P>
<P>
The new printers will compete directly against the
Hewlett-Packard (HP) Company, the industry leader, which sells an
estimated 70 percent of the world's laser printers, according to a

</P>
<P>
Other printer makers include Apple Computer, which makes
printers only for Macintosh computers, and a number of major
Japanese companies such as Canon and Epson.
</P>
<P>
The rise of personal computer networks over the last few years
has seen many companies abandon the relatively expensive solutions
offered by I.B.M. and buy laser printers that can be shared among
several personal computers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The company will begin by selling three black-and-white laser
printers that print at 12 to 24 pages a minute and a single color
laser printer, it said. The price would be competitive with those
of HP series.

SARAJEVO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel on Monday called Nato-led Implementation Force (IFOR) to

<HEADLINE> Sony to Introduce PC Line in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sony Corporation, a leading
TV and audio and video player maker of Japan, is expected to
introduce its first two personal computer models soon, as its
efforts to enter the PC business in North America.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that the two machines were
specially designed for the U.S. market. The "PC by Sony" will cost
2,000 U.S. dollars to 3,000 U.S. dollars, depending on features,
and will be available in August.
</P>
<P>
Sony executives acknowledge that the product had lower margins
than they were used to, but they said the double-digit growth of
the PC business made it an attractive one, and the convergence of
computers, communications and entertainment was an event Sony
could not afford to miss, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The company claimed in November that it would produce a
computer as easy to use as a television set. But later it said the
market research led them to a more conventional model.
</P>
<P>
The Sony computers will have a powerful amplifier and built-in
speakers, and some clever software for displaying video, according
to the report. Sony is likely to create competition for Compaq
Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Packard Bell Electronics and other
computer makers -- not just with its computer's features but with
its strong brand name.
</P>
<P>
Its base model has a 166-megahertz version of the Intel
Corporation's Pentium processor and 16 megabytes of random-access
memory (RAM); the more powerful one has a 200-megahertz Pentium
chip and 32 megabytes of RAM, the paper reported.
