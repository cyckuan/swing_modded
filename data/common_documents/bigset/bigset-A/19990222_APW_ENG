<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Leaders To Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is meeting with the  
congressional leaders of both parties for the first time in more 
than a year to hash out legislative priorities from Social Security 
to education and to review administration policy in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	All sides say they are looking for consensus on domestic issues  
as the president and Congress try to put the impeachment process 
behind them, but with a deadline looming today in the Kosovo peace 
talks taking place in France, GOP questions about the Clinton 
administration's handling of the crisis threatened to dominate the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., released a letter  
Monday night that he sent to Clinton on Feb. 5 saying he was 
``deeply concerned by the prospect that U.S. military forces could 
become embroiled in yet another costly, open-ended and ill-defined 
peacekeeping mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters he hoped to get an answer to that letter  
during today's meeting and while Clinton was determined to act in 
concert with NATO if military action were needed, Lott vowed that 
the Senate would debate and vote on any deployment of U.S. troops 
to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans feel very strongly we should not go about the  
world introducing U.S. troops without knowing what the rules of 
engagement are, how it's going be paid for, what we expect to 
achieve, what goals that are going to be achieved and what is the 
end game,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deadline for the peace talks in Rambouillet between  
Serbs and ethnic Albanians coincided with the starting time of the 
president's session with lawmakers, 9 a.m. EST. If a deal were 
reached, Clinton has said he would dispatch as many as 4,000 U.S. 
troops to help keep the peace. Failure to reach a deal could lead 
to NATO air strikes in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	In an address to the Democratic Governors Association on Monday  
night, Clinton offered a vigorous defense of his administration's 
continued involvement in the peace processes in the Northern 
Ireland, the Middle East, Africa and Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``No country turns away from its common values and common  
humanity even for a moment without paying a price,'' he said. 
``Every night I thank God we have a chance to work for peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Leavy, spokesman for Clinton's National Security Council,  
said the meeting with leaders of Congress would provide an 
opportunity to bring the lawmakers up to date on the status of the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is obviously very fluid right now,'' Leavy said.  
``We've been consulting extensively on Kosovo over the last month, 
and we're hopeful that there will be bipartisan support for moving 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's meeting was the first time in 19 months that Clinton had  
met with the Republican leaders in Congress. With many GOP 
lawmakers still smarting from their failed effort to drive Clinton 
from office, the session was being seen as a chance to clear the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president wanted to  
focus on his fiscal 2000 proposals to overhaul Social Security and 
Medicare, improve education, and pass a patients' bill of rights 
and a minimum wage hike. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president has long said that we need to move  
forward in a way that best advances the interests of Social 
Security, Medicare,'' Lockhart said. ``And I think the way we're 
going to do that is working with Democrats and Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he would press Clinton to support plans before a  
commission reviewing the Medicare program that would revamp the 
system, which is facing a budget crunch in 2008. Lott said the 
overhaul plan was one vote shy of commission approval. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he planned to discuss a missile defense system with  
Clinton, as well as Republican views on education and Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., said education and Social Security were at the top of the 
speaker's agenda, but that he was also interested in gauging 
Clinton's sincerity. ``We want to see if the president is serious 
about legislating, or if he wants to start the 2000 campaign,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we deal with the budget surplus,'' Feehery said, ``we need  
also to deal with the trust deficit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Clinton was launching a national campaign to enroll  
eligible uninsured children in Medicare and a parallel 
public-private effort to provide medical insurance to more 
children.

<HEADLINE> Bidding War Over Southwest Gas Corp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Southwest Gas Corp. became the target of a  
bidding war Monday as Southern Union Co. of Texas offered to top a 
deal the Nevada-based gas distributor had already struck with Oneok 
Inc. of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Union's unsolicited proposal values Southwest Gas at  
$32 a share, or $973 million, beating the $28.50 a share, or $866 
million, that Oneok agreed to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Gas issued a statement saying that while the merger  
agreement with Oneok remains in effect, its board of directors has 
authorized management ``to commence substantive discussions'' with 
Southern Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Southern Union took Oneok officials by surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	``We based our offer on due diligence, consultation with  
investment advisors and sound business judgment,'' said Larry 
Brummett, Oneok chief executive officer. ``We believe our offer is 
fair, competitive and still valid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Gas, based in Las Vegas, serves about 1.2 million  
customers in the fast-growing region of Nevada, Arizona and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	That growth makes Southwest Gas an attractive takeover target, a  
Southern Union executive said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Southwest's rapidly growing customer base  
combined with Southern Union's experience as one of the most 
cost-effective operators in the industry would create significant 
value for shareholders,'' said George Lindemann, Southern Union 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing its proposal, Southern Union said the merger would  
make it the largest gas-only distribution company in the country. 
Oneok made the same claim when its pending deal was announced in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Southern Union's proposal, Southwest Gas would operate out  
of Las Vegas as the Southwest Gas Division of Southern Union and 
keep its name in the local markets. Three Southwest Gas board 
members could join Southern Union's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Union's customer base would nearly double to 2.2  
million customers if its bid is successful. Southern Union has 
customers in Texas, Missouri, Florida and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneok, the corporate parent of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., spent  
14 months working on the merger agreement that was approved by the 
Southwest Gas board of directors. That deal is still subject to 
approval from state regulators, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission and Southwest Gas shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Gas said it would make no further public announcement  
regarding its negotiations with Southern Union ``until an agreement 
is reached or negotiations are terminated.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 190.07 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher in late afternoon  
trading, as optimism about lower interest rates and some 
high-priced takeover deals encouraged investors to dip back into 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 190.07 at 9,530.02, led by banking and technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher, with the Nasdaq composite  
up 36.95 at 2,320.55, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 28.14 
at 1,267.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. A volume figure was not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices were higher, pushing interest rates down, ahead of  
Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins 
testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, scheduled to begin at 10 
a.m. EST Tuesday. Later Tuesday, Greenspan will discuss with the 
same panel his views on the modernization of the financial-services 
industry. On Wednesday, he will address the House Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He will go to Capitol Hill on a high note, after data released  
last Thursday and Friday showed an economy still growing while 
price inflation remains quiet, said Alan Skrainka,chief market 
strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was up 15/32 point, pushing its yield,  
which moves opposite the price, down to 5.35 percent from 5.38 
percent late Friday, amid optimism that Greenspan would have an 
upbeat message. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the odds are very slim that he would say something to  
upset the apple cart,'' Skrainka said. ``Alan Greenspan probably 
has to pinch himself to make sure he's not dreaming. There's 
perfection in the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of technology companies, which need to borrow frequently  
and therefore benefit from lower interest rates, moved higher after 
dropping last week. The Dow was led higher by IBM, up 4 13/16 at 
176 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks also moved higher on lower interest rates.  
American Express was up 4 13/16 at 108. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also helped higher by some merger news, most  
prominently in the energy industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Resources agreed to buy gas and oil-pipeline company  
Consolidated Natural Gas for $6.3 billion. The union would create 
one of the country's largest electric and gas utilities. Dominion 
Resources' shares were down 1 15/16 at 40 5/16, while CNG's shares 
were down 1 1/16 at 55 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra Energy agreed to acquire KN Energy, a big natural-gas  
pipeline and storage operator, for $1.9 billion. KNE's stock was up 
3/8 at 21 7/8, but Sempra's shares were down 5/8 at 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, aircraft engine maker and Dow component United  
Technologies said it would buy Sundstrand for about $4.3 billion in 
cash and stock, in a move that will expand United Technologies' 
aerospace and aviation businesses. United Technologies' shares were 
up 1/16 at 125 1/2, after making back a loss of more than 2 points, 
and Sundstrand's shares were up 10 1/4 at 68 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Telecom Italia, the leading telecommunications service  
provider in Italy, is the target of a hostile takeover bid by 
smaller rival Olivetti. Telecom Italia's shares were up 7 1/16 at 
113 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Study: Black Spending Power Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Highly educated black women helped drive a 7  
percent jump in the spending power of black Americans during 1997, 
a new report said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual study of wages and salaries by Chicago-based Target  
Market News found that black buying power increased to $392 billion 
in 1997, up from $367 billion in 1996, and suggested new areas 
where corporations can target their marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks continued to spend most of their money on housing and  
related charges, which totaled $104.8 billion, but the analysis of 
government data found the biggest purchasing gains in the areas of 
personal care products and Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the economy has been good for a few years now, black  
middle class families are feeling more confident about spending 
more on things they have put off for the last couple of years,'' 
said Ken Smikle, president of Target Marketing News. ``There 
frankly are signs of splurging, spending on items for individual 
gratification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study drew on interviews and diaries taken from 3,000 black  
households as part of an annual consumer spending survey by the 
Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on personal items jumped to $7.4 billion in 1997 from  
$4.4 billion a year earlier as black women with higher personal 
income treated themselves to hair salons, cosmetics, manicures and 
massages, Smikle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet spending by black Americans jumped sixfold in 1997 to  
$60 million, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the personal-care segment, black women spent 215 percent more  
than they did in 1996, and 60 percent more per capita than white 
women did in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings reinforced previous findings that American women  
have been shrinking the wage gap as they attain higher education 
levels than men. In 1998, women aged 20 to 29 held more than 54 
percent of all bachelor's degrees, a significant factor in hiring 
for advanced technical jobs, according to the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau's data on income by educational attainment shows  
women in general earn only 73 percent compared with the median 
salary for men, but that figure rises to 82 percent for younger 
women who have bachelor's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to filling skilled positions in the future,  
employers will look toward the biggest and best educated pool of 
workers, which, as the data suggest, will be women,'' said John 
Challenger, chief executive of the employee outplacement firm 
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas. ``Women will increasingly gain 
stronger bargaining power, and that is when we will see salaries 
rise and the inevitable end to the glass ceiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For black women, wages grew 3 percent in 1997, compared to 6  
percent for white women, according to Target Market's analysis of 
Labor Department figures. But the number of black women entering 
the work force jumped 4 percent in the same period, compared to 
less than 1 percent for white women.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Seeks Damages in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- California-based Yahoo! will seek  
unspecified damages from Indian ``cybersquatters'' in a patent 
case, counsel for the U.S. company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	An Indian court granted an injunction Friday to the Santa Clara,  
California-based Yahoo!, which has brought a civil suit against 
``Yahooindia,'' whose World Wide Web site resembles the familiar 
Yahoo! home page and offers India-related services and information. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahooindia is run by New Delhi-based Netlink Internet Solutions.  
Monday, its Internet page read only: ``Under Construction. Please 
Come Back Later.'' The company's lawyer, Harish Malhotra, said he 
would appeal the injunction keeping Yahooindia from operating or 
seeking advertising pending a final ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yahoo is a common word in trade circles,'' Malhotra told The  
Associated Press. ``No one can own the name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing Yahoo! said the ruling was a rarity in a  
case related to the Internet, rife with the practice of 
``cybersquatting'' or copying of domain names. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeking punitive damages. Let this case be a deterrent  
for cybersquatters,'' Yahoo counsel Pravin Anand told The 
Associated Press. Anand, a leading patent attorney, said the ruling 
also rebutted the notion that Indian courts offered little redress 
to domestic and foreign companies in cases of patent law 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge M.K. Sharma said in his ruling: ``There is every  
possibility of an Internet user being confused and deceived in 
believing that both the domain names belong to one common source 
and connection, although the two belong to two different 
concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court rejected defense counsel Malhotra's argument that  
Indian patent laws protected only physical goods, saying the domain 
name served the same function as a trademark and was not a mere 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! was developed by David Filo and Jerry Yang in 1994 and  
offers services ranging from stock quotes to news to live chats. In 
January, Yahoo! announced it was acquiring Geocities to form the 
world's largest online company.

<HEADLINE> Former Illinois Mayor Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) -- He was always a little too flashy, a  
little too quick to kiss the women. He presided over the city 
during an era when mountains of trash grew along the streets and 
workers went unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
	So what is former Mayor Carl Officer doing in Tuesday's primary,  
seeking the office voters took away from him eight years ago? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've changed,'' he said last week.  
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving office in 1991, the confirmed bachelor with a  
penchant for fast living has married, become an ordained minister 
and taken over his family's funeral home business. 
</P>
<P>
	Everywhere he goes, Officer is greeted warmly by people who know  
him more for helping ease families through the death of a mother or 
brother than for the controversies of his 12 years as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see him back in,'' said cab driver Charlie  
Bourragh. ``George Wallace changed, didn't he? You can't judge a 
man by his past alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officer, 46, prefers to remember the accomplishments of his  
three terms as mayor: bringing businesses to town and laying the 
groundwork for development of the city's riverfront, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	But the prospect of his return, just as the city is showing  
signs of revival, leaves his critics cold. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelvin Jones, another mayoral candidate, said Officer left East  
St. Louis with ``the lowest conditions in the city's history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officer faces an uphill battle in his effort to regain the  
office he held from 1979 to 1991. The city's powerful Democratic 
Party machine backs candidate Eddie Jackson, a school principal. 
</P>
<P>
	City Councilwoman Debra Powell and retired firefighter Henry  
Birge are also on the ballot. The top two finishers among the 
all-Democratic slate move on to the April 13 general election. 
Incumbent Gordon Bush has decided not to seek a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	Without party backing, Officer is taking his campaign directly  
to residents with an hour of paid radio programming each morning 
and a full day of campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent campaign swing, Officer swept through the downtown  
business district to the beat of an aide's portable stereo blasting 
hip-hop music, tossing out campaign literature and kisses. 
</P>
<P>
	``No big date?'' he asks one woman outside a beauty salon.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't promised my wife, you'd be first on my list,'' he  
said, planting a kiss on her cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite greeting dozens of residents in a matter of minutes, he  
never introduces himself. ``I don't need to,'' he said. ``I've 
buried most of these folk's relatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officer may still have that same old charisma, but he said the  
immaturity that once got him in trouble is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a wisdom that comes from age and experience,''  
Officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	This from a man who once promised to rid the city of gangs in  
less than 12 weeks, used a City Hall phone to call a 900-number 
dating service and, shortly before leaving office in 1991, was 
pulled over for speeding 105 mph in a Jaguar owned by an imprisoned 
drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer traces his transformation to a visit to Israel in 1993,  
when he recalls looking up during a boat trip on the Sea of Galilee 
to see the path Jesus would have taken to descend from Nazareth. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the lifelong Baptist said he felt the true  
presence of God. ``My whole life changed that morning, and 
nothing's been the same since,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has since been ordained in the Baptist church and expects to  
receive his final ordination in the African Methodist Episcopal 
church in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he understands through his religious awakening what  
his purpose is here on earth. I trust him totally,'' said the Rev. 
Samuel Bradford, pastor of Shiloh AME church and one of Officer's 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Resident Darlean Lasley doesn't accept Officer's claim of  
transformation and classes him with other longtime city power 
brokers who she said are responsible for the city's impoverished 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had his shot and he blew it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Officer said most of the problems weren't his fault.  
</P>
<P>
	He blames the decline of the city's housing stock and a garbage  
crisis that made the city a national laughingstock on lazy 
residents. The city was so deeply in debt in the early 1990s it 
allowed trash to pile up on the streets for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	And he takes credit for beginning the process that brought the  
Casino Queen riverboat to East St. Louis and for bringing new 
businesses to downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Locals do support Officer, but just how much remains unclear,  
said James Jones, executive director of the East St. Louis 
Community Action Network, a nonprofit association of neighborhood 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some people think that he might be the most qualified  
candidate, but they won't say that publicly because they don't want 
to be associated with his checkered past,'' Jones said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks To Expand Gun Tracing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying they've identified a potent new tool in  
fighting youth crime, Clinton administration officials are asking 
Congress for money to expand a program that traces guns routed 
illegally into the hands of young people. 
</P>
<P>
	The call came as the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms released an analysis Sunday of its Youth Crime 
Gun Interdiction Initiative. The program traced guns used in 76,260 
crimes in 27 cities over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	ATF found that one-third to one-half of the traced guns were  
purchased from licensed dealers by people acting as ``straw'' 
intermediaries for the real owners, and only 35 percent were 
stolen. The rest came from private sellers not required to obtain 
identification or subject their customers to background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, President Clinton said the figures go a long way  
toward helping authorities find and punish those responsible for 
providing guns for young criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``With more police on the streets and tougher gun laws on the  
books, crime has dropped to its lowest level in a generation. But 
we must do more,'' he said. ``Tracing crime guns to their source, 
and putting gun traffickers out of business for good, will make our 
streets even safer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Howard Matre, an ammunition distributor in Seven Miles,  
Ohio, said the ATF report ``misrepresents the facts'' about straw 
sales, and provides an avenue for opponents to use in trying to 
overturn the right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``First you have the study, and then you justify the erosion of  
the rights,'' Matre said. ``It's very frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget request for fiscal 2000 includes an additional  
$11.2 million to expand the tracing program to 10 additional 
cities: Charlotte, N.C.; Dallas; Denver; Louisville, Ky.; New 
Orleans; Oakland, Calif.; Omaha, Neb.; Phoenix; Portland, Ore.; and 
Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	That 25 percent of the guns moved quickly from sale to recovery  
by police indicates they were bought legally, then resold, 
officials said. Semiautomatic pistols were the most commonly 
recovered weapon in each city, making up 52 percent of all trace 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the traces, 397 people have been referred to  
state and federal courts over the past year for prosecution as gun 
traffickers, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't stop them from buying the guns, but as soon as they  
turn those guns over to felons, we can prosecute that,'' ATF 
director John Magaw told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Dunleavy, an attorney for seven families who won a $4  
million negligence verdict against gun manufacturers in a Brooklyn, 
N.Y., court last week, said, ``If the manufacturers took more 
rigorous precautions up front, you wouldn't have the guns being 
trafficked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brooklyn case, brought in 1995 by a mother whose son was  
shot to death two years earlier, is being watched closely by cities 
anxious to sue manufacturers to recover costs from gun violence. 
ATF's report ``proves our evidence was certainly on the right 
track,'' Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that new guns reaching the hands of young  
criminals from straw purchasers made up between 25 and 36 percent 
of all firearms recovered from juveniles over the past three years, 
and between 32 percent and 49 percent of firearms recovered from 
offenders aged 18 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The report identified five types of semiautomatic pistols that  
move rapidly from dealers to young offenders: the Lorcin 9 mm, the 
.40-caliber Smith &AMP; Wesson, the Bryco 9 mm, the Hi-Point 9 mm and 
the .40-caliber Glock. 
</P>
<P>
	It said 11.3 percent of the offenders involved were under 17  
years old, and 32 percent were between 18 and 24. Thirty-one 
percent of the guns were used in drug offenses, 28 percent in 
assaults and 18 percent each in homicides and robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was the result of Clinton's 1996 directive that the  
Treasury and Justice departments establish a program to identify 
and reduce the illegal transfer of firearms to young people. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27 cities involved in the report are Atlanta; Baltimore;  
Birmingham, Ala.; Boston; Bridgeport, Conn.; Chicago; Cincinnati; 
Cleveland; Detroit; Gary, Ind.; Houston; Inglewood, Calif.; Jersey 
City, N.J.; Los Angeles; Memphis, Tenn.; Miami; Milwaukee; 
Minneapolis; New York; Philadelphia; Richmond, Va.; Salinas, 
Calif.; San Antonio; St. Louis; Seattle; Tucson, Ariz.; and 
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Ichiro Suzuki at Seattle's Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners have found the player  
to wear Randy Johnson's old No. 51 -- Ichiro Suzuki, a five-time 
batting champion from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki, 25, will take part in the Mariners' first full workout  
for pitchers and position players Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki will be joined at the Mariners' spring training by two  
other players from the Japanese Pacific League, pitchers Nobuyuki 
Hoshino and Nobuyuki Ebisu. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese translations have been posted on doorways at the  
Mariners' complex for signs such as ``Authorized Personnel Only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 media members from Japan will report on the Japanese  
players and countryman Mac Suzuki, a reliever in the Seattle 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be prepared for the media circus as well as we  
can,'' manager Lou Piniella said. 
</P>
<P>
	Piniella and pitching coach Stan Williams have drawn up a spring  
training strategy for the team's pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Piniella said the Mariners will pitch left-hander Jeff Fassero  
one inning in his first spring training start. He had bone chips 
removed from his left elbow in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're being cautious early on with all the starters,''  
Piniella said. ``Our plan is to give starters six to seven 
appearances, have them pitch a total of about 27 innings, with the 
last appearance going six or seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will throw one day, rest the next, throw 10 to 12 minutes  
the day after, rest the next and then pitch again. We've gotten 
away from that in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Stars Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr. were not among the  
Mariners' position players who took physicals Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey is already in the Phoenix area. Rodriguez will arrive  
Tuesday in time for the first workout, which is scheduled to last 
3 1/2 hours.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans At 23-Year Lows / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures tumbled to 23-year lows Monday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade after the U.S. Agriculture Department's 
chief economist predicted crop prices could fall to $4 a bushel later 
this year. Grain futures also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans fell after USDA chief economist Keith Collins predicted  
at a farm outlook conference that there is no end in sight this year 
to falling prices, largely because economic troubles in Asia have caused 
exports to fall sharply. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybean prices have fallen each day for more than a week amid  
indications world production will continue to increase at a time when 
there are few takers for the commodity. 
</P>
<P>
        U.S. farmers last year harvested a record crop, and analysts  
are predicting they will plant record acreage this year because of 
farm programs that pay more for that crop than others. Further exacerbating 
the problem are expectations for a near-record Brazilian crop and a 
large crop from Argentina. South American soybeans account for a third 
of the world's supply, and Brazil is the world's second-largest grower 
behind the United States. 
</P>
<P>
        Collins predicted farm income would drop this year by $3 billion  
to $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures fell on news of the USDA outlook and more near-ideal  
weather in winter-wheat growing regions. Corn futures suffered least, 
propped by continued steady domestic and export demand. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans for March delivery fell 4 1/4 cents to $4.74 a bushel.  
Prices earlier in the session had fallen to $4.64 1/2 a bushel. March 
wheat fell 3 cents to $2.51 3/4 a bushel; March corn fell 1 cent to 
$2.14 a bushel; March oats fell 1/4 cent to $1.01 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and pork bellies futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while lean hogs were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
        April live cattle fell 0.25 cent to 66.45 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell 0.58 cent to 72.77 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell 0.02 cent to 45.80 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 1.75 
cents to 52.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Buys Korean Bank Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In another sign of progress in South  
Korea's financial cleanup, British banking giant HSBC is paying 
$700 million for a 70 percent stake in Seoulbank, a troubled lender 
that was nationalized last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced Monday by HSBC Holdings PLC and South  
Korea's Financial Supervisory Commission, the South Korean 
government would keep 30 percent of the bank. South Korea will also 
take over the remainder of Seoulbank's bad debt. 
</P>
<P>
	London-based HSBC Holdings owns the Marine Midland Bank in the  
United States and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., Hong 
Kong's leading bank. It also owns Midland Bank, the largest bank in 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	Seoulbank was one of two banks nationalized last year by the  
South Korean government as part of a broad effort to restructure 
the country's financial system. The other one, Korea First Bank, 
sold a 51 percent stake in itself late last year to a U.S. 
investment group led by Newbridge Capital Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea poured $3.22 billion into Korea First Bank and $2.68  
billion into Seoulbank to write off half of their bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Both banks were forced to shed thousands of workers and close  
down dozens of retail branches across the country as part of a 
restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
	Selling the two troubled banks was among conditions laid down by  
the International Monetary Fund in exchange for its $58 billion 
bailout of South Korea's sinking economy in late 1997.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 1905 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher in late afternoon  
trading, as optimism about lower interest rates and some 
high-priced takeover deals encouraged investors to dip back into 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 190.07 at 9,530.02, led by banking and technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher, with the Nasdaq composite  
up 36.95 at 2,320.55, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 28.14 
at 1,267.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. A volume figure was not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices were higher, pushing interest rates down, ahead of  
Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins 
testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, scheduled to begin at 10 
a.m. EST Tuesday. Later Tuesday, Greenspan will discuss with the 
same panel his views on the modernization of the financial-services 
industry. On Wednesday, he will address the House Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He will go to Capitol Hill on a high note, after data released  
last Thursday and Friday showed an economy still growing while 
price inflation remains quiet, said Alan Skrainka,chief market 
strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was up 15/32 point, pushing its yield,  
which moves opposite the price, down to 5.35 percent from 5.38 
percent late Friday, amid optimism that Greenspan would have an 
upbeat message. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the odds are very slim that he would say something to  
upset the apple cart,'' Skrainka said. ``Alan Greenspan probably 
has to pinch himself to make sure he's not dreaming. There's 
perfection in the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of technology companies, which need to borrow frequently  
and therefore benefit from lower interest rates, moved higher after 
dropping last week. The Dow was led higher by IBM, up 4 13/16 at 
176 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks also moved higher on lower interest rates.  
American Express was up 4 13/16 at 108. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also helped higher by some merger news, most  
prominently in the energy industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Resources agreed to buy gas and oil-pipeline company  
Consolidated Natural Gas for $6.3 billion. The union would create 
one of the country's largest electric and gas utilities. Dominion 
Resources' shares were down 1 15/16 at 40 5/16, while CNG's shares 
were down 1 1/16 at 55 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra Energy agreed to acquire KN Energy, a big natural-gas  
pipeline and storage operator, for $1.9 billion. KNE's stock was up 
3/8 at 21 7/8, but Sempra's shares were down 5/8 at 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, aircraft engine maker and Dow component United  
Technologies said it would buy Sundstrand for about $4.3 billion in 
cash and stock, in a move that will expand United Technologies' 
aerospace and aviation businesses. United Technologies' shares were 
up 1/16 at 125 1/2, after making back a loss of more than 2 points, 
and Sundstrand's shares were up 10 1/4 at 68 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Telecom Italia, the leading telecommunications service  
provider in Italy, is the target of a hostile takeover bid by 
smaller rival Olivetti. Telecom Italia's shares were up 7 1/16 at 
113 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Tyson May Lose Jail Privileges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson will learn Wednesday whether  
he'll lose privileges and time off for good behavior for hurling a 
TV during an outburst in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion faces a closed hearing at  
Montgomery County (Md.) Correction Center that day and a ruling 
will be announced then, the county's Department of Corrections said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Department spokesman Eric Seleznow said jail officials cited  
Tyson for destruction of property, assault on correctional staff 
and disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	A disciplinary panel will determine Tyson's level of  
responsibility. Penalties could include loss of privileges and 
credit for good behavior in time served. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old boxer has been in an isolation cell since  
Friday, when he tossed a television set against jail bars in an 
inmate recreation area. He reportedly became agitated when a guard 
hung up a telephone he was using. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officials have three working days to have a hearing to  
consider all the facts relevant to the incident,'' Seleznow said. 
``At this point, we're not considering criminal charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jail officials Monday assessed Tyson's medical care, said a law  
enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is serving a one-year sentence for assaulting two men  
after a minor traffic accident in August in suburban Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	His jail outburst occurred two days after jail officials began  
withholding his daily dose of Zoloft, an antidepressant medication 
prescribed to manage what doctors have described as mood swings, a 
boxing source who requested anonymity told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who testified at Tyson's licensing hearing before the  
Nevada Athletic Commission in October said he is frequently 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	He is being treated by Dr. Richard Goldberg, chairman of the  
psychiatry department at Georgetown University Medical Center. The 
boxing source said Goldberg had unsuccessfully attempted to 
persuade jail officials to allow Tyson to continue his medication. 
</P>
<P>
	A Georgetown spokesman on Friday said Goldberg would not comment  
on the latest developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoloft is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the  
treatment of depression, panic disorder and obsessive compulsive 
disorder. Experts say abruptly withholding the medication from a 
patient would not lead to enhanced mood swings, but it could affect 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the major rules in medicine is don't rock a stable  
boat,'' said Dr. John Greist, a clinical psychiatry professor at 
the Institute of Medicine in Madison, Wis. Greist, who began 
working with Zoloft three years before its FDA approval in 1991, 
has prescribed Zoloft for more than 200 patients. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that if Zoloft reduced irritability, anger and  
aggression, then ``discontinuing it gradually or abruptly would 
permit those inherent characteristics to reemerge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before last Wednesday, Tyson had taken Zoloft on a daily basis  
for four months with the exception of the week preceding his Jan. 
16 fight with Francois Botha. A boxing source, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said he began taking it again the day after 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson won a fifth-round decision against Botha in his first  
since losing his boxing license for biting Evander Holyfield during 
a championship bout in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	While training for the Botha fight in Phoenix in December, Tyson  
appeared in good spirits. The week of the fight Tyson was combative 
at times, using profanity in one exchange with a television 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty pageant  
contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was released 
from prison in March 1995 after serving three years. Indiana 
officials will consider whether to revoke his probation based on 
his legal problems in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no contest to the Maryland charges, but has until  
March 7 to appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's advisers hoped he would be assigned to a prerelease  
program within 60 days. His assignment to a halfway house would 
have enabled him to resume his training, but this latest episode in 
jail could affect his eligibility for that program.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen in late  
profit-taking Monday after rising earlier on speculation that Group 
of Seven finance officials had approved a lower rate for the 
Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar edged higher against the euro. In late New York  
trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1028, down from $1.1076 late 
Friday. Also in late trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.91 
Japanese yen, down from 121.15 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar climbed to an 11-week high against the yen during  
early trading. Investors later sold yen after the G-7 meeting of 
industrial nations failed to say anything about exchange rates 
following a weekend meeting. Investors interpreted that as 
officials' approving of the falling yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was aided by Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's  
influential vice finance minister for international affairs, who 
was quoted in a Tuesday newspaper saying he favored a weak yen, a 
continuation of his position last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``An excessive rise in the yen should be avoided. Although we  
will not refer to a target level, we must send a message (to the 
market) at some point,'' he was quoted as saying in an interview 
published in Tuesday's Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper. Sending a 
message would mean intervening in foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was a little sensitive to that'' and took the yen  
lower against the dollar, said Jeremy Fand, a foreign exchange 
strategist at BankBoston's Boston office. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar did end the day lower against the yen as  
profit-taking set in. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially fell against the euro in Asian trading  
following weekend comments by Hans Tietmeyer, president of 
Germany's central bank, who intimated that a weak euro was 
worrisome for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was surprisingly supportive of the euro,'' Fand said. But  
the dollar later got a boost from rising U.S. stocks and bonds. 
``That's always good news,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4495 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4468, and 1.4962 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4852. The British 
pound rose to $1.6258 from $1.6226. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7734 German 
marks, up from 1.7658; 5.9488 French francs, up from 5.9207; and 
1,754.39 Italian lire, up from 1,748.25.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Education Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today asked the nation's  
governors to support his proposed education reforms, saying winning 
approval will be ``tough politics'' but ultimately worth the 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some will say the federal government should be giving states  
more flexibility, not demanding more accountability,'' Clinton 
said. ``I say it's a false choice, and the federal government 
should be giving you more of both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Vice President Al Gore held a roundtable discussion  
at the White House with 53 governors from the states and 
territories attending the National Governors' Association's annual 
winter meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sought to find common ground with governors who are  
split along political lines over the federal role in improving the 
performance of public schools. Democrats have largely backed 
Clinton's proposal, while Republican governors say Washington 
should have limited say in the way education dollars are used. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is tough politics. I don't know that I could have passed  
this through my legislature,'' Clinton said, referring to his 
tenure as governor of Arkansas. ``We don't have any business 
telling you whom to hire, how to teach, how to run schools. ... But 
let's not kid ourselves. We're not doing our children any favors by 
continuing to subsidize practices that do not work and failing to 
invest in practices that do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware Gov. Thomas Carper, chairman of the association, said  
governors ``want and expect both'' flexibility and guidance from 
the federal government when it comes to education. He said he 
expects the governors can resolve their differences over the issue 
and unite behind a common agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can find some middle ground, and we want to work  
hard to that end,'' Carper said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carper, a Democrat, also cautioned Clinton that states would  
not accept federal interference over the way states use money from 
their settlement with the tobacco industry. He said they would 
deliver the same message to congressional leaders Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't want ... is the federal government simply  
telling us how to spend our money,'' Carper said. ``Keep that in 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, a Republican, was more succinct:  
``This is state money. The federal government was invited to 
participate, but declined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals include building or modernizing 6,000  
classrooms, hiring 100,000 teachers, reducing class size in the 
early grades, starting more after-school programs, connecting all 
classrooms and libraries to the Internet, stopping social promotion 
and insisting on effective discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said his education plan is simply a means for the  
federal government to expand upon reform measures that already are 
under way in states such as North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania, 
Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not dream up these ideas in Washington,'' Clinton said.  
``I could mention every governor in this room in some specific or 
another, because these ideas represent the best practices in 
education reform today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also lavished praise on Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for  
proposing that his state set aside some of its tobacco settlement 
money for a children's foundation named in memory of Bush's late 
Democratic predecessor, Lawton Chiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us who knew and cared for Lawton, we are profoundly  
grateful for that,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Wells: Yanks Are Still in My Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- On his first day with the Toronto Blue  
Jays, David Wells said part of him was still with the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the enemy now but they are in my heart and on my  
mind,'' Wells said Monday, four days after New York dealt him to 
Toronto for Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, who has always been a Yankees fan, became a star in New  
York by pitching a perfect game against Minnesota last May. He even 
wore an original cap worn by Babe Ruth on the mound one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fun while it lasted,'' the 35-year-old left-hander  
said. ``There were no heroes last year; we just played as a team. I 
love everyone of them as my brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, who didn't want to talk about his feelings on the day of  
the trade, was angry at reporters who went to his residence in Palm 
Harbor, saying they were ``invading my privacy,'' and at one point 
made an obscene gesture at media members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming onto private property is something that's uncalled  
for,'' he said. ``It's something that in the situation that went on 
was very emotional for me. But to come over to my house and bother 
me like that, is very inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells began his major league career with the Blue Jays in 1987  
and spent six years in Toronto before being released. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm clear-minded and ready to get started and ready for the  
1999 season, to help this team win the pennant,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto general manager Gord Ash said he has no intention of  
trading Wells. Cleveland and the New York Mets have been mentioned 
as possible suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not discuss any deals with David Wells,'' Ash said.  
``In the words of George Bush: Read my lips -- David Wells will not 
be traded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the stunning trade, Wells went to Miami for a few days  
of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went down there, played golf and saw some friends,'' he  
said. ``Being traded isn't fun, but I'm a grown man and I can 
adapt. It's tough to leave a team that won 125 games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto thinks the deal, in which it also acquired reliever  
Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush, makes it a wild-card 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Toronto got the better part of the deal,'' Wells said.  
``The key to winning is pitching and this team has some good 
pitchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have to prepare himself for a return to SkyDome, a much  
different place to play than Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different culture in Toronto and you have to adjust,''  
he said. ``The fans aren't like in New York but they're fans. Now 
I'll make those fans happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells said his carefree personality won't change.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just like to have fun; I just like to be me,'' he said.  
``It's what my Mom made me -- she made me a complete person. You 
live your life the way you want it, as long as you do your job 
between the lines.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co. Tops Soft Money List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tobacco giant Philip Morris, which pushed for  
defeat of anti-smoking legislation last year, gave $2.4 million in 
so-called soft money to the two major political parties over the 
last two years, the advocacy group Common Cause said Monday. The 
company gave more than any other contributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris contributed $2 million to the Republicans and  
$419,164 to the Democrats, between Jan. 1, 1997, and Dec. 31, 1998, 
according to Common Cause, which supports public financing of 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans last June killed legislation that would have  
raised an estimated $516 billion over 25 years through a $1.10 tax 
increase on a pack of cigarettes and would have given the 
government new authority to regulate nicotine. Philip Morris also 
was the biggest soft money giver during the 1995-96 election cycle, 
Common Cause said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money is not subject to federal contribution limits and is  
supposed to be used for party-building activities such as 
get-out-the-vote drives. Increasingly, the money is being used for 
issue advertisements that support or oppose a political party but 
do not specifically urge a vote for or against a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	In helping to defeat the bill, the tobacco industry gave more  
than $40 million in the first half of 1998 lobbying Congress and 
another $40 million on television commercials opposing the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tobacco company, R.J. Reynolds, contributed $1.1 million  
in soft money, $1 million of that to the GOP, in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	The second- and third-largest soft money givers during the  
1997-98 election cycle were labor unions that made all of their 
contributions to the Democrats: the Communication Workers of 
America, $1.5 million, and the American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees, $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions strongly opposed a Republican plan to require them to get  
the written consent of their members before using dues for 
political purposes. Labor also opposed legislation allowing 
President Clinton to bring trade agreements to Congress for a 
straight yes-or-no vote without amendments, a procedure known as 
fast track. Both proposals failed to pass in the last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties overall raised $193 million in soft money during the  
1997-98 election cycle, more than double the $85 million they took 
in during the previous off-year elections, 1993-94.

<HEADLINE> Belle Reports Early to Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Albert Belle not only joined the  
Baltimore Orioles two days early, he talked about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle strode to the back fields and took some swings in the  
batting cage. He also threw in the outfield and signed some 
autographs on his way to the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	```I've said all along that I'll put forth the effort to work  
with the media,'' Belle said. ``Spring training is a lot easier to 
talk to everyone. Once the season starts, I won't be accessible 
every day, but I've become more and more accessible every year 
compared to the past, when I just cut everybody off. It's been a 
gradual improvement and we'll just go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was the only AL player to rank in the top three last year  
in batting average (.328), homers (49) and RBIs (152). He exercised 
an escape clause in his contract with the Chicago White Sox and 
signed a $65 million, five-year contract with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees had expressed interest in Belle before  
re-signing Bernie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather have come to Baltimore than the Yankees,''  
Belle said. ``You look at their situation, they're the kingpin and 
you want to be that underdog that knocks them off the top. That's 
pretty much the situation I've been in my whole career. It just 
makes for a better season when you knock the big guys off the 
top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no arguing that Belle would have a big impact in  
the lineup, the Orioles had to consider his numerous suspensions 
and controversies. Manager Ray Miller had a lengthy discussion with 
Belle in Baltimore after the signing and said he was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attitude thing, I haven't seen any problems,'' Miller  
said. ``I was quite taken aback when I spent some time with him, 
how articulate and candid he was about everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked me right in the eye and said, `I'll be the first one  
here and the last one to leave. I study film, I take my own notes 
and I play every day.' If there's a manager who doesn't like to 
hear that statement, something's wrong,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	A left fielder and cleanup hitter most of his career, Belle is  
projected as a right fielder and No. 3 hitter in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I broke in as a right fielder in '89 so that's nothing new to  
me,'' Belle said. ``I didn't realize that B.J (Surhoff) only made 
three errors in left field, so if playing right field is what it 
takes for us to get over the top, that's fine. I'd rather hit 
fourth. It'll be an adjustment for me, but that's what spring 
training's for.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Soar; Dow Gains 212.73 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices blasted higher Monday, pushing the  
Dow industrials to within 90 points of an all-time high, amid 
renewed confidence that interest rates would stay low and that the 
market for mergers and acquisitions is still hot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 212.73, or by 2.3  
percent, to 9,552.68, its biggest point gain in five weeks. That 
left the Dow 1 percent shy of the record 9,643.32 reached Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was moderate, with 874.62 million shares changing hands  
on the New York Stock Exchange, and advancing issues had a 9-to-5 
lead on decliners on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad-market indexes posted solid gains as well.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index was up 58.41, or by 2.6 percent, at  
2,342.01 amid a renewed interest in Internet and other technology 
shares. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index added 32.92, or 2.6 
percent, to 1,272.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Even veteran market experts were somewhat at a loss to explain  
the strong rally at a time when big-name stocks already are trading 
at prices that many fear are excessively above company earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been worried about the market for several years  
because the valuations in the big-cap stocks have risen so high and 
the broad market hasn't kept pace,'' said Larry Wachtel, the 
Prudential Securities market strategist. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts are coming to terms with the extraordinary  
resilience of large-company stocks, Wachtel said. With interest 
rates so low, big companies can borrow easily to make acquisitions. 
They can also afford to make technological improvements that boost 
productivity and help their earnings and stock prices, Wachtel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big companies are able to ... fend better, and as a result,  
people continue to buy the big-cap companies because they can do 
the deals, spend on the technology,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The market got a lift from a drop in bond-market interest rates  
ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's semiannual 
testimony on the state of the economy. Greenspan appears before the 
Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday morning and testifies Wednesday 
before the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	With inflation tame despite a robust economy, and with a third  
of the world in recession, Greenspan is not expected to signal any 
move to raise interest rates and cool off the market and the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation that his testimony would be upbeat for the  
market, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 5.35 percent from 
5.38 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower rates encouraged a broad rally in stocks, from  
financial and technology issues to retail, transportation and 
consumer issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led higher by IBM, which rose 6 5/16 to  
177 15/16; American Express, up 5 5/16 at 108 1/2; WalMart, up 3 1/2 at 
88 1/5; and Merck, up 2 4/5 to 81 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also helped higher by some merger news, although  
some of the stocks directly involved in merger discussions actually 
went down. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements included a bold attempt at a hostile takeover  
of Telecom Italia, the leading telecommunications service provider 
in Italy, by smaller rival Olivetti. Telecom Italia's U.S. shares 
rose 3 3/8 to 109 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, aircraft engine maker and Dow component United  
Technologies said it would buy Sundstrand for about $4.3 billion in 
cash and stock, in a move that will expand United Technologies' 
aerospace and aviation businesses. United Technologies shares 
initially fell on the news but ended up 1 1/16 at 126 1/2. 
Sundstrand's shares added 10 1/4 to 68 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	In the energy arena, Dominion Resources agreed to buy gas and  
oil-pipeline company Consolidated Natural Gas for $6.3 billion. The 
union would create one of the country's largest electric and gas 
utilities. And Sempra Energy agreed to acquire KN Energy, a big 
natural-gas pipeline and storage operator, for $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Resources shares fell 2 1/4 to 40, and Consolidated  
Natural Gas fell 1 1/16 to 55 3/16. Sempra's shares fell 3/4 to 21 5/8, 
while KN's shares added 1/8 to 21 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover bids buoyed prices throughout the market. The  
American Stock Exchange's market index climbed 7.46 to 700.03, and 
the NYSE composite added 13.67 to 600.23. The Russell 2000 index of 
mid-sized companies added 5.52 to 397.82. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas stock markets, the Nikkei index in Tokyo rose 1.13  
percent. In Europe, the FT-SE 100 index in London added 0.64 
percent, the DAX in Frankfurt added 0.89 percent, and the CAC in 
Paris advanced 0.86 percent.

<HEADLINE> University Features Judd Poster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Ashley Judd is heating things up for the  
University of Kentucky ice hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
	A free team poster, featuring the actress clad in only a  
Kentucky hockey jersey, helped double attendance to Cool Cats games 
this season. Hockey coach Ian Wood described the reaction as 
``absolutely unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not even begin to think it would be as big a success  
as it was,'' Wood told Sunday's edition of the Lexington 
Herald-Leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Judd's allegiance to Kentucky's men's basketball team is well  
documented with her frequent appearances at games. But she decided 
to help out the hockey team at the request of a cousin, who roomed 
with some of the players. In all, 5,000 posters were given away -- 
and not just to hockey fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know we had so many deans of so many departments,''  
Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team gets minimal funding from the university and relies on  
dues and gate concessions. This season, Wood said, the team will 
have a surplus for the first time.

<HEADLINE> NFL Players Sent to Europe League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If Andre Ware makes it back to the NFL this  
season, it will be by way of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware, the 1989 Heisman Trophy winner and a first-round draft  
pick by Detroit, signed in January with the Oakland Raiders. He did 
not play last season after three years in the Canadian Football 
League, which followed four weak seasons in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Ware was one of 152 players allocated to play in NFL  
Europe this year. The six-team league will have 15 quarterbacks who 
were on NFL rosters in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality of the players being allocated by NFL teams is  
getting better every year,'' said Oliver Luck, president of NFL 
Europe, which has three teams in Germany, one in the Netherlands, 
one in Scotland and one in Spain. ``We want to give those players 
the best possible opportunity to play and develop their skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos allocated seven players,  
including linebacker Nate Wayne, who as on the championship game 
roster. NFC champion Atlanta is sending one player, linebacker Shad 
Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans allocated 12 players, while Kansas City is sending  
11 and Philadelphia made 10 available to NFL Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The league begins play the weekend of April 17-18.

<HEADLINE> CIA Killer Wants Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAVERLY, Va. (AP) -- A Pakistani man sentenced to death for the  
fatal shootings of two CIA employees outside the spy agency's 
headquarters said he wants the International Court of Justice to 
hear his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mir Aimal Kasi said he hasn't received justice in the United  
States and should be considered a political prisoner who ``did my 
moral duty by attacking CIA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I demand that my case be tried in the International Court of  
Justice,'' he said in an interview with The Associated Press at a 
Virginia prison death row. 
</P>
<P>
	He requested that the government of his native Pakistan and  
Amnesty International take up his cause. 
</P>
<P>
	William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International  
USA in Washington, D.C., said he was unaware of Kasi's request. 
``This matter would have to be forwarded to the international 
secretary in London'' for a decision, Schulz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without intervention by the international court -- the principal  
judicial arm of the United Nations -- Virginia will execute Kasi 
when his appeals are spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I will be executed because this is a very sensitive  
and political type of case,'' Kasi said. ``The government wants to 
make an example that any other Muslim who harms Americans in the 
future will know something will happen to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about being executed at all,'' he added.  
``Being a Muslim, I'm not afraid of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasi, 34, was tried and convicted in November 1997 as Mir Aimal  
Kasi but said that name is erroneous because of a misprint on his 
visa. He said his real name is Aimal Khan Kasi. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Kasi opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle  
outside CIA headquarters in Fairfax County during the morning rush 
hour on Jan. 25, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He fled the next day to Pakistan and eluded a global manhunt for  
4 1/2 years before FBI agents tracked him down and returned him to the 
U.S. Kasi confessed to the slayings during the return flight, 
saying he was angry over CIA meddling in Muslim nations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has no regrets about killing CIA communications  
worker Frank Darling, 28, and CIA analyst and physician Lansing 
Bennett, 66, as they sat in their cars at a stoplight. Three other 
men were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider them part of CIA,'' he said ``It was an act of  
retaliation and revenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasi said he would have preferred to have killed the director of  
the CIA. ``I was not able to find his timing of coming and going,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his initial plan was to attack the Israeli embassy in  
Washington, D.C. He settled on the CIA because the embassy ``was 
not good for a one-man rifle attack. It would be good for a bomb 
attack, but I could not make a bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slight, bearded Kasi, dressed in a burgundy shirt and denim  
trousers, was relaxed and talkative, smiling often, during the 
interview Thursday in which he sat in a small room behind a glass 
partition. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he believes he will be executed, Kasi said he will  
not abandon his appeals, rejected in November by the Virginia 
Supreme Court but yet to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot drop my appeals because I have to try to save my  
life. If I didn't fight to the last moment, it would be like 
suicide,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, he said he whiles away the days by saying his prayers,  
watching TV, reading and visiting with his best friend and fellow 
death row prisoner, Derek Barnabei, sentenced to death in 1995 for 
a rape and murder in Norfolk.

<HEADLINE> Dominion Resources Eyes Gas Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Dominion Resources Inc. is buying  
Consolidated Natural Gas for $6.3 billion in stock in a deal 
creating one of the nation's biggest electric and natural gas 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company under the deal announced today will serve  
nearly 4 million retail customers in five states and generate $8.8 
billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination would give Dominion more size to remain  
competitive in a deregulated energy market. Many states, including 
Virginia, are abandoning the state-regulated monopoly system of 
utilities and are opening the sale of energy to competition in 
hopes of promoting lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition also would move Dominion further into oil and  
gas exploration and production, which many electric utilities have 
avoided in recent years because the business did little to add to 
growth in profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will operate a major interstate gas pipeline system  
and the largest natural gas storage system in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Dominion has derived nearly all its earnings from its  
Virginia Power unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Hamlin, an analyst with First Union Capital in Richmond,  
said the deal reflects a growing national trend that unites 
electric generating companies with pipeline companies. The union 
gives Dominion more retail customers and puts Dominion in more 
markets, Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh-based Consolidated, a natural gas exploration and  
distribution firm, owns four local gas distribution companies -- 
East Ohio Gas Co., People's Natural Gas Co., Hope Gas Co. and 
Virginia Natural Gas -- that supply 1.9 million people in Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. It also owns 7,600 miles 
of gas pipelines in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, West 
Virginia and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal approved Sunday, Dominion Resources will  
acquire all the shares of CNG. CNG stockholders will own about 43 
percent of the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It unites two of the most respected names in electricity and  
natural gas and provides us the critical mass needed for today's 
dynamic energy sector,'' said Thomas E. Capps, Dominion Resources' 
chairman, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion expects the deal will boost revenue and cut costs by  
approximately $150 million to $200 million annually by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it anticipates ``minimal workforce reductions.'' The  
combined company will employ about 17,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated shares jumped $3.50 to $56.25 Friday in New York  
Stock Exchange trading on rumors of a deal. Dominion Resources 
shares fell $1.5625 to $42.25. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for Dominion to exchange 1.52 shares of its stock  
for each Consolidated share. That represents a premium of 25.3 
percent over the average closing stock price of CNG shares during 
past 20 trading days. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading today, Consolidated shares fell 68 3/4 cents to $55.56 1/4  
while Dominion lost $1.68 3/4 to $40.56 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Race Tensions Flare in L.A. Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Early this month, a white principal at a  
mostly Hispanic elementary school was beaten up outside by two men 
who told him: ``We don't want you here anymore, principal. Do you 
understand that, white principal?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January, another Los Angeles-area school dropped its  
observance of both Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo after 
Hispanics complained they were getting only one day of attention 
compared with a whole month for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two racial flare-ups illustrate the challenges faced by Los  
Angeles-area schools as urban neighborhoods are transformed by new 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our communities are changing quickly,'' said Lee Wallach,  
executive director of Days of Dialogue, a nonprofit conflict 
resolution group that led mediation talks after the attack on the 
principal. ``L.A. is such a melting pot and so transient and these 
communities are changing, really monthly. When that happens and no 
one's talking to each other, it creates a lot of hostility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Bernstein, the 65-year-old principal at Burton Street  
Elementary, was beaten on Feb. 1 in an attack police are 
investigating as a hate crime. He told police that at least one of 
the assailants was Hispanic. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on the 40-year district veteran led to angry words  
among teachers, parents and administrators, who blame each other 
for creating a volatile atmosphere at the 750-student school, which 
is 90 percent Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton Street Elementary is in Los Angeles' Panorama City  
section, in the San Fernando Valley. The neighborhood had a more 
even balance of whites and Hispanics back in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents had been pushing for Bernstein's replacement for  
the past year by a Spanish-speaking principal. They complained he 
was insensitive to their concerns over Proposition 227, the state 
law banning bilingual education. They also accused him of trying to 
thwart their efforts to obtain waivers allowing their children to 
remain in bilingual classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want justice for our kids,'' parent Lorena Aguilar  
said. ``There are students who tell their parents they don't want 
to come to school. What will happen when they get to junior high or 
high school?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein has not gone back to work since the attack and has not  
returned calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of whether predominantly ethnic schools should have  
principals and administrators who speak the same language is at the 
heart of much of the tension in the 600,000-student Los Angeles 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	District leaders, as well as Mayor Richard Riordan, strongly  
believe administrators should be chosen on the basis of ability, 
not cultural background. 
</P>
<P>
	Some school board members disagree, siding with a growing number  
of ethnic parents who feel their children are best served by 
administrators of the same background. 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan has said such talk only serves to further divide the  
city. When School Board President Victoria Castro suggested Burton 
Street parents had a right to want a Spanish-speaking principal, 
Riordan responded angrily by saying Mrs. Castro should ``wash her 
mouth out with soap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just outside the city, Inglewood High School dropped both Black  
History Month and Cinco de Mayo this year for fear of the violence 
and student walkouts that have occurred during the past several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Inglewood High was once overwhelmingly black, but in a  
transformation that began in the late 1980s, it is now nearly 60 
percent Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, Inglewood High was forced to close for a day after a  
riot broke out and dozens of police were called in. A task force 
found that the fight began, in part, because Hispanic students were 
angry that blacks got a whole month to celebrate their heritage. 
Cinco de Mayo marks a May 5, 1862, victory in Mexico's battle for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Lowell Winston has told teachers instead to follow a  
``multicultural education approach'' throughout the school year and 
``talk about all cultures and contributions all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't continue to do things the way they were done in the  
past,'' he said. ``This school has had racial problems that are 
unique. The old ways didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the Los Angeles school district, three black teachers  
and a 13-year-old black former student at South Gate Middle School 
near Watts have filed a lawsuit alleging the district failed to 
halt discrimination against them at the school, which is more than 
98 percent Hispanic vs. 63 percent back in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	At Burton Street Elementary, Mia Regalado doubts her 9-year-old  
son Steven will learn how to read anytime soon, not with educators 
and parents busy trying to ease racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Ms. Regalado, whose son is repeating second grade because  
of his inability to read: ``I'm not so much concerned about race as 
I am about a teacher's ability to teach.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial To Recess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's landmark antitrust trial, which  
already has dragged on months longer than anyone expected, will 
recess during the entire month of March and part of April. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge announced the new schedule Monday, citing a criminal  
trial he must attend and another case in Philadelphia being argued 
by the government's lead lawyer, David Boies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said the Microsoft  
trial will resume no sooner than April 12, and possibly later if 
either of the other two trials continues past that date. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said Monday he expected Microsoft's final four  
witnesses to finish testifying by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the six-week break, Microsoft and the government will  
present for the judge their rebuttal arguments to sum up their 
cases, using three witnesses each. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began in late October and was expected to last six to  
eight weeks, in part because of mechanisms the judge put in place 
to speed things along. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge required all witnesses except one, an executive for  
Intel Corp., to submit their testimony in writing in advance, and 
he limited each side to a dozen witnesses plus the three allowed 
during the rebuttal phase. However, the cross-examination of 
witnesses has taken much longer than planned.

<HEADLINE> 'Payback,' 'Message' Top Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Costner's romantic ``Message in a  
Bottle'' and Mel Gibson's violent ``Payback'' both hit it big at 
the box office this weekend, estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``October Sky,'' the story of a coal miner's son with dreams of  
building rockets, opened to respectable business by grossing a 
studio-estimated $6 million for fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other new releases, the workplace comedy ``Office Space''  
and the bad-girl teen movie ``Jawbreaker,'' did lackluster 
business. ``My Favorite Martian'' continued to do attract 
theatergoers after two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Message in a Bottle,'' starring Costner as a widower who finds  
love again, and ``Payback,'' a violent revenge story with Gibson as 
a double-crossed criminal, both had estimated three-day grosses of 
$10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	If the estimates are correct, ``Message'' had a slightly higher  
per-location average since it was playing on fewer screens. Final 
figures are due today. 
</P>
<P>
	``October Sky's'' fifth-place opening launches it closer to the  
Brendan Fraser fish-out-water comedy ``Blast from the Past.'' The 
comedy, co-starring Alicia Silverstone, made $6.1 million for 
fourth, according to the studio. But several rivals disputed New 
Line's estimate for ``Blast'' as too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``October Sky's'' per-location average of just more than $4,000  
was hardly stellar, buy was still the second-highest of the 
wide-releases, just behind ``Message in a Bottle.'' That's an 
encouraging sign for a small movie that is tricky to market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a film that needs to find its place in the marketplace  
because of the importance of the word of the mouth,'' said Nikki 
Rocco, president of Universal Pictures distribution. ``I think it 
has that word of mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Academy Award nominations helped the Elizabethan romance  
``Shakespeare in Love'' and Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private 
Ryan.'' ``Shakespeare'' grossed $5.8 million for fourth place and 
the re-issue of ``Ryan'' got $2.4 million for 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	The new business for ``Ryan,'' pushed the World War II saga  
passed last summer's space adventure ``Armageddon'' to become the 
highest-grossing film released in 1998. ``Ryan'' now has grossed 
$203.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The other best-picture nominees for the March 21 awards, ``Life  
is Beautiful,'' ``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Elizabeth,'' were out 
of the top 10. Italy's ``Life is Beautiful,'' the tragic-comedy 
story set against the Holocaust, was 11th with $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the box office was down more than 11 percent from the  
same weekend last year, as 1999 still can't compete with the 
``Titanic''-powered 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new releases stumbled. ``Office Space,'' from the creator  
of ``Beavis and Butt-head,'' opened with $4.3 million for eighth 
place, and ``Jawbreaker'' -- trying to compete in the crowded teen 
movie market -- didn't even make the top 10 with its $1.6 million 
gross. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, another teen film, ``She's All That,'' grossed $5.4  
million in its fourth week for seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, ``My Favorite Martian,'' the big-screen adaptation of  
the 1960s sitcom, lost just 24 percent of its business in the 
second week to collect $6.7 million for third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rushmore,'' the quirky love-triangle tale with Bill Murray,  
also maintained most of its audience, collecting $2.7 million for 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday. Final figures were expected today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. (tie) ``Message in a Bottle,'' $10.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	1. (tie) ``Payback,'' $10.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``My Favorite Martian,'' $6.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Blast from the Past,'' $6.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``October Sky,'' $6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $5.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``She's All That,'' $5.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Office Space,'' $4.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Rushmore,'' $2.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' $2.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Source Links Tyson Outburst, Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson had been taken off anti-depressant  
drugs two days before he became enraged and threw a television set 
in a Maryland jail, a source told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's daily dose of Zoloft was stopped after he refused to be  
evaluated by a prison physician on grounds he had already been 
examined by a team of psychiatrists, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was put in an isolation cell at the Montgomery County  
Detention Center after the incident, and he faces a hearing either 
today or Tuesday that could lead to anything from a reprimand to 
further jail time for the former heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Goldberg, Tyson's regular doctor who heads the  
psychiatric program at Georgetown University, apparently couldn't 
convince prison officials that the fighter should stay on the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson had been taking Zoloft on a daily basis for the past four  
months, except for the week prior to his Jan. 16 fight with 
Francois Botha. He was weaned gradually from the drug during that 
week, and began taking it again the day after the fight, said the 
source, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither jail officials nor Goldberg could be reached for  
comment. A call to the home of Tyson's Washington, D.C. attorney, 
Paul Kemp, was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was in a common area with other prisoners on Friday and  
was talking on the phone when a guard came in and hung up the 
phone, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action enraged Tyson, who picked up the television set and  
threw it against some bars. Tyson, the source said, immediately 
apologized and offered to pay for the TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Massachusetts General testified at Tyson's licensing  
hearing before the Nevada Athletic Commission in October that Tyson 
was often depressed, but that his mood swings could be controlled 
if he took the proper medication. 
</P>
<P>
	On the medication, Tyson was cheerful and cooperative in  
interviews with reporters when training for the Botha fight in 
Phoenix in December. The week of the fight, though, he was 
combative at times and engaged in a profanity-laced tirade against 
a New York television reporter four days before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was being held in an 8-by-5-foot isolation cell pending a  
hearing either today or Tuesday on a citation for destruction of 
county property in the jail in the Washington, D.C., suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, 32, was sentenced Feb. 5 to a one-year jail sentence for  
assaulting two men after a minor traffic accident in August in 
Gaithersburg. Tyson pleaded no contest to the charges, but might 
appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's advisers had been hoping he would be put in a  
pre-release program within 60 days of beginning his sentence that 
would allow him to stay in a halfway house and leave during the day 
for training. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident with the television, though, could harm hopes of an  
early release. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer is also on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty  
pageant contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He served 
three years in prison and was released in March 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana officials say they will wait to see what happens in  
Maryland before deciding whether to revoke his probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson stopped Botha in the fifth round of their fight, his first  
since losing his boxing license for biting Evander Holyfield during 
a championship bout in June 1997.

	Regulatory Hurdle in Olivetti Plan

<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Olivetti SpA's bid for the world's sixth-largest  
phone company ran into a regulatory obstacle that will make it 
easier for Telecom Italia to defend itself against the hostile $58 
billion offer. Italy's stock market regulator, Consob, said 
Olivetti's weekend filing failed to meet the standards for a 
full-fledged takeover announcement. That's important because 
Italian law limits the defense a company can mount once it becomes 
the target of a takeover bid ruled valid by Consob. Telecom Italia 
shares were at 109 13/16, up 3 3/8. Olivetti shares were up 0.531 to

local Bell telephone companies' efforts to provide long-distance

prices in 1996. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in

<HEADLINE> CompuServe Gets a Makeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CompuServe, the pioneering online service that  
was overtaken and then taken over by America Online, hopes to stage 
a comeback by reaching beyond the pocket protector crowd without 
becoming another AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe, whose online users were long identified by geeky  
strings of numbers instead of catchy nicknames, unveiled Monday a 
multimillion dollar marketing push with user-friendly software, 
flashier features and lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	While the campaign is designed to attract a broader group of  
professionals such as small business owners, don't expect 
CompuServe to become too much like parent AOL, which pioneered an 
easy-to-use format for the online masses. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL wants to keep CompuServe a distinct, more elite service --  
part of a broader strategy of nurturing the businesses it acquires 
as niche brands for specific customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What AOL is trying to do is get beyond their traditional  
subscriber base, and get into a market that's a bit more 
sophisticated,'' said Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with Jupiter 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	With users finding more convenient ways online, CompuServe's  
subscriber base has fallen from about 2.6 million to 2 million 
since it was taken over by AOL as part of a three-way deal with H&AMP;R 
Block and WorldCom in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	To revive itself, CompuServe plans to mail out diskettes of its  
software upgrade, which supports higher-speed modem connections and 
is easier for users to install and customize on their personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mailing will be targeted more to business professionals,  
a sharp contrast with the ``carpet'' mailings of millions of 
diskettes AOL is known for. 
</P>
<P>
	New subscribers will see a ``Main Menu'' screen with a  
continuously updated news ticker featuring headlines from The 
Associated Press, market analysis from CBSMarketWatch.com and 
personalized news folders -- more sophisticated offerings than AOL 
members get. 
</P>
<P>
	But other features will become more like AOL's.  
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe's e-mail will be modeled after the easier-to-use  
version that helped AOL become the world's leading online service 
with more than 16 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	And subscribers will be given simpler user names, and the domain  
name will be shortened from ``compuserve.com'' to ``cs.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a new pricing plan, members would pay just $9.95 a month  
for 20 hours of online access, with each additional hour billed at 
less than 5 cents a minute. The offer will last for several months, 
depending on how many people sign up. CompuServe has been charging 
existing members $9.95 a month for five hours of use, with each 
extra hour costing $2.95. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, CompuServe is cutting the cost of unlimited access  
from $24.95 to $19.95 a month. But CompuServe officials downplayed 
this offer, saying that 80 percent of their online users choose 
limited access. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL hopes to charge advertisers a premium for targeting upscale  
CompuServe users, who may have more money to spend on a new 
computer or other big-ticket items than AOL users who may explore 
chat rooms for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go down and sit down to talk to advertisers about  
CompuServe, they really see it as a dream audience,'' CompuServe 
chief operating officer Audrey Weil said. But, she added, 
CompuServe will offer discounts to advertisers to try to get them 
to try marketing through CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has enjoyed some success with its strategy of snapping up  
companies with distinct identities and keeping their images 
distinct. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, AOL bought the ICQ Web site and its instant messaging  
software, which alerts users when their friends are on the Web and 
lets them chat and send files directly to other users' computer 
desktops. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns that ICQ users, the technology-elite, would  
flee AOL, ICQ last month said membership nearly doubled since the 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL says it will employ the same strategy when it completes its  
acquisition of Netscape Communications, the pioneer of Internet 
browser software. Netscape will keep its headquarters in Mountain 
View, Calif. and maintain a separate workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe, too, retains it original headquarters in Columbus,  
Ohio, and much of its staff. Whether AOL succeeds in reviving it 
will be another key test of an AOL strategy that resembles cable 
television, with each channel targeting a different audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as Weil said, ``Think of AOL like the USA Today newspaper.  
CompuServe is a little bit like the New York Times. It's a more 
serious newspaper.''

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed in Newspaper Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- A man pleaded innocent to arson charges  
Monday in connection with a weekend fire that destroyed the offices 
of a local newspaper and a dozen other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	George Aldrich, 26, a former tenant of the building, was ordered  
to a hospital for a 20-day observation period, said Anson Kaye, a 
spokesman for prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire early Saturday consumed the three-story brick building  
that housed The News Tribune -- a 7,500-circulation community 
newspaper serving readers in Newton and Waltham -- a military 
recruiting office, offices belonging to the Massachusetts 
Parent-Teacher Association Inc., a violin repair shop and several 
other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, The News Tribune, which publishes only on weekdays,  
printed a front page with a headline reading ``Out of the Ashes'' 
and a photo of a violin maker with an instrument that was spared by 
the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper's editors and reporters were relocated to Needham at  
the central offices of parent company Community Newspaper Co., the 
Fidelity-owned newspaper group that publishes papers in dozens of 
Massachusetts communities.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Starters Throw Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- If ever there was an image to scare AL teams,  
it was on view Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens, David Cone, Orlando Hernandez, Andy Pettitte and  
Hideki Irabu all throwing together off bullpen mounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found myself watching them and not getting my work done,''  
Cone joked. ``It was pretty unique to see all of us throwing at the 
same time. It may be the only time this spring, because we will 
going about our individual work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As was the case when Clemens threw for the first time in a New  
York uniform Saturday, fans lined a stadium ramp to watch the five 
pitchers go through the 15-minute session. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was funny. I walked in there and suddenly there they  
were,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``A little theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Clemens remains a focal point among the fans, the  
five-time Cy Young Award winner has quickly adjusted to his new 
team following his acquisition from Toronto last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a couple days, everything feels like normal again,''  
Clemens said. ``It feels good to be settling in and getting into 
the routine. I'm happy to be on the field with these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any questions about Clemens' fitting in were answered on Monday.  
The pitcher and shortstop Derek Jeter, who was drilled by a Clemens 
pitch at spring training last year, talked in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, in jest, said the Yankees hit by Clemens in the past  
``would get him back when he least expects it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to turn the page ... he wasn't trying to hurt me''  
Jeter said. ``He's one of those guys you don't want to face when 
he's on the other team. When he's on your team, he'll back you 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five starters got through their workouts fine, but Mike  
Stanton, the lone veteran left-handed reliever, will be out a few 
days by a reoccurring lower back problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chronic thing he has. It comes and goes,'' Torre said.  
``It's usually one time during the spring after we've had a few 
workouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Centerfielder Bernie Williams has the flu and did not work  
out Monday ... Torre may consider going with 10 pitchers in April 
and carrying catcher Mike Figga, who is out of options. ... Torre 
said Darryl Strawberry, coming back following colon cancer surgery, 
was a little tired Monday and did not take batting practice. ... 
Outfielder Paul O'Neill reported with the position players and said 
the highlight of his offseason was playing drums for John 
Mellencamp during a concert in Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> India Leader Praises Pakistan Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India reached a landmark in its foreign  
relations in weekend peace talks with its neighbor and nuclear 
rival Pakistan, India's president said today in his traditional 
address opening the budget session of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit Saturday to Pakistan  
-- on the first commercial bus service between the two countries in 
51 years -- was heralded by President K.R. Narayanan as a historic 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time an Indian prime minister had visited  
Pakistan in 10 years and the first since the rivals declared 
themselves nuclear powers last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a joint session of the two houses of Parliament,  
Narayanan said Vajpayee went to Pakistan to express ``India's deep 
desire for peace and friendship with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ended their  
talks Sunday in the Pakistani border city of Lahore with a pledge 
to reduce the risk of an accidental nuclear war, stop interfering 
in each others' affairs, strengthen mutual trust by such steps as 
giving advance warning of ballistic missile tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders also pledged to increase political, trade and other  
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought three wars since the independent  
nations were carved out of a British empire in 1947. They continue 
to skirmish regularly over Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided 
between them and claimed by both. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuclear tests by both countries last May brought their enmity to  
world attention, increasing pressure for them to resolve their 
differences. Narayanan said the weekend summit will ``mark a new 
chapter in our bilateral ties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Narayanan also pledged today that India would never be the first  
to use nuclear weapons and would work toward global disarmament.

<HEADLINE>  ABC Set To Air Lewinsky Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky was very frank about her  
feelings toward President Clinton and Kenneth Starr in an interview 
with ABC but had a hard time explaining her attraction to married 
men, Barbara Walters said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters met with reporters to describe her long-awaited  
interview with the former White House intern, who has yet to appear 
in public to discuss her relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview took place Saturday in New York and will be  
broadcast over two hours starting at 9 p.m. EST on March 3, the 
final day of a television ``sweeps'' period used to set advertising 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is open, she is expressive, she is sometimes very  
touching,'' Walters said. ``Sometimes when she describes herself 
you realize she can be very difficult. She is funny and extremely 
articulate. This is not a Valley Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the impeachment saga, Ms. Lewinsky was hotly pursued by  
interviewers, including talk show host Roseanne, who offered Ms. 
Lewinsky more than $1 million to talk. ABC did not pay for the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she chose Walters because she felt it was the  
best way to establish her credibility, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Monica was a little apprehensive in the beginning but  
was not nervous,'' Walters said. ``She looked very striking in 
appearance, very attractive. Once she began I think she forgot 
there were cameras there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most difficult question for her to address is why she gets  
involved with married men, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky is ``teary'' at some points, but ``this is not a  
sobbing interview,'' Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	After nailing down the interview in November, ABC had to wait  
until last week for permission from Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky balked only once at answering a question due to  
restrictions placed on her by Starr. It concerned the events of 
Jan. 16, 1998, when she was first questioned about her relationship 
with Clinton by Starr's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr had asked that Ms. Lewinsky have a lawyer present during  
the interview, and she was told not to characterize what was said 
to her by prosecutors, Walters said. Instead, Ms. Lewinsky talks 
about how she felt during the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also insisted Ms. Lewinsky not comment on other  
investigations being conducted by the special prosecutor, according 
to ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC has not decided whether it will air excerpts of the  
interview before March 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky gave another interview to British news anchor Jon  
Snow on Sunday at her mother's New York apartment. It will air in 
Britain on March 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Channel 4 would not comment on the amount it paid for the  
interview, but the British national news agency Press Association 
reported the sum was $660,000.

<HEADLINE> IOC Inquiry To End This Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC plans to end its investigation this  
weekend into possible misconduct by members implicated in the Salt 
Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials said Monday the six-man investigative panel  
will begin meeting late this week at International Olympic 
Committee headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have three options,'' said one panel member, speaking on  
condition of anonymity. ``We can exonerate (members). We can issue 
a warning or propose a warning, or we recommend expulsions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings will be private, with no news conferences or  
announcements planned, pending final decisions by the IOC executive 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do hope we will have completed our work by the end of the  
week,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard said. ``We will then 
prepare recommendations for the executive board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No board meeting is scheduled until March 14-15, just before the  
March 17-18 general assembly called to deal with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said it is possible the board could decide earlier by  
conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to the executive board if they want to wait until the  
14th or take a decision next week,'' he said. ``In any case, there 
will probably be nothing to announce before early next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the IOC inquiry panel recommended the expulsions of  
six members for accepting cash payments, scholarships for their 
relatives or other inducements stemming from Salt Lake City's bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those six members has since resigned, joining two others  
who had quit previously. The IOC panel notified three other members 
they were still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, 10 additional members were cited for possible rules  
violations in a report by a Salt Lake City ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cases of expulsion will be put to next month's general assembly,  
where a two-thirds vote is required for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Chilean IOC member Sergio Santander, one of those  
facing expulsion, resigned as president of his country's national 
Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-year-old Santander has admitted receiving $4,700 from Tom  
Welch, former president of the Salt Lake City bid organizers, but 
called it a personal contribution to an unsuccessful political 
campaign in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the previous cases, the IOC sent letters seeking  
explanations to those members named in the Salt Lake report. The 
members were given a chance to reply in writing or in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to study the files for which we've sent letters  
to all the members on the second list,'' the panel member said. 
``The general interest is to decide on the cases as soon as 
possible, especially for the members themselves whose names have 
been mentioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official said he believes the commission will also complete  
its inquiry into the three previous pending cases involving South 
Korea's Kim Un-yong, Russia's Vitaly Smirnov and Ivory Coast's 
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, a senior IOC executive board member, is the highest-ranking  
official implicated in the Salt Lake case. He was cited in both the 
IOC's internal investigation and that of the Salt Lake ethics 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has mounted an aggressive defense, describing the  
allegations against him as a politically motivated plot to smear 
his name and undermine his ambitions to succeed Juan Antonio 
Samaranch as IOC president. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel member said it's possible that not all remaining cases  
will be completed this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not unthinkable that we might need more information on  
one or two cases,'' he said. ``This is a serious matter. You are 
not going to judge on incomplete documents or information. You 
cannot rule out that some cases will be deferred to the future. I 
would hope not in the interest of the members themselves, but you 
cannot be sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Also, Kevan Gosper, an Australian member of the IOC's  
executive board, rebuked John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance 
president Dave D'Alessandro for speaking out against the 
international committee's handling of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed he should be debating this in public as if he  
is the conscience of the IOC,'' Gosper said.

scandal. 
</P>

Committee's executive board, said he was dismayed that David 
D'Alessandro had aired his criticism through the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed he should be debating this in public as if he  
is the conscience of the IOC,'' said Gosper, one of the IOC 
leadership's chief spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, president of Boston-based John Hancock Mutual Life  
Insurance, has been the only corporate executive so far to publicly 
challenge the IOC over its handling of the Salt Lake bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock has canceled negotiations with NBC for $20 million  
in Olympic advertising and removed the Olympic rings from its 
stationery. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro voiced his complaints in interviews and in written  
opinion pieces in U.S. newspapers that the IOC was losing 
credibility every day it allowed the scandal to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think D'Alessandro's comments are unfortunate,'' Gosper said  
in a telephone interview from Melbourne, Australia. ``I think it's 
quite improper for him to debate this through the media. After all, 
he's a (Olympic) partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call to John Hancock seeking comment from  
D'Alessandro was not immediately returned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his criticism nearly two weeks ago, D'Alessandro said he had  
taken his concerns to top IOC officials and ``their response was 
`We're going to investigate thoroughly and we're going to do things 
right.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock is one of 11 major international corporate sponsors of  
the Olympics who pay around $50 million for exclusive advertising 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors fear their investment is being devalued by the  
continuing fallout from Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four IOC members, a fifth of the total roster, have been  
implicated in receiving cash payments, scholarships, free health 
care and other improper inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock was one of the companies represented when top sponsors  
met with IOC marketing chiefs in New York 10 days ago. The sponsors 
strongly urged the IOC to clean up the scandal quickly or risk a 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, (the sponsors) are demonstrating their concern,''  
Gosper said. ``It's understandable. The reputation of our rings has 
been tarnished. But, from my corporate experience, the way to 
manage this is to quietly talk with your partners, not to debate it 
through the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper also urged IOC investigators to move quickly to clear any  
members who are innocent of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was concerned that some members have been left in  
limbo for too long and should be exonerated before the March 17-18 
general assembly called to deal with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members have either resigned or been ousted in the scandal.  
Three others have been under investigation since December, and 10 
additional members were cited in the Salt Lake ethics panel report 
issued earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC inquiry commission, headed by vice president Dick Pound,  
is to meet late this week and this weekend to deal with the 
remaining cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the Salt Lake panel had unfairly cited some members,  
including Australia's Phil Coles, by failing to contact them in 
advance for their version of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with the current procedure is that anyone who has  
been mentioned appears to be guilty of misconduct,'' he said. 
``This is a very unfortunate situation. To rectify that, the Pound 
commission should act quite rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board, which must finalize any verdicts, is not  
scheduled to meet until March 15-16.

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Gets Amnesty After 41 Yrs. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A North Korean believed to be the  
world's longest-serving political prisoner was one of 1,508 people 
granted amnesty Monday by South Korea's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Woo Yong-gak, imprisoned for 41 years, was one of 17 men  
convicted of spying for North Korea to be freed under a sweeping 
amnesty that will take effect Thursday, the first anniversary of 
President Kim Dae-jung's inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	Woo, 70, has been held in solitary confinement since being  
captured aboard a North Korean boat off South Korea's east coast in 
1958. 
</P>
<P>
	The amnesty will also affect 7,304 other people convicted of  
various crimes who have been out of prison on parole. They will 
have their civil rights restored or their criminal records erased. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amnesty is aimed at achieving a grand national  
conciliation and giving one-time offenders an opportunity to take 
part in national efforts to revive the economy,'' Justice Minister 
Park Sang-cheon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those pardoned include 2,700 people convicted of pilferage and  
other ``minor economic crimes'' and fined up to $4,100. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's battered economy was bailed out by the  
International Monetary Fund in late 1997. Petty crimes have since 
increased sharply as unemployment soared to a record 7.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those pardoned were several prominent dissidents convicted  
of making illegal visits to North Korea, including Lim Su-kyong, a 
former college student. Her 1989 visit to North Korea significantly 
heightened tension between the two Koreas. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluded from the amnesty was Kim Hyun-chul, a son of former  
President Kim Young-sam, because his appeal of a three-year 
sentence for bribery and tax evasion is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Since taking office nearly a year ago, Kim has released 180  
political prisoners who signed an oath to obey South Korean laws, 
including one making it a crime to espouse communism. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 17 convicted spies, held for between 29 to 41 years,  
have refused to sign the oath, saying that would violate their 
freedom of conscience and endanger their families in the communist 
North. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the government decided not to demand an oath.  
</P>
<P>
	The minister indicated the government may allow the 17 men to  
return to their families in a deal with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Extraordinary measures are under study,'' Park said.  
</P>
<P>
	North Korea is demanding the return of three convicted spies who  
had been previously released from prison under amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean officials have floated the idea of a possible swap  
of all 20 for about 300 surviving South Korean war prisoners 
believed still held in North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups welcomed the government's decision not to  
demand an oath from the convicted spies but complained that only 41 
``prisoners of conscience'' were released. 
</P>
<P>
	They claim that over 200 political prisoners still remain in  
jail.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Apple Growers Leaving Business / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDNEYVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina apple growers, faced with  
stiff competition and declining demand, are getting out of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Many growers left falling apples to rot last year because it  
wasn't worth their while to harvest them. This year, these farmers 
are either leveling their orchards or looking for new ways to sell 
their apples. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been tough,'' said Gene Klimstra, apple marketing  
coordinator for the North Carolina Farm Bureau. ``We probably lost 
2,000 acres of apple orchards last year, and we'll probably lose 
another 2,000 acres this year. It's gotten hard to make any money 
at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It used to be that a North Carolina grower -- most of whom work  
in seven foothill and mountain counties -- could clear between 
$20,000 and $30,000 a year on a 75-acre orchard site. But in 1998, 
many North Carolina growers made no profit or went into debt. 
</P>
<P>
	A drought last year at the height of the growing season lasted  
well into the harvest. The Asian financial crisis reduced export 
markets and foreign competition has siphoned away the apple juice 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the state of Washington, aggressive marketing and  
cold-storage facilities have taken the advantage North Carolina 
once enjoyed by having the first apples of each year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, apples from Henderson County and elsewhere brought $24  
million to North Carolina, once the seventh-biggest grower of 
apples among the states. By the end of last year, that figure had 
slipped to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When the industry was strongest, in the 1970s, about 16,000  
acres were cultivated statewide. If Klimstra's projections are 
correct, there will be 5,500 acres this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Henderson County, where good soil and cool late summer and  
autumn nights makes the area perfect for growing apples, Todd 
Thompson quit the business Jan. 1 after raising apples for 28 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson says in some ways local growers hurt themselves. They  
overproduced the Red Delicious variety when consumers were showing 
a preference for firmer and more exotic apples. They also set up 
too many roadside stands, he said, hoping to lure tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to Florida ... you're only going to stop for  
oranges one time,'' Thompson said. ``You're not going to stop and 
sample oranges all the way from here to Orlando.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There use to be as many as 26 packing houses in Henderson  
County. Last year, just seven packing houses remained in operation. 
And the three biggest instate buyers of North Carolina apples -- 
Gerber baby foods, National Fruit, which made apple sauce, and 
Seneca, which made juice -- never opened their doors, forcing 
producers to haul their crops out of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Thompson is uprooting his trees and burning them. An  
untended apple orchard is an incubator for insects and disease, and 
Thompson does not want to harbor red mites, aphids, scab and blotch 
that could spread to healthy orchards. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's friend, Richard Staton, 46, will keep raising apples  
in Henderson County. Staton has razed 50 acres of Red Delicious, 
but will replant with varieties for which there is a market. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, his family business took out a loan for a $500,000  
building in which he can store 90,000 bushels of apples in a 
low-oxygen atmosphere, keeping them almost as fresh as when they 
were picked for up to 13 months. This gives him a product he can 
deliver to Gerber at its Arkansas processing plant in May, when no 
fresh apples are coming off trees anywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``You either change with the market,'' Staton said, ``or get  
out.''

<HEADLINE> Source Links Tyson Outburst, Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson had been taken off anti-depressant  
drugs two days before he became enraged and threw a television set 
in a Maryland jail, a source told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's daily dose of Zoloft was stopped after he refused to be  
evaluated by a prison physician on grounds he had already been 
examined by a team of psychiatrists, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was put in an isolation cell at the Montgomery County  
Detention Center after the incident, and he faces a hearing either 
today or Tuesday that could lead to anything from a reprimand to 
further jail time for the former heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Goldberg, Tyson's regular doctor who heads the  
psychiatric program at Georgetown University, apparently couldn't 
convince prison officials that the fighter should stay on the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson had been taking Zoloft on a daily basis for the past four  
months, except for the week prior to his Jan. 16 fight with 
Francois Botha. He was weaned gradually from the drug during that 
week, and began taking it again the day after the fight, said the 
source, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither jail officials nor Goldberg could be reached for  
comment. A call to the home of Tyson's Washington, D.C. attorney, 
Paul Kemp, was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was in a common area with other prisoners on Friday and  
was talking on the phone when a guard came in and hung up the 
phone, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action enraged Tyson, who picked up the television set and  
threw it against some bars. Tyson, the source said, immediately 
apologized and offered to pay for the TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Massachusetts General testified at Tyson's licensing  
hearing before the Nevada Athletic Commission in October that Tyson 
was often depressed, but that his mood swings could be controlled 
if he took the proper medication. 
</P>
<P>
	On the medication, Tyson was cheerful and cooperative in  
interviews with reporters when training for the Botha fight in 
Phoenix in December. The week of the fight, though, he was 
combative at times and engaged in a profanity-laced tirade against 
a New York television reporter four days before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was being held in an 8-by-5-foot isolation cell pending a  
hearing either today or Tuesday on a citation for destruction of 
county property in the jail in the Washington, D.C., suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, 32, was sentenced Feb. 5 to a one-year jail sentence for  
assaulting two men after a minor traffic accident in August in 
Gaithersburg. Tyson pleaded no contest to the charges, but might 
appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's advisers had been hoping he would be put in a  
pre-release program within 60 days of beginning his sentence that 
would allow him to stay in a halfway house and leave during the day 
for training. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident with the television, though, could harm hopes of an  
early release. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer is also on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty  
pageant contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He served 
three years in prison and was released in March 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana officials say they will wait to see what happens in  
Maryland before deciding whether to revoke his probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson stopped Botha in the fifth round of their fight, his first  
since losing his boxing license for biting Evander Holyfield during 
a championship bout in June 1997.

<HEADLINE> College Produces 2 Grammy Nominees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEVELLAND, Texas (AP) -- Big-city record producers often say that  
star quality and stage savvy can't be taught in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks in the small community of Levelland hope to prove that  
notion wrong when two alumni of South Plains College's commercial 
music program -- Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks and Lee Ann 
Womack -- compete at the 41st annual Grammy Awards on Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Womack is nominated for best female country vocal  
performance. The Dixie Chicks, long known around Texas for their 
contemporary country sound, are nominated for three awards, 
including best new artist and best country album. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lee Ann is a very energetic, enthusiastic performer who gave  
100 percent every performance at SPC,'' recalled her instructor, 
John Hartin, creator of the commercial music program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Natalie has incredible musical energy and takes command of any  
material she is performing. I certainly hope they both win a 
Grammy. I feel that they are the ones who ought to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program teaches students the skills they need to walk out  
and become professional musicians, including songwriting, 
performing, navigating the industry and writing music for 
instruments they don't know how to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Womack graduated in 1985, Ms. Maines in 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	Hartin, who traveled the country with his band The Classics in  
the late '60s, took a position at South Plains College in 1975 
because he wanted to escape the sleepless nights and small-town 
diners of life on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a place that a person could go to learn about  
what it takes to survive in the music business,'' Hartin said. 
``You could learn music and you could learn business but to learn 
how the two intermingled was impossible in 1975 when I came here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartin's vision began with classes in the women's gymnasium and  
drew six students from the small towns around Levelland, the aptly 
named, pancake-flat community near the New Mexico state line. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the program is staffed by 10 full-time faculty members and  
has more than 60 students. The college of 6,700 students also 
boasts two TV studios and several recording studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Heath Wright, lead singer for the country band Ricochet and a  
graduate of the school's music program, said the training boosts an 
aspiring star's chances of success. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn a lot about songwriting and creativity,'' Wright  
said. ``Many bands are out there reproducing other people's sounds. 
Out there, they teach you how to find your own sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cory Williams, a third-year student, found himself playing  
alongside country music artist Ray Price when the musician was 
passing through Lubbock and needed a fiddle player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to play the whole show with him because I was able  
to sight-read the music,'' Williams said. ``You can never have a 
guarantee, but people who get their degree here seem to be doing 
pretty well these days.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial To Recess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's landmark antitrust trial, which  
already has dragged on months longer than anyone expected, will 
recess during the entire month of March and part of April. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge announced the new schedule Monday, citing a criminal  
trial he must attend and another case in Philadelphia being argued 
by the government's lead lawyer, David Boies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said the Microsoft  
trial will resume no sooner than April 12, and possibly later if 
either of the other two trials continues past that date. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said Monday he expected Microsoft's final four  
witnesses to finish testifying by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the six-week break, Microsoft and the government will  
present for the judge their rebuttal arguments to sum up their 
cases, using three witnesses each. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began in late October and was expected to last six to  
eight weeks, in part because of mechanisms the judge put in place 
to speed things along. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge required all witnesses except one, an executive for  
Intel Corp., to submit their testimony in writing in advance, and 
he limited each side to a dozen witnesses plus the three allowed 
during the rebuttal phase. However, the cross-examination of 
witnesses has taken much longer than planned.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices retreated early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a gloomy outlook for U.S. 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans posted new lows for the ninth consecutive session as  
market participants see few rays of light in the supply and demand 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is expected to harvest a near-record competing crop in  
the coming weeks amid sharply lower world demand because of 
economic turmoil that has left the biggest importers hurting for 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the gloomy outlook are predictions that U.S. farmers  
this spring will plant even more acreage to soybeans than they did 
last year, when they produced a record-large crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also retreated as market participants sought to  
find a level at which export demand will be stimulated and domestic 
feed demand will pick up. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures suffered the least, finding some support from  
continued-steady demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.53 1/2 a bushel; March  
corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.14 1/2 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at 
$1.01 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 5 1/4 cents to $4.73 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle was unchanged at 66.70 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .33 cent to 73.02 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .07 cent to 45.75 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 1.5 
cents to 52.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks-Pirates Trade On Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates' 2-for-1 trade with the  
Arizona Diamondbacks -- supposedly a done deal last week -- remained 
on hold Monday with Pirates general manager Cam Bonifay uncertain 
if it will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates planned to send second baseman Tony Womack and  
outfielder Al Martin to Arizona for outfielder Bernard Gilkey as 
soon as they signed shortstop Pat Meares. But the deal stalled over 
the weekend when Pittsburgh balked at paying any of Gilkey's $6 
million in deferred salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to report,'' Bonifay said from the Pirates'  
spring training camp in Bradenton, Fla. ``They said they were going 
to consider some things and get back to us, but there's nothing 
new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonifay talked Monday with Diamondbacks general manager Joe  
Garagiola Jr., but Arizona did not alter its offer either by paying 
more of Gilkey's contract or throwing in another player. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates want Arizona to pay the difference in the $6 million  
owed Martin through the 2000 season and the $11 million due Gilkey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be nice to have this resolved ... to the point of  
Diamondbacks making a decision,'' Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkey, who slumped in 1997 and 1998 after hitting 30 homers and  
driving in 117 runs with the New York Mets in 1996, is owed $2.5 
million in base salary each of the next two seasons. He also is due 
$2.5 million each year in deferred salary and one additional $1 
million deferred payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The deferred salary goes into an annuity that will pay Gilkey $1  
million a year for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought the trade would eventually be done, Bonifay  
said, ``I don't know. I can't honestly say that. It's not in my 
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade would allow both sides to deal off outfielders who  
prefer to play elsewhere; Martin first asked Pittsburgh to trade 
him last season. But it would cost the Pirates their only proven 
leadoff hitter in Womack, the two-time NL stolen base champion and 
the player most coveted in the trade by Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., was counting on the deal  
being completed and has yet to leave for camp. Womack arrived in 
Florida 10 days ago and said he is preparing as if a trade wasn't a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	But with position players due in camp Wednesday, Martin must  
decide whether to report to a team that has spent much of the 
offseason trying to deal him. He lost his starting job when Bonifay 
swung off-season trades for left fielder Brian Giles and center 
fielder Brant Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonifay realizes Martin will be unhappy if he reports to  
Bradenton, and is concerned about the effect that would have on his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned for both Tony and Al because of this being so  
publicly well known,'' Bonifay said. ``You've got to go back and 
talk to the players. We have to tell them we still like them. ... 
I'm not going to say that both players' feelings have not been 
affected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin hasn't talked to reporters in recent days, but has told  
friends on the Pirates he is discouraged the trade has not been 
completed. Mike Benjamin, who played for Boston last season, also 
can't be too happy after signing with the understanding he would 
play either second or shortstop, positions now filled by Womack and 
Meares. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got excellent depth in the middle infield ...  
with Tony on the club, Mike Benjamin and (spring invitee) Rafael 
Bournigal. The middle of the diamond turns into one of our 
strengths,'' Bonifay said. ``We're going to be excited about 
getting underway, to be honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Arizona trade falls through, Bonifay said it doesn't  
mean the Pirates must begin the season with their current roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we need to make a move, it's not like we have to make it on  
the first day of spring training,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Meares reported to Bradenton on Monday after landing  
neither the length or value of contract he wanted. He turned down 
an $11 million, three-year offer from Minnesota last fall and 
reportedly sought $4 million a year, only to sign with Pittsburgh 
for less than half that. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was no progress in talks with first baseman Kevin  
Young, who wants a five-year contract worth about $30 million. The 
Pirates have offered $16.5 million over three years. Young said he 
will not discuss negotiations once camp begins.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Soar; Dow Gains 212.73 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks prices climbed aggressively today, as  
optimism about lower interest rates and a few high-priced takeover 
deals encouraged investors to dip back into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 212.73 at 9,552.68, led by banking and technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher, with the Nasdaq composite  
up 58.81 at 2,342.41, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 31.87 
at 1,271.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was moderate, with 715.58 million shares having changed  
hands on the New York Stock Exchange, and advancing issues had a 
9-to-5 lead on decliners on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices rose, pushing interest rates down, ahead of Federal  
Reserve Chairman Greenspan's semi-annual testimony on the state of 
the economy before the Senate Banking Committee, scheduled to begin 
at 10 a.m. EST Tuesday. Greenspan will discuss modernization of the 
financial-services industry with the same panel later Tuesday, and 
on Wednesday, he will address the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chairman goes to Capitol Hill on a high note, after data  
released last Thursday and Friday showed an economy still growing 
while price inflation remains quiet. Stock investors, taking their 
cue from lower interest rates in the bond market today, were 
betting that his testimony will do nothing to upset the delicate 
balance of strong growth and low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was up 15/32 point, pushing its yield,  
which moves opposite the price, down to 5.35 percent from 5.38 
percent late Friday, amid optimism that Greenspan would have an 
upbeat message. 
</P>
<P>
	Even veteran market experts were somewhat at a loss to explain  
the strong rally. ``People have been worried about the market for 
several years because the valuations in the big-cap stocks have 
risen so high and the broad market hasn't kept pace,'' said Larry 
Wachtel, the Prudential Securities market strategist. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts are rethinking that idea and trying to square  
it with the extraordinary resilience of large-company stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a disinflationary world,'' Wachtel continued. ``Big  
companies are able to spend on technology and fend better, and as a 
result, people continue to buy the big-cap companies because they 
can do the deals, spend on the technology. Maybe there's a new 
paradigm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gainers on Wall Street cut a wide swath, from financial and  
technology stocks, which benefit from lower interest rates, to 
retail, transportation and consumer issues, which benefit in a 
growing world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led higher by IBM, up 6 5/16 at 177  
15/16; American Express, up 5 5/16 at 108 1/2; and WalMart, up 3 3/8 at 
88. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also helped higher by some merger news, including  
a bold attempt at a hostile takeover of Telecom Italia, the leading 
telecommunications service provider in Italy, by smaller rival 
Olivetti. Telecom Italia's shares were up 3 3/8 at 109 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Aircraft engine maker and Dow component United  
Technologies said it would buy Sundstrand for about $4.3 billion in 
cash and stock, in a move that will expand United Technologies' 
aerospace and aviation businesses. United Technologies shares 
initially fell on the news but were higher by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Resources agreed to buy gas and oil-pipeline company  
Consolidated Natural Gas for $6.3 billion. The union would create 
one of the country's largest electric and gas utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra Energy agreed to acquire KN Energy, a big natural-gas  
pipeline and storage operator, for $1.9 billion.

<HEADLINE> GOP Gears Up for N.Y. Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says a  
decision by Hillary Rodham Clinton to run for the Senate from New 
York would only add to his desire to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans also gave notice that the first lady would  
face a rough-and-tumble battle for the seat. It's the kind of race 
that lovers of politics ``kind of salivate over,'' former Sen. 
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of Democrats are urging Mrs. Clinton to run for  
the Senate seat that opens up next year when Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, D-N.Y., retires. She has said she is giving serious 
thought to the idea, and President Clinton has said he would 
support her if she decides to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls put her ahead of Giuliani, who also has yet to  
formally enter the race, but both sides agree it would be a 
bruising affair in which Mrs. Clinton would have to sacrifice her 
privacy and face attacks over Whitewater, her support for liberal 
causes and her statement last year in favor of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you it's no walk in the park,'' former Democratic  
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, who twice lost bids for a New York Senate 
seat, said in an interview with Time magazine. ``The tabloids try 
to eat you alive every day. Much worse, they go after your 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said he would be more inclined to run if Mrs. Clinton  
is his opponent. ``It would be the most focused-on race in the 
country,'' he said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``Starting off from 
the underdog position would probably be a good thing from my point 
of view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Amato, who lost his seat last November after a bitter battle  
with Democrat Charles Schumer, said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that 
trying again next year was ``certainly very tempting.'' He said 
there were at least two other attractive Republican moderates who 
could run successfully against Mrs. Clinton -- Reps. Jack Quinn and 
Rick Lazio. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton would be formidable but ``this is not a laydown,''  
D'Amato said. He speculated that the longer she waits to make her 
decision, the more likely it was that she will run. Republicans 
``are actually relishing the battle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat who thinks she shouldn't is former White House aide  
George Stephanopoulos, who, in an open memo to the first lady in 
this week's Newsweek, wrote that ``Whitewater, billing records, 
cattle futures, the travel office and Castle Grande (real estate 
development) will all be back. ... Do you really want to spend your 
last year in the White House reliving the most painful episodes of 
your tenure?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who has expressed her interest in  
the Senate seat, said she would gladly give up her plans to run if 
Mrs. Clinton enters the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she decides to run I will support her enthusiastically,''  
she said on Fox, adding that ``it's just a week after the 
impeachment is over and she deserves the time she needs'' to make 
that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Time also quoted Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who is urging the  
first lady to run, as saying he discussed the matter with Clinton 
when he joined him on an Air Force One flight to Mexico last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was more excited than I've ever seen him about anything,''  
Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one on the Sunday news programs, including the Republicans,  
made much of the fact that Mrs. Clinton, raised in Illinois and a 
longtime resident of Arkansas and Washington, has not lived in New 
York. New York has a history, with Robert Kennedy of Massachusetts 
and James Buckley of Connecticut, of electing out-of-staters to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said on NBC: ``Apparently, the  
president and first lady had decided some time ago to live in New 
York City when they left the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said on Fox that even  
as a person familiar with tough Chicago politics, ``I'm not sure 
why anybody from Illinois wants to stick their nose in New York 
politics.''

<HEADLINE> HMO Trade Group Urges Reviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As prospects for ``patients' rights''  
legislation brighten, the HMO trade group is urging its members to 
voluntarily let patients who are denied care appeal to outside 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
	And fearful that Congress will give patients the right to sue  
HMOs, the American Association of Health Plans says it could accept 
legislation requiring health plans to offer external appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	At its board meeting Monday, the group endorsed a set of  
principles for Congress to use in designing an external review 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be part of the discussion,'' said Karen Ignagni,  
the group's president, who will outline the board's actions at a 
news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Ignagni said, the group spent its energies fighting  
legislation mandating benefits and expanding the right to sue. It 
argued that any new requirements would drive up costs and force 
employers to drop insurance coverage. Now, with Congress set to 
act, things have changed, Ignagni said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we enter a year when people are looking at policy, we want  
to be clear on what we're prepared to say yes to,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	External appeals give patients the right to challenge decisions  
to doctors not associated with the insurance company. In recent 
months, many large health insurance companies have adopted these 
procedures on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are big differences among the federal and private  
proposals, including who pays for the appeals, who picks the 
external panel, the timeliness of the review and what services are 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO legislation was hotly debated last year, though Republicans  
and Democrats never engaged in serious negotiations and nothing 
ultimately passed. But chances appear much better in 1999 as 
Republicans look to prove they can do more than impeachment and 
President Clinton searches for a policy victory. 
</P>
<P>
	While Americans are generally happy with the health care they  
receive, many fear that cost-conscious insurance companies might 
deny care they may someday need. The right to appeal such denials 
is a central feature of every comprehensive proposal to regulate 
health maintenance organizations and other managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, patients generally got whatever care their doctors  
recommended, and health costs spiraled. Under managed care, the 
insurance company controls access to specialists and expensive 
tests and treatments, trying to avoid paying for unnecessary costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO trade group is not requiring its member plans to adopt  
appeals processes in order to remain in the group. That could come 
later this year, Ignagni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's actions are a step in the right direction, though the  
details will be crucial, said Judy Waxman, chief lobbyist for 
Families USA, a consumer group that is pushing for new laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like they're not just stonewalling, which is good,''  
she said. ``Obviously, the plans are trying to stave off any kind 
of ability to sue them. They may feel this is the lesser of two 
evils.''

<HEADLINE> Controversy for DiCaprio Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Life hasn't been a beach for Leonardo DiCaprio  
on the set of his new movie in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Beach'' has been awash in controversy and protests over  
the planting of non-native coconut trees and the smoothing over of 
sand dunes on Phi Island, where it is being filmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a stab at my reputation if I'm associated with a film  
that comes in and recklessly destroys things,'' DiCaprio said in 
the March 1 edition of Time. ``This is something I probably have to 
get used to -- lies culminating into something much more hysterical 
and out of hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiCaprio defended the movie, saying producers have worked hard  
to try and portray the landscape's beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts are that absolutely nothing wrong was done to that  
island,'' DiCaprio said. ``If anything, I've seen our people take 
meticulous care with every little branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Beach'' is based on Alex Garland's novel about an island  
paradise settled by a commune of world travelers. The movie marks 
DiCaprio's return to the big screen since taking a year off after 
the success of ``Titanic.''

<HEADLINE> Missles fly between Congress, White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans, unwilling to yield  
ground to President Clinton in fulfilling a longtime dream of 
building a national antimissile defense shield, are pressing for 
early votes on legislation to require a crash development program. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders want to make it, along with a 4.8 percent military  
pay raise, among the first items of business when Congress meets 
this week for the first time since Clinton's Senate impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House is threatening a veto -- even though the  
president earmarked $6.6 billion for a missile defense program in 
the budget he submitted only three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other problems, the administration claims the measure  
before Congress would interfere with talks beginning today in 
Moscow on modifications to the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot think of a worse way to begin a negotiation on the  
ABM treaty,'' White House national security adviser Sandy Berger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are crying foul, suggesting Clinton's main  
motivation is political-- to help Vice President Al Gore by 
undermining GOP attempts to use missile defense as a 2000 campaign 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is a scaled-down version of the Strategic Defense  
Initiative that President Reagan proposed in 1983 to protect 
American cities from incoming ballistic missiles -- a system that 
critics derided as ``Star Wars'' because it was originally intended 
to be space-based. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, the administration plan would set aside money for a  
missile defense program -- but delay a presidential decision on 
actually building one until June 2000. The legislation before 
Congress would do away with the presidential decision part, making 
deployment official U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the life of me, I can't understand the administration's  
position,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., the prime author of the 
House version. The threat to the U.S. mainland ``is here today and 
we have no defense against that threat. Why would you wait a 
year?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weldon said it would take three or four years to build such a  
system anyway, so the administration position only puts off a 
go-ahead until the middle of a presidential campaign year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, cosponsored by Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., will be acted  
on this week by the House Armed Services Committee. The measure, 
which has 30 Republican and 28 Democratic sponsors, states simply 
``that it is the policy of the United States to deploy a national 
missile defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version, by Sens. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and John  
Warner, R-Va., adds a phrase declaring that the system should be 
deployed ``as soon as is technologically possible.'' The measure 
was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee on a 12-7 vote 
and is on this week's Senate calendar. In the committee, Democratic 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut joined Republicans in voting 
for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Senate Republican leaders twice failed by one vote to  
win the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster against 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Armed  
Services Committee, vowed a similar battle this year, claiming 
``there will be extensive debate'' should Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss., try to bring the bill up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin wants consideration delayed at least until after U.S. and  
Russian negotiators work on possible modifications in the ABM 
treaty -- talks he acknowledges could stretch on for months. The 
treaty sharply restricts the kind of missile-defense system either 
nation can deploy. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional action now ``will undermine our chances of  
modifying the treaty,'' Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the technology to build such a system is at least three  
years off, ``Why would we want to needlessly commit ourselves to a 
deployment now?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Levin conceded that North Korea's firing of a ballistic  
missile over Japan last year, and concern about nuclear programs in 
Iran and Iraq, have increased the stakes. ``There is a real threat 
from North Korea that came a lot quicker than the intelligence 
community foresaw,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument that rushing ahead with a missile defense bill  
could upset the delicate ABM talks is unlikely to find much 
sympathy in the Republican-run Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Many conservatives, including Foreign Relations Committee  
Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., contend the ABM treaty is no longer 
valid and should be ditched because the Soviet Union no longer 
exists. Helms said recently it belongs ``in the dustbin of 
history.''

<HEADLINE> Graham `Shocked' by Collins' Signing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- At the end of last season, Kent  
Graham was the New York Giants' savior, leading the team to five 
victories in six games, including a win over Denver, the eventual 
Super Bowl champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite coach Jim Fassel's assurances, Graham knows that he is  
now the underdog to Kerry Collins, a free agent who agreed Friday 
to a $16.9 million, four-year, contract with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham is in the second year of a $3.5 million, three-year  
contract. His agent, Tom Condon, has been trying to get together 
with general manager Ernie Accorsi to upgrade the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make it clear, it's not a selfishness over the  
money,'' Graham said in a conference call Monday. ``The fact that 
Kerry makes five times more than me is not an issue. It's what that 
money means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing of the Collins signing and release of former  
starter Danny Kanell, Graham said he was ``shocked at first and 
disappointed, first off for Danny and second about my situation the 
way it is now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he chooses to believe Fassel, who said Friday that  
Graham will be the starting quarterback at the beginning of the 
1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been straight with me,'' Graham said. But he  
added, ``My agent thinks I'm crazy because you don't pay a guy that 
much money and have him sit on the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel, a former quarterbacks coach, has said he was eager to  
rehabilitate Collins, who was released during the season by the 
Carolina Panthers and waived afterward by New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins was dropped by the Panthers on Oct. 13 after reportedly  
telling then-coach Dom Capers that he didn't have the heart for pro 
football. Collins was waived by the Saints after completing 94 of 
191 passes for 1,202 yards, with four touchdowns and 10 
interceptions. Overall, he was 170-for-353 for 2,213 yards and 12 
TDs with 15 interception 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, who replaced Kanell after the Giants started 3-7, was  
105-of-205 for 1,219 yards, seven touchdowns and five interceptions 
in six starts. But the 1992 Giants draft pick has been less 
successful in a seven-year career that included stints in Detroit 
and Arizona, going 5-13 in 18 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said he doesn't expect Fassel to give him the luxury of a  
few bad starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a pressure to perform early on. I assume I'll start  
the first game,'' he said. ``I have to go out and play like I did 
last year.''

	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- From the far corner of the range Monday,  
Nick Faldo laid a club in the grass to work on his alignment, then 
turned around and hit lob wedges to a practice green behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years removed from his last tournament victory, two days  
away from a high-stakes match against Tiger Woods, Faldo is looking 
for what he calls ``synchronicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had better find it pretty quick.  
</P>
<P>
	The Match Play Championship begins Wednesday, a 64-man field of  
single elimination over 18 holes at La Costa Resort with an early 
flight home for anyone who gets off to a bad start, $1 million for 
the player who can win six matches over five days against the best 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good opportunity,'' Faldo said, hopeful that a victory  
over the world's top-ranked player can help rejuvenate a Hall of 
Fame career that has fallen into disarray since winning in Los 
Angeles two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship is the first of  
the new World Golf Championship events, each with a $5 million 
purse but none as compelling as this one. 
</P>
<P>
	Match play has not been a part of the PGA Tour since a two-year  
experiment in Tucson ended in 1985. It has not been used in a major 
event that brings together the best players in the world since the 
1958 PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is too young to be a major,'' said Mark O'Meara, the  
Masters and British Open champion. ``But this is the first time to 
get the top 64 players in match play, and there's a tremendous 
buzz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The field was determined by the top 64 in the world ranking  
published a week ago, and the brackets were drawn up like an NCAA 
tournament. If everything goes according to plan, Woods, David 
Duval, O'Meara and Davis Love III will meet in the ``Final Four'' 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't count on it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anybody in this field whom you can take  
for granted,'' O'Meara said. ``People need to know we're talking 
about the top 64 in the world. It isn't like the No. 3 player 
against No. 300. The top 70 or 80 players are world class who can 
beat anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the 64th seed happens to be Faldo, who once held  
the No. 1 spot for 81 consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	That spot currently belongs to Woods, who is starting to play  
like he deserves it. Woods ended a nine-month drought by winning 
the Buick Invitational two weeks ago in San Diego. He was in 
position to win again last week in the Nissan Open, taking a brief 
lead in the final round Sunday before finishing two strokes behind 
Ernie Els. 
</P>
<P>
	Already possessing awesome skills that have sent him soaring to  
the top of golf in just over two years, Woods loves the format as 
much as any American and is partially responsible for the renewed 
interest in match play because of his record three straight U.S. 
Amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like Tiger has been gearing up for this,'' Jesper  
Parnevik said. ``He's been talking about this for a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how far he has fallen, Faldo is also a master of match  
play, having won more Ryder Cup matches than anyone in its 70-year 
history. His 39 victories around the world include two World Match 
Play Championships in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he didn't arrive at La Costa equipped with the same level  
of confidence as Woods. While Woods was serving notice to Duval and 
everyone else that he can still win any time he sticks a tee in the 
ground, Faldo was home in Florida with his fingers crossed. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed his last two cuts on the European tour to slip to No.  
65 in the world ranking, and only got in the field when Jumbo 
Ozaki, who rarely plays outside Japan, decided not to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Faldo finds out what he can do with the opportunity. The  
fact the first five matches will be contested over 18 holes could 
be an advantage. Sunday's finals will be 36 holes, considered a 
fairer test of match play. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a stamina factor in 36 holes, and a bit more  
strategy,'' Faldo said. ``Eighteen holes is more like a sprint. But 
it's still match play. You play your opponent, don't you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen reporters followed him from the range to the 10th  
tee, and Faldo was clearly annoyed, sensing the hype over his 
opening match with Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, this must be my official tournament interview,'' he said.  
``You know it's a big ... tournament when they come onto the tee 
with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded by a spectator that there were children in the  
vicinity, Faldo pointed to reporters and said, ``Yes, they're right 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he turned around, hit his first drive down the middle and  
walked down the fairway with caddie Fanny Sunesson and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be like that Wednesday. Woods will be with him, as well  
as thousands of people swept up in the drama of match play.

<HEADLINE> GOP Set for a 1st Lady Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says a  
decision by Hillary Rodham Clinton to run for the Senate from New 
York would only add to his desire to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans also gave notice that the first lady would  
face a rough-and-tumble battle for the seat. It's the kind of race 
that lovers of politics ``kind of salivate over,'' former Sen. 
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of Democrats are urging Mrs. Clinton to run for  
the Senate seat that opens up next year when Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, D-N.Y., retires. She has said she is giving serious 
thought to the idea, and President Clinton has said he would 
support her if she decides to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls put her ahead of Giuliani, who also has yet to  
formally enter the race, but both sides agree it would be a 
bruising affair where Mrs. Clinton would have to sacrifice her 
privacy and face attacks over Whitewater, her support for liberal 
causes and her statement last year in favor of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you it's no walk in the park,'' former Democratic  
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, who twice lost bids for a New York Senate 
seat, said in an interview with Time magazine. ``The tabloids try 
to eat you alive every day. Much worse, they go after your 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said he would be more inclined to run if Mrs. Clinton  
is his opponent. ``It would be the most focused-on race in the 
country,'' he said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``Starting off from 
the underdog position would probably be a good thing from my point 
of view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Amato, who lost his seat last November after a bitter battle  
with Democrat Charles Schumer, said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that 
trying again next year was ``certainly very tempting.'' He said 
there were at least two other attractive Republican moderates who 
could run successfully against Mrs. Clinton -- Reps. Jack Quinn and 
Rick Lazio. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton would be formidable but ``this is not a laydown,''  
D'Amato said. He speculated that the longer she waits to make her 
decision, the more likely it was that she will run. Republicans 
``are actually relishing the battle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat who thinks she shouldn't is former White House aide  
George Stephanopoulos, who, in an open memo to the first lady in 
this week's Newsweek, wrote that ``Whitewater, billing records, 
cattle futures, the travel office and Castle Grande (real estate 
development) will all be back. ... Do you really want to spend your 
last year in the White House reliving the most painful episodes of 
your tenure?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who has expressed her interest in  
the Senate seat, said she would gladly give up her plans to run if 
Mrs. Clinton enters the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she decides to run I will support her enthusiastically,''  
she said on Fox, adding that ``it's just a week after the 
impeachment is over and she deserves the time she needs'' to make 
that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Time also quoted Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who is urging the  
first lady to run, as saying he discussed the matter with Clinton 
when he joined him on an Air Force One flight to Mexico last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was more excited than I've ever seen him about anything,''  
Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one on the Sunday news programs, including the Republicans,  
made much of the fact that Mrs. Clinton, raised in Illinois and a 
longtime resident of Arkansas and Washington, has not lived in New 
York. New York has a history, with Robert Kennedy of Massachusetts 
and James Buckley of Connecticut, of electing out-of-staters to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said on Fox that even  
as a person familiar with tough Chicago politics, ``I'm not sure 
why anybody from Illinois wants to stick their nose in New York 
politics.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Set To Air Lewinsky Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky was very frank about her  
feelings toward President Clinton and Kenneth Starr in an interview 
with ABC but had a hard time explaining her attraction to married 
men, Barbara Walters said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters met with reporters to describe her long-awaited  
interview with the former White House intern, who has yet to appear 
in public to discuss her relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview took place Saturday in New York and will be  
broadcast over two hours starting at 9 p.m. EST on March 3, the 
final day of a television ``sweeps'' period used to set advertising 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is open, she is expressive, she is sometimes very  
touching,'' Walters said. ``Sometimes when she describes herself 
you realize she can be very difficult. She is funny and extremely 
articulate. This is not a Valley Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the impeachment saga, Ms. Lewinsky was hotly pursued by  
interviewers, including talk show host Roseanne, who offered Ms. 
Lewinsky more than $1 million to talk. ABC did not pay for the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she chose Walters because she felt it was the  
best way to establish her credibility, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Monica was a little apprehensive in the beginning but  
was not nervous,'' Walters said. ``She looked very striking in 
appearance, very attractive. Once she began I think she forgot 
there were cameras there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most difficult question for her to address is why she gets  
involved with married men, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky is ``teary'' at some points, but ``this is not a  
sobbing interview,'' Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	After nailing down the interview in November, ABC had to wait  
until last week for permission from Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky balked only once at answering a question due to  
restrictions placed on her by Starr. It concerned the events of 
Jan. 16, 1998, when she was first questioned about her relationship 
with Clinton by Starr's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr had asked that Ms. Lewinsky have a lawyer present during  
the interview, and she was told not to characterize what was said 
to her by prosecutors, Walters said. Instead, Ms. Lewinsky talks 
about how she felt during the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also insisted Ms. Lewinsky not comment on other  
investigations being conducted by the special prosecutor, according 
to ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC has not decided whether it will air excerpts of the  
interview before March 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky gave another interview to British news anchor Jon  
Snow on Sunday at her mother's New York apartment. It will air in 
Britain on March 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Channel 4 would not comment on the amount it paid for the  
interview, but the British national news agency Press Association 
reported the sum was $660,000.

<HEADLINE> High Court's Hiring Record Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia defended  
the court's record on hiring minority law clerks Monday, saying the 
justices seek ``the best and the brightest law clerks we can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, Scalia  
disputed a suggestion from the audience that the justices have 
hired a disproportionately small number of female clerks. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``It is a problem with the numbers as far as  
minorities are concerned if you think the Supreme Court should have 
a complement of law clerks that looks like America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so,'' he added. ``I think we should have the  
best and the brightest law clerks we can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That is an objective that I would think that a Jewish group in  
particular would applaud, rather than seeking a system in which we 
have sort of racial quotas for these jobs,'' Scalia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP and others have accused the court in recent months of  
hiring too few minorities and women as clerks. The clerks help the 
justices screen new cases, do research and draft opinions. USA 
Today reported last year that blacks make up less than 2 percent of 
the 428 law clerks hired by the court's current nine justices 
during their tenures and that fewer than 25 percent of those clerks 
have been women. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to three black members of Congress last December,  
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist rejected calls for discussion of 
the issue with minority bar groups. 
</P>
<P>
	During Scalia's speech, when a member of the audience said the  
brightest law school graduates might look like a more diverse 
group, he countered, ``I'd be interested in what facts you have to 
establish that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All I have are the grades from law schools, the law school  
that the person graduates from and the recommendations of the law 
professors, and I pick my law clerks on the basis of that,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia, one of the court's most conservative justices, also  
outlined his view that the Constitution should be interpreted 
according to what it was understood to mean when it was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't use the original meaning of the text as your  
criterion to decide a case, what do you use? ... You will find 
there is nothing to use except your own prejudices,'' he said. 
``For the non-originalist, every day is a new day. You wake up and 
think 'I wonder what is unconstitutional today?'''

<HEADLINE> Animal Advocates Bid To Save Horses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- A month before Howard Brand died of  
cancer, the farmer amended his will to say he wanted his 1964 
Cadillac crushed and his animals destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after he died in January at age 88, animal rights groups  
hired a lawyer and launched a campaign to save the animals. Their 
fate now rests with a probate court judge, who decided Monday to 
consider whether it's legal to order the destruction of animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased that the judge is letting us be heard,'' said Mary  
Ingham, who is leading the campaign and whose uncle has taken care 
of the animals for years at Brand's farm in Essex Junction. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer for the estate and those who knew Brand say he wanted  
to ensure his animals -- believed to be four horses and a mule -- 
would not be treated poorly after he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not a man who abused animals, he was a man who was  
practical about animals,'' attorney Tom McCormick said Monday. 
``This was best for his animals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCormick contends the animals are private property and Brand  
had every right to destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Legislature permits this,'' he said. ``Laying down animals  
is not in of itself cruelty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the group trying to save Brand's animals argues that  
destroying an animal for no cause is inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the right to dispose of property that is  
living and breathing is limited,'' attorney Alan Bjerke said. 
``It's against the public policy of the state to allow an animal to 
be put to death by will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Fitzpatrick, the attorney who drafted the amendment to the  
will, recalled his surprise when Brand told him of his final 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted the Cadillac crushed and he wanted to make sure I  
was there to see the Cadillac crushed,'' to make sure no parts were 
removed, Fitzpatrick said in court. In the same conversation, he 
said he wanted his animals destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices rose early Tuesday following  
a jump earlier on Wall Street. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 66.75 points, or 0.47 percent, to  
14,323.42 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the 
average closed up 158.63 points, or 1.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.08 yen, down 0.90 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo but above its level of 120.91 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices started higher after  
the Dow Jones industrial average surged 212.73, or 2.3 percent, to 
9,552.68 at Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Dow's best showing in five weeks and left it within  
90 points of its Jan. 8 all-time high of 9,643.32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's advance came on the back of a drop in bond market  
interest rates ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's semiannual testimony on the state of the economy before 
the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market was also cheered by comments Monday by Taku  
Yamasaki, a former head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's 
policy research affairs council that Japan should use public funds 
to buy land and boost stock prices to solve its asset deflation 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the market was the yen's recent weakness against  
the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger dollar helps Japanese exporters by increasing the  
value of their export earnings when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar met some profit-taking after  
climbing to an 11-week high against the yen Monday. Also, the euro 
was traded at 133.46 yen, up from 134.40 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 2.45 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,111.36. The 
TOPIX closed up 14.41 points, or 1.32 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
rose to 1.760 percent from Monday's finish of 1.725 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.32 yen from 100.60 yen.

<HEADLINE> Cost of Tyson Hearings Taxes NAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- The cost of hearing boxer Mike Tyson's  
plea to reinstate his license has cleaned out the Nevada Athletic 
Commission's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Ratner, the commission's executive director, on Monday told  
lawmakers that an $18,500 emergency appropriation is needed to keep 
the panel from going broke by late March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we were not budgeted to pay for this,'' said Ratner.  
``We did not have the legal right to ask him to pay for the 
hearings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that could change. The commission has requested a bill that  
would allow costs of future hearings to be collected from fighters 
asking for a license. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanticipated costs included rent for a hearing room big  
enough to handle a crowd of more than 300, including 135 members of 
the media, Ratner told the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's license was suspended after he bit Evander Holyfield  
during a June 1997 title bout won by Holyfield. The Athletic 
Commission voted 4-1 to restore Tyson's boxing license in October 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least you won't have the cost of another Tyson hearing for  
another year,'' said state Sen. Ray Rawson, referring to the 
boxer's most recent jailing. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pled no contest to two counts of second-degree assault and  
was sentenced earlier this month to one year in jail for assaulting 
a motorist after a car accident in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	He will learn Wednesday whether he'll lose privileges and time  
off for good behavior for hurling a television set Friday during an 
outburst in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, 32, is still on probation from a 1991 rape conviction,  
and authorities in Indiana must decide if he has violated the terms 
of his probation there. Tyson was released in 1995 after serving 
three years of a six-year sentence, and his probation was set to 
expire in March.

<HEADLINE> Washington Monument Is Reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in four months, visitors  
were able to enjoy the view from the top of the Washington Monument 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The interior was closed in October to allow workers unhindered  
time to erect a metal and fabric web of scaffolding that now robes 
the 555-foot obelisk. Crews are fixing the monument's aging masonry 
joints, repairing cracked and chipped stones and cleaning the 
entire exterior surface of 36,000 stones. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 75 people braved below-freezing temperatures  
and winds gusting at more than 20 mph to wait in line to enjoy the 
view of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had heard that it was closed,'' said James Carney, who was  
visiting from Oklahoma City with his family. ``It was such a nice 
surprise when we heard it was open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The view,'' Carney said, ``was magnificent.''  
</P>
<P>
	The scaffolding, designed by architect Michael Graves, combines  
blue outlining fabric and semitransparent netting. It allows the 
monument to remain visible throughout the restoration, but obscures 
the view from the observation tower a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to get up on your toes and kind of peek around the  
pipes and purple fabric,'' said Bonnie Lang of Modesto, Calif., who 
was visiting Washington to see the sites. ``But the view is still 
gorgeous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scaffolding is scheduled to be removed by the middle of  
2000.

<HEADLINE> Senior IOC Exec Rebukes US Sponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A senior IOC member rebuked the chief executive of  
a top American sponsor Monday for speaking out against the 
international committee's handling of the Olympic corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevan Gosper, an Australian member of the International Olympic  
Committee's executive board, said he was dismayed that David 
D'Alessandro had aired his criticism through the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed he should be debating this in public as if he  
is the conscience of the IOC,'' said Gosper, one of the IOC 
leadership's chief spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, president of Boston-based John Hancock Mutual Life  
Insurance, has been the only corporate executive so far to publicly 
challenge the IOC over its handling of the Salt Lake bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock has canceled negotiations with NBC for $20 million  
in Olympic advertising and removed the Olympic rings from its 
stationery. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews and in written opinion pieces in U.S. newspapers,  
D'Alessandro complained the IOC was losing credibility every day it 
allowed the scandal to continue. He hinted that IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch might be nearing the end of his once-unchallenged 
reign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think D'Alessandro's comments are unfortunate,'' Gosper said  
in a telephone interview from Melbourne, Australia. ``I think it's 
quite improper for him to debate this through the media. After all, 
he's a (Olympic) partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro responded Monday by saying that he met with Dick  
Pound, who is conducting the IOC's investigation, and Michael 
Payne, its head of marketing about the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told them of our deep concerns and we told them that if  
they followed through on Samaranch's promises in January that we 
would be willing to stay private,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But D'Alessandro said that ``a complete tournaround'' by Gosper  
and other IOC offiocials on the question of improper payments in 
Sydney's winning bid for the 2000 games convinced him to take his 
criticism public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the IOC is not listening to private pressure,'' he  
said. ``Clearly Mr. Gosper and others have been going back on their 
public statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock is one of 11 major international corporate sponsors of  
the Olympics who pay around $50 million for exclusive advertising 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors fear their investment is being devalued by the  
continuing fallout from Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four IOC members, a fifth of the total roster, have been  
implicated in receiving cash payments, scholarships, free health 
care and other improper inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock was one of the companies represented when top sponsors  
met with IOC marketing chiefs in New York 10 days ago. The sponsors 
strongly urged the IOC to clean up the scandal quickly or risk a 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, (the sponsors) are demonstrating their concern,''  
Gosper said. ``It's understandable. The reputation of our rings has 
been tarnished. But, from my corporate experience, the way to 
manage this is to quietly talk with your partners, not to debate it 
through the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper also urged IOC investigators to move quickly to clear any  
members who are innocent of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was concerned that some members have been left in  
limbo for too long and should be exonerated before the March 17-18 
general assembly called to deal with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members have either resigned or been ousted in the scandal.  
Three others have been under investigation since December, and 10 
additional members were cited in the Salt Lake ethics panel report 
issued earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC inquiry commission, headed by vice president Dick Pound,  
is to meet late this week and this weekend to deal with the 
remaining cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the Salt Lake panel had unfairly cited some members,  
including Australia's Phil Coles, by failing to contact them in 
advance for their version of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with the current procedure is that anyone who has  
been mentioned appears to be guilty of misconduct,'' he said. 
``This is a very unfortunate situation. To rectify that, the Pound 
commission should act quite rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board, which must finalize any verdicts, is not  
scheduled to meet until March 15-16.

<HEADLINE> CompuServe Gets a New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- CompuServe, the pioneer online service  
that was overtaken and bought by America Online Inc., updated its 
software today in an effort to reposition itself as a home on the 
Internet for busy adults. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe says it will continue to serve the professional  
people key to its business, but with more user-friendly software, 
flashier features and lower prices for the service. 
</P>
<P>
	The software upgrade, called CompuServe 2000, supports  
higher-speed modem connections and is easier for users to install 
and customize on their personal computers. Users will see a ``Main 
Menu'' screen with a continuously updated news ticker with 
headlines from The Associated Press, market analysis from 
CBSMarketWatch.com and personalized news folders. 
</P>
<P>
	E-mail is easier to use, modeled after the version that helped  
America Online become the world's leading online service with more 
than 15 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Subscribers will be given five user names per account, each  
ending in the domain name ``cs.com,'' shortened from 
``compuserve.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New members will pay just $9.95 a month for 20 hours of online  
access, with each additional hour billed at less than 5 cents a 
minute. In addition, CompuServe is cutting the cost of unlimited 
access from $24.95 to $19.95 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL bought CompuServe's content and subscribers after former  
owner H&AMP;R Block sold it to WorldCom Inc. in January 1998. 
CompuServe's subscriber base then fell from about 2.6 million to 2 
million, as the huge influx of new Internet users found more 
convenient ways to go online. 
</P>
<P>
	Long a favorite of technology lovers, CompuServe was known for  
identifying its members online with long strings of numbers instead 
of catchy names, and charging subscribers a premium to get 
specialized business, computer and financial information. 
</P>
<P>
	``CompuServe 2000 is for grown-ups who want fast solutions to  
manage their busy lifestyles -- from content to commerce to 
connectivity to customer service,'' said CompuServe chief operating 
officer Audrey Weil.

<HEADLINE> Little Guys Could Steal Boxing Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Last Friday afternoon, in the Maryland jail he calls home these  
days, Mike Tyson threw a fit, then a TV set, and finally got 
himself tossed into an isolation cell for the weekend. All things 
considered, it probably could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Because if Tyson had been sitting in front of the TV set the  
next evening, when welterweights Felix Trinidad and Pernell 
Whitaker fought 12 very entertaining rounds at Madison Square 
Garden in New York, he might be feeling more desperate still. 
</P>
<P>
	Not too long ago, Iron Mike was the glamour puss in boxing's  
glamour division. It seemed like people would throw down good money 
forever to see him fight anybody, so long as he was bigger than Joe 
Pesci and smaller than a Chevy Cavalier. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson probably wasn't thinking career when he got into it with  
two older men during a traffic altercation in Maryland last summer, 
which is how he wound up being jailed. But truth be told, a few 
months in the slammer didn't figure to affect his appeal much, one 
way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
	All of a sudden, though, the tectonic plates below boxing's  
surface are shifting dramatically. All of a sudden, neither Tyson 
nor the heavyweights he's been carrying all these years can count 
on fans of the ``sweet science'' to make pay-per-view deposits 
directly into their retirement accounts. All of a sudden -- first 
with last Saturday's Oscar De La Hoya-Ike Quartey bout, and then 
the Trinidad-Whitaker fight -- their faster, lighter, flashier 
cousins are proving to be much more entertaining buys. 
</P>
<P>
	This fact was not wasted on Don King, who promotes Trinidad and  
used to promote Tyson, but now is being sued by Iron Mike. The 
referee had barely raised Trinidad's hand in victory Saturday when 
King opened negotiations for what could be a megafight against De 
La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he going to be chicken De La Hoya and not fight Trinidad or  
will he be macho Oscar and accept this challenge?'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people deserve to see the best fighting the best. Tito  
Trinidad is ready to fight anybody, any place, any time. Are you 
listening Oscar?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boxing insiders have long insisted the soap opera surrounding  
Tyson diverted attention from a wealth of deserving fighters in 
several divisions, and Trinidad, a 26-year-old Puerto Rican, was a 
perfect example. He was 33-0 going in, but still largely unknown, 
even though the Whitaker fight marked the 12th time in five years 
he was defending his IBF title at 147 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad was such an unknown, in fact, that while the weigh-in  
was going on Friday, he took off running through the streets of 
Manhattan to lose three pounds and make the weight at 147. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the way Trinidad pummeled Whitaker, recognition should  
flow his way. ``Sweet Pea,'' one of the great defensive fighters of 
the last two decades, got mashed. He was floored early, he suffered 
a broken jaw in the middle rounds and picked up a nasty cut over 
his right eye toward the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Whitaker hadn't fought in the past 16 months  
while engaged in drug and alcohol rehabilitation. But he was 
surprisingly sharp and even sharper-tongued afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't do anything well,'' Whitaker said. ``Hell, yeah , I  
think I won. I had a good time. I'll be back. ... It was close, but 
I'm not going to whine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker even had enough left to compare Trinidad and De La  
Hoya, who beat him in April 1997. He gave the nod to Trinidad. 
``Much better than De La Hoya,'' Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the welterweights intend to steal the thunder from the  
heavies, they had better move quickly to match Trinidad and De La 
Hoya -- even though his promoter, Bob Arum, is King's sworn rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters are committed to opponents in May, De La Hoya  
against Oba Carr, Trinidad against Vincent Pettway. The only 
remaining obstacle is agreeing to a TV network into which the rest 
of us can pour our pay-per-view dollars. De La Hoya has an 
exclusive contract with HBO, and King has already said he is 
willing to go there; he's already done the math. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fight,'' King said, ``will do two million buys on  
pay-per-view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With those kind of numbers in the air, Tyson should be in a  
hurry to get out of jail and back into the ring. Not only is his 
own window of opportunity closing, but by missing the sportscasts 
on television Friday, he also spared himself this chilling tidbit: 
</P>
<P>
	Buster Douglas, the same Buster Douglas whose 1990 knockout of  
Tyson, started Iron Mike's downward spiral, won for the eighth time 
Friday night in nine matches on the comeback trail. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 190 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher at early afternoon as lower  
interest rates and takeover news encouraged investors to buy 
financial and utility shares, as well as dip back into the 
technology sector, which had taken a beating last week. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 190.60 at 9,530.55, led by banking and technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher, with the Nasdaq composite  
up 39.90 at 2,323.50 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 27.30 
at 1,266.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 473.46 million 
shares, below even Friday's slow pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices were higher, pushing interest rates down, ahead of  
Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins 
testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, scheduled to begin at 10 
a.m. EST Tuesday. Later Tuesday, Greenspan will discuss with the 
same panel his views on the modernization of the financial-services 
industry. On Wednesday, he will address the House Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He will go to Capitol Hill on a high note, after data released  
last Thursday and Friday showed an economy still growing while 
price inflation remains quiet, said Alan Skrainka,chief market 
strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was up 13/32 point, pushing its yield,  
which moves opposite the price, down to 5.35 percent from 5.38 
percent late Friday, amid optimism that Greenspan would have an 
upbeat message. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the odds are very slim that he would say something to  
upset the apple cart,'' Skrainka said. ``Alan Greenspan probably 
has to pinch himself to make sure he's not dreaming. There's 
perfection in the econonomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led higher by financial and technology shares,  
including IBM, up 4 3/8 at 176; and American Express, up 5 13/16 at 
109. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also helped higher by some merger news, most  
prominently in the energy industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Resources agreed to buy gas and oil-pipeline company  
Consolidated Natural Gas for $6.3 billion. The union would create 
one of the country's largest electric and gas utilities. Dominion 
Resources' shares were down 1 15/16 at 40 5/16, while CNG's shares 
were down 1 1/16 at 55 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra Energy agreed to acquire KN Energy, a big natural-gas  
pipeline and storage operator, for $1.9 billion. KNE's stock was up 
3/8 at 21 7/8, but Sempra's shares were down 5/8 at 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, aircraft engine maker and Dow component United  
Technologies said it would buy Sundstrand for about $4.3 billion in 
cash and stock, in a move that will expand United Technologies' 
aerospace and aviation businesses. United Technologies' shares were 
up 1/16 at 125 1/2, after making back a loss of more than 2 points, 
and Sundstrand's shares were up 10 1/4 at 68 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Telecom Italia, the leading telecommunications service  
provider in Italy, is the target of a hostile takeover bid by 
smaller rival Olivetti. Telecom Italia's shares were up 7 1/16 at 
113 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Groups Protest IV Bags Made of PVC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmental activists are mounting a  
campaign against plastic medical IV bags that can leach a suspected 
cancer-causing chemical into patients, but the Food and Drug 
Administration says alarm is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no evidence that medical equipment made of PVC plastic  
harms patients, agency officials said last week. Every product has 
trace contamination of some chemical, said Dr. David Feigal, a 
blood safety specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make sure we don't rush to an alternative that  
would not be as safe as this,'' Feigal added. 
</P>
<P>
	PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, is a plastic used widely in products  
ranging from shower curtains to medical devices. Environmentalists 
dislike it because the manufacture and incineration of PVC can 
cause dioxin pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plasticizers'' make PVC flexible. The government classifies  
one such chemical, called DEHP, as a probable human carcinogen, 
based on studies of animals given high doses. 
</P>
<P>
	Many IV bags are made of PVC plastic and thus contain DEHP.  
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace and the Health Care Without Harm coalition are urging  
that hospitals use only IV bags made of other plastics. ``I would 
like to reduce as much as possible the potential risks to my 
patients,'' said coalition member Dr. Peter Orris of Chicago's Cook 
County Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has long known that some DEHP can leach from the bags  
into certain intravenous medicines, blood and liquid nutrition 
mixes. Indeed, the government does not allow drugs such as the 
chemotherapy Taxol to be given in PVC bags. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agency says the worst human exposure -- newborns using  
PVC equipment to breathe -- still is at only half the level that 
animal studies deem risky. Most patients absorb doses many times 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Using glass to store blood is riskier, Feigal said, because  
dangerous bacteria seep into glass containers far easier than into 
sealed plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors do want the industry to develop safer medical plastics,  
stressed Dr. Mohammad Akhter of the American Public Health 
Association, which does not back Greenpeace's campaign. But ``this 
in no way says people shouldn't get IV drugs to have lifesaving 
therapy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Army's Future Said Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
pressured ethnic Albanians today to sign a Kosovo peace accord, so 
the full focus of diplomacy could be aimed at the recalcitrant 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. official at the peace conference said the future of the  
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army remained a sticking point for the 
ethnic Albanians. Under the proposed three-year interim plan, the 
KLA would be disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian delegation, made up of KLA members as well  
as more moderate politicians, was apparently split on disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said the secretary spoke  
by telephone with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, Russian 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Albanian officials in Tirana. She 
also planned to call President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin reported no progress in the talks today.  
</P>
<P>
	The phone calls, he said, were to work up support for ``the  
emerging agreement'' of the Kosovo Albanians. He said their demand 
for a referendum on independence was also a major sticking point 
that needed to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kosovo Albanians continue to move forward toward an  
agreement,'' Rubin said. ``The Serbs are not engaged seriously on 
the military part, which is an integral part of the agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serb negotiators say they are prepared to sign a deal giving  
Kosovo Albanians wide autonomy, but they refuse a military annex to 
the agreement that calls for up to 30,000 NATO troops to enforce 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	That position threatens to be the deal-breaker, and could result  
in NATO airstrikes on Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	During a stroll around central Rambouillet today, Serbian  
President Milan Milutinovic echoed comments over the weekend in 
which he seemed to indicate the Serbs would be willing to talk 
about the military issue -- after a political deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to you before that we may discuss the scope and  
character of that after the agreement,'' he told reporters. ``We 
are for the political agreement,'' he said. ``After that we can 
discuss implementation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if his comments represented a real change in  
the Serb position. Milutinovic has consistently rejected any 
possibility of stationing foreign troops in Kosovo, where ethnic 
Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population. An estimated 
2,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have been driven 
from their homes in Kosovo over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if everything could be completed by the 3 p.m. (9 a.m.  
EST) Tuesday deadline, he said: ``It depends on other parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright has said the political and military issues can't be  
split. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have a yes from both sides, we will have an  
implementation force,'' Albright said Sunday evening. ``If the 
talks crater because the Serbs do not say yes, we will have 
bombing. If the talks crater because the Albanians have not said 
yes, we will not be able to support them and in fact will have to 
cut off whatever help they are getting from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it fails because both parties say no, there will not be  
bombing of Serbia and we will try to figure out ways to continue 
trying to deal with both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has adamantly opposed NATO air strikes on Serbia and has  
been noncommittal about stationing NATO troops in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``With regard to NATO airstrikes, we were against them from the  
beginning, and we are still now,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor 
Ivanov told reporters in Tokyo. ``If the airstrikes took place, all 
the effort and all the talk conducted up until now would be 
wasted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Kosovo, Serb forces backed by tanks battled ethnic  
Albanian rebels northwest of Pristina today. 
</P>
<P>
	Television crews reported police were blocking access to the  
area, where several houses were burning in the aftermath of the 
exchange of fire.

<HEADLINE> Government Urges Advertising Fairness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is urging advertisers and  
broadcasters to adopt a system to prevent advertisers from 
discriminating against radio stations owned by or geared to 
minority listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and Federal Communications Commission  
Chairman Bill Kennard are making the pitch Monday at an advertising 
conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Their challenge responds to a report, issued by the FCC last  
month, that said advertisers often bypass or pay less money to 
minority-owned radio stations or stations targeting black or 
Hispanic listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	At the conference, Kennard plans to suggest that the industries  
develop a voluntary code guided by, among other things, the 
principal of ``fair competition,'' said FCC and administration 
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diversity of voices and views is a pillar of our democracy,''  
Gore says in remarks prepared for delivery to the conference via 
satellite. ``That is why we must ensure that our airwaves provide 
opportunities for all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge is intended to be a ``starting point'' for the  
industry to consider, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, the advertising and broadcasting industries have been  
open to but noncommittal about developing such a code. The American 
Advertising Federation is assembling a panel to examine its 
feasibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who supports Kennard's approach, will call on advertisers  
and advertising agencies ``to make voluntary commitments 
demonstrating that they understand the value of diversity and the 
economic logic of serving minority consumers,'' according to his 
prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy was made available to The Associated Press.  
</P>
<P>
	The FCC report, written by the Civil Rights Forum on  
Communications Policy, an advocacy group based here, recommended 
that industry adopt a code of conduct that requires decisions about 
buying ads to be based on market research. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear what specifically Gore and Kennard would like to  
see included in such a voluntary code. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also plans to announce the creation of a new interagency  
working group to examine advertising practices and their impact on 
minority broadcasters' and minority advertising agencies' ability 
to compete and thrive. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department,  
the Commerce Department and the Small Business Administration's 
Office of Advocacy will be part of the working group. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is likely to conduct additional research -- as Kennard  
has suggested -- on why advertisers are bypassing minority radio 
stations, the administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anecdotal data in the FCC's report suggested that, in some  
cases, media's buying processes were guided by ethnic or racial 
stereotyping. But the report didn't pin down reasons why some 
minority stations were being passed up by advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many factors could be responsible, the report acknowledged,  
among them audience demographics, ratings or whether a station is 
owned by a company operating many radio outlets.

<HEADLINE> Peterman Prepares To Liquidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Put the duster-clad man in the J. Peterman  
logo on a horse and point him west. The catalog retailer is 
preparing to ride off into the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
	Founder John Peterman said Monday that last-ditch attempts to  
find a buyer for his struggling company had failed. He said he 
expects a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge to set a date Tuesday for an 
auction at which the company's assets will be sold to the highest 
bidder, with proceeds going to the company's creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the weekend, we had a buyer, but their proposal wouldn't  
work'' both in terms of price and structuring, Peterman said in a 
telephone interview. ``The court wouldn't have accepted it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though apparently resigned to the prospect that his 12-year-old  
company will be liquidated, Peterman had not given up. ``We'll 
continue to try to pull it out of the fire until the auction,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The J. Peterman Co., which employs 500 people, most in  
Lexington, sought protection from creditors in a Jan. 25 petition 
filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 11 
enables a company to keep operating under a court's supervision 
while it develops a plan for returning to solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	In its most recent set of court filings, Peterman listed debts  
of more than $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has remained in business in recent weeks through a  
series of stopgap loans provided by its only secured creditor, 
Heller Financial of Chicago, now owed nearly $10 million. Those 
loans have not included money to buy spring merchandise, and the 
company is now two weeks overdue in putting out its spring catalog, 
Peterman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said Heller, a primary investor in last year's plan to  
open 70 J. Peterman retail stores, refused to extend additional 
credit that might have allowed the company to work its way out of 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, when the company ran into snags in opening new  
stores and a slowdown in catalog sales, ``Heller squeezed down at a 
time when we needed flexibility,'' Peterman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman, a 57-year-old former minor league baseball player and  
marketing consultant, first started selling vintage, cowboy-style 
dusters in 1987 through ads in the back of The New Yorker and The 
Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	By the next year, he was putting out a catalog that was  
something new in the mail-order business: consciously upscale, with 
color sketches of the merchandise instead of photographs and 
lyrical copy that invested the merchandise with a romantic, exotic 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing approach was imitated by other retailers and  
become the target of satire on the top-rated television comedy 
``Seinfeld.'' During the show's final three seasons, ending last 
May, the character Elaine Benes worked for J. Peterman, whose 
headquarters were relocated to New York for the show's purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last year, the real John Peterman decided to capitalize on  
the fame with a retail expansion that included plans for 50 stores 
and 20 catalog outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman recruited executives from J. Crew, Calvin Klein and The  
Gap, raised $10 million from private investors and made plans to 
target upscale markets. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the year, though, there were layoffs and a freeze  
on new store openings, followed last month by the bankruptcy 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the current incarnation of J. Peterman goes out of  
existence, the founder promised that ``You haven't heard the last 
of J. Peterman.'' First, Peterman said, he plans to write a book. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been more experts and smart people in here who,  
when you put all of that together, it just became tragically 
humorous,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman apparently will have competition. Robert Bolson, a  
former copy writer for the J. Peterman catalog, said Monday he is 
seeking an agent and publisher for his account, ``J. Peterman, 
Behind the Duster: Autopsy of an American Phenomenon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman's reaction? ``Unfortunately, Robert doesn't know a  
thing about the company,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bowe Kidnap Sentencing Is Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Sentencing was delayed Monday for former  
heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe, who faces a prison sentence for 
kidnapping his estranged wife and five children. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Hinson, one of Bowe's lawyers, said federal prosecutors  
requested the delay and no new date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will probably be in two or three months,'' Hinson said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Bowe pleaded guilty to abducting Judy Bowe and their  
children from their home in Cornelius, just north of Charlotte. He 
attempted to drive them to his home in Fort Washington, Md., but 
Judy Bowe managed to telephone for help during a stop in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said then that Bowe would serve 18 to 24 months in  
prison under his plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay also postponed an appearance in U.S. District Court by  
O.J. Simpson defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr., who is 
representing Bowe on the kidnapping charges, Hinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowe arrived at his wife's home on Feb. 25, 1998, and threatened  
her with a knife, handcuffs, duct tape and pepper spray. He forced 
her and the youngsters into a Lincoln Navigator and headed to his 
Fort Washington, Md., home, according to a federal grand jury 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	After driving about 200 miles, they stopped at a restaurant in  
South Hill, Va., where Judy Bowe called her sister in North 
Carolina, who guided police to the restaurant. Judy Bowe told 
officers she and her children did not want to go to Maryland. They 
returned home, Judy Bowe with a superficial stab wound to her left 
breast allegedly inflicted by Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowe outpointed Evander Holyfield for the undisputed heavyweight  
championship on Nov. 13, 1992. He lost the WBC title when he didn't 
fight Lennox Lewis of Britain. He lost the WBA and IBF titles in a 
decision to Holyfield on Nov. 6, 1993.

<HEADLINE> Fishermen Saved From Ice Floe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ten people fishing on a frozen lake were rescued  
when the ice beneath their feet broke into a floe and stranded them 
on open water. 
</P>
<P>
	The fishermen were stranded for about 30 minutes Sunday on Lake  
St. Clair. They were rescued by the Coast Guard, which lowered a 
rescue swimmer by hoist cable to ensure there was no one left on 
the floe in ice shanties. 
</P>
<P>
	Already nine times this season, the Coast Guard in Detroit has  
been deployed to rescue fishermen stranded on floating ice, said 
Philip Myers, a search-and-rescue controller. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 95 people have been rescued from Lake St. Clair and the  
Saginaw Bay area, and one person has died, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of people who have gone out risking life and limb  
because there's fish in the water,'' he said. ``Some of them are 
actually repeat rescuees and think, `It hasn't killed me yet, and 
hey, somebody will come and rescue me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers are proposing legislation to make fishermen pay  
for their rescues and punish those who ignore warnings about unsafe 
ice.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Starts Internet Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dow Jones &AMP; Co. has created an index to track 40  
key Internet stocks in a move that should help investors keep track 
of one of the hottest sectors of the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The list, inaugurated last week, joins a plethora of Internet  
indexes sponsored by brokerages, research firms and trade 
magazines, all seeking to become a benchmark for measuring the 
health of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the strength of the Dow Jones name, the index is sure  
to become widely used. Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street 
Journal, keeps track of hundreds of indexes, including the most 
easily recognized benchmark for blue chip stocks, the Dow Jones 
industrial average, which the company started in 1896. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet index has two components: a 15-stock average that  
will track electronic commerce companies, and a 25-stock indicator 
that follows Internet service-related stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The commerce portion includes bookseller Amazon.com, auction  
house eBay, the broker ETrade and the Web portal site Yahoo! Two of 
the companies on this list will be removed if the merger deals they 
have struck are approved by shareholders. Geocities, a provider of 
individual Web pages, is being acquired by Yahoo!, and the portal 
site Excite is being bought by At Home, a high-speed Internet 
service provider.. 
</P>
<P>
	The services index, in addition to At Home, also includes  
companies such as the software maker Netscape Communications Corp. 
and the company that has agreed to buy it, America Online Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to the rapid pace of consolidation among Internet stocks,  
Dow Jones plans to review the index quarterly in order to make any 
adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to be listed on either part of the index, a company  
must derive at least half of its revenues from Internet-related 
business, have been listed on a stock exchange for at least three 
months, have a market value of at least $100 million, and have 
enough trading activity to meet certain tests of liquidity. 
</P>
<P>
	The index closed at 180.19 points Monday, up 9.85 points, or  
5.78 percent from Friday. The index is calculated from a base of 
100 points as of June 30, 1998, and Dow Jones has compiled data on 
the index as far back as June 30, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in options on the electronic commerce portion of the  
index was to begin Friday on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks Fire Graham as Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Dirk Graham, who was known as a hard-hitting  
forward when he played for the Chicago Blackhawks but who led them 
to their worst record in 42 years as coach, was fired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Lorne Molleken will replace Graham as interim  
coach, the team announced. Denis Savard will stay on as assistant 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, just 59 games into his first season as coach, will  
remain with the Blackhawks organization, team officials said. His 
new position was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham had little coaching experience when he was hired by the  
Blackhawks last June. He had spent just one season, 1995-96, as an 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the time of Graham's appointment, general manager Bob  
Murray insisted that Graham's demeanor in the locker room as a 
player and captain of the Blackhawks was what mattered. Graham was 
known for motivating his teammates when he played for the 
Blackhawks from 1988 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	However, this year's team has shown little motivation under  
Graham. The Blackhawks have lost 10 of their last 12 games and are 
19 games under .500. That hasn't happened since 1955-57, when the 
Blackhawks finished 23 games under .500. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has the worst record in the Western Conference and the  
second-worst record in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	After the team's 6-3 loss to the Boston Bruins on Sunday, a  
frustrated Graham said the coaching staff believed in what they 
were teaching, but had received a negative response from the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	A tough and aggressive player, Graham won the 1991 Frank Selke  
award for his defensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 152 goals, 190 assists and 685 penalty minutes in 546  
games for Chicago. He also holds the team record for most 
shorthanded goals in a season, 10 in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
	But most importantly, he was a leader. He was captain for 6 1/2  
seasons and part of the 1992 squad that won 11 straight playoff 
games before losing to Pittsburgh in the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham replaced Craig Hartsburg, who was fired in April after  
Chicago's 30-39-13 season, when they failed to make the playoffs 
for the first time since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Molleken, 42, came to the Blackhawks last June from the Edmonton  
Oilers, where he was head coach of two minor league affiliates. He 
previously coached the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey 
League and was a coach in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks also announced the appointment of defenseman  
Trent Yawney as an assistant coach. Yawney, 33, a 12-year veteran 
of the NHL, broke his arm in a game at Nashville and is out for the 
year.

	Kosovo Albanians Deciding on Plan  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Facing tomorrow's deadline, ethnic  
Albanians met tonight to decide whether to accept the self-rule 
plan for Kosovo designed to end their yearlong conflict. They were 
told by Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, that a peacekeeping 
force would ensure their security in event an agreement is reached. 
Meanwhile, Serb negotiators continued to refuse to accede to 
demands that a NATO peacekeeping force be part of any peace deal. 
But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said that NATO would 
not carry out threatened airstrikes against Serb targets if the 
ethnic Albanians did not give final approval to the agreement.

	Dragging Death Case Nears End  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Closing arguments will be made tomorrow in  
the capital murder case of John William King, one of three men 
accused of dragging James Byrd Jr. to his death last June. 
Prosecutors wrapped up their case following the testimony of a 
pathologist. Dr. Tommy Brown said Byrd was conscious as he was 
dragged by a pickup truck until his head was torn off by a concrete 
drainage duct. Prosecutors need to prove Byrd was alive when he was 
dragged in order to prove kidnapping and murder, which together 
would expose alleged white supremacist King to the death penalty. 
The defense called only three witnesses, whose testimony lasted 
less than an hour, before resting.

	Dow Gains 212.73 As Stocks Soar

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices blasted higher today amid renewed  
confidence that interest rates would stay low and that the market 
for mergers and acquisitions is still hot. The Dow industrials 
climbed 212.73 points to 9,552.68, the biggest point gain in five 
weeks. That left the Dow 90 points shy of the record 9,643.32. 
Broad-market indexes posted solid gains as well. On the NYSE, 
advancers led decliners 1,953-1,061. The Nasdaq was up 58.41 at

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and the nation's governors  
grappled with differences over education policy today at a 
roundtable discussion at the White House. Some governors raised 
doubts about Clinton's education initiative to build more schools, 
hire more teachers and penalize states for poor classroom 
performance. Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Republican, said it was 
impossible for the federal government to design ``a 
one-size-fits-all system.''

	Tobacco Co. Tops Soft Money List

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tobacco giant Philip Morris, which pushed for  
defeat of anti-smoking legislation, gave $2.4 million in 
unregulated soft money to the two major political parties over the 
last two years, the advocacy group Common Cause said. The company 
gave more than any other soft money contributor. Philip Morris 
contributed $2 million to the Republicans and $419,164 to the 
Democrats in 1997 and 1998, according to Common Cause.

democracy. The observers said they witnessed ballot box-stuffing, 
voter intimidation and lax adherence to elections standards. The 
party of Nigeria's presidential front-runner, former Gen. Olusegun 
Obasanjo, seemed likely to sweep both the Senate and the House of 
Representatives.

heavy smoke in some earlier model Ford Explorer sport utility 
vehicles. A hot portion of the blower assembly may ignite debris 
that can collect in the venting system in explorers from model 
years 1992-1994, an agency report said. The safety agency is also 
looking into complaints that some 1997 and 1998 Explorers continue 
to accelerate after the driver takes his foot off the gas or 
disengages the cruise control.

<HEADLINE> NJ Lawyer Seeks Tobacco Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A groundbreaking tobacco litigator from New  
Jersey claims a prominent Baltimore lawyer is withholding his share 
of attorneys' fees due from Maryland's $4.2 billion share of the 
national tobacco settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Z. Edell of Morristown, who won the first jury award  
against a tobacco company, is suing the law firm of Peter G. 
Angelos to recover the money -- perhaps as much as $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed earlier this month in U.S. District court here  
charges fraud and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the Angelos firm issued a statement Monday denying  
that Edell was owed a contingency fee -- the legal term for a 
percentage of the settlement -- and that any suggestion of fraud is 
``outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edell maintains Angelos, who is also majority owner of the  
Baltimore Orioles baseball team, reneged on what was essentially a 
handshake deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Informal understandings are common among lawyers, according to  
Richard Daynard, another attorney who worked with the Angelos firm 
in the Maryland tobacco case. Daynard said Monday he is still 
wrangling with the firm over his compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Edell had obtained the first jury award against a tobacco  
company in a liability case, $400,000 for the family of Rose 
Cipollone of New Jersey in 1988. But the award was overturned on 
appeal, and the lawsuit was dropped in 1992, a process that drained 
Edell's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Edell contends the Angelos firm recruited him in December 1995  
to join forces and bid on handling Maryland's lawsuit against the 
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	He believed he would serve as a consultant, but the Angelos  
proposal ultimately accepted by Maryland said Edell would be 
co-lead counsel involved in daily case management and supervision. 
It called him the ``premier tobacco litigation expert in the United 
States,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Maryland's suit proceeded, Edell devoted increasing amounts  
of time to depositions and court arguments, his lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Maryland agreed to accept $4.2 billion as part of  
the national tobacco settlement with major tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland set attorneys' fees at 12.5 percent, according to the  
Edell lawsuit. That would leave a pot of $525 million to be split 
among the lawyers. The actual amount, however, was to be determined 
by negotiations between the lawyers and the tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still hoping that Mr. Angelos will do the right thing,  
rather than letting this litigation go forward, because we have 
lived up to all of our obligations to the state of Maryland,'' 
Edell's lawyer, Michel F. Baumeister said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angelos firm's statement maintains Edell ``did not want the  
risk of a contingent fee, particularly in light of the disastrous 
financial consequences of the Cipollone litigation to himself and 
his former firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point downstream, when he apparently sensed that there  
might be a potential for substantial fees, he sought to participate 
on a contingent basis. This proposal was rejected,'' the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It contends that Edell was only guaranteed $500,000 ``on an  
exceedingly generous hourly rate.'' The Edell lawsuit acknowledges 
that guarantee, but maintains it was based on him having only a 
limited role.

<HEADLINE> Levi Strauss To Slash 5,900 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. will close 11 of its 22  
plants in North America and lay off about 5,900 employees, or 30 
percent of its work force in the United States and Canada, as the 
jeans maker struggles with slumping sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based company said it will shift production to  
plants overseas, which will enable it to spend more time and money 
on product design and marketing, two areas where it has been 
lagging in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at Levi Strauss fell 13 percent last year to $6 billion.  
It was the second year of disappointing results at the privately 
held company, which doesn't release earnings reports or any 
competitive data on specific business units or brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's business has been under pressure as it competes with  
well-known labels from the Gap and Tommy Hilfiger, newcomers like 
MUDD and JNCO and lower-priced jeans from Sears and Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement is just the latest round of cutbacks at the  
San Francisco-based company. Starting in late 1997, it laid off 
7,400 workers, more than a third of its North American workforce, 
and closed more than 10 plants, not counting the cuts announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Levi's is less and less able to compete with everyone else in  
this business,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail consultant and 
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. 
``There jeans just aren't in demand like they used to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's will close 10 U.S. plants and one in Ontario, Canada.  
Four plants in Texas will close, two in Tennessee, one in Georgia, 
one in Arkansas, one in Virginia, and one in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's will be offering benefits packages to U.S. employees that  
include three weeks of severance pay for each year of service, 
extended medical coverage and up to $6,000 towards training, 
education and business start-up expenses.

<HEADLINE> College Produces 2 Grammy Nominees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEVELLAND, Texas (AP) -- Big-city record producers often say that  
star quality and stage savvy can't be taught in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks in the small community of Levelland hope to prove that  
notion wrong when two alumni of South Plains College's commercial 
music program -- Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks and Lee Ann 
Womack -- compete at the 41st annual Grammy Awards on Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Womack is nominated for best female country vocal  
performance. The Dixie Chicks, long known around Texas for their 
contemporary country sound, are nominated for three awards, 
including best new artist and best country album. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lee Ann is a very energetic, enthusiastic performer who gave  
100 percent every performance at SPC,'' recalled her instructor, 
John Hartin, creator of the commercial music program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Natalie has incredible musical energy and takes command of any  
material she is performing. I certainly hope they both win a 
Grammy. I feel that they are the ones who ought to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program teaches students the skills they need to walk out  
and become professional musicians, including songwriting, 
performing, navigating the industry and writing music for 
instruments they don't know how to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Womack graduated in 1985, Ms. Maines in 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	Hartin, who traveled the country with his band The Classics in  
the late '60s, took a position at South Plains College in 1975 
because he wanted to escape the sleepless nights and small-town 
diners of life on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a place that a person could go to learn about  
what it takes to survive in the music business,'' Hartin said. 
``You could learn music and you could learn business but to learn 
how the two intermingled was impossible in 1975 when I came here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartin's vision began with classes in the women's gymnasium and  
drew six students from the small towns around Levelland, the aptly 
named, pancake-flat community near the New Mexico state line. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the program is staffed by 10 full-time faculty members and  
has more than 60 students. The college of 6,700 students also 
boasts two TV studios and several recording studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Heath Wright, lead singer for the country band Ricochet and a  
graduate of the school's music program, said the training boosts an 
aspiring star's chances of success. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn a lot about songwriting and creativity,'' Wright  
said. ``Many bands are out there reproducing other people's sounds. 
Out there, they teach you how to find your own sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cory Williams, a third-year student, found himself playing  
alongside country music artist Ray Price when the musician was 
passing through Lubbock and needed a fiddle player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to play the whole show with him because I was able  
to sight-read the music,'' Williams said. ``You can never have a 
guarantee, but people who get their degree here seem to be doing 
pretty well these days.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Has Jan. Surplus of $70.3B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government piled up a $70.3 billion  
surplus in January, putting the budget in the black for the first 
four months of fiscal 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had expected a big surplus because Social Security  
checks for January went out Dec. 31 instead of the usual Jan. 3, 
which fell on a Sunday this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the actual surplus was even larger than the predicted $55  
billion to $60 billion, and it more than offset monthly deficits in 
October, November and December. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first four months of fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1,  
the government had a $15.3 billion surplus, compared with a $14.3 
billion deficit during the same period of fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Clinton administration predicted a $79.3 billion  
surplus for all of fiscal 1999, up 13 percent from $70.2 billion in 
1998, which marked the government's first surplus since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists agreed that the government should be able to expand  
the surplus, if it doesn't disburse it in the form of tax cuts or 
spending increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The robust economy is fueling strong growth in personal income  
tax receipts. They totaled $287.4 billion from October through 
January, up 5.6 percent from 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than offsetting a 5.2 percent decline in corporate  
tax receipts, to $52.7 billion, reflecting the world economic 
slump's impact on profits.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Plan Weekend Ski Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clintons are heading back to the ski  
slopes for daughter Chelsea's 19th birthday, the White House 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days in Arizona and California pushing his fix for  
Social Security and raising money for Democrats, President Clinton 
has three days of family time in Park City, Utah, blocked off on 
his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second year in a row that the first family has chosen  
Park City for family time. Last year the president, who has skied 
only once in his life, was just getting over a knee injury and 
opted to read by the fire while Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea dashed 
down the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton leaves Washington on Thursday for Tucson, Ariz., where  
he plans an address on his budget proposals for Social Security and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that night, he heads to San Francisco for a fund-raiser on  
behalf of House and Senate Democrats. Another fund-raiser is slated 
for Friday night in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Chelsea's birthday, he heads to Park City, where he  
will remain until Tuesday, March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Clintons stayed in the gated multimillion-dollar  
mountaintop home of Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, who has 
several intermediate ski runs just off his back yard at the Deer 
Valley Resort, about 25 miles east of Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Awaits Hearing After Outburst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mike Tyson had been taken off antidepressant drugs two days  
before he became enraged and threw a TV set in a Maryland jail, a 
source close to the boxer told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's daily dose of Zoloft was stopped after he refused to be  
evaluated by a prison physician on grounds he had already been 
examined by a team of psychiatrists, said the source, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion was put in an isolation cell at  
the Montgomery County (Md.) Detention Center after the outburst. He 
faces a hearing this week that could lead to loss of privileges but 
will not result in further jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections officials in Montgomery County are meeting today to  
assess Tyson's medical care, a law enforcement source told the AP, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. The source added that Tyson 
faces disciplinary but not criminal charges stemming from his 
actions at the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Hamill, county corrections director, will make the final  
decision. He said Tyson can speak at the hearing but will not be 
represented by a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	A source familiar with the proceedings said the 32-year-old  
boxer probably will be disciplined for disorderly conduct and 
destruction of county property. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Goldberg, Tyson's regular doctor who heads the  
psychiatric program at Georgetown University, apparently couldn't 
convince prison officials that the fighter should stay on his 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson had been taking Zoloft on a daily basis for the past four  
months, except for the week prior to his Jan. 16 fight with 
Francois Botha. He was weaned gradually from the drug during that 
week, and began taking it again the day after the fight, said the 
source, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither jail officials nor Goldberg could be reached for  
comment. A call to the home of Tyson's Washington lawyer, Paul 
Kemp, was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was in a common area with other prisoners on Friday and  
was talking on the phone when a guard came in and hung up the 
phone, the source close to the fighter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action enraged Tyson, who picked up the television set and  
threw it against some bars. Tyson, the source said, immediately 
apologized and offered to pay for the TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Massachusetts General testified at Tyson's licensing  
hearing before the Nevada Athletic Commission in October that Tyson 
was often depressed, but that his mood swings could be controlled 
if he took the proper medication. 
</P>
<P>
	On the medication, Tyson was cheerful and cooperative in  
interviews with reporters when training for the Botha fight in 
Phoenix in December. The week of the fight, though, he was 
combative at times and engaged in a profanity-laced tirade against 
a New York television reporter four days before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was being held in an 8-by-5-foot isolation cell pending a  
hearing either today or Tuesday on a citation for destruction of 
county property in the jail in the Washington suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was sentenced Feb. 5 to a one-year jail sentence for  
assaulting two men after a minor traffic accident in August in 
Gaithersburg, Md. Tyson pleaded no contest to the charges, but 
might appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's advisers had been hoping he would be put in a prerelease  
program within 60 days of beginning his sentence that would allow 
him to stay in a halfway house and leave during the day for 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident with the television, though, could harm hopes of an  
early release. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer is also on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty  
pageant contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He served 
three years in prison and was released in March 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana officials say they will wait to see what happens in  
Maryland before deciding whether to revoke his probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson stopped Botha in the fifth round of their fight, his first  
since losing his boxing license for biting Evander Holyfield during 
a championship bout in June 1997.

<HEADLINE> Brown's Scoring Surge Sparks Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat are so hot that even P.J. Brown is  
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	This is akin to Tim Hardaway blocking shots or Alonzo Mourning  
running the offense. Brown would rather rebound than score, but 
he'd rather shoot than lose, so lately he's been taking -- and 
making -- wide-open jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other teams are under the notion that P.J. is not a good  
shooter,'' coach Pat Riley said. ``One of these days they're going 
to learn that you can't leave him open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami's victory last Tuesday at Indiana, Brown scored 22  
points. That was the 6-foot-11 power forward's personal best in 
three seasons with the Heat -- until Saturday, when Brown scored 24 
to help beat the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have 24 rebounds than 24 points,'' Brown said.  
``Everybody on the team wants me to shoot the ball. I've never been 
a shooter. When your teammates push you, that gives you a lot more 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``But tell the fans not to get used to it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sparked by Brown's scoring surge, the Heat take a five-game  
winning streak into Tuesday's game at Washington. Brown figures 
he'll stop shooting when teams start guarding him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been happening since I got here -- teams want to  
double-team Zo or Tim, and they come off of me. All I try to do is 
take advantage of the opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not doing anything spectacular. I'm just taking a rhythm  
jumper from 15 to 18 feet. I shoot it every day, so I'm going to 
try to put it in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown went 10-for-14 against the Rockets, with most of his  
points uncontested from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew he could hit that shot, but not like that on a  
consistent basis,'' Houston's Othella Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	During an offseason extended by the NBA lockout, Brown worked on  
his midrange jumper every day, and the practice paid off. He's 
shooting 54 percent this season, compared with 45 percent for his 
career, and he's scoring 12.1 points per game, an improvement from 
his average of 8.8 in five previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat's bruising forward is perhaps best known for flipping  
the New York Knicks' Charlie Ward into the stands during the 1997 
playoffs. Even with two starters now sidelined by injuries, the 
Heat depend on Brown for rebounding and defense, not scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he'll call a play for Brown perhaps once every five  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's see, that would mean the next one would be against  
Detroit'' on Friday, Brown said with a smile. ``Yeah, that sounds 
about right.''

<HEADLINE> Nobel Prize Winner Elion Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. (AP) -- Gertrude Belle Elion, who  
shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine for research that led to 
AIDS-fighting drugs, died Sunday. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Elion worked on several lifesaving medications during her career  
as a medical researcher, and in 1988 she and colleague George 
Hitchings, whom she worked with for 40 years, won the Nobel Prize 
for their research leading to drugs for AIDS, herpes, leukemia and 
malaria. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gertrude Elion's love of science was surpassed only by her  
compassion for people,'' said Robert A. Ingram, chief executive of 
Glaxo Wellcome. ``While blazing new trails as a woman scientist in 
what was then a man's world, Dr. Elion persevered in work that led 
to advances in treatments for a variety of diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in New York City, Elion received a bachelor's degree from  
Hunter College in New York in 1937 and a master's degree in 
chemistry from New York University in 1941.

	Kosovo Albanians Mull Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- American mediators at the Kosovo  
peace talks were not optimistic that there would be an agreement 
before tomorrow's deadline, according to a U.S. official. But chief 
U.S. mediator Christopher Hill remained overnight to oversee 
completion of the proposed text of the accord and to present it to 
the Serbs and ethnic Albanians. U.S. and European mediators have 
pushed the ethnic Albanians to give their final approval to the 
settlement. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said that 
NATO would not carry out the threatened airstrikes against Serbs 
without Albanian support for the pact. Ethnic Albanians meeting to 
decide whether to accept the self-rule plan.

	Both Sides Rest in Dragging Case  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Closing arguments are scheduled to begin  
tomorrow in the capital murder case of John William King, the first 
of three white men to be tried in the dragging death of a black 
man. A pathologist, Dr. Tommy Brown, was the last of 43 prosecution 
witnesses to take the stand. He said James Byrd Jr. was conscious 
when he was dragged along a road by a chain around his ankles until 
his head was torn off by a concrete drainage duct. Prosecutors need 
to prove Byrd was alive when he was dragged in order to prove 
kidnapping and murder, which together would expose the white 
supremacist to the death penalty. The defense rested their case 
this afternoon after calling only three witnesses.

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraqi missiles aimed at U.S. and British  
planes flying over the northern no-fly zone have caused some 
civilian damage and hampered U.N. operations, according to a U.N. 
report. The United Nations is concerned that continued aerial 
confrontations could affect food deliveries in northern areas. It 
already has restricted staff movements, the report said. Iraq has 
challenged allied forces in the ``no-fly'' zones almost daily since 
the United States and Britain launched airstrikes in mid-December.

	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey asserted today it has a ``right to  
self-defense'' if Greece provides support to separatist Kurds -- a 
thinly veiled threat of military force against its neighbor and

imprisoned rebel warlord Abdullah Ocalan had told interrogators 
that Greece gave his fighters weapons and training, claims that 
Greece has rejected in the past. A judge is expected to file 
charges tomorrow against Ocalan for waging a nearly 15-year 
insurrection in Turkey's southeast.

to their worst record in 42 years as coach, was fired today. 
Assistant coach Lorne Molleken will replace Graham as interim 
coach. The Blackhawks have lost 10 of their last 12 games and are 
19 games under .500. That hasn't happened since 1955-57.

<HEADLINE> Airport Lacks Airlines, Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASCOUTAH, Ill. (AP) -- It has all the trappings of a major  
airport -- baggage carousels, ticket counters and televisions 
broadcasting CNN headlines over and over. 
</P>
<P>
	What's missing are airlines -- and passengers.  
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a year after opening, the $330 million taxpayer-funded  
MidAmerica Airport is used only by planes flying into the Air Force 
base that shares its runways. 
</P>
<P>
	The airport's boosters had predicted that it would be bustling  
with commercial airline service by now, and handle 1.1 million 
passengers next year. But the airlines cited by airport officials 
as their best prospects -- American, Delta and Southwest -- say they 
have no plans to fly here. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what tomorrow's going to bring, so you don't  
want to burn any bridges, but right now it's just the best business 
decision,'' said Delta spokeswoman Betty Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which leaves local officials to insist that they haven't  
make a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've not had a nervous moment, one second of lost sleep or one  
iota of misconception about building this airport,'' said St. Clair 
County Board Chairman John Baricevic. ``It was absolutely the right 
thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airport has its beginnings in 1990 when planners considered  
the possibility of relocating Lambert-St. Louis International 
Airport to the Illinois side of the Mississippi River. Lambert, 
home to Trans World Airlines and one of the nation's busiest 
airports, is largely hemmed in by development north of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Politics scuttled that plan, but Illinois officials soon  
concluded that joint civilian-military use of Scott Air Force Base 
would help to make St. Louis' often-overlooked Illinois suburbs a 
player in the regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after St. Clair County adopted the project,  
construction began with officials confidently predicting that 
service could start as soon as 1996. After a series of delays, the 
airport officially opened its runway in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the airport indeed brought plenty of money into  
the region -- all but $30 million of MidAmerica's cost was borne by 
the federal and state governments, with the county chipping in the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	County officials can boast that MidAmerica has lured more  
government spending -- in the form of an Illinois Air National Guard 
unit that is moving from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, 
bringing 300 full-time and 1,000 part-time jobs and $100 million in 
construction spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to attracting commercial airlines and any  
private-sector spending and jobs that go with them, experts say 
MidAmerica faces an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, carriers are short of aircraft. They have more  
opportunity to make money with airplanes than they have the ability 
to go out and develop new markets,'' said independent airline 
analyst Robert Mann. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines know customers want the convenience of frequent flights  
and a wide range of destinations -- something they can't afford to 
do by spreading operations across two airports, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	County officials have said they expected to lose money on the  
airport for at least five years. It will take that long for 
airlines to gear up for service at the new field, airport director 
Rick Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some suspect it will be much longer.  
</P>
<P>
	Joe Behnken, a St. Clair County councilman who has been highly  
critical of the county's efforts to lure an airline to MidAmerica, 
says the Public Building Commission, which oversees the airport, is 
incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those folks know nothing about the management and running of  
any business, much less an airport,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baricevic dismissed Behnken's criticisms as political. Behnken  
is a Republican; Baricevic is his Democratic rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new airports have found ways to succeed. When Northwest  
Arkansas Regional Airport in Bentonville, Ark., opened in November 
at a cost of $109 million, airlines had already signed up. 
</P>
<P>
	But that airport had the backing of three influential  
corporations -- Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt Transportation -- 
which pledged their business to airlines using the field, said 
spokesman Scott Van Laningham. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no businesses have made such a pledge to MidAmerica.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the airport stays open at least 12 hours a day,  
staffed by 27 workers -- including a full fire crew and maintenance 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	And -- to the further aggravation of critics -- MidAmerica is  
already spending money on upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the county approved requesting $2.5 million for  
improvements that include higher runway lights and a fence to keep 
deer away.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Plans To Sign With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman plans to sign with  
the Los Angeles Lakers but said there are still issues to be 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, in a separate statement, said they hope to sign him  
``very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things that have to occur before I even step  
on the floor with the Lakers,'' the seven-time rebounding champion 
said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman stated several minutes later that he will indeed sign.  
And the news conference ended abruptly with Rodman in tears amid 
all the skeptical questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to sign a contract tonight,'' he said, adding he  
hoped it would be for two or three years. He said he might play 
when the Lakers face the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the Lakers did not attend the news  
conference. Rodman said that was because the team was out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been saying for the past couple of weeks that we would  
like to have Dennis Rodman on our team,'' general manager Mitch 
Kupchak said in a statement. '' Now that he has announced his 
desire and intention to play for us, we hope to sign a deal and see 
him in a Lakers' uniform sometime very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old forward said that if the Lakers want him, they  
``have to let me know and reassure me.'' He added that he does not 
want to ``go into a situation where I am trying to discipline kids 
or try to coach kids and do other things that I shouldn't be 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to be clear on whether the Lakers had offered him a  
contract and if he was happy and would sign it as is, Rodman 
responded: ``Well, I'm not happy at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what would make him happy, he said: ``What would make me  
happy is if I could bring this city a ring as I did Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Bulls star said he is in good shape and would be  
reliable, playing up to 35 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can count on me. You can count on me going to practice,''  
Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted he ``absolutely'' wants to play again.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know, it's not about the money,'' he said. ``You got a lot  
of guys in this league making $12 million. I'm coming back to a 
prorated contract that's only going to pay me $495,000 -- after 
taxes you probably have $200,000. Is that a good enough reason for 
me to come back?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, whose tattoos and body piercings have become as much a  
part of his persona as his defense and work under the boards, said 
it would be good for the league to have him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see that the NBA right now is struggling to try to have some  
kind of image,'' he said. ``The NBA right now is not even the way 
it should be this year because a lot of people are having career 
lows, other people are having self-doubts about themselves, a lot 
of people are out of shape, a lot of people are not even who they 
are. And basically if I come back in the league I will give the 
league something to write about, something to talk about, some 
excitement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were to play Denver tonight, but Rodman said he  
didn't think he needed to travel there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's enough distraction as it is,'' he said. ``I  
think I'll wait 'til they come back and I can go to the practice 
and meet with the guys, whatever, and hope that they accept me. If 
(I) feel like I'm not being greeted to come on this team I'll step 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of Rodman's return has been an almost daily news  
item since a newspaper report on Feb. 13 quoted sources close to 
him as saying he had decided to play for the Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Legalizing Payday Loans Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When Toby McKenzie wanted states to pass new laws endorsing  
``payday loans'' at high interest rates, he and his colleagues in 
the check cashing industry got out their own checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie started at home in Tennessee. His family donated  
$33,200 to lawmakers' campaigns over three years. He gave $5,000 to 
Gov. Donald Sundquist's inaugural committee and later hired one of 
the governor's top aides. His wife joined a prestigious lobbying 
firm as a partner. Last year, he and his wife gave $130,000 to the 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Tennessee became the 19th state this decade to make  
check cashing businesses exempt from its usury laws, allowing check 
cashing outlets to make short-term loans at what amounts to more 
than 390 percent interest per year. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar strategy of campaign contributions and aggressive  
lobbying has prepared the way to legality for payday lenders in 
many states -- despite criticism from consumer advocates who say the 
business preys on the poor, the ignorant and the desperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Payday loans work like this: You want money today, but payday is  
a week or two away. You write a check dated for your payday and 
give it to a check cashing outlet. You get your money, less a fee. 
In two weeks, the check casher cashes your check or lets you pay 
another fee to renew the loan for another two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 18 more states, as in Tennessee where a temporary law  
allowing payday loans expires this year, the check cashing industry 
is currently seeking to change laws that forbid their unique brand 
of triple-digit loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hired a Noah's Ark of lobbyists,'' recalled Tennessee  
state Sen. Steve Cohen, who counted 10 lobbyists for the industry 
as the Legislature debated whether to legalize payday loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hired a black lobbyist to get black votes,'' Cohen said.  
``If we'd have had a transsexual they would have hired a 
transsexual lobbyist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payday lenders and their families donated at least $105,750 to  
Tennessee lawmakers' campaigns from October 1996 through October 
1998. While McKenzie was the big giver, Check Into Cash owner W. 
Allan Jones and his family gave $29,300. The Tennessee Cash Advance 
Association gave $23,300 and members gave $15,200 separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures don't include large, unregulated ``soft money''  
gifts to the Republican and Democratic parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' company and McKenzie's subsidiary, National Cash Advance,  
make loans from the Carolinas to California. The two industry 
pioneers and their wives, who live in Tennessee, contributed as far 
away as Florida; all four gave the maximum allowable $500 to Gov. 
Jeb Bush. McKenzie gave another $5,000 to the GOP in Florida, where 
payday lending is legal but remains under fire from critics and law 
enforcement officials who say some companies are charging more than 
the 10 percent allowed each time a loan is renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	One group, the California Check Cashers Association, spent  
$79,135 lobbying California lawmakers in 1996, the year the state 
passed a law allowing and regulating payday lending. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobbyists for payday lenders say their contributions are legal  
and typical for any business group trying to influence legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not an industry in any democratic society that does  
not represent itself in government bodies,'' said Anthony Simone of 
the payday lenders' group Community Financial Services Association, 
defending the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics argue that powerful lobbyists and big contributions --  
not consumers' best interests -- are what changed state laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tennessee, Brian McGuire of the consumer advocacy group  
Tennessee Citizen Action, said he tried to fight the payday loan 
legislation. But it was an uneven match, some observed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Legislatures work pretty well if you have good lobbyists on  
both sides,'' said Tennessee state Sen. Roy Herron. ``Where the 
system breaks down is where you have a crew of highly effective and 
capable lobbyists on one side and only five-and-a-half million 
silent Tennesseans on the other side. Then the result is not always 
justice.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond giving money, payday lenders have also hired  
well-connected former politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisiana, they hired the law firm of former U.S. Sen.  
Russell Long. In Tennessee, McKenzie's company made a top executive 
out of Sundquist's aide, Chip Saltsman. He's now also chairman of 
the Tennessee Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, Steve Beshear, a former lieutenant governor and  
attorney general, ran for the U.S. Senate in 1996, saying, 
``Congress is owned, body and soul, by special interest groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he lost, he became the top lobbyist for Kentucky's payday  
loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
	His employer, the Kentucky Deferred Deposit Association, spent  
$102,539 on lobbying from September 1997 through April 1998, the 
month the law was changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Beshear declined calls seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, payday lenders didn't just give at the state level.  
They gave $21,000 in just five weeks last year to Kentucky Lt. Gov. 
Steve Henry's U.S. Senate bid. They gave $11,000 over two months to 
the Senate campaign of former Rep. Scotty Beasler, D-Ky., including 
$4,000 from the Joneses and McKenzies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Ryan borrowed $200 from a check cashing firm so she could  
take her 7-year-old daughter to visit relatives last year, just 
months after Kentucky approved triple-digit payday loans. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Ryan couldn't pay the loan back, she borrowed more to  
pay the fees. With only $800 a month in disability income to pay 
the $1,160 she owes four payday lenders, she may file for 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go to bed thinking, 'How on earth am I going to get this  
paid?' '' said Ms. Ryan, 39, of Middlesboro, Ky. ``When I hear the 
alarm go off in the morning, it's the first thought I have.''

<HEADLINE> Finding a Cure for All-in-Wonder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Nothing is as sweet as a come-from-behind victory over a clever,  
powerful enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent column chronicled a failed attempt to install ATI  
Technologies' All-in-Wonder Pro video accelerator and TV tuner. 
</P>
<P>
	The install program repeatedly hung at the Windows 98 reboot,  
stubbornly refusing all attempts to get it to work. This was a 
shame, because the Canadian company's card had been getting rave 
reviews and promised powerful 2-D and 3-D graphics, plus great 
video input and output capability. 
</P>
<P>
	And all for $169.99, less than its eight megabytes of memory  
would have cost not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	So I reinstalled the original video card in my PC, licked my  
wounds and tried again, this time with a new card from ATI, who 
felt that the first go-around might have included outdated 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out that both pieces of software were identical. What  
did the trick on the second try was to first uninstall all Norton 
utilities. ATI's install software apparently was too modest to do 
its thing while Norton watched. 
</P>
<P>
	Irritating, but worth the effort. I loaded something called  
Lunatik, from Eidos, part of an included six-package software 
bundle, and was blown away by the card's ability to deliver smooth, 
quick, 64-bit 3-D graphics in a rich array of colors. 
</P>
<P>
	So all that remained was to hook up the cable TV line and try  
the video capabilities, right? 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong. Although the installation had been successful, any  
attempt to run the video program brought this mysterious Windows 98 
error message: ``Your program is making an invalid dynamic link 
call to a .DLL file.'' The last ``invalid dynamic link call'' I 
understood was getting turned down for a date, so it was clearly 
time to call ATI technical support and whine for help. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when ATI put a lot of points on the board. Although -- and  
perhaps because -- it was not a toll-free call, technical support 
answered on the second ring. The suggestion: Find a file named 
VGARTD.VXD and rename it VGARTD.ATI. 
</P>
<P>
	Which was way beyond my technical understanding, but if the  
witch doctor says it will kill the demon, why argue? I jotted down 
the spell, intending to execute it later, at home. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of hours later, technical support called back to say  
that on second thought, and after doing some poking around in 
Microsoft's Knowledge base, I really ought to open my System .INI 
file and place a semicolon in front of the statement 
``DCI(equals)RFMDCI.'' This was followed up with an e-mail of 
precise instructions, a very nice touch. 
</P>
<P>
	The semicolon tells Windows 98 to ignore the instruction, which  
was apparently lurking around from Windows 3.1 days. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked! The All-in-Wonder-Pro woke up, got video cooking in a  
flash, and did all the nifty things the hype said it would do. 
Which is a lot, including closed captioning, user-selectable 
close-up, scheduled viewing and a ``Hot Words'' feature that alerts 
you when selected words appear in the captioning. 
</P>
<P>
	And that doesn't even get into the video capture capabilities  
and the ability to use a TV set for displaying presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	It's irritating that a 10-character instruction in an .INI file  
could cause so much grief, but that's one of the joys of Windows. 
And the ATI follow-up was impressive. So if you're thinking of a 
graphics card upgrade, give it a shot. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> International Anti-Bribery Pact Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Commerce Secretary William Daley said Monday  
that the Salt Lake City Olympic bribery scandal shows no country is 
immune from bribery, and he called for strong enforcement and 
monitoring of a new international anti-bribery treaty that went 
into effect Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Corruption affects rich and poor nations, multinational  
corporations and small businesses. We are all in this together,'' 
Daley said at a conference on the role of the private sector in 
fighting corruption in developing countries and emerging economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Conference on Corruption, held under the auspices  
of the 29-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, brings together 150 high-level government and private 
sector participants from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Vice President Al Gore will open an 80-nation  
first-of-its-kind conference that will specifically target fighting 
corruption among police, prosecutors, judges, military personnel, 
customs officers, border guards and government budget and 
procurement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is a positive coming out of Salt Lake City or  
cronyism in Asia,'' Daley said, ``it is that to the cost of bribery 
has been added a political price -- people have lost their 
positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Salt Lake City Olympic Organizing Committee officials,  
Daley was alluding to the resignation after 32 years in power of 
Indonesian President Suharto last year, which came about, in part, 
because of his family's involvement in controlling the commodity 
import market. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the U.S government plans to increase the pressure on  
the World Trade Organization and Latin American and Asian regional 
organizations to adopt strong anti-corruption measures. 
</P>
<P>
	In discussing the OECD's anti-corruption treaty -- now in effect  
for a week -- Daley named France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy 
as countries that had signed the accord but not yet ratified it 
though they promised to do by the end of 1998. Those countries 
account for nearly a quarter of OECD exports. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 12 member nations, including the United States, had  
formally adopted the OECD treaty, and that he hoped other members 
would fulfill their commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley also urged private companies to establish codes of  
conduct, set up ethics offices and train employees to watch out for 
bribes and report them to these offices.

<HEADLINE> Securitas To Acquire Pinkerton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Pinkerton Inc., the legendary  
American detective agency that guarded Abraham Lincoln, chased 
Jesse James and gave rise to the term ``private eye,'' is being 
bought by a Swedish security company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Securitas AB would create a global company with  
$3.5 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Securitas agreed Monday to pay $384 million for Pinkerton, which  
will keep its name, management and worldwide staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not losing an icon. Pinkerton will remain Pinkerton.  
We're just trading shareholders,'' said Denis R. Brown, Pinkerton's 
president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined companies would have about 5 percent of the  
worldwide security market and 114,000 employees in more than 30 
countries in Europe, North and South America, and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger reflects the need of both companies to expand their  
international reach, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton will rely on Securitas to serve its clients throughout  
much of Europe, where Pinkerton is weak. Pinkerton, in return, 
gives Securitas access to the North American and South American 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, it looks like they will be a major global presence in  
this business, and frankly, I think Securitas is getting it at a 
very reasonable price,'' said Steve Percoco, an analyst with Lark 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton's profits have been weak and it has been revamping  
some of its businesses in response. On Monday it said 
fourth-quarter profits were off 35 percent to $4.3 million, or 35 
cents per share, from $6.6 million, or 50 cents per share, a year 
ago. For the year, Pinkerton lost $463,000, or 4 cents per share, 
compared to earnings of $14.7 million or $1.12 per share in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton was founded in 1850 by Allan Pinkerton, a barrel maker  
who turned detective after helping authorities capture a band of 
counterfeiters operating near his business in Dundee, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton himself won fame as Lincoln's protector in the early  
days of the Civil War. The company wasn't working with Lincoln when 
he was assassinated in 1865. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton agents were hired by banks and railroads to track down  
robbers and swindlers. Pinkerton agents chased the James and 
Younger Brothers gangs across the South and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Wild West years, Pinkerton gents were credited with  
killing or capturing most members of the Wild Bunch. The gang's 
leaders, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, escaped capture by 
fleeing to South America. 
</P>
<P>
	During the late 19th century, Pinkerton agents infiltrated  
unions and attempted to disrupt strikes and organizing activities. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the best-known cases, testimony from Pinkerton agents  
helped convict 19 coal miners who belonged to the terrorist group 
known as the Mollie Maguires. The miners were found guilty of 
crimes committed during a bitter strike and were hanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pinkerton logo, a large eye with the words ``We Never  
Sleep'' under it, is said to have given rise to the term ``private 
eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, Pinkerton employees range from uniformed security  
guards to computer experts who protect corporate databases and 
other intellectual property. Clients include 80 percent of the 
companies in the Fortune 1000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say there's nothing in the area of security that we're  
not involved in somewhere in the world,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	On news of the merger, Pinkerton stock jumped $11.68 3/4, or 69  
percent to $28.56 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Securitas agreed 
to pay $29 for each Pinkerton share. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition has been approved by the boards of both  
companies, but it still must undergo regulatory scrutiny.

<HEADLINE> Court Sides With FCC Over Bells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court lifted a court order Monday  
that had limited the Federal Communication Commission's authority 
over local Bell telephone companies' efforts to provide 
long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court's action further strengthens the FCC's ability to  
open the $110 billion local phone market to competition, and is 
considered another defeat for the nation's five Bell telephone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the Supreme Court, without comment, vacated the  
8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' order forbidding the FCC from 
requiring local Bell telephone companies to open their networks to 
competitors at certain prices, as a prerequisite for entering the 
long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	No Baby Bell has won FCC clearance to offer long-distance  
service in its local phone market. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices ordered the appeals court in St. Louis to  
reconsider its 1998 ruling in light of another recent Supreme Court 
decision upholding the FCC's authority to oversee such pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the high court said a 1996 law gives the FCC the  
power to set pricing guidelines for long-distance companies and 
other potential competitors to connect with local phone companies' 
networks. Rivals need to do this to offer competing local service. 
That Supreme Court decision was a loss for the Bell companies and 
GTE and a win for the FCC and long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling overturned a 1997 decision by the St. Louis court  
that said states -- not the FCC -- had that power. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE and the Bell telephone companies are now challenging the  
substance of the FCC's price rules, which the high court did not 
address in its Jan. 25 order, at the St. Louis court. The court 
will determine whether the FCC's price rules are consistent with 
the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to state telephone regulators meeting in Washington,  
Solomon Trujillo, president of Bell company US West, again urged 
Congress to rewrite a provision of a 1996 law that would permit the 
Bell companies to provide long-distance service at a specific date 
in the future. He didn't recommend what that date should be.

<HEADLINE>  Rockies Comfortable With New Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Golf clubs are allowed on the baggage  
carousel and Armani suits are not required on road trips. Welcome 
to the new rules under Colorado Rockies manager Jim Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I normally don't have too many rules,'' Leyland said. ``The  
more you've got, the more you break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In six years under manager Don Baylor, coats and ties were  
mandatory on Colorado's charter plane. Golfing was allowed on the 
road but golf clubs were not. Spring workouts started by 
mid-morning and finished well after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, the Rockies are able to schedule afternoon tee times  
at posh resort courses because they are typically finished by noon 
following 2 1/2-hour workouts efficiently coordinated by third-base 
coach Rich Donnelly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody just feels comfortable,'' said infielder  
Kurt Abbott, who played for Leyland when the Florida Marlins won 
the World Series in 1997. ``Everybody knows what they have to do. 
It's about baseball, about doing things right. It's not about 
having to dress up or looking good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some players trade their three-piece suits for polo shirts  
from the Greg Norman collection, don't expect the Rockies to show 
up at a New York hotel looking like a leftover from a Pearl Jam 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	In giving his players some leeway, Leyland is trusting they will  
police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be neat,'' he said. ``I basically let the players  
make the rule. You can wear a nice pair of jeans, but if guys start 
wearing jeans with holes in them, we can wear a suit and tie. We 
can wear tuxedos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Baylor, the Rockies were allowed to have mustaches and a  
well-kept goatee. That policy will not change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my team to act like professionals and I want them to be  
disciplined, but I don't believe telling a grown man he can't have 
a mustache is a form of discipline,'' Leyland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The longer leash can be attributed to Leyland's resume, which  
includes 13 years as a major league manager, a World Series ring 
and three straight NL East pennants with the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Rockies were born in 1993, everything was a learning  
experience, and the owners had more input into the team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like with a family,'' Rockies owner Jerry  
McMorris said. ``It's always easier to loosen the reins than 
tighten the reins. ... We're changing with the times and the new 
manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Leyland's standards stem from common sense. The shorter  
workouts prevent players from getting bored shagging fly balls, and 
the dress code keeps them comfortable on cross-country charter 
flights that sometimes land at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's going to see us?'' relief pitcher Chuck McElroy said.  
``You don't want to spill soda or anything on an $1,100 suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules are sure to be a hit with Colorado's more  
flamboyant personalities such as outfielder Dante Bichette -- who 
showed up with his hair dyed black and Elvis sideburns last season 
-- and relief pitcher Curtis Leskanic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might have to have a dress code with me,'' Leskanic said,  
``otherwise I'll show up looking like I'm playing in the New York 
Penal League. Seriously though, it's just a matter of not doing 
anything stupid.''

<HEADLINE> Portraitists Pestered 1st President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George Washington came to the presidency under  
siege by artists who saw his character and their fortunes in the 
contours of his face. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Revolution's commander in chief found persistent  
artists more irritating than the crack of British muskets; the 
lengthy sittings portrait painters required were, he said, 
mind-numbing wastes of fleeting time. 
</P>
<P>
	Posterity, for whom these portraits were painted, can now judge  
the results for itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five Washington portraits, painted by a dozen artists  
during his two terms as president, are on view at the National 
Portrait Gallery here. The show is one of many events marking 1999 
as the 200th anniversary of the first president's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting for an artist, Washington was, at first, ``as restive  
... as a colt is of the saddle,'' he said in a letter. Then he 
simply endured. Finally, he rebelled, strictly limiting the artists 
he sat for. He was, he said, ``heartily tired'' of the demands of 
``these kinds of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``George and Martha Washington: Portraits from the Presidential  
Years'' offers a wide range of talent and formats, from intimate 
miniatures on ivory to full-length portraits laden with the gravity 
of state documents. One portrait bust in marble shows the president 
as a noble Roman draped in a toga. 
</P>
<P>
	The show runs through Aug. 8.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Miles, the Portrait Gallery's curator for painting and  
sculpture and author of the show's catalogue, notes that a group 
portrait of the Washington family by Edward Savage is laced with 
symbolism. The Washingtons are examining a map of the new federal 
district soon to bear the president's name; columns and red drapery 
frame a view of the Potomac River in the glow of a sunset, itself a 
symbol of the approaching end of the president's long career. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbert Stuart, creator of the Washington image that graces the  
one-dollar bill and other well-known portraits of the president, 
has a prominent role in the show. But Martha Washington told at 
least one friend she did not consider Stuart's efforts a ``true 
resemblance'' of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, one 19th century art critic said that if Washington  
should suddenly reappear on earth people who had seen Stuart's 
portraits would brand him an impostor. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart and the others turned out Washington portraits for an  
eager market and multiplied their profits by selling engravings of 
the works. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to make a fortune by Washington,'' Stuart told an  
Irish painter in 1793. 
</P>
<P>
	If Stuart and his colleagues hoped for money, they also searched  
for character. Stuart found Washington's face ``fierce,'' almost 
savage, and many of his features uncommon or unique. John Trumbull, 
who portrayed the president as the hero of the Battle of Trenton, 
saw in his face ``the high resolve to conquer or to perish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Stuart portrait appeared as an illustration in a French book  
on physiognomy whose author pronounced: ``Everything in this face 
announces the good man, a man upright, of simple manners, sincere, 
firm, reflecting and generous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One family of American artists took on Washington en masse, and  
earned a pun for their pains. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriarch Charles WilLson Peale, who had fought with Washington  
in the revolution and had painted the commander more than 50 times, 
asked him to sit for his son, Rembrandt Peale.

	Washington agreed, but Rembrandt Peale became ``so agitated that  
I could scarcely mix my colours'' and asked his father to set up 
his easel as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Peale calmed down and two portraits resulted, each  
from a different angle. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon other Peales joined in, including Rembrandt's uncle, James  
Peale, and his young brothers, Raphaelle and Titian Peale. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart reported to Martha Washington: ``He is beset, Madam. No  
less than five upon him at once: One aims at his eye, another at 
his nose, another is busy with his hair, his mouth is attacked by a 
fourth and the fifth has him by the button.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On encountering another artist, Stuart again described the scene  
of Washington and the Peales and unleashed his pun. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were peeling him, Sir,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Study Targets Golf Ranking System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Forget the debate over whether Tiger  
Woods or David Duval should be No. 1 in the world. The real 
controversy this week is who they should be playing in the first 
round of the Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	An exhaustive analysis of Official World Golf Ranking,  
commissioned by Golf Digest for its April issue and released 
Monday, shows the system does not reflect current level of play and 
is particularly out of sync in the lower end of the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really what matters -- not who's No. 1, but who gets to  
play,'' said Dean Knuth, who spent two months on the project for 
Golf Digest. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking system had always been somewhat of an enigma,  
published once a week, but no more meaningful than some of the PGA 
Tour's statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	That's no longer the case. The 64-man field for the first World  
Golf Championship was decided by the rankings, meaning those who 
barely got in -- such as Nick Faldo and Craig Stadler -- will get at 
least $25,000 and have a chance at the first prize of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Golf Digest turned to Knuth, who spent 16  
years with the U.S. Golf Association and created something even 
more cryptic than the rankings: the course and slope rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Knuth, who scored a perfect 800 on his SAT and now writes  
high-tech software for the military, came up with eight major flaws 
with the system and distributed his findings to the five major 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--The ranking isn't current. Because the two-year rolling system  
gives double points for the current year, Knuth says a victory last 
week is the same as 51 weeks ago. By the same token, a player gets 
twice as much credit for a tournament one year ago than he does for 
a tournament 53 weeks ago. He suggests decreasing the value by 
one-twelfth each month. 
</P>
<P>
	--Points are unevenly distributed. Players earn points for top-20  
finishes, so finishing 21st is no different than missing the cut. 
Knuth proposes assigning points in the same manner the PGA Tour 
distributes prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	--The strength of field factor is self-perpetuating. A No. 1  
player in the field is worth 50 weighting points, while the No. 7 
player is worth only 20 weighting points to that tournament. Top 
players created their own strength of field. He suggests computing 
the strength of field over the previous five years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Majors are not worth enough points. Knuth points out that  
someone who wins a Japanese tour event gets more points than a 
player who finishes third in the Masters. Majors account for 10 
percent of total points given in a total year. Knuth recommends 
increasing the value to 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Japan and Australasian tours are getting too many points.  
Knuth says their value should be cut in half. Carlos Franco, ranked 
44th in the world, won twice in Japan last year, but never finished 
higher than 40th in any of the majors. He narrowly got his PGA Tour 
card at Q-school, but is eligible for two $5 million world events 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Knuth also says European events should be worth more, and  
unofficial events such as the invitation-only Million Dollar 
Challenge and World Match Play Championship should have their value 
cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
	If his rankings had been used this week, Faldo, Stadler, Franco  
and Frankie Minoza would not have qualified, while David Toms, Jay 
Haas, Frank Nobilo and Per-Ulrik Johansson would be in. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the top, Mark O'Meara would have been No. 1 at the end of  
last year, Duval would have replaced him after his 59 in the Hope 
Classic, and Woods would have returned to the top after winning in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf Digest plans to present the report to the International  
Federation of PGA Tours next week.

<HEADLINE> Merger of Shipbuilders Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The proposed merger between the Navy  
shipbuilders Newport News Shipbuilding and Avondale Industries Inc. 
has received anti-trust clearance from the U.S. Justice Department, 
but the future of the deal remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Other federal officials still must OK the merger. Also, General  
Dynamics' recent proposal to acquire Newport News could still 
scuttle the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale said in a brief statement Monday that the Justice  
Department had determined the merger would not violate federal 
anti-trust law. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would create a company with estimated 1999 revenues  
of $2.6 billion. The company would be capable of building any 
warship in the Navy's fleet, from behemoth nuclear-powered aircraft 
carriers to fast-moving amphibious landers. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger still must be approved by the stockholders of both  
companies and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Pentagon signed off on the deal between  
Virginia-based Newport News and New Orleans-based Avondale. The 
Defense Department said the merger ``would not an adverse impact on 
competition to build and repair Navy ships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was unrelated to General Dynamics' proposed  
$1.36 billion cash takeover of Newport News. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News has said that General Dynamics' proposal required  
careful review of potential antitrust problems in the rapidly 
consolidating defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department said Friday it is evaluating the proposed  
General Dynamics-Newport News merger. The Pentagon has said it 
supports mergers that reduce excess capacity or lower costs while 
sustaining competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avondale-Newport News deal would reduce the Navy's pool of  
primary contractors for ships to three: the new company; General 
Dynamics, which owns Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works, and National 
Steel and Shipbuilding Co.; and Litton Industries, parent of 
Ingalls Shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding builds all the Navy's aircraft  
carriers and many of its submarines, and it repairs and performs 
maintenance on various types of Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale designs, builds and overhauls Navy surface ships as  
well as commercial vessels.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Logo Lawsuit Verdict Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A federal judge has upheld a jury's verdict  
that the Baltimore Ravens copied their logo design from a security 
guard, who sued the NFL franchise for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion dated Feb. 19, U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis  
denied the team's request for a new trial, saying the jury's 
verdict last November was ``supported by adequate evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also rejected defense lawyers' suggestion that one juror was  
coerced by a deadlocked panel into deciding in favor of security 
guard Frederick Bouchat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens contend the design was created by league artists at  
NFL Properties in New York without any input from Bouchat. The 
Ravens' logo features outspread raven wings flanking a shield 
bearing the letter ``B.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchat, a former security guard, claims that while working at  
the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation in downtown 
Baltimore, he decorated a Cleveland Browns helmet with a logo he 
designed shortly after state officials lured the Browns to 
Baltimore in November 1995. He says he placed the helmet on his 
desk in the building's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens have said they will appeal the verdict. Ravens  
spokesman Kevin Byrne; the team's lawyer, John Paul Reiner; and NFL 
officials could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchat declined to comment on the ruling, referring the matter  
to his attorneys. But the judge's decision bolstered Bouchat's 
claim, said his lawyer, Howard Schulman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident that the verdict will hold up,'' Schulman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount Bouchat will receive will be determined at a later  
hearing before another federal jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate motion, the judge opened the way for Bouchat's  
lawyers to investigate a Ravens' employee's claim the team had 
Bouchat's design at their headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Ravens will likely appeal, Garbis wrote ``it cannot be  
said that any further evidence relating to the Ravens' access (to 
the logo design) is, necessarily, moot.''

<HEADLINE> Video Games, Berlin Wall Lead Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a week of voting left, video games and  
the fall of the Berlin Wall are the leading candidates for postage 
stamps commemorating the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Votes cast through Feb. 17 put video games in first place with  
133,942 ballots, followed by the Berlin Wall at 132,190, the Postal

</P>
<P>
	The next five top vote-getters are cable television, 94,385;

<HEADLINE> Saints Terminate Shuler's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Quarterback Heath Shuler's contract with the  
New Orleans Saints was terminated Monday, team president and 
general manager Bill Kuharich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuler, 26, had two years left on a deal originally agreed upon  
in 1997 when the Saints acquired him through a trade with the 
Washington Redskins. He was scheduled to make base salaries of $2 
million in 1999 and $3.5 million in 2000, plus a $500,000 roster 
bonus and a $500,000 reporting bonus in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuler, a first-round draft pick in 1994, had said he was  
interested in restructuring the remaining time on his contract but 
an injured left foot apparently weighed against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-year veteran has not played a down since Nov. 16, 1997.  
He has been hobbled since sustaining crushed bones in his left foot 
in a game at Oakland on Nov. 9, 1997. Surgeons removed the 
shattered bones and torn ligaments that year, but the injury 
remains painful. 
</P>
<P>
	After a record-breaking career at Tennessee, the Washington  
Redskins made Shuler the third player taken in the 1994 draft, 
expecting quarterback-friendly coach Norv Turner to make him an NFL 
star. 
</P>
<P>
	But a 13-day holdout while a $19 million contract was completed  
turned Redskins fans against Shuler. He followed that up with poor 
play, forced passes and fumbles. Finally, a shoulder injury benched 
him and allowed Gus Frerotte, a seventh-round pick out of Tulsa, to 
take over. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuler was then acquired by the Saints. But in nine starts, he  
completed 52 percent of his passes, threw only two touchdowns and 
was intercepted 14 times. He was also sacked 21 times in 10 games 
before being put on injured reserve Nov. 19, 1997.

<HEADLINE> NY Times Buying TheStreet.com Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co. is buying a minority  
stake in TheStreet.com, a popular financial news Web site, for $15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Monday, will give the publisher a stake in  
one of the Internet's hottest areas as a growing number of 
investors flock to the Web for financial news and investment 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	TheStreet.com was co-founded in 1996 by James J. Cramer, a  
well-known money manager who writes a daily column for the site and 
also appears regularly as a commentator on the CNBC cable business 
news network. 
</P>
<P>
	TheStreet.com currently has about 37,000 paid subscribers.  
</P>
<P>
	The Times Co. is buying the undisclosed stake strictly as an  
investment and will not be contributing any news to the site. The 
purchase will be made with a combination of cash and services, but 
those services have yet to be determined, said spokeswoman Lisa 
Carparelli. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, The Times Co.'s vice chairman, Michael  
Golden, will become a member of TheStreet.com's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its flagship newspaper, The New York Times Co.  
publishes The Boston Globe, 21 regional newspapers and three 
magazines. It also operates eight television and two radio 
stations, and has several Internet-related investments.

<HEADLINE> Mets Co-Owner Tours Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Nelson Doubleday was so excited  
about the prospects for the New York Mets that he decided to take a 
look for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The 65-year-old co-owner of the Mets toured the club's complex  
Monday with general manager Steve Phillips while the team went 
through a three-hour workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the chemistry is there,'' Doubleday said. ``I think  
you saw it at the end of last year, I think you saw it when Mike 
(Piazza) showed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking time out from his stroll, Doubleday spent several minutes  
talking with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very interesting spring,'' he said. ``We've  
got Steve (Phillips) and that's a very important thing, you can see 
what he's put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shea Stadium is going to be fun this season,'' Doubleday said.  
``Hopefully, we'll see some games that are 9-2 in our favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday reported that 100,000 seats were sold at Shea Stadium  
on first day tickets went on sale, a substantial increase from the 
22,000 bought on the same day last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday also shared the story about receiving a gift from a  
friend consisting of two belts with wording stitched into them. The 
matching pair of belts are for Doubleday and his wife to wear to 
Shea Stadium.

<HEADLINE> IOC Inquiry To End This Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC plans to end its investigation this  
weekend into possible misconduct by members implicated in the Salt 
Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials said Monday the six-man investigative panel  
will begin meeting late this week at International Olympic 
Committee headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have three options,'' said one panel member, speaking on  
condition of anonymity. ``We can exonerate (members). We can issue 
a warning or propose a warning, or we recommend expulsions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings will be private, with no news conferences or  
announcements planned, pending final decisions by the IOC executive 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do hope we will have completed our work by the end of the  
week,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard said. ``We will then 
prepare recommendations for the executive board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No board meeting is scheduled until March 14-15, just before the  
March 17-18 general assembly called to deal with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said it is possible the board could decide earlier by  
conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to the executive board if they want to wait until the  
14th or take a decision next week,'' he said. ``In any case, there 
will probably be nothing to announce before early next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the IOC inquiry panel recommended the expulsions of  
six members for accepting cash payments, scholarships for their 
relatives or other inducements stemming from Salt Lake City's bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those six members has since resigned, joining two others  
who had quit previously. The IOC panel notified three other members 
they were still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, 10 additional members were cited for possible rules  
violations in a report by a Salt Lake City ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cases of expulsion will be put to next month's general assembly,  
where a two-thirds vote is required for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Chilean IOC member Sergio Santander, one of those  
facing expulsion, resigned as president of his country's national 
Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-year-old Santander has admitted receiving $4,700 from Tom  
Welch, former president of the Salt Lake City bid organizers, but 
called it a personal contribution to an unsuccessful political 
campaign in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the previous cases, the IOC sent letters seeking  
explanations to those members named in the Salt Lake report. The 
members were given a chance to reply in writing or in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to study the files for which we've sent letters  
to all the members on the second list,'' the panel member said. 
``The general interest is to decide on the cases as soon as 
possible, especially for the members themselves whose names have 
been mentioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official said he believes the commission will also complete  
its inquiry into the three previous pending cases involving South 
Korea's Kim Un-yong, Russia's Vitaly Smirnov and Ivory Coast's 
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, a senior IOC executive board member, is the highest-ranking  
official implicated in the Salt Lake case. He was cited in both the 
IOC's internal investigation and that of the Salt Lake ethics 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has mounted an aggressive defense, describing the  
allegations against him as a politically motivated plot to smear 
his name and undermine his ambitions to succeed Juan Antonio 
Samaranch as IOC president. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel member said it's possible that not all remaining cases  
will be completed this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not unthinkable that we might need more information on  
one or two cases,'' he said. ``This is a serious matter. You are 
not going to judge on incomplete documents or information. You 
cannot rule out that some cases will be deferred to the future. I 
would hope not in the interest of the members themselves, but you 
cannot be sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Also, Kevan Gosper, an Australian member of the IOC's  
executive board, rebuked John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance 
president Dave D'Alessandro for speaking out against the 
international committee's handling of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed he should be debating this in public as if he  
is the conscience of the IOC,'' Gosper said.

<HEADLINE> Court Leaves Asbestos Award Intact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today left intact a $10.6  
million award against an Illinois manufacturer sued over its past 
use of asbestos in some of its products. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which John  
Crane Inc. attacked as fundamentally unfair a consolidated trial in 
Baltimore in which it was one of many defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-month Maryland state court trial that ended in 1995  
centered on thousands of health claims arising from exposure to 
products containing asbestos, used extensively for decades in 
insulation and fireproofing before it was linked to severe and 
sometimes deadly respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The claims of more than 1,000 plaintiffs against about a dozen  
defendants were consolidated before Judge Richard Rombro, but the 
trial fully handled only the claims of five ``representative'' 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Crane, based in Morton Grove, Ill., and a subsidiary of Bundy  
Corp., manufactures sealing products, including packing used to 
seal pumps and valves. The packing once contained asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
	Crane's liability was upheld by a state appeals court and  
Maryland's highest court refused last October to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Crane said, ``A  
sprawling consolidated trial of this complexity presents such a 
high probability of jury confusion and prejudice to the defendant 
that it must be deemed inherently lacking in due process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal noted the growing trend of massive product-liability  
litigation, stating, ``It seems certain that at least many tens, if 
not hundreds, of thousands of cases are resolved by state and 
federal courts each year in consolidated proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crane's appeal was supported in a friend-of-the-court brief  
submitted by, among others, the National Association of 
Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a consolidated action,'' they told the justices, ``there is  
a grave risk that the jury will confuse the facts applicable to any 
particular plaintiff or defendant with those applicable to 
others.'' The trial in Baltimore provided ``an all too familiar 
example of the jury confusion, prejudice and plain error that can 
occur,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is John Crane Inc. vs. Abate, 98-873.

<HEADLINE> Sempra Energy Is Buying KN Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Sempra Energy is buying the natural gas  
pipeline operator KN Energy Inc. for about $1.8 billion in cash and 
stock in a deal that would extend the rapid expansion of the 
California-based energy concern. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company under the deal announced Sunday would  
retain the name Sempra Energy and continue to be based in San 
Diego. It would have revenue of about $9.9 billion annually and 
more than 15,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra was formed last June with the merger of Los Angeles-based  
Pacific Enterprises and San Diego based Enova Corp. Sempra said it 
has 21 million customers among its eight subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	KN Energy, based in Lakewood, has $9 billion in assets in 16  
states, including natural gas pipelines, more than 30 gas 
processing plants, 25 storage facilities and more than 200,000 
residential customers in addition to business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal needs approval by both state and federal regulators and  
both companies' shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 200 and 300 jobs would be eliminated, with most  
reductions in headquarters and staff positions at both companies, 
said Richard Farman, Sempra's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	KN Energy employs about 3,300 people. Sempra has 12,000  
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, Sempra will offer 1.115 shares of  
its common stock for each share of KN Energy stock, or $25 in cash 
for each share. KN Energy has about 70 million shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra would also assume more than $4 billion in KN Energy debt  
as part of the deal, pushing its total value to about $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	KN Energy picked up a high debt load last year with the $3.5  
billion purchase of MidCon Corp. pipeline company. Reduced demand 
for natural gas with the warm winter sent KN stock to a 52-week low 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said Farman will remain as chairman and CEO of the  
combined company. KN Energy CEO Larry Hall will join Sempra's board 
of directors.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Ruling Party Leads Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHETUMAL, Mexico (AP) -- Mexico's ruling party appeared it would  
beat back a stiff challenge by opposition parties in a race for the 
governorship of the Caribbean coast state of Quintana Roo. 
</P>
<P>
	With 12.68 percent of the vote counted late Sunday, the  
Institutional Revolutionary Party's candidate, Joaquin Hendricks, 
had 40.93 percent of the vote. Gaston Alegre of the leftist 
Democratic Revolutionary Party had 31.8 percent, and a pro-business 
party, National Action, had 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Democratic Revolution held out hope it could win,  
Hendricks proclaimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have won cleanly,'' he told a cheering crowd of supporters  
in Chetumal, the state capital. ``I'm going to govern for everyone 
... with honesty and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintana Roo, where wealthy tourist resorts like Cancun are  
located near dirt-poor Maya Indian communities, was seen as a test 
of the ruling party's ability to convince voters it can narrow the 
income gap and overcome the image of corruption and 
authoritarianism that dogs current Gov. Mario Villanueva. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a change. The worst thing that could happen is for  
things to go on the same way,'' said Manuel Peraza, a businessman 
in Chetumal. 
</P>
<P>
	Early results were not available Sunday for another race, the  
governor election in Hidalgo state. The ruling party, known as the 
PRI, had expected to easily retain control of the central plains 
state. The race between Hendricks, a former army officer, and 
Alegre had been much closer, according to pre-election polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Alegre had pledged more protection for workers and the state's  
fragile environment, while Hendricks wants to develop agribusiness 
to keep poor farmers from flocking to slums surrounding the 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	The PRI has governed Quintana Roo since it was admitted as a  
state in 1974. At the federal level, the party has held the 
presidency without interruption since 1929 and would like to 
maintain its strength for the 2000 presidential vote. Earlier this 
month, it won the governorship of Guerrero state but lost in Baja 
California Sur. 
</P>
<P>
	The party faces serious problems in Quintana Roo.  
</P>
<P>
	Two days before Sunday's vote, federal prosecutors announced 38  
arrest warrants for former Quintana Roo state officials and 
businessmen linked to the cocaine-trafficking Juarez cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe the U.S. government would like to see Villanueva  
prosecuted for alleged links to drug traffickers. Villanueva, who 
maintains his innocence, has won a court order allowing him to see 
evidence in a Mexican investigation against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the PRI's big challenge was coming in places like the  
largely Indian town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, where farmworkers 
earn about $1.70 per day, well below the national minimum wage of 
$3.45 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermino Cab was one voter who said he supported Democratic  
Revolution ``because the PRI never does anything for us. We don't 
have irrigation, we don't have tractors ... the hospital won't take 
care of us, and sometimes our children die.''

<HEADLINE> Movies Were Siskel's First Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Writing for rival newspapers, the young Gene  
Siskel and Roger Ebert were fierce competitors, always trying to 
out-scoop each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The icy relationship warmed -- after time -- when they reluctantly  
teamed up to co-host a public television program called ``Sneak 
Previews'' in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first five years that we knew each other, Gene Siskel  
and I hardly spoke. Then it seemed like we never stopped,'' Ebert 
wrote in a column titled ``Farewell, my friend'' on the front page 
of Sunday's Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel, 53, a married father of three, died in a hospital in  
suburban Evanston on Saturday surrounded by his family. The death 
of the Chicago Tribune critic ended a quiet but strenuous battle 
against complications that arose after a growth was removed from 
his brain in May 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even imagine what it will be like (without Siskel),''  
Ebert said Saturday. ``There was a history there, a respect that 
I'm never really going to replace in my life. It's going to be 
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The public television show that the pair hosted became so  
popular it was syndicated nationwide and later renamed ``Siskel &AMP; 
Ebert.'' With their trademarked ``thumbs up, thumbs down'' reviews, 
the program became a powerhouse in the film industry. A ``thumbs 
up'' could give a film a boost, while a ``thumbs down'' could sink 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two thumbs up has become an icon in the film industry,''  
said Paul Dergarabedian, a spokesman for Exhibitor Relations Co. 
which compiles box office receipts. ``The average person would look 
toward them about whether to take their hard-earned dollars to the 
box office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show will continue on with Ebert and revolving guest  
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel's love affair with movies started when he was a child  
living on Chicago's North Side. As an orphan schoolboy, he'd walk 
eight blocks to his neighborhood theater to catch a Saturday 
matinee with his friends. There, surrounded by red velvet, his 
lifetime love of movies began. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Siskel had taken a leave of absence  
from his work not only with ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' and the Chicago 
Tribune, but also as a film critic for ``CBS This Morning'' and 
WBBM-TV, and as a columnist for TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's column, Ebert recalled how Siskel strove to deflect  
attention away from his illness and toward his film criticism after 
his surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it was obvious sometimes that he walked slowly and  
was in pain, I never once heard him complain. He carried on with a 
bravery that is hard to imagine,'' Ebert wrote.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt To Name Everglades Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, reacting to  
criticism from some leading scientists, on Monday announced the 
creation of an independent advisory panel to help guide the 
government's $8 billion restoration plan for the Florida 
Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sheer scale of this restoration demands that we take full  
advantage of the range of talent our nation has to offer,'' Babbitt 
said in a statement after meeting with three of the scientists who 
have been critical of the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Six leading ecologists in a letter to Babbitt last month had  
complained that the ambitious Everglades restoration does not go 
far enough. They said it should be subject to closer scrutiny by 
independent scientists who have not been involved in developing the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt met Monday with three of the scientists -- Stuart Pimm,  
an ecologist at the University of Tennessee, Gordon Orians of the 
University of Washington, and Peter Raven, director of the Missouri 
Botanical Gardens -- to discuss ways to involve independent 
scientists in the project. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, the Interior Department issued a statement  
saying that Babbitt had agreed to creation of the independent 
scientific panel that would advise on implementation of the 
Everglades restoration program. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, whose members would be appointed by Babbitt and  
represent a broad range of expertise, will provide ``independent 
scientific advice ... to help ensure the success'' of the long-term 
restoration programs, according to a draft proposal agreed to by 
the scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimm said the scientists felt an independent group of advisers  
were needed to monitor the Everglades project. ``This review panel 
provides it and we are absolutely delighted,'' said Pimm after the 
meeting with Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	The other scientists who raised concerns in the Jan. 28 letter  
were Paul Ehrlich an ecologist at Stanford University, Edward O. 
Wilson, a Harvard University biologist, and Gary Meffe, a 
conservation biologist at the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration unveiled the $8 billion Everglades plan last  
October, saying it's aim is to restore one of America's ecological 
wonders by returning the natural water flows that long ago were 
disrupted by a series of government built dams, levies and canals. 
</P>
<P>
	Developed by the Army Corps of Engineers, the plan calls for  
building a comprehensive network of water storage systems to 
provide flood protection, preserve water for agriculture and 
residents and also protect the area's marshlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The project must still be reviewed in a series of public  
hearings and much of it is subject to approval by Congress which 
must come up with half of the money. The other half is financed by 
state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
	While piecemeal efforts to revitalize the Everglades have been  
under way for years, the long-range recovery plan represents the 
most ambitious attempt yet to rescue the unique ecosystem.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Alou May Miss Whole Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	All-Star outfielder Moises Alou ripped up his left knee when he  
fell off a treadmill and likely will miss most, if not all, of the 
season -- a loss the Houston Astros called ``devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou tore his anterior cruciate ligament last week while  
training at his home in the Dominican Republic. The Astros hoped 
the injury was not serious, but an MRI in Houston on Monday 
revealed the damaged ACL. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a devastating blow for our team,'' Astros general  
manager Gerry Hunsicker said by telephone from training camp in 
Kissimmee, Fla. ``Clearly, this was the worst-case scenario we 
could have imagined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably facing missing most of the year, possibly the  
whole season,'' Hunsicker said. ``I think the best we could hope 
for is that he returns sometime in late August or early 
September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou, 32, finished third in the NL MVP voting last season behind  
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire. Playing his first season in Houston, 
Alou hit .312 with 38 home runs and 124 RBIs in helping the Astros 
win the NL Central championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery has not been set, though Hunsicker hoped it would happen  
sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was so shocked by this diagnosis, I think everybody  
is going to take a day or two to gather themselves before anything 
is scheduled,'' Hunsicker said. ``I think he was really stunned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minus Alou, a World Series star for the Florida Marlins in 1997,  
the Astros will rely on Carl Everett and young Richard Hidalgo to 
fill the void in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	Everett hit .296 with 15 homers and 76 RBIs and Hidalgo, 23,  
batted .303 with seven homers and 35 RBIs in 211 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you don't replace an All-Star caliber player,'' Hunsicker  
said. ``We all understand that injuries are part of the game and we 
live in fear of one of our star players being struck down with a 
serious injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker said Alou was hurt Thursday when he tried to adjust  
the controls on a treadmill that was going too fast. Alou slipped 
and caught himself in the crevice between the treadmill belt and 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the Astros were optimistic the injury was not too  
serious. They knew he would not take part when position players 
began spring training Tuesday, but Hunsicker thought it might be a 
cartilage problem that would take 3-4 weeks to heal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There doesn't appear to be any structural damage, which is  
good news, but we don't know the extent of it until he gets the 
tests,'' Hunsicker said last week. ``He can put weight on it, which 
is also a good sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the MRI showed far more extensive damage. Alou traveled to  
Houston on Sunday night and was examined by team physician Dr. 
David Linter on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou set career highs in almost every offensive category last  
season with 182 hits, 34 doubles and 104 runs as the Astros won 
their second straight division title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins traded Alou to the Astros after the 1997 season.  
Under his five-year contract, Alou could have demanded a trade 
after last season but elected to stay after the Astros agreed to 
give him an extra $3 million payment in 2002.

<HEADLINE> CompuServe Gets a Makeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CompuServe, the pioneering online service that  
was overtaken and then taken over by America Online, hopes to stage 
a comeback by reaching beyond the pocket protector crowd without 
becoming another AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe, whose online users were long identified by geeky  
strings of numbers instead of catchy nicknames, unveiled Monday a 
multimillion dollar marketing push with user-friendly software, 
flashier features and lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	While the campaign is designed to attract a broader group of  
professionals such as small business owners, don't expect 
CompuServe to become too much like parent AOL, which pioneered an 
easy-to-use format for the online masses. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL wants to keep CompuServe a distinct, more elite service --  
part of a broader strategy of nurturing the businesses it acquires 
as niche brands for specific customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What AOL is trying to do is get beyond their traditional  
subscriber base, and get into a market that's a bit more 
sophisticated,'' said Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with Jupiter 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	With users finding more convenient ways online, CompuServe's  
subscriber base has fallen from about 2.6 million to 2 million 
since it was taken over by AOL as part of a three-way deal with H&AMP;R 
Block and WorldCom in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	To revive itself, CompuServe plans to mail out diskettes of its  
software upgrade, which supports higher-speed modem connections and 
is easier for users to install and customize on their personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mailing will be targeted more to business professionals,  
a sharp contrast with the ``carpet'' mailings of millions of 
diskettes AOL is known for. 
</P>
<P>
	New subscribers will see a ``Main Menu'' screen with a  
continuously updated news ticker featuring headlines from The 
Associated Press, market analysis from CBSMarketWatch.com and 
personalized news folders -- more sophisticated offerings than AOL 
members get. 
</P>
<P>
	But other features will become more like AOL's.  
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe's e-mail will be modeled after the easier-to-use  
version that helped AOL become the world's leading online service 
with more than 16 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	And subscribers will be given simpler user names, and the domain  
name will be shortened from ``compuserve.com'' to ``cs.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a new pricing plan, members would pay just $9.95 a month  
for 20 hours of online access, with each additional hour billed at 
less than 5 cents a minute. The offer will last for several months, 
depending on how many people sign up. CompuServe has been charging 
existing members $9.95 a month for five hours of use, with each 
extra hour costing $2.95. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, CompuServe is cutting the cost of unlimited access  
from $24.95 to $19.95 a month. But CompuServe officials downplayed 
this offer, saying that 80 percent of their online users choose 
limited access. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL hopes to charge advertisers a premium for targeting upscale  
CompuServe users, who may have more money to spend on a new 
computer or other big-ticket items than AOL users who may explore 
chat rooms for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go down and sit down to talk to advertisers about  
CompuServe, they really see it as a dream audience,'' CompuServe 
chief operating officer Audrey Weil said. But, she added, 
CompuServe will offer discounts to advertisers to try to get them 
to try marketing through CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has enjoyed some success with its strategy of snapping up  
companies with distinct identities and keeping their images 
distinct. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, AOL bought the ICQ Web site and its instant messaging  
software, which alerts users when their friends are on the Web and 
lets them chat and send files directly to other users' computer 
desktops. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns that ICQ users, the technology-elite, would  
flee AOL, ICQ last month said membership nearly doubled since the 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL says it will employ the same strategy when it completes its  
acquisition of Netscape Communications, the pioneer of Internet 
browser software. Netscape will keep its headquarters in Mountain 
View, Calif. and maintain a separate workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe, too, retains it original headquarters in Columbus,  
Ohio, and much of its staff. Whether AOL succeeds in reviving it 
will be another key test of an AOL strategy that resembles cable 
television, with each channel targeting a different audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as Weil said, ``Think of AOL like the USA Today newspaper.  
CompuServe is a little bit like the New York Times. It's a more 
serious newspaper.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Military Pay Raises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate pressed ahead Monday with  
politically popular legislation that would give the military a 4.8 
percent across-the-board pay raise next Jan. 1, despite a plea from 
the Clinton administration that Congress first find the money to 
pay for the increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is the first major piece of legislation considered by  
the Senate this year, and GOP leaders said they wanted to send an 
important message to men and women in the Armed Services -- 
particularly in light of a possible new military deployment in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed a 4.4 percent military pay raise.  
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to senators as debate began on the Senate floor,  
Defense Secretary William Cohen said he was concerned that the 
legislation, while well-meaning, could end up ``raising hopes that 
cannot be fulfilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be counterproductive,'' Cohen wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	If enacted, the pay raise would be the largest for the military  
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also provide more generous retirement and  
GI Bill educational benefits. The administration claims the measure 
is $7 billion more expensive over the next five years than the 
$36.5 billion benefit increase package proposed by Clinton in his 
fiscal year 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen cautioned that, with no clear indication of where the  
extra money might come from, meeting the ``unfunded requirement'' 
could mean cuts in other essential military programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee, described the defense secretary's concerns as 
``constructive criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, we're going to forge ahead,'' Warner said.  
``Even if this bill is expensive, the alternative is 
unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation appeared to have wide support in both parties  
and was expected to win Senate approval later this week. However, 
several Democrats echoed the administration's concerns over the 
pricetag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little consideration seems to have been given to how we will  
pay for this. There could be serious consequences,'' said Sen. Carl 
Levin of Michigan, the committee's senior Democrat. He said the 
measure could become ``a promise to the troops that may or may not 
be possible to redeem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., a sponsor of the bill, told the Senate  
that while he was glad the it had taken up the bill, ``My concern 
is that we may be moving too quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has predicted the  
Senate would pass the ``long overdue'' pay raise within a few 
weeks. His spokesman, John Czwartacki, said the possibility that 
U.S. troops would soon be on their way to Kosovo provided even more 
impetus for fast passage of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was deliberately made first on the Senate calendar  
after the impeachment trial of Clinton, Czwartacki said. ``We're 
back in the mode where senators can be senators,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's plan calls for a 4.4 percent  
across-the-board military pay raise in 2000 and annual raises of 
3.9 percent over the following five years. The Senate bill gives a 
4.8 percent increase starting Jan. 1, then would give the military 
an additional raise in each succeeding year of 0.5 percentage 
points above the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also allow military personnel to retire at 50  
percent pay after 20 years service -- a plan that was in effect 
prior to 1986. Or, they could accept a $30,000 cash bonus and 
remain in the current retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also give service members the option of  
contributing up to 5 percent of their basic pay to a 401(k) type 
savings account, to which the services could, under certain 
circumstances, make matching contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon contends that military personnel are paid as much  
as 13.5 percent less than civilian personnel with comparable jobs 
in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the independent Center for Strategic and Budgetary  
Assessments, in a report on the measure, suggested this claim was 
somewhat misleading. ``One problem is the overall private-sector 
workforce differs greatly from the military's workforce in terms of 
education, age, sex and other factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It cited a 1994 RAND study based on the 1992 workforce that  
``found that when compared to changes in pay for a subset of the 
civilian workforce that closely resembles the military ... there 
essentially no pay gap, at least in 1992.''

<HEADLINE> Green Bay Signs Raleigh McKenzie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Fourteen-year veteran Raleigh McKenzie  
has agreed to a deal with the Green Bay Packers, who lost right 
guard Adam Timmerman to the St. Louis Rams last week. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie, the 36-year-old twin brother of Reggie McKenzie, the  
Packers' director of pro personnel, will reunite with Green Bay 
coach Ray Rhodes, for whom he played in Philadelphia in 1995 and 
'96. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms weren't disclosed, but the four-year deal is reportedly  
worth about $6 million and includes a $1.8 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie, 6-foot-2 and 283 pounds, has played all five offensive  
line positions in his NFL career, including right tackle for San 
Diego last season. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie, who won Super Bowl rings with Washington in 1987 and  
'91, will carry a 126-game starting streak into the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers also said Monday they had signed quarterback Matt  
Hasselbeck to a multi-year contract and free agent receiver Tyrone 
Goodson, who was waived by St. Louis last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers released linebacker Anthony Hicks, a fifth-round  
draft selection out of Arkansas in 1998 who spent the past two 
seasons on injured reserve.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux To Meet With Marino Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Former Pittsburgh Penguins star Mario Lemieux,  
who is working on a proposal to take over the bankrupt franchise, 
will meet Tuesday with team co-owner Roger Marino's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The session is not expected to cover the competing bids by  
Lemieux and Marino to reorganize the team's finances, but rather 
the $26.2 million in deferred compensation owed Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is chairman of the committee representing the team's  
unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino also plans to submit a reorganization plan to U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court, even though he has lost nearly $40 million 
operating the club the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Baldwin, the Penguins' primary owner from 1991-97 and  
still a co-owner, also seeking to reorganize the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry L. Manion III, Marino's lawyer, originally planned to hold  
a joint meeting of the team's creditors but decided to change that 
to individual meetings. Marino, who has feuded publicly with 
Lemieux, will not attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Any concessions that Manion can derive from the meetings would  
be part of the reorganization plan he will submit to U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court Judge Bernard Markovitz next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who is trying to raise at least $40 million from  
investors, also expects to submit his plan next month. He is 
willing to exchange some of the millions he is owed for equity in 
the team.

<HEADLINE> Duke Tops Men's Basketball Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Texas was in chaos less than a year ago. The  
season had a dismal ending with two players leaving for other 
schools, the head coach resigning and a record that set the 
Longhorns near the bottom of the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
	This season was not expected to be much better, but new coach  
Rick Barnes has turned Texas around. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being one win away from clinching the top seed in  
the conference tournament, the Longhorns (17-10, 12-2) have moved 
into the AP college basketball rankings for the first time this 
season at No. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't gawk about it. It was the farthest thing from our  
mind,'' Barnes said Monday after practice. ``But I'm happy for our 
players. I think they worked hard for it, but all we're concerned 
about right now is finding a way to keep winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a slow start, Texas has won eight of its last nine games  
and holds a two-game lead over Big 12 rivals Oklahoma and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the poll is Duke, winner of 22 straight games and  
one victory shy of Atlantic Coast Conference history. The Blue 
Devils (27-1) were first on 70 ballots and received 1,774 points 
from the media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory Saturday night at North Carolina would give Duke,  
which beat Florida State by 26 points and Clemson by 27 last week, 
the first 16-0 regular season in the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (25-1), which beat Vanderbilt in its only game last week,  
moved up one place to No. 2 with 1,685 points. The ranking matches 
the highest in school history, a one-week stay at No. 2 in February 
1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (25-4), which won the Big Ten regular-season  
title Sunday with a 56-51 victory over Wisconsin, also moved up one 
place and received the other No. 1 vote and 1,617 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (23-2), which lost to Miami 73-71 on Saturday,  
dropped from second to fourth, the first time this season the 
Huskies haven't been ranked either No. 1 or 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland held No. 5 and was followed by Stanford, Arizona, St.  
John's, Cincinnati and Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Second Ten was Miami, Utah, Kentucky, North Carolina, UCLA,  
Wisconsin, College of Charleston, Iowa, Florida and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five teams in the Top 25 were New Mexico, Texas,  
Purdue, Syracuse and Temple, with the last two tied for 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple (18-8) was No. 7 in the preseason poll, but fell out of  
the rankings four weeks into regular season after losing four 
straight games. The Owls returned to the rankings after winning 
five of six. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri (18-7) and Miami of Ohio (19-6) both lost two games  
last week to fall out of the poll after returning for one week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky, which beat Georgia and lost to Arkansas, had the  
week's biggest drop falling from No. 6 to 13th and out of the Top 
Ten for the first time this season. Purdue, which was the third 
ranked team to lose two games last week, fell from 17th to No. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The week's biggest jumps were the moves of Miami from 15th to  
No. 11 and Florida from 23rd to No. 19, the highest rankings for 
both this season.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Cracking Down on Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball is promising to crack down on differing  
interpretations of the strike zone, telling teams the official 
definition ``will be more strictly enforced'' by umpires this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was immediately attacked as ``deplorable'' by the head  
of the umpires' union. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the first moves of the restructured commissioner's  
office under Bud Selig -- and one that could provoke anger among 
umpires -- the decision was made by Sandy Alderson, the new 
executive director of baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The move appears designed to get umpires to call ``high  
strikes.'' In recent years, umpires rarely called any pitch above 
the belt a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how anyone could say we're going to more strictly  
enforce a rule,'' umpires' union head Richie Phillips said. ``The 
umpires enforce all of the rules. That's been their job for more 
than 100 years. It is deplorable for the commissioner's office to 
indicate that the umpires have not strictly enforced all of the 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a rarity, the players' association backed owners.  
</P>
<P>
	``There never has been a good reason for why players should have  
to adjust to 32 different strike zones, so some effort to make the 
strike zone more uniform is to be welcomed,'' said Gene Orza, the 
No. 2 official of the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the memo, which was sent to teams Friday, was  
first reported Monday by the Los Angeles Times, and a copy of the 
memo was obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is to inform you that, at the direction of commissioner  
Selig, and after consultation with the league presidents, the 
`strike zone' as defined in the official playing rules will be more 
strictly enforced in 1999 by umpires in both leagues,'' Alderson 
wrote to teams. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the rules, the strike zone goes from ``a horizontal  
line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top 
of the uniform pants'' to ``a line at the hollow beneath the 
kneecap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the memo, which was sent to all managers and general  
managers, Alderson said that while the top of the strike zone is 
difficult to define, ``the upper limit of the strike zone will 
extend two inches above the top of the uniform pants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of the differing strike zones escalated after the 1997  
NL playoffs, when a wide strike zone by Eric Gregg led to a 
15-strikeout game by Florida's Livan Hernandez. AL umpires were 
criticized for several blown calls during last year's playoffs, one 
of the reasons Selig is trying to shift responsibility over umpires 
away from the leagues to Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strike zone is the strike zone,'' Phillips said. ``Is  
there a different strike zone in the American League and National 
League? Definitely not. Some of them may see it different, but the 
strike zone is the strike zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires' labor agreement expires after this season, and a  
confrontation between owners and umpires is expected. Umpires have 
been demanding more backing since 1996, when Roberto Alomar, then 
of the Baltimore Orioles, spit at umpire John Hirschbeck and was 
suspended for only five games. Alomar didn't service the penalty 
during the playoffs, rather at the start of the following season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, umpires have demanded owners and players agree to a  
``code of conduct.'' While there were several meetings two years 
ago, agreement on a code has still proved elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson's memo may heighten the tension.  
</P>
<P>
	``Neither the umpires or the umpires' association were consulted  
on this issue,'' Phillips said. ``But I'm not surprised by what 
goes on in the baseball offices at Park Avenue.''

<HEADLINE> FOX, CBS Seek Free TV Antennas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Broadcasters urged the satellite industry  
Monday to give some satellite customers free TV antennas so they 
can continue to watch Fox and CBS programs. 
</P>
<P>
	As it stands, 700,000 to 1 million satellite TV customers  
nationwide will no longer be permitted to receive Fox and CBS 
programs via their satellite systems on Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Broadcasters asked the satellite  
industry to provide those customers -- along with others who are 
slated to lose CBS and Fox programs on April 30 -- free rooftop TV 
antennas so customers can try to receive these broadcast signals 
over the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our member companies are looking at offering free-of-  
charge antennas, but the problem is, you can't do millions at 
once'' because it would be an administrative headache, said Chuck 
Hewitts, president of the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite TV customers, meanwhile, can contact their local CBS  
or Fox affiliate to try to obtain a waiver so that they can 
continue to receive CBS and Fox shows on their satellite systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The waivers permit satellite systems to beam the signal of a Fox  
or CBS affiliate from a distant market into the satellite viewer's 
local market only if the local station determines that the viewer 
can't receive the local signal on a rooftop antenna. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAB didn't know how many satellite viewers have either  
requested or received such waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hewitt contends that ``tens of thousands'' of customers are  
going to be cut off even though they can't receive local Fox and 
CBS signals from rooftop antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of CBS and Fox, Judge Lenore Nesbitt of the U.S.  
Southern District Court of Florida issued a preliminary injunction 
last year to disconnect satellite customers nationwide from CBS and 
Fox signals by Feb. 28. That order covers customers who signed up 
for the service between March 11, 1997, and July 10, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Another injunction, by the same court, will cut off 1.5 million  
more customers from CBS and Fox signals by April 30. The injunction 
covers customers who signed up for the service before March 11, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Both injunctions are against PrimeTime 24, a leading distributor  
of programming to major satellite providers such as DirecTV and 
EchoStar, for violating copyright law. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the court said PrimeTime 24 was illegally  
distributing distant Fox and CBS signals to satellite customers who 
can receive local CBS and Fox stations from rooftop antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress hopes to pass legislation this year that would make it  
easier for satellite customers to legally obtain network programs 
on their satellite systems.

<HEADLINE> Saberhagen Predicts Healthy Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- A year ago, Bret Saberhagen went to  
spring training with a repaired shoulder and an uncertain future. 
Now he's back with a 15-win season and a contract that could keep 
him with the Boston Red Sox for four more years. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not surprising for someone who was so good that he won  
the first of his two Cy Young awards when he was just 21. It's 
shocking for someone who had major surgery at 32 and missed most of 
the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God that I got a second chance,'' Saberhagen says.  
``It's kind of like a dream come true again. I appreciate the game 
a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had surgery on his right shoulder on May 28, 1996, while with  
Colorado, missed that entire season and didn't pitch in the majors 
again until Aug. 22, 1997, when he made his first start since Oct. 
1, 1995. He was 0-1 with a 6.58 ERA in six starts for Boston in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	When spring training began the following season, the Red Sox  
were very careful about bringing Saberhagen along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had hopes to be in the rotation for my first start of the  
year,'' he said, ``but it took a lot of work to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen made it, beating Seattle and Randy Johnson 10-5 in  
the fifth game of the season. He allowed two runs on four hits in 
five innings. He went on to win five of his first six starts but 
was taken out after six innings in each of the other four wins to 
make sure his arm wasn't being overworked. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times it was frustrating, but it was just a matter of,  
after the game, sitting down and saying, `hey, we're not in this 
thing for one game,' '' Saberhagen said. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he's in it for a reborn career.  
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen ended up with a 15-8 record and 3.96 ERA in 31 starts  
and never missed his turn in the rotation. He pitched 175 innings, 
felt strong at the end of the season and wants to work at least 200 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's miles past where he was at this point last year,''  
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``He's stronger. His arm has a 
little more resiliency. We figure we can get another 10 or 12 
pitches out of him a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Pedro Martinez, Tim Wakefield and Saberhagen forming a  
solid starting corps, the Red Sox added veterans Mark Portugal and 
Pat Rapp to a rotation that's much more settled than last year's. 
Portugal was 10-5 with Philadelphia, which finished eight games 
under .500, and Rapp was 12-13 with Kansas City, which was 17 under 
.500. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were on our team, they'd have won a lot more last  
year,'' Saberhagen said. ``So we're going to be in a lot more 
ballgames'' this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen should be better prepared for the start of the  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been throwing down here for about a week now and been  
able to throw off the mound and come back and throw long toss the 
next day and feel very good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, manager Jimy Williams wants to make sure he doesn't get  
carried away by Saberhagen's success and use him too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get too glad happy about how well he did,'' Williams  
said. ``When you think about what the man has been through, you 
don't want to try to push the envelope too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox apparently are convinced that Saberhagen's arm has  
recovered fully. They signed him last season to a contract for 
three years and an option for a fourth, when he'll be 38 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	That, he figures, will be enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to win 200 games. I have 156 right now so I should be  
able to do that if I stay healthy,'' Saberhagen said. And he'd love 
to cap a career that was in jeopardy a couple of years ago with the 
Red Sox first championship since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning in Boston would be something else,'' he said. ``I  
don't think you can compare it to anything because the city has 
waited so long for a championship. I'd love to be part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a possibility again now that his shoulder is healthy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching was always something that just pretty much came  
natural to me,'' Saberhagen said, ``but after it's taken away and 
you've got to work to get back there you realize how tough it is 
and how fortunate you are.''

<HEADLINE>  Rodman Plans To Sign With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- There were tears. There was talk of  
sex. There were obscenities. There was flamboyant fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	All the commotion came as Dennis Rodman held a news conference  
Monday and said he was moving closer to playing for the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the seven-time defending rebounding champion, said he  
expects to be in uniform Thursday or Friday. ESPN said he would 
practice Wednesday -- even though the team will be coming off three 
road games in three nights -- and make his debut Friday against the 
Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest chapter of ``As The Worm Turns,'' along with the  
Lakers' subsequent 117-113 loss at Denver, made for another 
turbulent day. But that's nothing new to the Lakers, who three 
weeks ago made it clear they wanted to sign the 37-year-old 
tattooed forward, a member of five championship teams, including 
the last three with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed conservatively -- for him -- except for a wide,  
multicolored hat and dark glasses, Rodman arrived 30 minutes late 
for his news conference. He was accompanied by his wife, actress 
Carmen Electra, agent Steve Chasman and sister Debra. But nobody 
was there from the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came a series of bizarre and conflicting statements. And  
the news conference ended abruptly after some 20 minutes with a 
tearful Rodman being asked if he had been selfish by not announcing 
a decision earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman began by saying he wanted to sign with the Lakers, but  
matters were incomplete. When angrily questioned why he called the 
news conference if he had no announcement to make, Rodman snapped: 
``You don't have to be here.'' Shortly thereafter he said he hoped 
to sign Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I'll be playing this week, and, hopefully, the  
Lakers and the people of California will accept me for who I am and 
what I do,'' he said. ``If not, I'll move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said he had spoken with Lakers owner Jerry Buss several  
times and hoped to sign a two- or three-year deal with the team. He 
insists he is in good shape and could immediately play 30 to 35 
minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would be reliable, pointing out he played 80 of  
a possible 82 regular-season games for the Bulls last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can count on me, you can count on me going to practice,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said the Lakers weren't a championship team now and must  
change their approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the guys want to be superstars,'' he said. ``Everybody has  
to play a role. This team doesn't understand that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he wasn't returning because of money.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy at all,'' he said, referring to the fact that  
the Lakers could offer him only a $1 million veterans' minimum, 
which would be prorated to under $500,000 because of the shortened 
season and the games he has missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will make me happy is if I can bring this city a ring  
just like I did in Chicago,'' he said. ``I'm here just because I 
want to make people happy. I miss entertaining. I miss entertaining 
for the people. I play for the people, I give the people what they 
want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It had been reported Rodman would receive an extra $3 million as  
part of his contract with Converse if he played in New York, 
Chicago or Los Angeles this season. But he said he was going to 
have to ``fight them in court to get that money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the news conference resembled an episode of ``The  
Jerry Springer Show'' -- although there was no fighting, Rodman used 
four-letter words and made sexual references about his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, when asked about being selfish, Rodman started crying  
and said, ``I'm never going to win, no matter what I do for this 
league, for the game of basketball, I'm never going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, opening a piece of paper, he said, ``I've got 10 charities  
here that I'm going to give $10,000 to. Even with this here, I'm 
still not going to win. You tell me if that's selfish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sister interjected, ``He doesn't have any money.''  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman then waved off reporters and left the microphone.  
</P>
<P>
	Lakers great Magic Johnson, a part-owner and vice president of  
the team, expressed relief that Rodman had made a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was tired of it dragging on because it was doing nothing but  
being a distraction for our players, the coach, as well as our 
franchise,'' Johnson said Monday in Indianapolis. ``We were just 
hoping this day would finally come, either tell us you're coming or 
tell us you're not coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy it's all over with. We know he's coming. Now  
coach (Del) Harris can get him in there, get him learning the plays 
in the system, try to get him in shape as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had criticized Rodman on David Letterman's show Thursday  
night, saying he was causing a distraction and he hoped the Lakers 
would ``just forget it.''

<HEADLINE> Wonder, Xenakis Get Music Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Stevie Wonder and Iannis Xenakis won  
this year's Polar Music Prize, given by the Royal Swedish Academy 
of Music. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize, announced Monday, is endowed by the late Stikkan  
Andersson, whose record company released the songs of ABBA. It is 
awarded to one popular and one classical musician. Each recipient 
gets $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenakis, a Romanian-born Greek who lives in Paris, is regarded  
as one of contemporary music's most innovative and erudite 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
	He once composed an electronic work whose sole sound source was  
amplified burning charcoal. He has also used sounds derived from 
jangling jewelry and coupling freight cars.

<HEADLINE> Catchy Names Help Pass Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It wouldn't be easy to vote against the  
Taxpayer Relief Act. And what about the Stop Sweatshops Act or the 
Drug Free Century Act? 
</P>
<P>
	With 535 senators and representatives vying for attention in  
Washington, lawmakers are increasingly finding that getting their 
legislation passed starts with coming up with a good name -- even if 
it sometimes is somewhat misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 5,000 bills introduced each year and they won't go  
anywhere if the titles are too arcane or too bureaucratic,'' said 
Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., who is sponsoring a bill informally 
named the Honest Balanced Budget Act of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Stearns' bill would separate the Social Security Trust Fund and  
the general budget, a move that could change the whole concept of 
budget surpluses. ``The question is how you penetrate this murky 
situation and get members to think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other names informally attached to bills introduced in the  
first weeks of this congressional session are the Education Bill of 
Rights (which promotes more local control of education money), the 
Mass Immigration Reduction Act (which imposes a moratorium on 
immigration) and the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act (which targets 
games of chance sent through the mail). 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, said Senate Historian Donald Ritchie, major bills  
tended to be named after committee chairmen who wielded far more 
power than they do today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930 will always represent the failed  
Depression-era policy of high tariffs, and organized labor will 
always think of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act as the epitome of 
anti-union measures. When he vetoed it, President Truman called it 
the ``Slave Labor Act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Keogh, a New York representative from the 1930s through  
the 1960s, has his name on a retirement plan, and more recently 
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., has become famous for his Roth IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., known for  
his role in the impeachment of President Clinton, may leave an 
equally lasting impression with his Hyde Amendment, an annual 
addition to spending bills that curtails federal abortion funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has also borrowed the names of others to promote  
legislation. There's the Brady Act, the gun-control measure named 
for Jim Brady, the press secretary wounded in the assassination 
attempt on President Reagan; the Ryan White Act funding AIDS 
research and named after an Indiana boy who died of AIDS; and 
Megan's Law, named in memory of a New Jersey girl killed by a child 
molester that mandates public information about convicted 
molesters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie said the trend toward more clever monikers began in the  
1960s, when the democratization of Congress gave junior members a 
chance to move their bills forward if they had the right political 
savvy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans, after their takeover in 1995, put special  
effort into names in their ``Contract With America'' agenda, coming 
up with the Common Sense Legal Reforms Act for a controversial bill 
limiting lawsuits on faulty products and a prison-building bill 
called the Taking Back Our Streets Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to make it sound like it's a motherhood-and-apple-pie  
issue,'' Ritchie said. ``That overlooks the fact that often there's 
more than one way to look at something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behind some of the high-minded sentiments in some of the names  
lie controversial proposals. The Taxpayer Relief Act would reduce 
individual income tax rates by 10 percent, a Republican plan that 
is adamantly opposed by the White House and most Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, conservative Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has  
introduced such bills as the Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act, an 
anti-abortion bill, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which 
restricts affirmative action programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, Congress spent a lot of time on the Defense  
of Marriage Act, which was aimed at denying federal benefits to 
same-sex couples. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said at the time she thought from  
the name that the bill was going to deal with some of the stresses 
that most married people face. ``I was looking forward to seeing 
this legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Then when I see it, it turns out to be something completely  
different,'' she said. ``It certainly is not about defending 
marriage.''

<HEADLINE> Short-Term Treasuries Mixed / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities were mixed in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.51 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.530 percent, up from 4.440 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.430 percent, down from 4.470 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Sept. 21, when the  
bills sold for 4.635 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest 
since Feb. 8, when the rate was 4.420. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.646 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,885.50 and 4.595 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,776.00. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.71 
percent last week from 4.67 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Court Lets Iowa Farm Case Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling it  
was told casts doubt on all 50 states' efforts to protect farmers 
from being sued by their neighbors under public-nuisance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, refused to review a decision by  
Iowa's highest court that struck down the state's ``right to farm'' 
law, similar to laws enacted in every other state. 
</P>
<P>
	A large, interstate coalition of farmer groups told the court  
that the Iowa Supreme Court decision, if allowed to stand, will 
deprive more than 100,000 Iowa farms of the legal assurance that 
they won't be sued ``because they look and sound and smell like 
farms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition also told the justices that the Iowa court's  
reasoning, if adopted elsewhere, would wipe out any state's ``right 
to farm'' law. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1970s and early 1980s, states passed those laws in  
response to pressures from suburban sprawl. The laws are aimed at 
protecting farms by offering them a qualified defense to nuisance 
lawsuits by neighbors who object to the normal incidents of farming 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa law, enacted in 1982, is typical in that it protects  
farmers against nuisance lawsuits as long as the basis of 
neighbors' complaints are not tied violations of federal or state 
laws, negligent operation of the farm, water pollution or excessive 
soil erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	People who own about 1,000 acres of land in Kossuth County,  
Iowa, had their land designated as an agricultural area under the 
state's ``right to farm'' law in 1995, but the designation was 
quickly challenged by owners of neighboring land. 
</P>
<P>
	The neighbors sued the Kossuth County Board of Supervisors,  
contending that its action amounted to an unconstitutional 
``taking'' of property without just compensation because the 
farmland had been given ``nuisance immunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit attacked the state ``right to farm'' law even though  
no allegations of a nuisance were raised. 
</P>
<P>
	A state trial judge threw out the lawsuit, but the Iowa Supreme  
Court last September reinstated it and struck down the ``right to 
farm'' law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenged statutory scheme amounts to a commandeering of  
valuable property rights without compensating the owners, and 
sacrificing those rights for the economic advantage of a few,'' the 
state court ruled. ``In short, it appropriates valuable private 
property interests and awards them to strangers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the farmland owners  
argued that the Iowa court's ruling conflicts with the nation's 
highest court's previous rulings on governmental actions that have 
an impact on private property. 
</P>
<P>
	Those decisions generally have said an unlawful, ``taking'' of  
private property without compensation occurs only if land is 
physically invaded or its owner is deprived of all economic use of 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said the Iowa court's ruling threatens ``the  
unanimous judgment of the states that farming is worth preserving 
and protecting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Girres vs. Bormann, 98-1003.

<HEADLINE> Airport Lacks Airlines, Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASCOUTAH, Ill. (AP) -- It has all the trappings of a major  
airport -- baggage carousels, ticket counters and televisions 
broadcasting CNN headlines over and over. 
</P>
<P>
	What's missing are airlines -- and passengers.  
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a year after opening, the $330 million taxpayer-funded  
MidAmerica Airport is used only by planes flying into the Air Force 
base that shares its runways. 
</P>
<P>
	The airport's boosters had predicted that it would be bustling  
with commercial airline service by now, and handle 1.1 million 
passengers next year. But the airlines cited by airport officials 
as their best prospects -- American, Delta and Southwest -- say they 
have no plans to fly here. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what tomorrow's going to bring, so you don't  
want to burn any bridges, but right now it's just the best business 
decision,'' said Delta spokeswoman Betty Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which leaves local officials to insist that they haven't  
make a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've not had a nervous moment, one second of lost sleep or one  
iota of misconception about building this airport,'' said St. Clair 
County Board Chairman John Baricevic. ``It was absolutely the right 
thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airport has its beginnings in 1990 when planners considered  
the possibility of relocating Lambert-St. Louis International 
Airport to the Illinois side of the Mississippi River. Lambert, 
home to Trans World Airlines and one of the nation's busiest 
airports, is largely hemmed in by development north of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Politics scuttled that plan, but Illinois officials soon  
concluded that joint civilian-military use of Scott Air Force Base 
would help to make St. Louis' often-overlooked Illinois suburbs a 
player in the regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after St. Clair County adopted the project,  
construction began with officials confidently predicting that 
service could start as soon as 1996. After a series of delays, the 
airport officially opened its runway in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the airport indeed brought plenty of money into  
the region -- all but $30 million of MidAmerica's cost was borne by 
the federal and state governments, with the county chipping in the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	County officials can boast that MidAmerica has lured more  
government spending -- in the form of an Illinois Air National Guard 
unit that is moving from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, 
bringing 300 full-time and 1,000 part-time jobs and $100 million in 
construction spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to attracting commercial airlines and any  
private-sector spending and jobs that go with them, experts say 
MidAmerica faces an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, carriers are short of aircraft. They have more  
opportunity to make money with airplanes than they have the ability 
to go out and develop new markets,'' said independent airline 
analyst Robert Mann. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines know customers want the convenience of frequent flights  
and a wide range of destinations -- something they can't afford to 
do by spreading operations across two airports, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	County officials have said they expected to lose money on the  
airport for at least five years. It will take that long for 
airlines to gear up for service at the new field, airport director 
Rick Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some suspect it will be much longer.  
</P>
<P>
	Joe Behnken, a St. Clair County councilman who has been highly  
critical of the county's efforts to lure an airline to MidAmerica, 
says the Public Building Commission, which oversees the airport, is 
incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those folks know nothing about the management and running of  
any business, much less an airport,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baricevic dismissed Behnken's criticisms as political. Behnken  
is a Republican; Baricevic is his Democratic rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new airports have found ways to succeed. When Northwest  
Arkansas Regional Airport in Bentonville, Ark., opened in November 
at a cost of $109 million, airlines had already signed up. 
</P>
<P>
	But that airport had the backing of three influential  
corporations -- Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt Transportation -- 
which pledged their business to airlines using the field, said 
spokesman Scott Van Laningham. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no businesses have made such a pledge to MidAmerica.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the airport stays open at least 12 hours a day,  
staffed by 27 workers -- including a full fire crew and maintenance 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	And -- to the further aggravation of critics -- MidAmerica is  
already spending money on upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the county approved requesting $2.5 million for  
improvements that include higher runway lights and a fence to keep 
deer away.

<HEADLINE>  Gardner May Start for Giants Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Last season, spring training was a time  
of concern and doubt for Mark Gardner. His wife had just undergone 
a liver transplant, and he felt uneasy about being so far away as 
she healed. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Lori Gardner is doing fine and her husband is the  
most likely candidate to be the San Francisco Giants' opening day 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the season opener were tomorrow, it would be Gardy  
probably,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``Over the course of 
his career, he's earned it. He's the veteran of the staff. Why not 
Mark?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner was signed as a free agent by the Giants days before the  
start of the 1996 season, when the Florida Marlins decided to send 
Gardner to the minors but gave him a chance to work out a deal with 
another club. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 12-7 for San Francisco that season, earning the opening  
day spot the following year. Gardner was 8-2 through mid-June and 
the Giants won the NL West in 1997, but the end of the season was 
torture for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori was ailing, and was shortly thereafter to be diagnosed with  
liver cancer. Mark was winless in his last six starts and did not 
pitch again after Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori, a former softball player who met Mark at Fresno State, had  
a successful transplant in the middle of last February. Mark showed 
up late for spring training, and wondered whether he was doing the 
right thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough at the beginning. The thing that was bothering me  
last year was thinking, `Should I be here or should I be there?''' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori insisted that Mark rejoin the team as soon as possible, and  
he opened the season as the No. 4 starter in the Giants' rotation. 
By the end of the season, Gardner was the team's best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner went 5-1 with a 2.97 ERA in August and September as the  
Giants forced a one-game playoff with the Chicago Cubs for the 
wild-card spot. He started that game, and was the loser in a 5-3 
defeat at Wrigley Field.

<HEADLINE>  Gardner May Start for Giants Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Last season, spring training was a time  
of concern and doubt for Mark Gardner. His wife had just undergone 
a liver transplant, and he felt uneasy about being so far away as 
she healed. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Lori Gardner is doing fine and her husband is the  
most likely candidate to be the San Francisco Giants' opening day 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the season opener were tomorrow, it would be Gardy  
probably,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``Over the course of 
his career, he's earned it. He's the veteran of the staff. Why not 
Mark?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner was signed as a free agent by the Giants days before the  
start of the 1996 season, when the Florida Marlins decided to send 
Gardner to the minors but gave him a chance to work out a deal with 
another club. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 12-7 for San Francisco that season, earning the opening  
day spot the following year. Gardner was 8-2 through mid-June and 
the Giants won the NL West in 1997, but the end of the season was 
torture for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori was ailing, and was shortly thereafter to be diagnosed with  
liver cancer. Mark was winless in his last six starts and did not 
pitch again after Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori, a former softball player who met Mark at Fresno State, had  
a successful transplant in the middle of last February. Mark showed 
up late for spring training, and wondered whether he was doing the 
right thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough at the beginning. The thing that was bothering me  
last year was thinking, `Should I be here or should I be there?''' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori insisted that Mark rejoin the team as soon as possible, and  
he opened the season as the No. 4 starter in the Giants' rotation. 
By the end of the season, Gardner was the team's best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner went 5-1 with a 2.97 ERA in August and September as the  
Giants forced a one-game playoff with the Chicago Cubs for the 
wild-card spot. He started that game, and was the loser in a 5-3 
defeat at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 13-6 in 1998, becoming one of only a dozen major  
leaguers that have won at least 12 games and had an ERA of lower 
than 4.50 in each of the last three seasons. He set career highs 
for wins, innings (212) and strikeouts (151). 
</P>
<P>
	And he earned the right to probably get another opening day  
start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's just more of an honor for what you've done the  
year before,'' Gardner said. ``I might be the guy that might give 
you a little solidification. I'm not an ace, I'm just going to be 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner signed a two-year contract with the Giants before this  
season, and came to training camp with a lot fewer distractions 
than last year.

<HEADLINE> Rabbis Create United Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis in  
the United States and Canada have formed the first religious 
organization to encompass all branches of Judaism since the 
Synagogue Council of America fell apart five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Orthodox involvement is especially significant because in recent  
years the most traditional branch of Judaism has generally backed 
away from cooperation with more liberal Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	The other pan-Jewish organizations in North America deal with  
secular and communal matters rather than religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The new North American Boards of Rabbis is a federation of local  
rabbinical boards, which usually include Orthodox rabbis. The 
Synagogue Council was a loose coalition of rabbinical and synagogue 
associations that disbanded because of apathy and separatist trends 
among the Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all Orthodox rabbis will be involved in NABOR; some  
hard-line Orthodox are not part of the rabbinical boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting in Washington on Monday, leaders of rabbinical groups in  
25 major cities chose an Orthodox rabbi, Marc Schneier, as the 
group's first president. He leads a congregation in Westhampton 
Beach, N.Y., and is president of the metropolitan New York Board of 
Rabbis, the largest such local body with 800 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest danger to the Jewish people no longer comes from  
outside but from within,'' Schneier said. ``And the most divisive 
issue in the community is the confrontation among the religious 
branches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NABOR's founders said the organization will allow rabbis to  
address issues that transcend theological and ideological 
differences and provide a ``voice of rabbinic unity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its first project next month, NABOR will send a delegation to  
the Czech Republic just before Passover to promote religious unity 
across denominational lines. NABOR also plans to publish a 
newsletter, survey interdenominational activities, and represent 
Jewish religious views to other religions. 
</P>
<P>
	Philanthropists S. Daniel Abraham, Charles Bronfman and Michael  
Steinhardt have pledged $100,000 toward a budget of $400,000 for 
the first two years of operation.

<HEADLINE> N.Y.C. Seizes Cars in DWI Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A city crackdown on drunken drivers began with  
the seizure of at least two cars. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is the first municipality in the nation to seize the  
vehicles of motorists arrested on drunken driving charges as a way 
to reduce the number of deaths on roadways. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists with a blood alcohol level of 0.10 percent -- the  
state's legal limit for driving -- or higher will have their 
vehicles seized on the spot. While the motorist faces prosecution 
in criminal court, the vehicle seizure will be part of a separate 
proceeding in civil court under state forfeiture laws. 
</P>
<P>
	And because civil proceedings require only a preponderance of  
evidence for a verdict -- rather than guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt -- motorists acquitted of drunken driving in criminal court 
may still lose their cars in civil court. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil libertarians have attacked the new policy as excessive and  
vowed to challenge it in court. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he is 
confident the plan will hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	One car was seized Sunday and one today. Officer Theresa  
Farello, a police department spokeswoman, could not immediately 
explain why a car was seized Sunday evening, 1 1/2 hours before the 
program was to start at midnight.

<HEADLINE> Va. Man Finishes Old Jail Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A man who fled a jail work crew in 1974  
while serving time for selling $10 worth of marijuana was released 
Monday after serving 2 1/2 months on his original sentence and an 
escape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The state granted Alfred Odell Martin III parole two weeks after  
he persuaded a judge to give him a break for turning his life 
around while living in virtual exile in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, the moment came when I was smelling the fresh air and  
looking at the blue sky, and it was overwhelming,'' Martin, who had 
lived as a businessman in suburban Detroit, said after he left 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was caught selling marijuana to a department store  
co-worker and was less than two days into his one-year sentence 
when he left a Martinsville jail work crew on Feb. 13, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia first sought his extradition in 1974, but then-Gov.  
William Milliken of Michigan effectively granted Martin legal 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	He was caught driving with expired license plates in Michigan  
last November, and Virginia pressed for -- and later won -- his 
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Michigan judge who handled Martin's fight to avoid being  
returned to Virginia praised Martin for living an ``exemplary 
life.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Monday, with prices rising in Tokyo and Taipei but falling in Hong 
Kong and Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 158.63  
points, or 1.13 percent, to close at 14,256.67. On Friday, the 
average fell 48.75 points, or 0.34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares rose as the Japanese yen's retreat against the dollar  
prompted investors to buy export-oriented electronics and auto 
issues, including Toyota, Honda and Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar climbed above 122 yen for the first time  
in 11 weeks after a weekend meeting of G-7 finance ministers and 
central bankers in Germany concluded without reference to the 
weaker yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors saw this as tacit acceptance of the currency's  
depreciation, and quickly bought up dollars, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 121.98 yen in late trading, up 1.92 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 
121.15 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Taipei surged for a second straight session,  
with the key index rising 4.0 percent following a cut in bank 
reserve requirement ratios. The market's Weighted Stock Price Index 
rose 241.30 points to 6,313.63. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Taiwan's central bank on Friday to cut the  
average reserve requirement ratio on deposits to 6.41 percent from 
7.65 percent whipped up a buying frenzy in banking stocks, the 
biggest beneficiaries of the ratio cut, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed slightly lower in  
thin trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 24.78 points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 9,229.34. 
On Friday, the index had slumped 148.27 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said trading was light as many investors stayed on the  
sidelines to await earning results of HSBC Holdings, one of Hong 
Kong's leading banks. After the market closed, HSBC Holdings 
reported that its net profit fell 21 percent to U.S. $4.32 billion 
in 1998 because of the Asian crisis and bad loans in mainland 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, shares plunged 2.6 percent on worries that the  
Japanese yen may weaken further against the dollar in global 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 13.69 points to  
508.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed sharply higher, with  
brokers saying most local and international investor attention was 
focused on Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The NZSE-40 Capital 
Index rose 26.45 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,261.39. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower on mounting wariness  
over the impending announcement on bank closures. The Composite 
Index fell 5.348 points, or 1.3 percent, to 398.670, after a bomb 
threat forced the exchange to halt trading one hour before its 
normal closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed, with buying on selected  
blue-chip stocks keeping the market's main index afloat. The 
Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies rose 13.06 
points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,939.69. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed moderately lower. The  
benchmark All Ordinaries Index closed at 2916.3, down 8.0 points, 
or 0.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower. The benchmark  
Composite Index edged down 2.68 points, or 0.47 percent, to 562.62. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed, with the main rising on  
the back of follow-through buying from Friday. The Straits Times 
Index rose 1.9 percent, or 25.87 points, to 1,400.18. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed slightly lower in light  
trading. The SET index fell 3.34 points, or 1 percent, to 333.23.

<HEADLINE> Spelling Criticizes Teen Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aaron Spelling -- the creator of steamy shows  
like ``Melrose Place'' -- says he's shocked by the sexual content in 
some soon-to-be-released teen movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're going too far,'' Spelling said in the March 1  
edition of Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
	The article examines the sexual content of several upcoming  
R-rated teen movies, including ``Cruel Intentions,'' starring Sarah 
Michelle Gellar, and ``Go,'' with Scott Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	Spelling, who also produces teen-oriented shows like ``Beverly  
Hills 90210'' and ``Charmed,'' said movies need to be more 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I abhor some of these teenage movies. If they're going to have  
sexual affairs, I like to see condoms. We do it on TV. I think they 
should do it,'' said the producer. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Cruel Intentions'' star Reese Witherspoon said the movie,  
due out March 5, reflects teen life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing about this movie is that it blows the lid off  
any stereotype of kids' being gentle and demure. Kids are horrible 
to each other. It is a very sexual climate in high school. This 
movie shows parents that this is where your kids are at,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Expert Says Feds Lag on Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agencies are belatedly responding to  
the Year 2000 computer problem, and some of the biggest 
departments, including Defense and State, are still lagging behind, 
a House expert said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agencies, ``are finally getting around in the last year to  
really putting some effort into this,'' Rep. Stephen Horn, 
R-Calif., said in releasing his seventh quarterly ``report card'' 
on the status of efforts to what is known as the ``Y2K'' problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn, who heads the House subcommittee on government management,  
information and technology, gave the 24 agencies he has followed an 
overall grade of ``C+.'' That's up from the ``D'' grade handed down 
in his survey last November. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least we know there is recognition that 'Y2K' is not a new  
cereal,'' said Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md., who has worked to 
draw attention to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has given most federal agencies until March 31  
to upgrade their computers so there will not be breakdowns in basic 
public services on Jan. 1, 2000. Most older computers use only two 
digits to mark keep track of what year it is, and could confuse 
2000 with the year 1900 at the turn of the century, causing 
malfunctions and shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, head of the president's Year 2000 Council, said  
he was pleased by Horn's latest assessment. Horn, Koskinen said, 
``has complained I was overoptimistic, but when the dust gets 
settled we'll find that I was more right than he was, and I'm 
delighted with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen and Horn agreed that about 90 percent of federal  
computer systems will be ready by the March 31 deadline and 
Koskinen said critical transportation, defense and benefits 
programs will be fixed well in advance of the yearend. ``I think 
the public should be satisfied that the risk is not coming from 
federal systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horn gave 11 agencies, including the Social Security  
Administration and the Veterans Affairs Department, either an ``A'' 
or ``A-'' for installing software that is Y2K-compliant. He praised 
the Energy and Justice departments for making major strides since 
the last report. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said three departments -- Health and Human Services,  
Agriculture and Defense -- were still in the ``C'' category and 
three others -- State, Transportation and the Agency of 
International Development -- got failing grades. Led by Defense, 
those six account for more than 50 percent of the mission-critical 
computer systems in the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen said they've repaired more  
than 80 percent of their systems and expect to be fully ready at 
the end of the year. ``If we don't have a system fixed we will have 
fully fleshed-out contingency plans. We will be able to carry out 
our national security responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Care Financing Administration, the office of the  
Health and Human Services Department responsible for Medicare and 
Medicaid payments, also put out a statement that while follow-up 
work is still needed, it expects to meet the goal of having all its 
systems meet the March 31 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Aviation Administration officials have also pledged  
there will be no disruption of air services or safety problems next 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Morella praised the FAA for ``working around the clock'' to  
address the computer problem, and said that while some flights 
might be canceled on New Year's Day, ``it will not be unsafe to 
fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last fall approved more than $3 billion in emergency  
funding to help agencies make the needed computer changes. In the 
coming weeks lawmakers will also be considering legislation to 
limit the liabilities of private businesses that could face 
lawsuits for problems resulting from computer breakdowns.

<HEADLINE> Wilson Will Not Seek Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After meeting with advisers, checking his bank account and  
considering his chances, former Gov. Pete Wilson has decided not to 
run for president -- for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson determined that he could not raise the $20 million to $25  
million that he believed was necessary to run a credible campaign 
for the Republican nomination, according to a veteran Wilson 
strategist who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've reluctantly reached the conclusion that it's just not  
practical to pursue the nomination,'' Wilson told the Los Angeles 
Times, which reported the decision in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Hart, spokeswoman for Citizens for California's Future,  
a Wilson organization, declined comment Sunday night and said the 
group would release a statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term governor and two-term U.S. Senator concluded that  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush had gained so much momentum a year before 
the first primary that his early lead in several key polls was 
insurmountable. Bush has not announced whether he will run for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who moved from Sacramento to Century City after leaving  
office last month, plans to inform supporters of his decision 
today, the source said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson told Los Angeles Times columnist George Skelton that he  
decided last Wednesday that it would be senseless for him to run 
for president. ``I don't pretend I'm not disappointed,'' Wilson 
said. ``But life goes on and there's much to do and much to enjoy 
and I intend to do both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former governor has not decided whom he will endorse in the  
presidential race, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson abandoned his last presidential run after one month in  
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Recovery from throat surgery hampered the start of that  
presidential campaign, making him one of the last aspirants to 
officially announce his candidacy. He also was haunted by his own 
pledge made during his 1994 re-election campaign that he would not 
seek higher office.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Signs 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin today signed into law  
Russia's austere 1999 budget, a document designed to help the 
country out of its worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget was approved by both houses of parliament earlier  
this month with minimal opposition. Reflecting Russia's economic 
plight, the budget authorizes government spending of just $25 
billion and revenues of only $21 billion -- tiny sums given Russia's 
huge size. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin, who has been sidelined by several illnesses recently,  
was at work in the Kremlin today. The president has said almost 
nothing about the country's economic problems, and has left most 
day-to-day government affairs to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hopes the tight budget will keep inflation under  
control and will also persuade the International Monetary Fund and 
other foreign lenders to resume assistance that was halted after 
the economic crisis hit in August. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the IMF has expressed doubts about the government's  
forecasts. The government expects inflation of only 30 percent this 
year, but overall inflation is already more than 10 percent since 
the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has already said it will not be able to pay all of the  
$17.5 billion in foreign debts that fall due this year, though the 
government has yet to reach a rescheduling agreement with 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuri Maslyukov, the first deputy prime minister, held talks on  
the issue in Germany over the weekend with officials from the G-7 
group of industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Maslyukov said today that Russia needed to work out an agreement  
first with the IMF before there could be any deals on debt 
rescheduling. 
</P>
<P>
	Maslyukov also said he asked the countries to write off some of  
Russia's Soviet-era debts, the Interfax news agency reported. There 
was no word on their response. 
</P>
<P>
	Maslyukov expressed hope that Russia could sign a loan agreement  
with the IMF as early as April, but added that the fund didn't 
believe in the government's ability to raise the planned amount of 
taxes. Maslyukov called the IMF's concern ``unfounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can restructure our foreign debts, we don't expect any  
problems with implementation of the 1999 budget, and don't see any 
grounds to forecast an economic collapse,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NHTSA Probing Ford SUVs, GM Pickups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *CATHERINE STRONG   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is investigating  
dozens of complaints of fires or heavy smoke in some earlier model 
Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	About a million of the Explorers, from model years 1992 to 1994,  
are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Monday by the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration said there were 135 complaints of fire, smoke or 
burning smells coming from the ventilation system after leaves or 
other material entered through the Explorers' fresh-air vent, at 
the bottom of the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the complaints involved fires or heavy smoke. A  
hot portion of the blower assembly may ignite debris that can 
collect in the venting system, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dealers can only advise consumers to avoid parking under  
trees,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. issued a recall of 48,000 Mercury Villager cars  
in 1995 for a similar problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety agency is also looking into complaints that some 1997  
and 1998 Explorers continue to accelerate after the driver takes 
his foot off the gas or disengages the cruise control. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some 300,000 of the 1997-98 Explorers on the road.  
About 99 percent of the complaints involved problems with the 
throttle on Explorers with four-liter engines and a single overhead 
cam, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of it and cooperating fully with NHTSA,'' said  
Ford spokeswoman Karen Shaughnessy. 
</P>
<P>
	There were about 3,830 complaints provided by Ford to the agency  
and they typically said the throttle or gas pedal ``sticks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However it was unclear whether the throttle stuck in the open  
position, causing acceleration, or the closed position, making it 
difficult to accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford says most of the reports describe throttles that were stuck  
closed and are therefore not a safety problem. However, agency 
investigators said that if the throttle sticks closed repeatedly, 
that also could create a safety problem. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA opens safety investigations with a preliminary inquiry in  
which the agency and manufacturer exchange paperwork including any 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation may then be upgraded to an engineering  
analysis, during which engineers study components to see if they're 
defective. An investigation eventually can lead to a recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHTSA also opened an investigation into complaints that  
spare tires are falling off some Chevrolet S-10 pickups. The spare 
is stored under the truck and held in place by a cable. 
</P>
<P>
	In several cases the tires bounced back into the motorist's  
pickup or hit another vehicle, the report said. One injury was 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 1.45 million of the General Motors pickups on  
the road. Federal investigators are looking at S-10 pickups from 
model years 1991 through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokeswoman Mia Walton said the company was ``cooperating  
fully with the investigation.''

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Revive Hijack Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive  
lawsuits stemming from the 1986 terrorist hijacking of Pan Am 
Flight 73 in Karachi, Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that  
allegations against Pan American World Airways and a security firm 
should be restudied in light of their decision last year on 
transfers of complex lawsuits from one federal trial court to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	A New York-based federal appeals court ruled in the Flight 73  
case last June that the earlier Supreme Court decision should not 
be applied retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to public concern over terrorism on international  
airline flights, Pan Am contracted with Alert Management Systems to 
enhance security on those flights. The airline advertised its 
program to improve airport security. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 5, 1986, Pan Am Flight 73 left Bombay, India, en route  
to New York with a scheduled stop in Karachi. While the plane was 
on the ground at Karachi's airport, armed hijackers boarded and 
eventually fatally gunned down 20 passengers. Many others were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen lawsuits against Pan Am and Alert Management  
Systems were consolidated in a federal court in New York. Some of 
the victims and victims' surviving relatives challenged the 
transfer of their case. 
</P>
<P>
	All claims stemming from international air travel are governed  
by the Warsaw Convention, which imposes a $75,000 per passenger 
limit on liability, unless an air carrier engaged in willful 
misconduct. The Flight 73 lawsuits alleged such willful misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial jury in 1994 concluded that Pan Am had engaged  
in willful misconduct in touting its security system but that there 
was no proof the misconduct caused the hijacking. The $75,000 
limits on liability therefore were imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Supreme Court decision on transferring complex cases  
was announced last March, appeals in the Flight 73 case still were 
pending before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But that 
court said the March ruling ``does not apply retroactively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original Pan Am World Airways declared bankruptcy and closed  
down operations in 1991. Pan Am Corp., its parent firm, is in the 
final stages of liquidation following that bankruptcy. The name Pan 
Am Airways was sold during the bankruptcy proceedings, but the 
airline in its newest incarnation is not involved in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Singh vs. Pan Am, 98-905, and Patel vs. Pan Am,  
98-907.

<HEADLINE> Pigs Grown With Human Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- At a top-secret farm hidden in the  
Northeast, scientists are growing pigs whose DNA has been altered 
with human genes. 
</P>
<P>
	It sounds like the stuff of science fiction, yet officials at  
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. say they are close to figuring out how 
these pigs can figure in the treatment of human organ failures, 
spinal cord injuries and illnesses such as Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of transplanting animal parts to humans, called  
xenotransplantation, isn't new. But, until recently, nobody knew 
how to keep the human body from rejecting the organs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 18,000 organ transplants are performed in the United  
States each year and more than 40,000 patients are waiting for 
donor organs, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. 
About 10 Americans die each day waiting for transplants, network 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexion's first altered pigs, created with the help of  
researchers at Virginia Tech in the early 1990s, contained a human 
gene called CD-59. Scientists hoped the grafted gene would trick 
the human body's immune system into believing that the pig parts 
were human. 
</P>
<P>
	While transplanted organs from those pigs were able to survive  
for a couple of days in their new host, the body eventually 
rejected the parts. 
</P>
<P>
	A major breakthrough came last year when the small biotechnology  
firm, working with scientists in Australia, figured out a way to 
alter a sugar-like molecule in pig cells so that human antibodies 
would not recognize it as foreign. 
</P>
<P>
	The molecule had been acting as a magnet for human antibodies,  
betraying the fact that the transplanted tissue was not human. 
Alexion quickly patented the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you now take cells from those animals and challenge them  
with human serum, they are almost indestructible in the lab,'' said 
Stephen P. Squinto, the chief technology officer at Alexion. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at Alexion have already transplanted brain cells from  
their transgenic pigs into rodents with a syndrome similar to 
Parkinson's, a degenerative nerve condition that affects motor 
function. 
</P>
<P>
	The transplanted cells not only survived, they became  
neurotransmitters in the animals' brains and helped correct the 
tremors, Squinto said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same experiments are now being conducted in baboons. If  
those experiments work, Alexion hopes to begin human trials by the 
end of the year. Researchers hope that within 15 years humans will 
be able to receive permanent organ transplants from swine. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has seen remarkable results by transplanting  
cells from a pig's snout into the damaged spinal columns of 
rodents, Squinto said. The cells replace the damaged protective 
sheath around the spine and allow nerve cells to regenerate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would we expect that we will be able to take a person who is a  
paraplegic and have them walking or running in the Olympics?'' 
Squinto said. ``No, I don't think that's the case. But restoring 
some function to that person is certainly a goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Xenotransplantation faces stiff opposition from some in the  
medical community and from animal-rights activists. Alexion was 
unwilling to allow a reporter or photographer to visit their 
facilities, in part because they could be targeted by animal rights 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the medical concerns: the fear that transplanted organs  
could bring with them new diseases caused by viruses now living 
only in pigs. A virus originally transmitted from chimpanzees to 
humans is believed to have caused AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Because a transplant patient's immune system is suppressed with  
drugs, xenotransplantation provides an ideal environment for pig 
viruses to mutate, said Dr. Thomas Murray, director of the Center 
for Biomedical Ethics at Case Western Reserve University. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are risks to third parties here,'' he said. ``If you get  
an organ from a cadaver, you decide whether to accept that risk for 
yourself. But if you get an organ from a pig, many more people are 
put at an unknown risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA had temporarily banned animal-to-human transplant  
experiments because of pig viruses, but dropped the ban late in 
1997. Scientists now believe they have identified all the so-called 
retroviruses that are unique to pigs and can screen for them, 
Squinto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Hull, director of the clinical transplant program at  
Hartford Hospital, is excited by the idea of farms filled with 
transplantable organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology could dramatically improve the lives of thousands  
of people, many of whom can no longer even get out of bed because 
their own hearts or livers are failing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd be able to meet the needs of everybody,'' he said. ``You  
would save a tremendous amount of money and lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But animal rights activists say they whole process is  
unnecessary. Rather than killing animals for organs, they suggest 
everyone be considered an organ donor unless they specifically 
request an exemption, the opposite of the current policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the way to save a lot of money, and it would save a  
lot of suffering,'' said Sandra Larson, with the New England 
Anti-Vivisection Society.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Breaks Out in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces battled ethnic Albanian  
rebels northwest of Pristina today, while Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright tried to keep the Kosovo peace talks in France 
from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	International peace monitors also reported that Serb police were  
separating men from women and children in two ethnic Albanian 
villages near the fighting, which erupted today in the town of 
Vucitrn, 12 miles northwest of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Blyth, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and  
Cooperation in Europe, called the report ``a bad sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television crews reported police were blocking access to the  
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting erupted when about 10 Serb military vehicles came under  
fire near Vucitrn, said Walter Ebenberger, an OSCE spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces called in reinforcements -- including two tanks and  
an armed personnel carrier -- which returned fire, Ebenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the fighting ebbed about two hours later, and there was  
no word on casualties. The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information 
Center said the fighting started when government troops attacked 
three villages in the Vucitrn area. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest fighting added urgency to diplomatic efforts to save  
the Kosovo peace talks in Rambouillet, France, which appear near 
collapse. Albright returned to the conference site today to push 
the belligerents hard to make a deal, with just one day left before 
a Tuesday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian center also said the body of a 50-year-old  
ethnic Albanian man and his son were found today near Kacane, about 
30 miles south of Pristina near the Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of rising tension, two members of an  
international team monitoring the cease-fire in Kosovo were punched 
by two Serbian policemen but were not seriously hurt, the OSCE said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	OSCE spokesman Jorgen Grunnet said the monitors were on a  
routine patrol late Sunday when they were confronted by two 
policemen. After a brief argument, the monitors were ``roughed 
up,'' Grunnet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunnet said the police also harassed an unspecified number of  
other OSCE personnel when they entered the country from neighboring 
Macedonia on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav border authorities insisted on searching their  
vehicles which, Grunnet said, was against an international 
convention on treatment of the peace officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, the police checked the identities of a number of  
locally hired OSCE employees, apparently ethnic Albanians, who were 
aboard an OSCE bus taking them to work in the mission's 
headquarters in Pristina. Grunnet said this was also against the 
rules.

<HEADLINE> Simon To Brand Name Malls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Millions of consumers flock to malls each year,  
but few have a clue who actually operates these shopping meccas. 
</P>
<P>
	That might change as Simon Property Group, the nation's biggest  
mall owner, launches a branding campaign that will thrust its name 
into the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, which is expected to announce the initiative today, says  
the campaign will differentiate its properties from the competition 
by connecting its 145 malls under one name and guaranteeing 
superior levels of service to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers, meantime, will benefit from national advertising and  
other programs that Simon will use to promote its name and its 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to drive both consumer loyalty and tenant loyalty,''  
said Jonathan Litt, a real estate analyst at PaineWebber. ``As 
opposed to going to a no-name mall where you don't know what you 
will get, they want you to see the Simon name and know what kind of 
experience it will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simon's new campaign comes as malls fight for shoppers in the  
fiercely competitive and crowded retail marketplace. While 
consumers have long been loyal to certain stores, most haven't had 
the same attachment to any given mall and base where they shop on 
price and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study by the Atlanta-based consulting firm Kurt Salmon  
Associates reported consumers cut back shopping trips to large 
indoor malls by 12 percent last year, while they shopped 21 percent 
more at local stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts question whether mall-owner branding has any real  
value. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you change what is under the roof, just sticking the  
name on the door won't make a difference,'' said Wendy Liebmann, 
president of the retail consulting firm WSL Strategic Retail. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simon says its initiative will give shoppers reasons to come  
to their malls. One is Simon's pledge to aggressively tackle issues 
like customer service and safety, a regular consumer complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	They also will nationalize their MALLPeRKS program. Shoppers  
receive a point for every $1 spent at any store in any Simon mall, 
and they then get a selection of rewards to redeem -- like discounts 
or gift certificates to retailers -- based on the number of points 
they attain. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon also sees the branding program as a way to attract more  
outside marketers to use its malls to reach millions of people. 
More than 2.3 billion visitors come to Simon's properties each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo, for instance, has the exclusive rights to sell drinks  
at vending machines in Simon malls. Last week, Simon partnered with 
Time Inc. to create S magazine that will be distributed at all 
Simon malls. It will include mall-specific events, like promotions 
and special events, as well as advertisements from tenants. The 
articles will come from Time Inc.'s magazines, including Money, 
InStyle and Sports Illustrated.

<HEADLINE>  Blackhawks Fire Graham as Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Dirk Graham, who was known as a hard-hitting  
forward when he played for the Chicago Blackhawks but who led them 
to their worst record in 42 years as coach, was fired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Lorne Molleken will replace Graham as interim  
coach, the team announced. Denis Savard will stay on as assistant 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, just 59 games into his first season as coach, will  
remain with the Blackhawks organization, general manager Bob Murray 
said. However, Murray said a decision hasn't been made on Graham's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Molleken called his appointment as interim coach a sad moment  
for him, adding that Graham is a close friend. But he vowed to do 
things differently than the man he replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more structure, more discipline,'' Molleken  
said. ``Team play has been horrendous. That is what we will focus 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he wanted to see signs of things getting better with  
the Blackhawks. But with 23 games remaining, the team remained at 
the bottom of the Western Conference with the second-worst record 
in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to start getting ready for next season,'' Murray  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham had little coaching experience when he was hired by the  
Blackhawks last June. He had spent just one season, 1995-96, as an 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the time of Graham's appointment, Murray insisted that  
Graham's demeanor in the locker room as a player and captain of the 
Blackhawks was what mattered. In announcing Graham's firing, Murray 
admitted to his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned to never put a person in the position we put  
Dirk,'' Murray said. ``We set him up to fail. You have to have some 
experience to do this job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was known for motivating his teammates when he played for  
the Blackhawks from 1988 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	However, this year's team has shown little motivation under  
Graham. The Blackhawks have lost 10 of their last 12 games and are 
19 games under .500. That hasn't happened since 1955-57, when the 
Blackhawks finished 23 games under .500. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham also made news for his conflicts with players.  
</P>
<P>
	During a recent practice, Graham and right wing Tony Amonte got  
into an expletive-laced argument as the coach denounced the 
Blackhawks' star for turning over the puck. He later said Amonte 
and the rest of the first unit should be demoted to the second unit 
because they weren't doing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their disagreement, Amonte said it was unfortunate  
Graham was losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had the respect of the players,'' he said. ``The players  
listened to him. (But) everyone sees the game differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tough and aggressive player, Graham won the 1991 Frank Selke  
award for his defensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 152 goals, 190 assists and 685 penalty minutes in 546  
games for Chicago. He also holds the team record for most 
shorthanded goals in a season, 10 in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was captain for 6 1/2 seasons and part of the 1992 squad  
that won 11 straight playoff games before losing to Pittsburgh in 
the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	As coach, he replaced Craig Hartsburg, who was fired in April  
after Chicago's 30-39-13 season, when they failed to make the 
playoffs for the first time since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Molleken, 42, came to the Blackhawks last June from the Edmonton  
Oilers, where he was head coach of two minor league affiliates. He 
previously coached the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey 
League and was a coach in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League.

<HEADLINE> Vizquel Shows Up to Indians Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- He never asked for a trade. He never  
said he wouldn't report to training camp. He's a happy camper. 
Let's play ball. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the message from Omar Vizquel on Monday as he arrived  
at the Cleveland Indians training camp following an offseason in 
which the six-time Gold Glove shortstop had voiced unhappiness with 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to put all that behind me,'' Vizquel said. ``Nobody  
put a gun to my head to sign the contract. My situation is good 
here. I want to be a Cleveland Indian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This winter, Vizquel lobbied the Tribe front office for an  
extension of the contract he signed after the 1995 season. The deal 
has three years remaining at $3 million per year, plus a $3 million 
option for 2002. But Indians officials refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel had said asking for a trade or refusing to report to  
training camp were both options. In the end, he reported to camp on 
time and said Monday he is willing to live with the terms of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel said his situation, which has been the talk of Cleveland  
fans during in an offseason in which the Indians signed Gold Glove 
second baseman Roberto Alomar, ``was blown out of proportion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As an employee of the Cleveland Indians, I have the right to  
go in and ask (general manager) John Hart about my contract. I did 
that,'' Vizquel said. ``I walked into his office friendly and I 
walked out friendly. We couldn't find an answer to it now, so for 
now the talks are done. I am not going to talk about it anymore 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart left the door open for future discussions with Vizquel.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a closed issue,'' Hart said. ``We'd like Omar to  
retire as a Cleveland Indian. It's his right to ask for more years 
in his contract, but that doesn't mean we have to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel said he was not asking for a renegotiation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't trying to change the deal. I just wanted to add some  
years to it,'' he said. ``It was not a renegotiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indians catcher Sandy Alomar has said Vizquel should honor the  
contract, and that if Indians officials renegotiated, it would open 
the door for other players to seek new deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel and Alomar met with manager Mike Hargrove on Monday to  
defuse any potential hard feelings between the two players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is straight between us,'' Vizquel said. ``I've been  
good friends with Sandy for a long time, but the last thing you 
want to hear from a friend is him saying something that was not a 
benefit to you. My situation was none of Sandy's business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar also said he and Vizquel have cleared the air between  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing against Omar,'' Alomar said. ``If he was  
offended by my comments, I apologize. I am not upset with him, and 
I don't think he is upset with me.''

<HEADLINE>  Blackhawks Fire Graham as Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Dirk Graham, who was known as a hard-hitting  
forward when he played for the Chicago Blackhawks but who led them 
to their worst record in 42 years as coach, was fired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Lorne Molleken will replace Graham as interim  
coach, the team announced. Denis Savard will stay on as assistant 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, just 59 games into his first season as coach, will  
remain with the Blackhawks organization, general manager Bob Murray 
said. However, Murray said a decision hasn't been made on Graham's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Molleken called his appointment as interim coach a sad moment  
for him, adding that Graham is a close friend. But he vowed to do 
things differently than the man he replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more structure, more discipline,'' Molleken  
said. ``Team play has been horrendous. That is what we will focus 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he wanted to see signs of things getting better with  
the Blackhawks. But with 23 games remaining, the team remained at 
the bottom of the Western Conference with the second-worst record 
in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to start getting ready for next season,'' Murray  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham had little coaching experience when he was hired by the  
Blackhawks last June. He had spent just one season, 1995-96, as an 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the time of Graham's appointment, Murray insisted that  
Graham's demeanor in the locker room as a player and captain of the 
Blackhawks was what mattered. In announcing Graham's firing, Murray 
admitted to his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned to never put a person in the position we put  
Dirk,'' Murray said. ``We set him up to fail. You have to have some 
experience to do this job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was known for motivating his teammates when he played for  
the Blackhawks from 1988 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	However, this year's team has shown little motivation under  
Graham. The Blackhawks have lost 10 of their last 12 games and are 
19 games under .500. That hasn't happened since 1955-57, when the 
Blackhawks finished 23 games under .500. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham also made news for his conflicts with players.  
</P>
<P>
	During a recent practice, Graham and right wing Tony Amonte got  
into an expletive-laced argument as the coach denounced the 
Blackhawks' star for turning over the puck. He later said Amonte 
and the rest of the first unit should be demoted to the second unit 
because they weren't doing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their disagreement, Amonte said it was unfortunate  
Graham was losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had the respect of the players,'' he said. ``The players  
listened to him. (But) everyone sees the game differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tough and aggressive player, Graham won the 1991 Frank Selke  
award for his defensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 152 goals, 190 assists and 685 penalty minutes in 546  
games for Chicago. He also holds the team record for most 
shorthanded goals in a season, 10 in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was captain for 6 1/2 seasons and part of the 1992 squad  
that won 11 straight playoff games before losing to Pittsburgh in 
the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	As coach, he replaced Craig Hartsburg, who was fired in April  
after Chicago's 30-39-13 season, when they failed to make the 
playoffs for the first time since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Molleken, 42, came to the Blackhawks last June from the Edmonton  
Oilers, where he was head coach of two minor league affiliates. He 
previously coached the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey 
League and was a coach in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks also announced the appointment of defenseman  
Trent Yawney as an assistant coach. Yawney, 33, a 12-year veteran 
of the NHL, broke his arm in a game at Nashville and is out for the 
year. He said Monday he is ``hanging up the blades.''

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Unemployment Holds Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Unemployment held steady at a record 5.8  
percent in the three months ending in January, the government said 
Monday in a report that offered up a gloomy outlook for the Chinese 
New Year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census and Statistics Department said 202,000 people were  
out of work in the November-January period, compared with 201,200 
in October-December. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Wong, the secretary for education and manpower, warned  
there were no signs that the situation would improve soon. Hong 
Kong's economy shrank by 7 percent in the third quarter of 1998 and 
is believed to have contracted by 5 percent for all of last year. 
Nobody is predicting a quick recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic situation in the coming months remains  
uncertain,'' Wong said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Unionists warn more people would be thrown out of work during  
the Chinese New Year, when many companies traditionally review 
their books and lay off unneeded staff after giving them their 
year-end bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``At present, it would probably be fair to say a lot more  
companies will be thinking of downsizing more than anything else,'' 
said Tang Kwong-yiu, the government economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong people greet each Chinese New Year with wishes of  
prosperity, but with the new year less than a week old, prosperity 
doesn't seem to be in the cards as the territory struggles through 
its deepest recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, the trend will continue,'' said Anthony Chan, chief  
regional economist at HSBC Securities. Chan added that unemployment 
may hit 6.5 percent by midyear -- ``emphasized by corporate 
downsizing at small and medium-sized enterprises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others predict the jobless figures could hit 7 percent -- or  
240,000 people out of work -- by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the situation to continue to deteriorate,'' said  
Shamus Mok, chief economist at Bank of East Asia Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor activists echoed the dismal forecasts. Despite government  
job-enhancing projects, the absence of social welfare insurance 
specifically for the unemployed will most likely cause a rise in 
poverty figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need time, we need government commitment,'' said  
Mabel Au of Oxfam Hong Kong, which leads a coalition of 16 
non-government organizations studying poverty and unemployment in 
the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wong warned there were limits to what the government can do.  
</P>
<P>
	``One must not forget that whenever businesses are not doing  
well, whatever we do to ease the situation will not bring down the 
rate of unemployment,'' Wong said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen in late  
profit-taking Monday after rising earlier on speculation that Group 
of Seven finance officials had approved a lower rate for the 
Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar edged higher against the euro. In late New York  
trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1028, down from $1.1076 late 
Friday. Also in late trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.91 
Japanese yen, down from 121.15 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar climbed to an 11-week high against the yen during  
early trading. Investors later sold yen after the G-7 meeting of 
industrial nations failed to say anything about exchange rates 
following a weekend meeting. Investors interpreted that as 
officials' approving of the falling yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was aided by Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's  
influential vice finance minister for international affairs, who 
was quoted in a Tuesday newspaper saying he favored a weak yen, a 
continuation of his position last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``An excessive rise in the yen should be avoided. Although we  
will not refer to a target level, we must send a message (to the 
market) at some point,'' he was quoted as saying in an interview 
published in Tuesday's Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper. Sending a 
message would mean intervening in foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was a little sensitive to that'' and took the yen  
lower against the dollar, said Jeremy Fand, a foreign exchange 
strategist at BankBoston's Boston office. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar did end the day lower against the yen as  
profit-taking set in. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially fell against the euro in Asian trading  
following weekend comments by Hans Tietmeyer, president of 
Germany's central bank, who intimated that a weak euro was 
worrisome for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was surprisingly supportive of the euro,'' Fand said. But  
the dollar later got a boost from rising U.S. stocks and bonds. 
``That's always good news,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4495 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4468, and 1.4962 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4852. The British 
pound rose to $1.6258 from $1.6226. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7734 German 
marks, up from 1.7658; 5.9488 French francs, up from 5.9207; and 
1,754.39 Italian lire, up from 1,748.25.

<HEADLINE> Trial To Resume in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine aviator who operated  
electronic equipment from his jet's rear seat and had no control 
over the plane's operation may command the fate of pilot Capt. 
Richard Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. William Raney was expected to testify this week in the  
court-martial of Ashby, the Marine pilot whose jet sliced a ski 
gondola cable in Italy last year, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter, one  
count of each destroying private and government property and one 
count of dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Raney and Capt. Chandler Seagraves both rode in the back seats  
of the EA-6B Prowler and operated the jet's radar detection and 
jamming gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Seagraves told the eight-man jury that he didn't hear  
the plane's radar altimeter sound any warnings as it flew lower 
toward the cable, and that he didn't think Ashby was flying 
dangerously. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim Ashby was flying too low and too fast when the  
jet hit the cable. His lawyers have said the Mount Cermis ski lift 
wasn't on Ashby's government-issue map, his radar altimeter 
malfunctioned, and he suffered from an optical illusion that made 
him think he was flying higher than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet was stationed at a NATO base at Aviano, Italy, at the  
time of the accident last Feb. 3. Although the mishap occurred 
during a low-level training flight, Prowlers typically operated 
thousands of feet higher during missions over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, six members of Ashby's squadron testified that he was  
a top pilot and usually calm and friendly. After the accident, said 
the unit's doctor, there was a concern that Ashby might consider 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The aviators testified a week earlier than scheduled because  
their Prowler squadron was sent Saturday to Europe to fly missions 
over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Michael Recce, a pilot, said he watched Ashby's crew  
discuss a 1,000-foot altitude restriction for the low-level 
training flight the day of the mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	Recce said none of the squadron members knew of the 2,000-foot  
restriction imposed the previous October. The Prowler hit the 
gondola cable at 360 feet to 370 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on all counts, Ashby faces more than 200 years in  
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., will face the same charges as Ashby at a court-martial next 
month.

<HEADLINE> ABC Set To Air Lewinsky Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky was very frank about her  
feelings toward President Clinton and Kenneth Starr in an interview 
with ABC but had a hard time explaining her attraction to married 
men, Barbara Walters said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters met with reporters to describe her long-awaited  
interview with the former White House intern, who has yet to appear 
in public to discuss her relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview took place Saturday in New York and will be  
broadcast over two hours starting at 9 p.m. EST on March 3, the 
final day of a television ``sweeps'' period used to set advertising 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is open, she is expressive, she is sometimes very  
touching,'' Walters said. ``Sometimes when she describes herself 
you realize she can be very difficult. She is funny and extremely 
articulate. This is not a Valley Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the impeachment saga, Ms. Lewinsky was hotly pursued by  
interviewers, including talk show host Roseanne, who offered Ms. 
Lewinsky more than $1 million to talk. ABC did not pay for the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she chose Walters because she felt it was the  
best way to establish her credibility, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Monica was a little apprehensive in the beginning but  
was not nervous,'' Walters said. ``She looked very striking in 
appearance, very attractive. Once she began I think she forgot 
there were cameras there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most difficult question for her to address is why she gets  
involved with married men, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky is ``teary'' at some points, but ``this is not a  
sobbing interview,'' Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	After nailing down the interview in November, ABC had to wait  
until last week for permission from Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky balked only once at answering a question due to  
restrictions placed on her by Starr. It concerned the events of 
Jan. 16, 1998, when she was first questioned about her relationship 
with Clinton by Starr's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr had asked that Ms. Lewinsky have a lawyer present during  
the interview, and she was told not to characterize what was said 
to her by prosecutors, Walters said. Instead, Ms. Lewinsky talks 
about how she felt during the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also insisted Ms. Lewinsky not comment on other  
investigations being conducted by the special prosecutor, according 
to ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC has not decided whether it will air excerpts of the  
interview before March 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky gave another interview to British news anchor Jon  
Snow on Sunday at her mother's New York apartment. It will air in 
Britain on March 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Channel 4 would not comment on the amount it paid for the  
interview, but the British national news agency Press Association 
reported the sum was $660,000.

<HEADLINE> CompuServe Gets a Makeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CompuServe has unveiled a multimillion dollar  
marketing push with user-friendly software, flashier features and 
lower prices as it attempts to stage a comeback with the help of 
parent America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe, a pioneering online service that was eventually  
taken over by former rival AOL, hopes to attract a broader group of 
members such as small business owners but maintain its unique 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL wants to keep CompuServe a distinct, more elite service --  
part of a broader strategy of nurturing the businesses it acquires 
as niche brands for specific customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What AOL is trying to do is get beyond their traditional  
subscriber base, and get into a market that's a bit more 
sophisticated,'' said Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with Jupiter 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe had carved out a niche serving businesses,  
professional people and experienced cyberspace users. 
</P>
<P>
	With users finding more convenient ways online, CompuServe's  
subscriber base has fallen from about 2.6 million to 2 million 
since it was taken over by AOL as part of a three-way deal with H&AMP;R 
Block and WorldCom in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	To revive itself, CompuServe said Monday it plans to mail out  
diskettes of its software upgrade, which supports higher-speed 
modem connections and is easier for users to install and customize 
on their personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mailing will be targeted more to business professionals,  
a sharp contrast with the ``carpet'' mailings of millions of 
diskettes AOL is known for. 
</P>
<P>
	New subscribers will see a ``Main Menu'' screen with a  
continuously updated news ticker featuring headlines from The 
Associated Press, market analysis from CBSMarketWatch.com and 
personalized news folders -- more sophisticated offerings than AOL 
members get. 
</P>
<P>
	But other features will become more like AOL's.  
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe's e-mail will be modeled after the easier-to-use  
version that helped AOL become the world's leading online service 
with more than 16 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	And subscribers will be given simpler user names, and the domain  
name will be shortened from ``compuserve.com'' to ``cs.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a new pricing plan, members would pay just $9.95 a month  
for 20 hours of online access, with each additional hour billed at 
less than 5 cents a minute. The offer will last for several months, 
depending on how many people sign up. CompuServe has been charging 
existing members $9.95 a month for five hours of use, with each 
extra hour costing $2.95. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, CompuServe is cutting the cost of unlimited access  
from $24.95 to $19.95 a month. But CompuServe officials downplayed 
this offer, saying that 80 percent of their online users choose 
limited access. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL hopes to charge advertisers a premium for targeting upscale  
CompuServe users, who may have more money to spend on a new 
computer or other big-ticket items than AOL users who may explore 
chat rooms for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go down and sit down to talk to advertisers about  
CompuServe, they really see it as a dream audience,'' CompuServe 
chief operating officer Audrey Weil said. But, she added, 
CompuServe will offer discounts to advertisers to try to get them 
to try marketing through CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has enjoyed some success with its strategy of snapping up  
companies with distinct identities and keeping their images 
distinct. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, AOL bought the ICQ Web site and its instant messaging  
software, which alerts users when their friends are on the Web and 
lets them chat and send files directly to other users' computer 
desktops. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns that ICQ users, the technology-elite, would  
flee AOL, ICQ last month said membership nearly doubled since the 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL says it will employ the same strategy when it completes its  
acquisition of Netscape Communications, the pioneer of Internet 
browser software. Netscape will keep its headquarters in Mountain 
View, Calif. and maintain a separate workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe, too, retains it original headquarters in Columbus,  
Ohio, and much of its staff. Whether AOL succeeds in reviving it 
will be another key test of an AOL strategy that resembles cable 
television, with each channel targeting a different audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as Weil said, ``Think of AOL like the USA Today newspaper.  
CompuServe is a little bit like the New York Times. It's a more 
serious newspaper.''

	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- There were tears. There was talk of  
sex. There were obscenities. There was flamboyant fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	All the commotion came as Dennis Rodman held a news conference  
Monday and said he was moving closer to playing for the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the seven-time defending rebounding champion, said he  
expects to be in uniform Thursday or Friday. ESPN said he would 
practice Wednesday -- even though the team will be coming off three 
road games in three nights -- and make his debut Friday against the 
Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest chapter of ``As The Worm Turns,'' along with the  
Lakers' subsequent 117-113 loss at Denver, made for another 
turbulent day. But that's nothing new to the Lakers, who three 
weeks ago made it clear they wanted to sign the 37-year-old 
tattooed forward, a member of five championship teams, including 
the last three with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed conservatively -- for him -- except for a wide,  
multicolored hat and dark glasses, Rodman arrived 30 minutes late 
for his news conference. He was accompanied by his wife, actress 
Carmen Electra, agent Steve Chasman and sister Debra. But nobody 
was there from the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came a series of bizarre and conflicting statements. And  
the news conference ended abruptly after some 20 minutes with a 
tearful Rodman being asked if he had been selfish by not announcing 
a decision earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman began by saying he wanted to sign with the Lakers, but  
matters were incomplete. When angrily questioned why he called the 
news conference if he had no announcement to make, Rodman snapped: 
``You don't have to be here.'' Shortly thereafter he said he hoped 
to sign Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I'll be playing this week, and, hopefully, the  
Lakers and the people of California will accept me for who I am and 
what I do,'' he said. ``If not, I'll move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said he had spoken with Lakers owner Jerry Buss several  
times and hoped to sign a two- or three-year deal with the team. He 
insists he is in good shape and could immediately play 30 to 35 
minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would be reliable, pointing out he played 80 of  
a possible 82 regular-season games for the Bulls last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can count on me, you can count on me going to practice,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said the Lakers weren't a championship team now and must  
change their approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the guys want to be superstars,'' he said. ``Everybody has  
to play a role. This team doesn't understand that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers (6-5) didn't look like a championship team in their  
loss at Denver, which had won just once in nine previous games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping that this is going to give us a boost, because we  
need one,'' guard Derek Harper said following the latest loss. 
``Getting him will help. We need help as a team. He is a 
high-energy player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal said Rodman will bring defense and rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
	``He will open the floor more for me,'' O'Neal said. ``I've been  
the one to get to the rebound first, and this will allow me to get 
down the floor. I'm sure he will get the rebound. I welcome him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said he wasn't returning for the money, pointing out  
there wasn't much of that for him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy at all,'' he said, referring to the fact that  
the Lakers could offer him only a $1 million veterans' minimum, 
which would be prorated to under $500,000 because of the shortened 
season and the games he has missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will make me happy is if I can bring this city a ring  
just like I did in Chicago,'' he said. ``I'm here just because I 
want to make people happy. I miss entertaining. I miss entertaining 
for the people. I play for the people, I give the people what they 
want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It had been reported Rodman would receive an extra $3 million as  
part of his contract with Converse if he played in New York, 
Chicago or Los Angeles this season. But he said he was going to 
have to ``fight them in court to get that money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the news conference resembled an episode of ``The  
Jerry Springer Show'' -- although there was no fighting, Rodman used 
four-letter words and made sexual references about his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, when asked about being selfish, Rodman started crying  
and said, ``I'm never going to win, no matter what I do for this 
league, for the game of basketball, I'm never going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, opening a piece of paper, he said, ``I've got 10 charities  
here that I'm going to give $10,000 to. Even with this here, I'm 
still not going to win. You tell me if that's selfish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sister interjected, ``He doesn't have any money.''  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman then waved off reporters and left the microphone.  
</P>
<P>
	Lakers great Magic Johnson, a part-owner and vice president of  
the team, expressed relief that Rodman had made a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was tired of it dragging on because it was doing nothing but  
being a distraction for our players, the coach, as well as our 
franchise,'' Johnson said Monday in Indianapolis. ``We were just 
hoping this day would finally come, either tell us you're coming or 
tell us you're not coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy it's all over with. We know he's coming. Now  
coach (Del) Harris can get him in there, get him learning the plays 
in the system, try to get him in shape as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had criticized Rodman on David Letterman's show Thursday  
night, saying he was causing a distraction and he hoped the Lakers 
would ``just forget it.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Gambles at Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic is  
trying to outmaneuver both the United States and his ethnic 
Albanian enemies in hopes of emerging from Kosovo peace talks 
without a NATO attack or foreign troops to police a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic is gambling that the ethnic Albanians will refuse to  
sign the proposed peace accord, and by doing so, will force NATO to 
abandon plans for airstrikes against Yugoslavia if it fails to sign 
a peace deal with ethnic Albanians to end the yearlong conflict in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the tactic is succeeding.  
</P>
<P>
	After days of bombastic threats and deadline rhetoric, Secretary  
of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday that there will be no NATO 
airstrikes on Yugoslavia or its republic of Serbia, where Kosovo is 
located, if both sides fail to agree to peace terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it fails because both parties say `no,' there will not be  
bombing of Serbia and we will try to figure out ways to continue 
trying to deal with both sides,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombings will only be ordered if the Kosovo Albanians agree and  
the Serbs do not, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	That represented a major concession by the United States in the  
face of pressure from the other sponsors of the peace conference 
outside Paris, notably Russia, which do not share Washington's view 
that the Serbs are primarily to blame for the impasse in peace 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are trying to do is to push the Kosovo Albanians over  
the finish line,'' Albright's spokesman, James P. Rubin said, 
adding that ``in order to move forward to military action, it needs 
to be clear that Serbs are to blame'' if the talks break down. 
</P>
<P>
	But that would require the ethnic Albanians to sign onto a  
political agreement that falls short of their main goal -- 
independence -- without having firm guarantees that NATO troops will 
be there to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbian delegation at the talks in Rambouillet, France, has  
signaled it would accept the political portion of the peace formula 
-- which provides self-rule for the majority Albanian province but 
not the independence that the Kosovo Liberation Army demands. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Serbs have steadfastly refused to go along with the  
security portion of the document, which provides for 30,000 
American and other NATO troops to enforce the agreement for at 
least three years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the ethnic Albanians, however, an agreement without NATO  
troops is no agreement at all. Without the security guarantee, the 
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army says it will not disarm because it 
cannot guarantee the safety of ethnic Albanians, who form 90 
percent of Kosovo's 2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington had insisted that the proposed agreement, which also  
provides sweeping autonomy for Kosovo, is a package deal. But 
Milosevic has succeeded in undercutting that view: he accepts 
autonomy for Kosovo, but not foreign troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the ethnic Albanians already feel they have made enough  
concessions by setting aside their goal of independence for at 
least three years, they don't want to play their last card and sign 
the deal unless NATO protection is included. 
</P>
<P>
	In what may be a prelude to an ethnic Albanian walkout, the head  
of the delegation, Hashim Thaci, sent a telegram Sunday to British 
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister Hubert 
Vedrine saying it was difficult for his group to remain in France 
``at a time when fighting is raging in Kosovo. It's a difficult 
dilemma of our delegation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the ethnic Albanians sign, the whole peace process may  
collapse with no agreement in sight and no way for Washington to 
force a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, when Albright arrived in Rambouillet on Saturday, she  
found the Italians and Russians refusing to lay all the blame on 
the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discord in the Contact Group,'' said a headline Sunday in the  
state-controlled Yugoslav newspaper Politika, likely reflecting 
Milosevic's own perceptions regarding the six-nation group trying 
to push the two sides to accept a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Xhemail Mustafa, a spokesman for ethnic Albanian political  
leader Ibrahim Rugova, said the talks' extension reflected not only 
the Contact Group's wish to find an interim solution for Kosovo but 
also to save the conference and the Western powers' credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Without unanimity, it would be politically difficult -- if not  
impossible -- for NATO to launch attacks on the Serbs. Attacking KLA 
``strongholds'' would involve the spectacle of superpower missiles 
and smart bombs raining down on remote mountain villages where 
fighters live alongside civilians and whose buildings still bear 
the scars of fighting last summer.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Steel Exports to U.S. Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese steel exports to the United States plunged  
more than 25 percent in January compared to a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's steel exports have become a major trade conflict between  
the two countries since the U.S. steel industry accused Japanese 
companies of dumping low-priced steel in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry said Monday that Japanese steel exports to  
the United States fell 25.4 percent in volume terms, and declined 
28.7 percent in value. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, exports to the U.S. market more than doubled in terms  
of volume, increasing to 7.02 million metric tons. Wide strip 
hot-rolled coil exports to the United States rose nearly fourfold 
to 2.25 million metric tons, Japanese producers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, major U.S. steelmakers and the United Steelworkers  
Union filed import complaints accusing Japan and seven other 
nations of selling cut-to-length steel in the U.S. market at less 
than production costs and home market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the U.S. government said it had evidence  
that Japan and Brazil had illegally dumped hot-rolled steel in the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steelmakers, however, have said Japan's sharp rise in  
exports last year came largely at the request of the U.S. 
steelmakers themselves and steel users to meet a domestic supply 
shortage.

<HEADLINE> GM Halts Output of Some Minivans GM halts production of European-market minivans made in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will cease production of its  
U.S.-built Opel and Vauxhall Sintra minivans sold in Europe due to 
weak sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sintra is the European version of the minivan sold in North  
American as the Chevrolet Venture, Oldsmobile Silhouette and 
Pontiac Montana. All are built in Doraville, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, which plans to replace the Sintra in the spring with the  
smaller German-built Zafira minivan, sold only 17,260 Sintras last 
year, less than half its 35,000-unit target. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to build 145,000 Zafiras this year, with  
full-year production in 2000 set at 200,000, GM said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	GM had considered moving Sintra production to Europe, but  
decided instead to focus solely on the Zafira. The automaker plans 
to boost production of its North American-market minivans once it 
ends production of the Sintras in April.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Stop Copyright Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to kill a  
copyright lawsuit in which a news service that videotaped the 
beating of trucker Reginald Denny during the 1992 Los Angeles riots 
seeks payment for unauthorized showings overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that lets Los  
Angeles News Service pursue its lawsuit against Reuters even though 
U.S. copyright laws generally do not apply in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last July that  
damages for copyright infringement are available if an unauthorized 
copy is made in the United States and then transmitted abroad. The 
New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously had 
allowed the same exception to copyright laws' jurisdictional 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Denny's beating and other attacks on motorists were taped from a  
helicopter during the rioting that followed the acquittals of two 
police officers charged with beating motorist Rodney King. Los 
Angeles News Service agreed to provide its copyright works to the 
television networks, including NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Reuters Television International obtained a copy of the  
videotape through a joint venture with NBC and the British 
Broadcasting Company. Reuters then made copies available to its 
subscriber stations by putting them on satellites accessible in 
Europe and parts of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge narrowed the copyright lawsuit to domestic  
infringements, but the 9th Circuit court reversed that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview after the appeals court ruling, news service  
lawyer William Bergen said his client might collect $6 million in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Reuters' lawyers urged the  
justices to use the case to make clear that copyright laws do not 
reach overseas infringements. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Reuters Television International vs. Los Angeles  
News Service, 98-851.

<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Trans-Atlantic mergers require lots of  
trans-Atlantic travel. Just ask DaimlerChrysler, which started its 
own flights between Stuttgart and Detroit on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating under the name DaimlerChrysler Aviation, the  
automaker's Airbus A320 with 52 seats will fly four times a week 
between its two main bases of operations, with a refueling stop in 
Iceland, the company announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in November, the A320 will be replaced with an Airbus  
A319, which will make the trip nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said it started the flights because the need for  
its employees to fly back and forth across the Atlantic has risen 
dramatically since last year's merger.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Stable Job Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. job market should remain strong through  
the second quarter of the year, despite a softening in the 
manufacturing sector, according to a survey being released today. 
</P>
<P>
	In its quarterly survey of 16,000 U.S. businesses, Manpower Inc.  
found that 29 percent of the companies plan to add workers in the 
second quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 6 percent of the business surveyed plan to cut jobs, while  
61 percent anticipate no change. The remaining 4 percent weren't 
sure, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures are comparable to year-ago figures, but markedly  
higher than first-quarter projections, reflecting typical seasonal 
hiring patterns, Manpower said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter, 23 percent of the companies expected to  
add jobs, 10 percent expected job cuts and 63 percent anticipated 
no change. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee-based Manpower said the April-June quarter should see  
a continuation of the strong hiring patterns of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see no deterioration of hiring strength in terms of plans  
to reduce work forces even in the manufacturing sectors, where 
weakness is centered more on new hires than on downsizing 
activity,'' said Mitchell S. Fromstein, chief executive officer of 
Manpower, the nation's largest temporary staffing firm. 
</P>
<P>
	That weakness was offset by stronger demand for workers in the  
services and construction industries, Manpower said. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook for the Midwest was the strongest in the nation with  
31 percent of businesses saying they planned to add to the payroll, 
while 29 percent of businesses surveyed in the West and South said 
so. The Northeast lagged behind the other regions with 26 percent 
of companies surveyed saying they planned to increase staffing. 
</P>
<P>
	Manpower's survey was based on telephone interviews with 16,000  
employers in 474 U.S. cities. The company said its figures have a 
margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Regulatory Hurdle in Olivetti Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Olivetti SpA's bid for the world's sixth-largest  
phone company ran into a regulatory obstacle Monday that will make 
it easier for Telecom Italia to defend itself against the hostile 
$58 billion offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's stock market regulator, Consob, said Olivetti's weekend  
filing failed to meet the standards for a full-fledged takeover 
announcement. That's important because Italian law limits the 
defense a company can mount once it becomes the target of a 
takeover bid ruled valid by Consob. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling doesn't stop Olivetti from trying a takeover, but it  
does give Telecom Italia more room to try and fend it off. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Telecom Italia now is free to alter its capital  
structure, a move that would enable it to adopt a defense that 
would make a takeover prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia enlisted some big investment bankers for the  
looming battle. It said Monday it is being advised by J.P. Morgan, 
Credit Suisse First Boston, Lazard Freres and Istituto Mobiliare 
Italiano. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government was reportedly being advised by Morgan  
Stanley Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti had no immediate comment on Consob's decision that the  
filing was inadequate. The regulator said too many parts of the 
deal were subject to regulatory decisions that could deny financing 
to Olivetti in its attempt to buy a company more than five times 
its size. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's bid relies heavily on debt financing from three U.S.  
investment banks -- Chase Manhattan, Lehman Brothers and Donaldson, 
Lufkin and Jenrette -- as well as Italy's Mediobanca. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid Saturday for the Italian communications giant stunned  
the business world. If Olivetti succeeds, it would be Europe's 
biggest telecommunications deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs on Monday raised its investment recommendation for  
Telecom Italia, saying it didn't think Olivetti was offering enough 
and that Telecom Italia ``could make a vigorous defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in Telecom Italia shares was so frenzied that the stock  
was briefly suspended after shooting up 10 percent at the opening 
Monday. In the first trading since the bid was announced, the 
dollar volume of $1.6 billion in Telecom Italia trades was a record 
for any day for any company's shares on Italy's Milan exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom closed up 8.5 percent and Telecom Italia Mobile,  
Europe's biggest wireless telephone operator that is 60 percent 
owned by Telecom Italia, rose 6.4 percent. On the New York Stock 
Exchange, Telecom Italia's U.S. shares gained 3.2 percent, rising 
$3.37 1/2 to $109.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The gain left Telecom Italia at 9.86 euros a share in Milan,  
about $10.86 at current exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and traders say Olivetti's offering of 10 euros a share  
(about $10.10) isn't enough for Telecom Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti closed down 7.7 percent in Milan on concerns that it  
wouldn't be able to pull off the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstacles are numerous.  
</P>
<P>
	Telecom was a state monopoly that went private in 1997. The  
Italian treasury still holds 3.4 percent of the shares and veto 
power over major decisions through next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the veto, which includes the power to stop an investor  
from acquiring more than 3 percent of the stock, and despite 
pressure from unions, Premier Massimo D'Alema said the government 
needs to be to be ``absolutely neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, the government would like Telecom to stay in  
Italian hands and would prefer that it not be split apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's biggest unions on Monday called for an urgent meeting  
with the premier to discuss their worries that a takeover might 
lead to layoffs. Telecom has around 126,000 employees, mostly in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another potential problem for Olivetti could be its plan to  
raise cash by selling its investments in mobile operator Omnitel 
Pronto Italia, as well as fixed-line operator Infostrada, to 
Mannesmann , a German industrial holding company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government granted Omnitel's operating license on  
condition that it not be sold off for five years, and there is one 
year left to meet that proviso. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti and Mannesmann control those two via a holding company  
50.1 percent owned by Olivetti and 49.9 percent owned by 
Mannesmann, the biggest rival to the former German telephone 
monopoly Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany on Sunday, Mannesmann said it will pay Olivetti the  
equivalent of $7.8 billion for its stakes in Omnitel and Infostrada 
if the takeover bid succeeds.

<HEADLINE> Sempra To Buy KN Energy for $1.8B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Sempra Energy announced Monday the $1.8 billion  
purchase of Colorado-based KN Energy, extending its natural gas 
pipeline reach 25,000 miles throughout the Midwest and giving it 
the largest customer base in the utility industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock and cash transaction will increase Sempra's payroll to  
15,000 employees and its revenues by $4.4 billion annually. The 
combined company will serve 21 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra would also assume more than $4 billion in KN Energy debt  
as part of the deal, pushing its total value to about $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a breakout strategy to new regions of the country, from  
the Gulf Coast to Chicago, across the Plains to the Rockies and 
California,'' said Stephen Baum, vice chairman and chief operating 
officer at San Diego-based Sempra. ``We have a premier position in 
the gas delivery market and it transforms us from a regional 
utility to a national player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KN Energy is the nation's second-largest natural gas pipeline  
and storage company, and operates the largest pipeline in Chicago 
and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	KN Energy will not close its main office in Locoweed, Colo., but  
the companies expect to eliminate duplicate operations and jobs, 
resulting in a loss of about 300 jobs through layoffs and attrition 
and a savings of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra isn't alone in its plans to be a big player nation's  
energy industry. Virginia-based Dominion Resources Inc. announced 
Monday it was buying Consolidated Natural Gas for about $6 billion 
in stock. The merger will form a company serving 4 million 
customers in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Before deregulation, a lot of companies had no competition, or  
minimal competition,'' said Barry Liden, director of government 
relations for Texas-based Bustin &AMP; Co. ``In this new, competitive 
environment, companies are trying to find efficiencies for 
themselves and benefits for their shareholders. That happens by 
diversifying their interests and offerings, and that likely means 
more mergers to capture a bigger share of the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the proposed agreement, Sempra will acquire KN  
Energy for a fixed ratio of 1.115 shares of Sempra common stock, or 
$25 in cash, for each KN Energy share. That represents a premium of 
about 24 percent above the average closing price of KN Energy 
shares over the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	KN Energy shareholders will have the option of cash or stock,  
such that 70 percent of KN Energy shares are converted to Sempra, 
while 30 percent are sold for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of KN Energy rose 12 1/2 cents to $21.62 1/2 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Sempra fell 75 cents to $21.56 1/4, 
also on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Completion of the acquisition requires the approval of  
shareholders from both companies, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission and the state utility commissions of Colorado and 
Wyoming. The companies anticipate closing the deal in six to eight 
months.

<HEADLINE> Owners Catch No Arbitration Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even when baseball owners win in salary  
arbitration, they lose. 
</P>
<P>
	They won nine of 11 hearings, but the 62 players in arbitration  
this year averaged a record 169 percent salary increase, topped by 
a record 1,517 percent raise for Texas pitcher Rick Helling, 
according to a study by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling, who went 20-7 and tied for the AL lead in wins, went  
from a $216,000 salary last year to an average of $3.5 million 
under a $10.5 million, three-year contract with the Rangers. That 
topped the 1,511 percent raise Milwaukee outfielder Jeromy Burnitz 
got last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston closer Billy Wagner got the second-highest percentage  
raise this year, increasing 1,126 percent from $280,000 to 
$3,433,333 under a $10.3 million, three-year deal with the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall increase was up from a 150 percent average last year  
and broke the previous record of 154 percent, set in 1997. Salaries 
for those who filed rose from an average of $781,780 to an average 
of $2,099,790, breaking the previous record of $2,091,187, set in 
1994 before a 7 1/2-month strike. 
</P>
<P>
	While owners won most of the hearings, they lost their two  
biggest cases, getting beaten by pair of New York Yankees stars: 
shortstop Derek Jeter and closer Mariano Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	While owners have a 236-181 advantage in cases since arbitration  
began in 1974, they hate the process and repeatedly attempt to 
negotiate it out of existence because it forces small- and 
middle-market teams to match the salaries paid to young players by 
large-market rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Players with three to six years of major league service are  
eligible for arbitration along with about a dozen players with two 
to three years in the majors. After six seasons, a player becomes 
eligible for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a new effort this year by management's labor lawyers  
to push for better settlements by teams and it paid off. Of the 19 
players who avoided hearings by agreeing to one-year contracts, 12 
settled below the midpoint, seven settled at the midpoint and none 
settled above. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, there were eight settlements above the midpoint  
last year, seven at the midpoint and 22 below. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners also pushed for earlier settlements, with 24 of the 62  
players agreeing before the exchange of numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	But players were extremely aggressive in asking for large  
increases, which caused the record raises. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four players -- nearly three of four filing -- doubled their  
salaries, down from 49 last year, and 26 tripled, down from 29. But 
17 got fivefold raises, an increase of two, and 11 got sixfold 
raises, also an increase of two. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay left-hander Terrell Wade, on the disabled list for  
most of last season, got the smallest raise, a 12 percent increase 
from $222,500 to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven players agreed to multiyear contracts, down from 19 last  
year and 14 in 1997.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Levi Strauss will close 11 of its 22 plants in  
North America and lay off about 5,900 employees, or 30 percent of 
its work force in the United States and Canada, as the jeans maker 
struggles with slumping sales. The San Francisco-based company said 
it will shift production to plants overseas, which will enable it 
to spend more time and money on product design and marketing, two 
areas where it has been lagging in recent years.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive

Flight 73 in Karachi, Pakistan. The justices, without comment,

<HEADLINE> Magazine Lists Top 100 Racehorses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Man o' War, winner of 20 of his 21 career  
starts in 1919 and 1920, is the choice as Racehorse of the Century 
in a vote released Monday by the thoroughbred magazine The 
Blood-Horse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blood-Horse polled seven racing officials and journalists to  
compile its list of the top 100 racehorses of the 20th century, 
which will be featured in the magazine's Feb. 27 issue and a book 
to be released this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Second to Man o' War in the poll is 1973 Triple Crown winner  
Secretariat, followed by Citation, Kelso, Count Fleet, Dr. Fager, 
Native Dancer, Forego, Seattle Slew and Spectacular Bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Hammonds, managing editor of the The Blood-Horse, said Man  
o' War took first place on three ballots, while Secretariat earned 
three first-place votes and Citation one. 
</P>
<P>
	Man o' War took the top spot because he was listed second or  
third on each of the four ballots which did not pick him No. 1, 
Hammonds said. The experts varied more in their opinion of 
Secretariat, with one voter keeping him out of the top 10 entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people feel that because he didn't win all his races,  
because he got beat a few times,'' Secretariat was not as worthy, 
Hammonds said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel consisted of Howard Battle, racing secretary at  
Keeneland; Lenny Hale, vice president of the Maryland Jockey Club; 
Daily Racing Form columnist Jay Hovdey; Sports Illustrated senior 
writer William Nack; California senior steward Pete Pedersen; 
racing writer Jennie Rees of The (Louisville) Courier-Journal; and 
Gulfstream Park steward Tommy Trotter. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 192 horses received at least one vote in the  
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	The only horse currently racing to make the Blood-Horse's list  
is 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Silver Charm at No. 63. 
Skip Away, the recently retired 1998 Horse of the Year, is No. 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigar, the all-time leading North American money winner with  
just short of $10 million in earnings, is No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	All 11 Triple Crown winners made the list, from Sir Barton in  
1919 (No. 49) to Affirmed in 1978 (No. 12). 
</P>
<P>
	The only horse on the list never to race in the United States is  
Phar Lap of New Zealand (No. 22), who made his only North American 
start in Mexico.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Reach Steel Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia, facing the prospect of punitive  
tariffs on its steel shipments to the United States, agreed Monday 
to slash those shipments by 70 percent in return for continued 
access to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal with the United States, Russia will limit  
shipments of hot-rolled steel to levels that existed in 1996 and 
restrict shipments of 16 other types of steel to 1997 levels. That 
was before the global financial crisis triggered a surge in cheap 
imported steel into the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, struggling to deal with the  
political problems caused by a record-high trade deficit, said the 
deal would save American jobs and help the struggling Russian 
economy at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``These agreements deliver on the administration's commitment to  
respond vigorously to the surge in imports that has threatened the 
livelihoods of communities and workers around the nation,'' said 
Commerce Secretary William Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley acknowledged the administration was trying to strike a  
delicate balance between helping the U.S. industry and not shutting 
the door to all Russian steel at a time when the Russian economy is 
in a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a legitimate concern about taking Russia to its  
knees,'' Daley said, noting steel production accounts for 7 percent 
of Russia's total economic output. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. steel industry, its union and many of its  
supporters in Congress were quick to attack the agreement, saying 
it offered too little relief when a flood of imported steel is 
forcing production cutbacks, bankruptcies and thousands of layoffs 
at domestic steel plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement still allows too much steel to be imported at  
too low of a price,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, R-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry is pushing a bill in Congress that would  
impose worldwide quotas on the amount of steel that could be 
shipped into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure has attracted 167 co-sponsors, but the Clinton  
administration is opposed, arguing the approach would encourage 
protectionist retaliation and increase trade barriers around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia requested a negotiated settlement after the U.S. industry  
filed complaints charging Russia, Japan and Brazil with ``dumping'' 
steel in the United States at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department on Feb. 12 ruled against Japan and  
Brazil, announcing a preliminary determination for penalty duties 
as high as 80 percent on hot-rolled steel. That level of tariff 
would effectively block those two countries from the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, is now in a  
recession of its own because of the global financial turmoil. It 
asked the United States last week to begin negotiations on a 
``suspension agreement'' similar to the one Russia received Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But outside experts said such a deal would be harder to grant to  
Brazil because of the way U.S. law is written. The administration 
had more leeway to negotiate an agreement with Russia because it's 
classified as a non-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported last week that America's trade deficit  
surged by more than 50 percent last year to an all-time high of 
$168.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The global economic crisis has cut demand for U.S. exports while  
triggering cheaper imports into the country because of slumping 
demand in the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement with Russia, the annual quota for hot-rolled  
steel from that country was set at 750,000 metric tons with a floor 
put on the price this steel can be sold at, ranging from $255 to 
$280 per metric ton. Russia also agreed to an initial six-month 
moratorium on shipping any hot-rolled steel to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Russia agreed to separate quotas in 16 other steel  
product areas. Taken together, the quotas for hot-rolled and the 
other steel products will keep Russian shipments almost 70 percent 
below the levels reached in 1998 for the five years of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Commerce said it would not impose penalty tariffs on  
hot-rolled steel. Those could have ranged up to 218 percent.

hot-rolled steel. Those could have ranged up to 218 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pete Wilson Won't Seek Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Faced with a daunting fund-raising challenge  
and strong competition from Texas Gov. George W. Bush, former 
California Gov. Pete Wilson said Monday he has decided against 
running for president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reluctantly, I'm compelled to conclude that it is just not  
practical to pursue a candidacy for the Republican presidential 
nomination in 2000,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term governor and 1996 presidential candidate admitted  
the presidency is the only elective office he wants, but said it is 
too costly to enter the race at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Some candidates have spent several years laying the groundwork  
for their presidential bids, while Wilson said he has focused on 
his duties as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 65, was never considered a front-runner in 2000 and has  
barely registered on national polls. His decision bodes well for 
Republican candidates who are already courting California voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was in Ohio on Monday celebrating his father's 97th  
birthday and was not available for interviews. Instead he issued 
the statement that detailed his accomplishments as governor, his 
regret about not being able to run for president in 2000 and his 
plans for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson did not mention Bush in the statement, but Wilson press  
secretary Sean Walsh called the Texas governor the ``fresh 
interesting candidate on the national scene'' and said Bush's 
popularity was a strong factor in Wilson's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the son of the former president, has not announced he will  
run, but many Republican governors at the National Governors' 
Association meeting believe a bid by Bush is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Elizabeth Dole, publisher Steve Forbes and Ohio  
Congressman John Kasich also are considered leading Republican 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson abandoned his 1996 presidential bid after one month in  
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he learned in '96 just how big and complex this  
country is and how difficult it is to run for president,'' said 
Larry Thomas, a former Wilson press secretary.

<HEADLINE> Gardner May Start for Giants Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Last season, spring training was a time  
of concern and doubt for Mark Gardner. His wife had just undergone 
a liver transplant, and he felt uneasy about being so far away as 
she healed. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Lori Gardner is doing fine and her husband is the  
most likely candidate to be the San Francisco Giants' opening day 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the season opener were tomorrow, it would be Gardy  
probably,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``Over the course of 
his career, he's earned it. He's the veteran of the staff. Why not 
Mark?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner was signed as a free agent by the Giants days before the  
start of the 1996 season, when the Florida Marlins decided to send 
Gardner to the minors but gave him a chance to work out a deal with 
another club. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 12-7 for San Francisco that season, earning the opening  
day spot the following year. Gardner was 8-2 through mid-June and 
the Giants won the NL West in 1997, but the end of the season was 
torture for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori was ailing, and was shortly thereafter to be diagnosed with  
liver cancer. Mark was winless in his last six starts and did not 
pitch again after Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori, a former softball player who met Mark at Fresno State, had  
a successful transplant in the middle of last February. Mark showed 
up late for spring training, and wondered whether he was doing the 
right thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough at the beginning. The thing that was bothering me  
last year was thinking, `Should I be here or should I be there?''' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori insisted that Mark rejoin the team as soon as possible, and  
he opened the season as the No. 4 starter in the Giants' rotation. 
By the end of the season, Gardner was the team's best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner went 5-1 with a 2.97 ERA in August and September as the  
Giants forced a one-game playoff with the Chicago Cubs for the 
wild-card spot. He started that game, and was the loser in a 5-3 
defeat at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 13-6 in 1998, becoming one of only a dozen major  
leaguers that have won at least 12 games and had an ERA of lower 
than 4.50 in each of the last three seasons. He set career highs 
for wins, innings (212) and strikeouts (151). 
</P>
<P>
	And he earned the right to probably get another opening day  
start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's just more of an honor for what you've done the  
year before,'' Gardner said. ``I might be the guy that might give 
you a little solidification. I'm not an ace, I'm just going to be 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner signed a two-year contract with the Giants before this  
season, and came to training camp with a lot fewer distractions 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Lori and their two sons are with Mark in  
Scottsdale. Baker, referring to the street that runs past 
Scottsdale Stadium, said much of the credit for Gardner's strength 
should go to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was like a miracle on Osborn Road,'' Baker said. ``It was  
probably more amazing what she did, which affected what he did. 
What if she had wanted him to stay home? He's a strong dude. Both 
of them are strong.''

<HEADLINE> Minority Broadcasting Code Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The advertising and broadcasting industries  
should come up with a voluntary code designed to make sure that 
advertisers don't discriminate against radio stations owned by or 
geared to minorities, government officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard said the  
code would be based on a set of principles that include using 
accurate information about consumer purchasing practices, promoting 
fair competition and expanding opportunities for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``These principles are few in number but draw on the many values  
which we cherish as a nation,'' Kennard said in a speech prepared 
for a conference of the American Advertising Federation in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard's proposal was endorsed by Vice President Al Gore, who  
said in remarks being delivered by satellite: ``Diversity of voices 
and views is a pillar of our democracy. That is why we must ensure 
that our airwaves provide opportunities for all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge responds to a report issued by the FCC last month  
that advertisers often bypass or pay less money to minority-owned 
radio stations or stations targeting black or Hispanic listeners. 
Clinton administration and commission officials said it is intended 
to be a ``starting point'' for advertisers and broadcasters to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, written by the Civil Rights Forum on Communications  
Policy, a Washington-based advocacy group, recommended that 
industry adopt a code of conduct that requires decisions about 
buying ads to be based on market research. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers and broadcasters have been open to, but noncommittal  
about, developing such a code. The American Advertising Federation, 
however, is assembling a panel to examine the feasibility of a 
code. 
</P>
<P>
	In his prepared remarks, Gore called on advertisers and  
advertising agencies ``to make voluntary commitments demonstrating 
that they understand the value of diversity and the economic logic 
of serving minority consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also planned to announce the creation of an interagency  
working group that will examine advertising practice and their 
impact on minority broadcasters' and minority advertising agencies' 
ability to compete and thrive. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice and Commerce  
departments and the Small Business Administration will be part of 
the working group. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is likely to conduct additional research -- as Kennard  
has called for -- on why advertisers are bypassing minority radio 
stations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anecdotal data in the FCC's report suggested that, in some  
cases, the ad-buying process was guided by ethnic and racial 
stereotyping. But the report didn't pin down the reasons why some 
minority stations were being passed up by advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many factors, however, could be responsible, including audience  
demographics, ratings or whether the radio station is owned by a 
company operating many stations, the report acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Kennard took note of the wider economic effects  
of depriving minority-oriented stations of ad revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``To succeed on the Main Streets of tomorrow, Madison Avenue  
must recognize the reality of minority consumers and the power of 
minority-formatted stations in reaching them,'' he said. But he 
said listeners also suffer when they ``find themselves bypassed by 
some of our biggest companies, on the outside looking in to our 
national marketplace.''

<HEADLINE> EU Farmers Clash With Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Hurling potatoes, cobblestones and even  
uprooted trees, over 30,000 farmers rallied Monday in Brussels to 
demand that European Union agriculture ministers shield them from 
farm subsidy cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers from across the EU's 15 nations held their biggest  
demonstration in the Belgian capital in over a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	Police used tear gas, water cannons and batons to drive back  
groups of protesters who tried to force their way through the 
barbed-wire barricades. Fourteen protesters were arrested for 
wrecking cars and two police were lightly injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agriculture ministers are considering cuts of up to 30  
percent in guaranteed farm prices in order to pare down the 
European Union's $45.8 billion farm budget ahead of an EU summit in 
Bonn, Germany, next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm leaders insist the cuts would reduce farmers' incomes by as  
much as 20 percent, pushing many into bankruptcy and driving people 
away from the profession at an even faster rate. The number of 
farmers in Europe is already declining at 3 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in farming all my life. I want to make sure there is  
a future,'' said Ramon de Arcos, 48, who left his tomato and olive 
farm in western Spain to attend the march. ``Farming is the only 
thing we have in Extremadura.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers, many waving black flags, set off firecrackers, sirens  
and horns as they marched towards the EU building. A few protesters 
tore up cobblestones and even pulled out traffic signs and trees in 
their attempt to break through the police cordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We demand justice for farmers,'' said Luc Guyau, president of  
the COPA European farmers union, which organized the rally. 
``Whatever happens, we farmers must be guaranteed full compensation 
for income losses which we may suffer as a result of price cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The EU sells off farming,'' one banner read. ``Without  
farmers, no future,'' read many others. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm demonstrations have been held in France for several weeks,  
and over the weekend thousands of farmers marched through the 
Spanish capital of Madrid to protest likely cuts in farm subsidies. 
A small demonstration of Italian farmers was held in Luxembourg on 
Monday, after they were barred from coming to Brussels with their 
tractors. 
</P>
<P>
	France, the, EU's biggest agricultural producer, is a key  
defender of farmer's interests. French Agriculture Minister Jean 
Glaveny said Monday there will be no farm deal this week without an 
agreement to cut into other EU subsidy programs within the EU's 
$100 billion annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have complained of belt-tightening throughout the 1990s  
and strongly resisted the last EU subsidy reform in 1992. EU 
agriculture represents about 7 million full-time jobs but that 
number has been dwindling fast.

<HEADLINE> Clinic Receives Anthrax Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A Planned Parenthood clinic received a  
letter in the mail this morning with a powdery substance and a 
threat that it contained anthrax, an FBI spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no known injuries, but 24 people inside were  
quarantined and washed with bleach and soap as a precaution and 
three would likely be checked out at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe at this time that anyone is in any danger,''  
said FBI spokeswoman Bridgett Patton. However, hazardous material 
crews were at the scene as a precaution and the substance would be 
tested, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar letters were sent to clinics throughout the country last  
week. At least 14 letters claiming to contain anthrax were mailed 
to abortion clinics and Planned Parenthood centers across the 
nation and were postmarked in Lexington, Ky. Initial tests show 
that the threats were hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a rash of phony anthrax threats at clinics in  
several states last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known whether the letter received in the  
Kansas City clinic also came from Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax mostly affects farm animals, but its germs, when inhaled  
by humans, can lead to death if not treated early with antibiotics.

<HEADLINE> China Debts Hit Hong Kong Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Banking giant HSBC Holdings PLC said Monday  
that its profits plunged 21 percent last year because of the Asian 
crisis and bad loans in mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC, which is based in London but controls the leading bank in  
Hong Kong, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., earned $4.32 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC increased its provisions for bad loans by $1.63 billion to  
$2.64 billion. The bank would not say how much of the bad debt was 
based in China, where seriously troubled investment trusts have 
caused massive problems for Hong Kong bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC's affiliate, Hang Seng Bank Ltd., said its profits fell by  
27.5 percent to $6.79 billion, as it set aside $2.48 billion for 
bad loans, up from provisions of $635 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Hang Seng Bank said it earned $9.36 billion in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Many banks in Hong Kong have been taking big provisions to cover  
their losses at a collapsed Chinese investment trust, the Guangdong 
International Trust and Investment Corp., or Gitic, which was 
declared bankrupt last month. Emerging problems at other Chinese 
trusts and companies have raised more concerns.

<HEADLINE> Vizquel Shows Up to Indians Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- He never asked for a trade. He never  
said he wouldn't report to training camp. He's a happy camper. 
Let's play ball. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the message from Omar Vizquel on Monday as he arrived  
at the Cleveland Indians training camp following an offseason in 
which the six-time Gold Glove shortstop had voiced unhappiness with 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to put all that behind me,'' Vizquel said. ``Nobody  
put a gun to my head to sign the contract. My situation is good 
here. I want to be a Cleveland Indian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This winter, Vizquel lobbied the Tribe front office for an  
extension of the contract he signed after the 1995 season. The deal 
has three years remaining at $3 million per year, plus a $3 million 
option for 2002. But Indians officials refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel had said asking for a trade or refusing to report to  
training camp were both options. In the end, he reported to camp on 
time and said Monday he is willing to live with the terms of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel said his situation, which has been the talk of Cleveland  
fans during in an offseason in which the Indians signed Gold Glove 
second baseman Roberto Alomar, ``was blown out of proportion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As an employee of the Cleveland Indians, I have the right to  
go in and ask (general manager) John Hart about my contract. I did 
that,'' Vizquel said. ``I walked into his office friendly and I 
walked out friendly. We couldn't find an answer to it now, so for 
now the talks are done. I am not going to talk about it anymore 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart left the door open for future discussions with Vizquel.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a closed issue,'' Hart said. ``We'd like Omar to  
retire as a Cleveland Indian. It's his right to ask for more years 
in his contract, but that doesn't mean we have to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel said he was not asking for a renegotiation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't trying to change the deal. I just wanted to add some  
years to it,'' he said. ``It was not a renegotiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indians catcher Sandy Alomar has said Vizquel should honor the  
contract, and that if Indians officials renegotiated, it would open 
the door for other players to seek new deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel and Alomar met with manager Mike Hargrove on Monday to  
defuse any potential hard feelings between the two players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is straight between us,'' Vizquel said. ``I've been  
good friends with Sandy for a long time, but the last thing you 
want to hear from a friend is him saying something that was not a 
benefit to you. My situation was none of Sandy's business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar also said he and Vizquel have cleared the air between  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing against Omar,'' Alomar said. ``If he was  
offended by my comments, I apologize. I am not upset with him, and 
I don't think he is upset with me.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Military Pay Raises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate pressed ahead Monday with  
politically popular legislation that would give the military a 4.8 
percent across-the-board pay raise next Jan. 1, despite a plea from 
the Clinton administration that Congress first find the money to 
pay for the increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is the first major piece of legislation considered by  
the Senate this year, and GOP leaders said they wanted to send an 
important message to men and women in the Armed Services -- 
particularly in light of a possible new military deployment in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed a 4.4 percent military pay raise.  
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to senators as debate began on the Senate floor,  
Defense Secretary William Cohen said he was concerned that the 
legislation, while well-meaning, could end up ``raising hopes that 
cannot be fulfilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be counterproductive,'' Cohen wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	If enacted, the pay raise would be the largest for the military  
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also provide more generous retirement and  
GI Bill educational benefits. The administration claims the measure 
is $7 billion more expensive over the next five years than the 
$36.5 billion benefit increase package proposed by Clinton in his 
fiscal year 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen cautioned that, with no clear indication of where the  
extra money might come from, meeting the ``unfunded requirement'' 
could mean cuts in other essential military programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee, described the defense secretary's concerns as 
``constructive criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, we're going to forge ahead,'' Warner said.  
``Even if this bill is expensive, the alternative is 
unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation appeared to have wide support in both parties  
and was expected to win Senate approval later this week. However, 
several Democrats echoed the administration's concerns over the 
pricetag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little consideration seems to have been given to how we will  
pay for this. There could be serious consequences,'' said Sen. Carl 
Levin of Michigan, the committee's senior Democrat. He said the 
measure could become ``a promise to the troops that may or may not 
be possible to redeem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., a sponsor of the bill, told the Senate  
that while he was glad the it had taken up the bill, ``My concern 
is that we may be moving too quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has predicted the  
Senate would pass the ``long overdue'' pay raise within a few 
weeks. His spokesman, John Czwartacki, said the possibility that 
U.S. troops would soon be on their way to Kosovo provided even more 
impetus for fast passage of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was deliberately made first on the Senate calendar  
after the impeachment trial of Clinton, Czwartacki said. ``We're 
back in the mode where senators can be senators,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's plan calls for a 4.4 percent  
across-the-board military pay raise in 2000 and annual raises of 
3.9 percent over the following five years. The Senate bill gives a 
4.8 percent increase starting Jan. 1, then would give the military 
an additional raise in each succeeding year of 0.5 percentage 
points above the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also allow military personnel to retire at 50  
percent pay after 20 years service -- a plan that was in effect 
prior to 1986. Or, they could accept a $30,000 cash bonus and 
remain in the current retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also give service members the option of  
contributing up to 5 percent of their basic pay to a 401(k) type 
savings account, to which the services could, under certain 
circumstances, make matching contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon contends that military personnel are paid as much  
as 13.5 percent less than civilian personnel with comparable jobs 
in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the independent Center for Strategic and Budgetary  
Assessments, in a report on the measure, suggested this claim was 
somewhat misleading. ``One problem is the overall private-sector 
workforce differs greatly from the military's workforce in terms of 
education, age, sex and other factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It cited a 1994 RAND study based on the 1992 workforce that  
``found that when compared to changes in pay for a subset of the 
civilian workforce that closely resembles the military ... there 
essentially no pay gap, at least in 1992.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Rep. Watts Does Ad for NRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican Conference Chairman J.C.  
Watts is appearing in a Time magazine ad as a spokesman for the 
National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, the fourth ranking Republican in the House, is the second  
Oklahoma Republican lawmaker to appear in an NRA ad. Rep. Steve 
Largent was featured in an advertisement last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Second Amendment is very clear that all Americans have the  
right to bear arms for whatever lawful purpose they choose,'' Watts 
said in the ad. ``I grew up with a healthy respect for guns as a 
way of life -- as American as mom, football and apple pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the lawmaker supported the NRA and voted to repeal a  
ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Pryor, an aide to Watts, said he did the endorsement at the  
request of an Oklahoma City advertising executive. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the advocacy group, Handgun Control, said  
Watts' support of the NRA is not surprising since Oklahoma 
lawmakers are strong supporters of gun owners' rights. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Rockies Comfortable With New Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Golf clubs are allowed on the baggage  
carousel and Armani suits are not required on road trips. Welcome 
to the new rules under Colorado Rockies manager Jim Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I normally don't have too many rules,'' Leyland said. ``The  
more you've got, the more you break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In six years under manager Don Baylor, coats and ties were  
mandatory on Colorado's charter plane. Golfing was allowed on the 
road but golf clubs were not. Spring workouts started by 
mid-morning and finished well after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, the Rockies are able to schedule afternoon tee times  
at posh resort courses because they are typically finished by noon 
following 2 1/2-hour workouts efficiently coordinated by third-base 
coach Rich Donnelly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody just feels comfortable,'' said infielder  
Kurt Abbott, who played for Leyland when the Florida Marlins won 
the World Series in 1997. ``Everybody knows what they have to do. 
It's about baseball, about doing things right. It's not about 
having to dress up or looking good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some players trade their three-piece suits for polo shirts  
from the Greg Norman collection, don't expect the Rockies to show 
up at a New York hotel looking like a leftover from a Pearl Jam 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	In giving his players some leeway, Leyland is trusting they will  
police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be neat,'' he said. ``I basically let the players  
make the rule. You can wear a nice pair of jeans, but if guys start 
wearing jeans with holes in them, we can wear a suit and tie. We 
can wear tuxedos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Baylor, the Rockies were allowed to have mustaches and a  
well-kept goatee. That policy will not change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my team to act like professionals and I want them to be  
disciplined, but I don't believe telling a grown man he can't have 
a mustache is a form of discipline,'' Leyland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The longer leash can be attributed to Leyland's resume, which  
includes 13 years as a major league manager, a World Series ring 
and three straight NL East pennants with the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Rockies were born in 1993, everything was a learning  
experience, and the owners had more input into the team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like with a family,'' Rockies owner Jerry  
McMorris said. ``It's always easier to loosen the reins than 
tighten the reins. ... We're changing with the times and the new 
manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Leyland's standards stem from common sense. The shorter  
workouts prevent players from getting bored shagging fly balls, and 
the dress code keeps them comfortable on cross-country charter 
flights that sometimes land at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's going to see us?'' relief pitcher Chuck McElroy said.  
``You don't want to spill soda or anything on an $1,100 suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules are sure to be a hit with Colorado's more  
flamboyant personalities such as outfielder Dante Bichette -- who 
showed up with his hair dyed black and Elvis sideburns last season 
-- and relief pitcher Curtis Leskanic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might have to have a dress code with me,'' Leskanic said,  
``otherwise I'll show up looking like I'm playing in the New York 
Penal League. Seriously though, it's just a matter of not doing 
anything stupid.''

<HEADLINE> Darlington Winners Teach Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Two of Darlington Raceway's all-time  
winners were on hand to teach some of the younger NASCAR drivers 
how to get around the sport's oldest superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	David Pearson and Bobby Allison, both NASCAR Hall of Fame  
drivers with 15 Darlington victories between them, were at the 
track tutoring drivers Buckshot Jones, Dan Pardus and Busch Series 
rookie Jimmy Kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Jimmy's first time here, and at this place you've got  
to take any help you can get,'' said Allison, who won five times at 
the 1.366-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison is a consultant to Kitchens' team and watched the rookie  
scrape the outside wall a couple of times on his first laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison said Kitchens and the others have to learn not to think  
you can come out and defeat Darlington. ``If you have that 
attitude, it will beat you,'' Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearson holds the track's Winston Cup mark with 10 victories and  
is one of the first called on by young drivers who want to learn to 
succeed at Darlington. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearson helped Jones, now a Winston Cup rookie, a few years ago  
when Jones first started the Busch Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Winston Cup is a different ballgame,'' Pearson said.  
``Darlington is different from any track they will ever drive on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the track Monday were Pearson's son, Larry, who won a  
Busch race here in 1995, Wayne Grubb, Bobby Hamilton and his son, 
Bobby Hamilton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones led testing with a top lap of 163.647 mph, followed by  
Pardus at 163.484 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers will continue testing this week in preparation for the  
TranSouth 400 on March 21. The Busch Series Diamond Hill Plywood 
200 is set for March 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying for both races is March 19.

<HEADLINE> Dominion Resources To Buy Gas Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Dominion Resources Inc. will buy  
Consolidated Natural Gas in a $6.0 billion stock deal that will 
create a utility giant with nearly 4 million customers and $8.8 
billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, announced Monday, will create the nation's  
fourth-largest gas and electric utility and gives Dominion 
Resources the size to remain competitive in an increasingly 
deregulated market. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal approved Sunday by both companies' boards of  
directors, Dominion Resources would buy all shares of 
Pittsburgh-based CNG, one of the nation's largest producers, 
transporters, distributors and retail marketers of natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	When the deal was announced, it was worth $6.3 billion. However,  
investors sent both stocks falling. Consolidated closed down $1.06 1/4 
to $55.18 3/4, while Dominion Resources fell $2.25 to $40, both in 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is strategically wise for Dominion Resources because it  
puts the company further into oil and gas exploration and 
production, said Thomas Hamlin, an analyst with First Union Capital 
in Richmond. It also gives Richmond-based Dominion Resources more 
retail customers and puts the company in more markets, Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very good move, a necessary move,'' Hamlin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dominion has derived nearly all its earnings from its Virginia  
Power unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger also is consistent with Dominion Resources' goals and  
the growing trend that unites electric generating companies with 
pipeline companies, Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh-based CNG supplies natural gas to 1.9 million  
customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia through 
its four distribution companies: East Ohio Gas Co., People's 
Natural Gas Co., Hope Gas Co. and Virginia Natural Gas. It also 
owns 7,600 miles of gas pipelines in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, 
Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a natural fit for our shareholders, customers and  
employees,'' said George A. Davidson Jr., chairman and chief 
executive officer of CNG. ``It's also important to note that DRI 
and CNG have similar corporate cultures, strategies and management 
styles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will be named Dominion Resources and have  
its headquarters in Richmond. Thomas E. Capps, Dominion Resources' 
chairman, president and chief executive, will serve as president 
and chief executive officer of the combined company. Davidson will 
serve as chairman until his previously announced retirement in 
August 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It unites two of the most respected names in electricity and  
natural gas and provides us the critical mass needed for today's 
dynamic energy sector,'' Capps said. ``We are creating a formidable 
platform for growth in a region that is home to 40 percent of the 
nation's demand for energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger must still be approved by shareholders of both  
companies as well as federal and state regulators.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Members Held in Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying he was fed up with lies and delays, a  
federal judge held two Clinton Cabinet secretaries in contempt of 
court Monday in a dispute over $500 million in Indian trust funds. 
The judge said he had ``never seen more egregious misconduct'' by 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin must accept blame for years of bureaucratic foot dragging and 
``outright false statements'' concerning access to documents in a 
lawsuit on the trust funds, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs was supposed to turn over  
statements, checks and other documents on accounts held by five 
Indians who are the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the 
Interior and Treasury departments. The lawsuit alleges 
mismanagement of 300,000 Indian accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth ordered Babbitt, Rubin and Assistant Interior Secretary  
Kevin Gover to pay legal fees and other expenses that resulted from 
delays in complying with a November 1996 order to come up with the 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cabinet heads are frequently named as defendants in civil  
suits against the government, Lamberth's ruling is unusual in 
holding top officials responsible. The money would come from the 
agencies, not the men themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, a federal judge cited Attorney General Griffin Bell for  
contempt for refusing to turn over FBI files to the Socialist 
Workers Party. And in 1984, a judge held William Ruckelshaus, then 
the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, in contempt in a 
dispute over emissions standards for nuclear facilities. The EPA 
was not yet a Cabinet-level agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's harshly worded ruling took special aim at Babbitt  
and at Justice Department lawyers in the fight over access to 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government here did not just stub its toe,''  
Lamberth wrote. ``It abused the rights of the plaintiffs to obtain 
these trust documents, and it engaged in a shocking pattern of 
deception of the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the beginning of justice for victims who have been for  
years abused,'' said Eloise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet tribe 
in Montana and one of the account holders suing the government. 
``This is money that belongs to people, the majority of them very 
poor people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few documents have appeared despite repeated meetings  
between lawyers and the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Lamberth said a new, court-appointed administrator  
will ensure the government complies from now on. The judge also 
warned he may impose fines or other punitive damages if matters 
don't improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court is deeply disappointed that any litigant would fail  
to obey orders for production of documents, and then conceal and 
cover up that disobedience with outright false statements that the 
court then relied upon,'' the judge wrote. ``But when that litigant 
is the federal government, the misconduct is even more troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department had no immediate reaction to the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department issued a statement saying correcting  
decades-long problems with management of the Indian trust funds was 
one of Babbitt's ``highest priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth noted Babbitt's recent decision to remove a key  
official responsible for handing over the documents, but he said 
the secretary did not go nearly far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's ``inattention to detail and wholesale delegation of  
authority to individuals who have not served his -- or the 
government's -- interest, may cause him future problems with this 
court if the government misconduct continues,'' the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth said he regretted that Rubin became enmeshed in the  
``fiasco'' and suffered the tarnish of a civil contempt citation as 
a result. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is clear is that he has totally delegated his  
responsibility to others and they have miserably failed to comply 
with this court's orders,'' Lamberth wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is related to a long attempt to clean up $3 billion  
in Indian trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds include the 300,000 accounts held by individual  
Indians and an additional 1,600 tribal accounts worth $2.5 billion. 
The money includes lease revenue, royalties and court settlements.

<HEADLINE> Blues Trade Kenady to Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues completed a recent  
transaction with the Rangers on Monday by sending forward Chris 
Kenady to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 13, the Blues acquired Jeff Finley and Geoff Smith from  
the Rangers for future considerations. The trade of Kenady 
completed the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenady, a 6-foot-2, 210-pound right wing, was the eighth choice  
of the Blues (175th overall) in the 1991 NHL entry draft. In five 
games with the Blues last season, Kenady recorded two assists. He 
has split this season between Long Beach and Utah of the IHL and 
has eight goals and 12 assists in 54 games.

<HEADLINE> Freestyle Skier Moran Hurt in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Jim Moran, a member of the 1998 U.S. Olympic  
freestyle ski team, was in critical condition Monday with a serious 
head injury after crashing in a weekend competition at Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been on a respirator since admission to the facility,''  
Swedish Medical Center spokeswoman Jessica Anderson said. ``He is 
still in critical condition and he has a severe head injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran, 26, landed face first following an aerial spin Saturday  
in the U.S. Freeskiing Open. He was airlifted to Swedish in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital authorities on Monday said Moran was surrounded by  
family members. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran left the U.S. team after finishing 23rd in the moguls  
competition in the Nagano Olympics. He skied to two World Cup 
moguls victories, a 1993 event in Breckenridge and a 1996 
competition in Altenmarkt, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally from Stowe, Vt., he recently moved to Park City,  
Utah.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Back on Top in Women's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Purdue replaced Tennessee as the No. 1 team in The Associated  
Press women's basketball poll for the second time this season, 
moving to the top Monday with just two weeks of voting to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's 72-69 loss at LSU produced a flip-flop in the top  
two places. Purdue (25-1) received 38 of 41 first-place votes and 
1,021 points from a national media panel. Tennessee (25-2) slipped 
to second with one first-place vote and 973 points. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time this season the lead has changed hands.  
The poll has not had that many changes at No. 1 since there were 
four in the 1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became No. 1 for the first time in school history when it  
bumped Tennessee in the second poll of the season. That happened 
after Purdue's 78-68 victory over the Lady Vols, who had led the 
preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Boilermakers lasted only one week on top. They lost at  
Stanford by one point and were replaced by Connecticut, which 
lasted seven weeks at No. 1 before giving way to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I said in November, it's a tremendous honor to be ranked  
No. 1 and it's a real tribute to the commitment by our 16 
players,'' Purdue coach Carolyn Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the ranking is not going to help us score any points or  
come up with any steals,'' she said. ``Our focus is on the Big Ten 
tournament, where everyone is 0-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue gained the No. 1 ranking after a close call over the  
weekend. The Boilermakers needed Stephanie White-McCarty's two free 
throws with two seconds left to beat lowly Minnesota 63-61 on 
Friday night. Purdue then defeated Northwestern to finish 16-0 in 
the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, which was No. 1 for six weeks, had routed Memphis by  
74 points and Vanderbilt by 36 before stumbling at LSU, the Lady 
Vols' first loss to a Southeastern Conference team since the 1997 
league tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other change in the Top 10 was a switch in positions by  
No. 9 Virginia Tech and No. 10 Notre Dame. There were few big 
changes in the rest of the list expect for LSU's jump from 23rd to 
17th. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech (22-2) held at No. 3 with one first-place vote  
and 951 points, while No. 4 Colorado State (27-1) received its 
first-ever vote for No. 1 and had 893 points. Old Dominion was 
fifth, followed by Connecticut, Rutgers, Duke, Virginia Tech and 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech remained 11th, UCLA climbed one spot to 12th and  
North Carolina slipped one place to 13th after losing to Duke. Then 
it was Georgia, Penn State, Clemson and LSU, followed by Oregon, 
Virginia and Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five were UC Santa Barbara, Kansas, Auburn, Alabama  
and Florida International. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU's move of six places was the biggest jump in the poll. The  
biggest drop was just two places -- by Clemson (14th to 16th), 
Virginia (17th to 19th) and Florida International (23rd to 25th). 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson fell despite beating Wake Forest in its only game and  
Virginia dropped after winning twice. Florida International lost to 
Western Kentucky in its only game of the week.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Rookie Sheds Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- George Karl planned to pick his spots for  
rookie Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor. 
</P>
<P>
	That spot is now in the Milwaukee Bucks' starting lineup.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks' lack of an inside scoring threat caught up with them,  
so Karl replaced Ervin Johnson in the starting lineup with Traylor, 
the sixth pick in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his line against Indiana on Saturday was unspectacular  
-- four points, four rebounds in 13 minutes -- it was a glimpse of 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserves to play more and I'm having trouble finding him in  
the rotation in the second unit,'' Karl said. ``I talked to Ervin 
and he was comfortable coming off the bench. So we went with it. 
I'd say right now this is probably how we'll go. It allows us to 
play bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is ironic, because Traylor is having an immediate impact  
in the NBA largely because he's smaller now than he was a year ago 
at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Traylor got his nickname ``Tractor'' in high school for his  
girth. He ballooned to more than 330 pounds in college, but after 
declaring for the NBA draft following his junior year, he cut out 
fried foods, starting jogging and shed 46 pounds from his 6-foot-7 1/2 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
	He's still big and strong at 284 pounds, only now he's quick,  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, I couldn't even tell you when the last time was that I  
was this small,'' Traylor said. ``But I feel real good, been 
getting up and down the court real fast, which was something you 
have to be able to do in coach Karl's system. So, being in shape is 
probably the best thing I did to give me an opportunity to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the lockout dragging on, he found a piece of him wishing  
he'd stayed in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little piece? It was probably a big piece of me,'' Traylor  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Karl is thrilled that Traylor decided to declare for the  
draft a year early. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's by far the best rookie I've ever coached and it will be  
real interesting to see how he does against the big boys,'' Karl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Traylor ever had a chip on his shoulder, he shed that,  
too, Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many of your young players today come in and say, `I'm  
good, now play me.' This kid wants to be good. I think he knows he 
isn't yet. This kid's come in and has shown he wants to be good and 
he's going to earn it the right way by working harder and listening 
and being coachable. And that's refreshing,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl, however, isn't shy about saying Traylor will be an  
All-Star one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming from a coach like George Karl who's coached a lot of  
All-Stars, I mean, that's something that's good for my 
confidence,'' Traylor said. ``I have to keep working hard to make 
his thoughts and my thoughts, which are the same as his, come 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traylor's circumference may be smaller but his big dreams  
persist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a guy who's not just going to be an everyday guy.  
I want to be ... a household name,'' he said. ``I want people to 
say, `Robert Traylor's coming to town to play basketball.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	He's off to a fine start.

<HEADLINE> Ichiro Suzuki at Seattle's Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners have found the player  
to wear Randy Johnson's old No. 51 -- Ichiro Suzuki, a five-time 
batting champion from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki, 25, will take part in the Mariners' first full workout  
for pitchers and position players Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki will be joined at the Mariners' spring training by two  
other players from the Japanese Pacific League, pitchers Nobuyuki 
Hoshino and Nobuyuki Ebisu. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners announced earlier that the trio would join the team  
for the first two weeks of spring training, and also be eligible to 
participate in several Seattle exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese translations have been posted on doorways at the  
Mariners' complex for signs such as ``Authorized Personnel Only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 media members from Japan will report on the Japanese  
players and countryman Mac Suzuki, a reliever in the Seattle 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be prepared for the media circus as well as we  
can,'' manager Lou Piniella said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners and the Orix Blue Wave, based in Seattle's sister  
city of Kobe, entered into a working agreement in February 1998. 
The agreement includes the exchange of players, coaches and front 
office staff, with a goal of playing exhibition games in each 
other's countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Piniella and pitching coach Stan Williams have drawn up a spring  
training strategy for the team's pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Piniella said the Mariners will pitch left-hander Jeff Fassero  
one inning in his first spring training start. He had bone chips 
removed from his left elbow in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're being cautious early on with all the starters,''  
Piniella said. ``Our plan is to give starters six to seven 
appearances, have them pitch a total of about 27 innings, with the 
last appearance going six or seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will throw one day, rest the next, throw 10 to 12 minutes  
the day after, rest the next and then pitch again. We've gotten 
away from that in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Stars Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr. were not among the  
Mariners' position players who took physicals Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey is already in the Phoenix area. Rodriguez will arrive  
Tuesday in time for the first workout, which is scheduled to last 
3 1/2 hours.

<HEADLINE> Javelin Change Wipes Out Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Jackie Joyner-Kersee will lose her  
heptathlon world record at the end of the year because of a design 
change to the javelin. 
</P>
<P>
	The world governing body of track and field said Monday that a  
new javelin with a slightly different center of gravity -- allowing 
it to land more frequently on its tip -- will go into use beginning 
April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee set the world record of 7,291 points at the 1988  
Seoul Olympics. The javelin is one of the seven events in the 
heptathlon. 
</P>
<P>
	The new world record will go into the books Jan. 1, 2000, and  
will come from the best performance with the new javelin, which 
will not go as far as the old implement. 
</P>
<P>
	The current women's javelin record of 262 feet 5 inches, set by  
Petra Felke of East Germany on Sept. 9, 1988, also will be erased. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF made a similar change to the men's javelin in 1986,  
wiping out Uwe Hohn's throw of 343-10. However, Daley Thompson's 
decathlon record of 8,847 points -- set with the same javelin -- was 
allowed to stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, there will be new records,'' said Giorgio Reineri,  
an IAAF spokesman. ``It is not a political decision, it's a 
technical decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee was not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee, who retired last year, won two Olympic gold  
medals in the heptathlon and one in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the IAAF elected to keep Thompson's decathlon record,  
Reineri said, ``I think they (the technical committee of the IAAF) 
believed what was done 13 years ago was a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the marks of Joyner-Kersee and Felke would be noted  
in IAAF records ``as coming under different conditions.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans At 23-Year Low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean futures tumbled to 23-year lows on the Chicago Board of  
Trade Monday after the Agriculture Department's chief economist 
predicted crop prices could fall to $4 a bushel later this year. 
Grain futures also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell after the USDA's Keith Collins told a farm outlook  
conference he sees no end to the decline in commodity prices during 
1999, largely because economic troubles in Asia have caused U.S. 
exports to fall sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for soybeans have fallen to new lows each day for more  
than a week amid indications world production will continue to 
increase even as there are few takers for the commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. farmers last year harvested a record large crop, and  
analysts predict they will plant record acreage this year because 
of farm programs that pay more for soybeans than other crops. 
Further exacerbating the problem are expectations for a near-record 
Brazilian crop and a large crop from Argentina, which are likely to 
keep competition strong throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
	South American soybeans account for a third of the world's  
supply, and Brazil, the biggest producer in the continent, is the 
world's second-largest grower behind the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins predicted farm income would drop this year by $3 billion  
to $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for March delivery fell 4 1/4 cents to $4.74 a bushel.  
Prices earlier in the session fell to $4.64 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
after the cost of borrowing the metal -- an indicator of demand -- 
fell for the first time in several days. The decline prompted 
speculation that consuming countries are not in as dire need of the 
metal as originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures rose sharply last week after borrowing, or lease,  
rates soared. That led to speculation that demand for the metal for 
such uses as photography, electronics and jewelry-making could be 
on the rise for the first time in months. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants also noted exchange warehouse inventories  
have been tight for more than a year, leaving those short of the 
metal in a precarious position should a large consuming country 
like India suddenly experience a jump in demand. 
</P>
<P>
	March silver fell 14 cents to $5.46 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures soared in the nearby contract month on the Board  
of Trade of the City of New York as textile mills scrambled to find 
high-quality supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad weather during the last growing season helped produce one of  
the smallest crops in recent history and seriously affected the 
quality of that which could be harvested. Still, the outlook for 
cotton has been poor because of weak world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA in its farm outlook said exports will remain at their  
second-lowest in 20 years, while cheaper Asian imports are starting 
to flood U.S. shores. 
</P>
<P>
	March cotton rose 2.59 cents to 62.68 a pound, while the May  
contract fell 0.04 cent to 57.39 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Paul Anka: Hard Rockers Keep Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Paul Anka puts himself in the same class  
with Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen idol of the '50s and early '60s said the hard rockers  
have staying power -- just like him. 
</P>
<P>
	Other rockers stress ``form over content,'' the 57-year-old Anka  
said Sunday. ``They are actually manufactured entertainment groups. 
They are a product of technology. What you are listening to is 
technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not Aerosmoth, he said, and certainly not himself. He and  
the '70s band have sustained their appeal by sticking to their 
roots and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stay true to what I do,'' Anka said. ``I have never gotten  
into current fads. If you keep your integrity and try to keep your 
performance level up, you have a chance to keep your audience -- if 
they think you are human and not some passing fad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anka, who is in demand in Las Vegas, wrote ``Diana,'' ``Crazy  
Love,'' ``Put Your Head on My Shoulder'' and ``Puppy Love'' -- all 
before he was 18.

<HEADLINE> AmWest Halts United Merger Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- America West Holdings Corp., the subject of  
recent buyout and merger talks, is not for sale, says the company's 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	William Franke's announcement on Monday that the company ended  
talks with interested parties was met by cheering workers at the 
company's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expressions of interest were too conditional,'' he said  
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL Corp., which controls the nation's largest airline, United,  
and America West had been talking for several weeks about a deal 
for the ninth-largest airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Franke said the board had ``unanimously concluded that America  
West shareholders, employees and the communities we serve will be 
better served by a growing, profitable and independent company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franke added that ``we are confident about the company's future  
as an independent airline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to acknowledge that United Airlines had made an offer  
to buy the company. But he told reporters later that conditions of 
the deal with a possible suitor -- including antitrust worries -- 
were viewed as ``difficult and unlikely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	In January, America West said it had been contacted by several  
airlines about a possible deal, but did not provide additional 
details. In a separate statement, UAL acknowledged it had 
approached America West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based United, which has refused to  
comment on a report last week that a cash offer was made to America 
West, is disappointed by America West's decision to end 
discussions, said spokeswoman Kristina Price. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said a United-America West merger would have faced  
regulatory hurdles because of United's major presence in the 
western United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Boyd, a Colorado-based airline consultant, said that a  
buyout by United would have been bad for travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``United just needed (America West) for the airplanes,'' Boyd  
said. ``They need Phoenix like Bill Clinton needs another intern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America West's market value is about $1 billion, and Franke said  
recently that the biggest shareholder in the Phoenix-based carrier 
would agree to a buyout only if all the company's shares are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Pacific Group Inc. holds a 49 percent stake in America  
West. Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, owns 8.3 
percent and has first rights to purchase TPG's shares for an 
America West acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Franke said America West did not solicit the recent proposal.  
But he added that the board was legally obligated to consider any 
offers, and would continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one came along that made sense, of course, we would  
consider it. That's our obligation to our shareholders,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	America West still must resolve a sticky labor issue with its  
2,400 flight attendants, who are in a 30-day countdown toward a 
strike. The flight attendants have been working without a contract 
since voting to unionize in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	They can legally strike at midnight EST on March 20.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Arsonist Arrested in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- A man was arrested on arson charges in  
connection with a fire that destroyed more than a dozen businesses 
including offices of the local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Sgt. John Rodley said George Aldrich of Waltham was  
arrested Sunday. Rodley would not elaborate on Aldrich's alleged 
role in setting the fire, except to say tips from other people led 
to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saturday morning fire gutted the three-story brick building  
that housed The News Tribune, a 7,500-circulation newspaper that 
publishes afternoons Monday through Friday, as well as a military 
recruiting office, an instrument repair shop, and several other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltham Fire Chief Thomas Keough said the three-alarm blaze  
started in the basement. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The News Tribune continued normal publication, with a front page  
headline today reading, ``Out of the Ashes.'' Its editors and 
reporters were relocated to Needham at the central offices of 
parent company Community Newspaper Co., the Fidelity-owned 
newspaper group that publishes papers in dozens of Massachusetts 
communities. The paper is printed in Framingham. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of actually putting out the paper, we're not going to  
miss a beat,'' editor Jon Paul Potts said. But, he said, 
``psychologically, it's a big blow to the paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You cover four or five fires a day when you're in this line of  
work and you never think you're going to be on the other side,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Rise in Quiet Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose in quiet trading Monday ahead  
of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/32  
point, or $4.69 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.35 percent from 5.38 percent late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was restrained before Greenspan's regular testimony on  
the economy, which was set to begin Tuesday before the Senate 
Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But with no signs of inflation reviving, despite a remarkably  
resilient economy, there were expectations that Greenspan would not 
roil financial markets by signaling any move to cool off the 
economy by raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up between 3/32 point and 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities 
were up 1/4 point to 1/2 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.55 
points to 1,296.98 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.62 percent as the  
discount rose 0.07 percentage point to 4.51 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.61 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.45 percent. One-year yields were 4.71 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.01 percentage point from late Friday to 4.50 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.81 percent from 4.63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 125 7/32 from 125 1/8. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.14 percent from 5.15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hare Krishna Solicitations Curtailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to let Hare  
Krishnas solicit donations or sell religious literature at Miami 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The court rejected an appeal that argued such restrictions  
violate free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's action, taken without comment, is not a decision and  
sets no national precedent. But the denial of review lets stand a 
ruling that applies to all airports in three Southern states -- 
Florida, Alabama and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the International Society of Krishna Consciousness  
had urged the justices to use the Miami case to end such 
restrictions at airports that these days closely resemble shopping 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court ruled in 1992 that airports  
nationwide may prohibit groups from soliciting donations in 
terminals but must allow distribution of free literature. That 
ruling was sparked by a challenge to restrictions imposed on Hare 
Krishnas at New York City's three major airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 ruling, reached by a 5-4 vote, said an airport terminal  
is not a traditional ``public forum'' as is a city street or park 
where free-speech rights enjoy enhanced protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal acted on today asked the justices to reconsider the  
1992 decision ``in light of recent significant developments in the 
airport industry involving the increased commercialization of 
airport terminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said Miami's airport has been transformed ``into a  
prominent shopping center'' where, according to the airport's own 
statistics, half of all visitors stay at least two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
upheld the Miami airport's restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court noted that the 1992 Supreme Court decision did  
not specifically address restrictions on the sale of literature, 
but said, ``The same problems that justify a governmental 
restriction on solicitation in a nonpublic forum may render a 
similar prohibition on the sale of literature reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court in 1992, Chief Justice William H.  
Rehnquist said solicitation can be disruptive for airline 
passengers who must slow down to avoid or respond to a solicitor. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 ruling did not discuss soliciting and selling  
literature on the sidewalks or in the parking lots outside airport 
terminals, but Miami International Airport bars such activities in 
those areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is ISKCON Miami vs. Metropolitan Dade County, 98-874.

<P>
	HAVRE, Mont. (AP) -- More than 300 Amtrak passengers had an  
extended -- and unintended -- stay here this weekend after a 
telephone threat led authorities to search two trains for 
radioactive materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the eastbound and westbound Empire Builder trains left  
Havre Sunday morning, at least 16 1/2 hours behind schedule after 
officials found nothing harmful. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers, removed from the trains in 24-degree weather,  
were taken to the National Guard Armory and a school gymnasium in 
Havre after the trains were stopped on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	An Amtrak spokesman in Wilmington, Del., said the threat had  
been phoned in by a man claiming to be a government employee, or 
possibly a former employee, with access to chemical or radioactive 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat was made against a train going through Havre. Both  
legs of the Empire Builder run through this city, connecting 
Chicago and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill County Sheriff Tim Solomon said the trains were checked for  
radioactive materials. ``We came up with nothing in the search,'' 
said FBI agent George Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
	In the investigation, authorities waved a wand over each  
passenger, concentrating on hands and feet, said Robert Johnson, a 
passenger from Glendale, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't real scared, but once I saw the ambulance and the  
fire trucks pull up, I got a little more serious,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Havre is about 120 miles northeast of Great Falls.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Back on Top in Women's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Purdue replaced Tennessee as the No. 1 team in The Associated  
Press women's basketball poll for the second time this season, 
moving to the top Monday with just two weeks of voting to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's 72-69 loss at LSU produced a flip-flop in the top  
two places. Purdue (25-1) received 38 of 41 first-place votes and 
1,021 points from a national media panel. Tennessee (25-2) slipped 
to second with one first-place vote and 973 points. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time this season the lead has changed hands.  
The poll has not had that many changes at No. 1 since there were 
four in the 1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became No. 1 for the first time in school history when it  
bumped Tennessee in the second poll of the season. That happened 
after Purdue's 78-68 victory over the Lady Vols, who had led the 
preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Boilermakers lasted only one week on top. They lost at  
Stanford by one point and were replaced by Connecticut, which 
lasted seven weeks at No. 1 before giving way to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I said in November, it's a tremendous honor to be ranked  
No. 1 and it's a real tribute to the commitment by our 16 
players,'' Purdue coach Carolyn Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the ranking is not going to help us score any points or  
come up with any steals,'' she said. ``Our focus is on the Big Ten 
tournament, where everyone is 0-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue gained the No. 1 ranking after a close call over the  
weekend. The Boilermakers needed Stephanie White-McCarty's two free 
throws with two seconds left to beat lowly Minnesota 63-61 on 
Friday night. Purdue then defeated Northwestern to finish 16-0 in 
the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, which was No. 1 for six weeks, had routed Memphis by  
74 points and Vanderbilt by 36 before stumbling at LSU, the Lady 
Vols' first loss to a Southeastern Conference team since the 1997 
league tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other change in the Top 10 was a switch in positions by  
No. 9 Virginia Tech and No. 10 Notre Dame. There were few big 
changes in the rest of the list expect for LSU's jump from 23rd to 
17th. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech (22-2) held at No. 3 with one first-place vote  
and 951 points, while No. 4 Colorado State (27-1) received its 
first-ever vote for No. 1 and had 893 points. Old Dominion was 
fifth, followed by Connecticut, Rutgers, Duke, Virginia Tech and 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech remained 11th, UCLA climbed one spot to 12th and  
North Carolina slipped one place to 13th after losing to Duke. Then 
it was Georgia, Penn State, Clemson and LSU, followed by Oregon, 
Virginia and Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five were UC Santa Barbara, Kansas, Auburn, Alabama  
and Florida International. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU's move of six places was the biggest jump in the poll. The  
biggest drop was just two places -- by Clemson (14th to 16th), 
Virginia (17th to 19th) and Florida International (23rd to 25th). 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ruling Barring Aliens' Suits Stands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling  
that bars aliens from suing over the discrimination they 
encountered in their U.S. jobs if they lacked the authority, under 
federal immigration law, to work in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a Nigerian  
citizen whose undocumented immigration status squelched his 1995 
job-bias lawsuit even though his employer had not known he was 
unauthorized to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Obiora Egbuna, who is now a permanent resident alien, began  
working for Time-Life Libraries Inc. in Alexandria, Va., in 1989. 
At the time, he possessed a valid student work visa but it expired 
six months after he got the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Egbuna continued working for Time-Life Libraries until early  
1993, when he voluntarily resigned because he intended to return to 
Nigeria. When his plans changed, he sought to regain his old job 
but was refused. At the time, Egbuna still was not authorized to 
work in the United States. He obtained such authority later that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Egbuna sued his former employer, contending that its refusal to  
rehire him was in retaliation for his previously having 
corroborated an employee's sexual-harassment allegations against a 
supervisor. His lawsuit accused Time-Life Libraries of violating an 
anti-bias law known as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	While the lawsuit was pending, Time-Life Libraries learned that  
Egbuna had not been authorized to work in this country when it had 
denied him re-employment. It sought to have his lawsuit thrown out 
for that reason, and a federal trial judge dismissed the case. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
reinstated the lawsuit, but the full 4th Circuit court killed it 
again by an 8-4 vote last August. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is entitled to Title VII protection unless he or she  
``was qualified for employment,'' the appeals court ruled in 
interpreting a 1986 federal law, the Immigration Reform and Control 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Egbuna said the  
appeals court's ruling conflicts with a 1995 Supreme Court decision 
that said employers can be held liable for discriminating against 
someone even if they later found a lawful reason to justify the 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	A later-discovered lawful reason can be used only in determining  
the proper remedy for the unlawfully motivated treatment, the 
unanimous 1995 decision said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Egbuna vs. Time-Life Libraries Inc., 98-934.

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Bid Portends Shakeup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Olivetti's audacious bid to take over a former  
state-owned monopoly five times its size portends an era of 
unprecedented upheaval for Europe's telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Established companies in Britain and Germany face a growing  
threat from smaller, more aggressive upstarts, while in the 
Netherlands, a long-dominant telecommunications firm is seen as 
increasingly vulnerable to an unfriendly takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	For consumers, the competitive trend likely means cheaper and  
better phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We favor competition. We agree very much with this opening of  
the market,'' said Anna Ciaberoni, head of the Italian consumer 
group Federconsumatori. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciaberoni expressed some concern over the size of the bid but  
said she was generally optimistic that if Olivetti succeeds, 
consumers will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	The catalyst for these changes, last year's deregulation of the  
European telecommunications business, also has created pressure for 
mergers and acquisitions -- much like the recent wave of 
consolidation that is redefining the continent's car industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's $58 billion bid to take over Telecom Italia, the  
world's sixth-largest phone company, ran into some obstacles Monday 
after Italy's stock market regulator, Consob, said Olivetti's 
weekend filing failed to meet the standards for a full-fledged 
takeover announcement. That's important because Italian law limits 
the defense a company can mount once it becomes the target of a 
takeover bid ruled valid by Consob. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling doesn't stop Olivetti from trying a takeover, but it  
does give Telecom Italia more room to try and fend it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia said Sunday that Olivetti's bid is ``full of  
holes'' and was marshaling a defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti also must overcome potential resistance from the  
Italian treasury, which retains 3.4 percent of Telecom's shares and 
veto power over major decisions through 2000. Despite that veto 
power, Italy's Premier Massimo D'Alema said Monday his government 
needs to remain neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the outcome, Olivetti, a telecommunications  
newcomer that made its name building typewriters and computers, 
poses the biggest challenge seen so far in an industry still 
dominated by companies that long enjoyed monopoly rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, where deregulation of the industry began in 1981, at  
least two new firms have already carved out a niche serving 
businesses with fiber-optic phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the firms, COLT Telecom Group PLC, has expanded beyond  
British shores to build or plan networks in Germany, France, Italy 
and Spain. Since going public in 1996, COLT has grown into 
Britain's 48th-biggest company in terms of market capitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	British Telecommunications PLC has hardly been sitting still.  
The largest British phone company tried to buy the No. 2 U.S. 
long-distance carrier, MCI Communications Corp., in 1997. But 
British Telecom was outbid by WorldCom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Liberalization came earlier to the United Kingdom, and it's  
now coming to the rest of Europe,'' said John Curran, a 
London-based senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin and 
Jenrette, one of three U.S. investment banks backing the Olivetti 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The result, analysts say, is that younger, more entrepreneurial  
firms are starting to embarrass their larger domestic competitors, 
many of whom are still operated by national governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Telecom Italia, analysts cite the former German  
telephone monopoly, Deutsche Telekom, as one of the region's 
underperformers. 
</P>
<P>
	Its main competitor, Mannesmann AG, is seeking to build a  
presence in Italy and has agreed to buy Olivetti's holdings in 
mobile operator Omnitel Pronto Italia and fixed-line operator 
Infostrada. Olivetti plans to use money from the sales toward its 
takeover of Telecom Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom is vulnerable because of its weak management, said some  
analysts, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	But other European companies are potential takeover candidates  
due primarily to their small size. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scandinavian telecommunications market is seen by some as  
ripe for consolidation. Chicago-based Ameritech Corp., which 
already owns a stake in the Danish company TeleDenmark, is said to 
be weighing acquisitions elsewhere in northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the biggest Dutch telecommunications company,  
Royal KPN NV, confirmed Monday that his chief executive, Wim Dik, 
doubts whether KPN can remain independent beyond the next several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the long run, you could see three or four European carriers  
instead of a national carrier for each country,'' said James 
Sawtell, an analyst at Deutsche Bank's London office. 
</P>
<P>
	But not every competitor can aspire to pan-European or global  
status. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the example of Swisscom, the newly privatized  
telecommunications arm of Switzerland's postal service, Sawtell 
said: ``There's a lot of virtue in being just a well-run domestic 
carrier.''

<HEADLINE> Duke No. 1 in AP Men's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Duke, winners of 22 straight games and one victory shy of  
Atlantic Coast Conference history, was No. 1 again today in the AP 
college basketball poll, one vote short of a unanimous selection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (27-1) were first on 70 ballots and received  
1,774 points from the media panel. A victory Saturday night at 
North Carolina would give Duke, which beat Florida State by 26 
points and Clemson by 27 last week, the first 16-0 regular season 
in the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (25-1), which beat Vanderbilt in its only game last week,  
moved up one place to No. 2 with 1,685 points. The ranking matches 
the highest in school history, a one-week stay at No. 2 in February 
1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (25-4), which won the Big Ten regular-season  
title Sunday with a 56-51 victory over Wisconsin, also moved up one 
place and received the other No. 1 vote and 1,617 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (23-2), which lost to Miami 73-71 on Saturday,  
dropped from second to fourth, the first time this season the 
Huskies haven't been ranked either No. 1 or 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland held No. 5 and was followed by Stanford, Arizona, St.  
John's, Cincinnati and Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Second Ten was Miami, Utah, Kentucky, North Carolina, UCLA,  
Wisconsin, College of Charleston, Iowa, Florida and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five teams in the Top 25 were New Mexico, Texas,  
Purdue, Syracuse and Temple, with the last two tied for 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas (17-10) moved into the rankings for the first time this  
season. The Longhorns, who started the season 2-7 under first-year 
coach Rick Barnes, have won eight of nine, the only loss by one 
point to Oklahoma. The last time Texas was ranked was in the 
preseason poll last season when it was No. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple (18-8) was No. 7 in the preseason poll, but fell out of  
the rankings four weeks into regular season after losing four 
straight games. The Owls returned to the rankings after winning 
five of six. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri (18-7) and Miami of Ohio (19-6) both lost two games  
last week to fall out of the poll after returning for one week. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri, which lost to Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, had been  
22nd. Miami of Ohio, which lost to Toledo and Bowling Green, was 
25th. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky, which beat Georgia and lost to Arkansas, had the  
week's biggest drop falling from No. 6 to 13th and out of the Top 
Ten for the first time this season. Purdue, which was the third 
ranked team to lose two games last week, fell from 17th to No. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The week's biggest jumps were the moves of Miami from 15th to  
No. 11 and Florida from 23rd to No. 19, the highest rankings for 
both this season.

<HEADLINE> USDA Sees Farm Strain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- American farmers face another year of  
lagging exports and low prices, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
predicts. ``There is no point in trying to put a shiny gloss on 
it,'' he told a forum on the farm outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency figures released Monday lowered U.S. farm export  
projections by $1.5 billion to $49 billion -- lower than last year's 
$53.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The news was a blow to U.S. farmers still struggling from last  
year's low prices for commodities and livestock. Farmers have 
become increasingly reliant on exports since government subsidies 
began phasing out as part of the 1996 farm law. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress late last year passed a $6 billion bailout and the  
government last month gave $50 million to hog farmers who are 
getting their lowest prices in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no point in trying to put a shiny gloss on it, no  
point in playing games of spin and denial. The facts are the 
facts,'' Glickman said at the department's annual forum. ``I wish I 
could say we are about to turn the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	USDA chief economist Keith Collins was even more blunt: ``All  
signs now point to higher farm financial stress in 1999.'' He 
predicted farm income would drop $3 billion to $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. agricultural exports have been declining since 1996,  
when they reached a record $60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian economic crisis is the main culprit, with exports to  
that region accounting for over 80 percent of the decrease. Large 
supplies by U.S. farmers have worsened the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	One commodity particularly vulnerable to the global slowdown is  
cotton, Collins said, noting that the projected $1.4 billion in 
cotton exports is the second lowest in 20 years. Cotton exports 
totaled $2.5 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asian textiles and apparel are flooding the world market,''  
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just Monday, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. said it would close 11 of its 22  
plants in North America and lay off about 5,900 employees to deal 
with slumping sales. Last week, Cone Mills -- the world's largest 
producer of denim fabrics -- said it would cut 11.5 percent of its 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
	When buy clothes today, ``about 45 percent of the cotton in  
those textiles is imported,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	But cotton isn't alone. The greatest financial strain in 1999  
will be on field crops, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices, expected to average only $2.70 a bushel in 1998-99  
-- the lowest season-average price in 8 years -- probably won't rise 
more than 10 percent, Collins said. Corn, forecast at $1.95 per 
bushel this marketing year -- its lowest level in more than a decade 
-- should remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	As for soybeans, Collins said, ``Producers are being drawn to  
soybeans like filings to a magnet because for the moment it appears 
to be the least worst alternative.'' That bodes ill for its price. 
Soybeans, expected to average $5.20 per bushel this season -- their 
lowest since 1986-87 -- could average well below $5 a bushel, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and poultry production is expected to remain high but  
prices will make a small recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, fed cattle prices are expected to average $65.50 a  
hundredweight, compared with $61.50 last year. Hog prices are 
expected to begin to recover in the second half of the year with 
prices of around $34 per hundredweight, 7 percent higher than last 
year but still far below the $45 range before the price slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said it probably will take three to five years for U.S.  
exports to recover to the 1996 level. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the largest drops in exports is to Japan, where the  
continued recession has dropped the export estimate to $8 billion, 
15 percent below 1998. Overall, exports to Asia are forecast at 
$16.8 billion, compared with $19.6 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Farm Exports Expected To Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Projected U.S. farm exports for the year  
were lowered today by $1.5 billion as global demand lags while 
farmers' supplies increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fiscal year 1999 estimate of $49 billion is a sharp  
decline from November's $50.5 billion estimate and is $4.6 billion 
below fiscal 1998, the Agriculture Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no point in trying to put a shiny gloss on it,''  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said before the department's 
annual Agricultural Outlook Forum. ``The facts are the facts. I 
wish I could say we are about to turn the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exports began falling last year due to the Asian economic crisis  
and strong competition from other countries. Since then, Russia's 
economy -- a major customer of U.S. poultry for instance -- has 
joined the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in exports will likely cause further financial strain  
in the nation's farmland. Ever since the phasing out of government 
payments to farmers in the 1996 farm law, exports have become 
increasingly important for maintaining prices for U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, farmers saw their prices drop to extremely low levels  
in both commodities and livestock. Congress late last year passed a 
$6 billion bailout to help. The government also agreed last month 
to give $50 million to hog farmers, now getting their lowest prices 
in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman reiterated a call for Congress to help farmers, mainly  
by overhauling the crop insurance program. ``We've got to be 
creative in the way we help our farmers,'' he said. ``Lurching from 
one ad hoc relief bill to the next is not the best way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the largest drops in exports is to Japan, where the  
continued recession has dropped the export estimate to $8 billion, 
15 percent below 1998. Overall, exports to Asia are forecast at 
$16.8 billion, compared to $19.6 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean exports are forecast to drop almost $3.5 billion from  
last year. Weak foreign demand for cotton are expected to reduce 
exports of that commodity to $1.4 billion, compared to $2.5 billion 
last year.

<HEADLINE> Court Lets Notification Law Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today left intact a Virginia  
law requiring doctors to notify a young girl's parent before 
performing the abortion she seeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that the  
law wrongly denies most mature girls under 18 the right to an 
abortion without parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's action is not a decision, and does not preclude the  
possibility the court may review the Virginia law, or one similar 
to it, at some future date. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action today, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Declined to revive lawsuits stemming from the 1986 terrorist  
hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi, Pakistan. The justices, 
without comment, turned away arguments that allegations against Pan 
American World Airways and a security firm should be restudied in 
light of their decision last year on transfers of complex lawsuits 
from one federal trial court to another. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to let Hare Krishnas solicit donations or sell  
religious literature at Miami International Airport. The court 
rejected an appeal that argued such restrictions violate 
free-speech rights. Today's action sets no national precedent. But 
the denial of review lets stand a ruling that applies to all 
airports in three Southern states -- Florida, Alabama and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to use a Nevada case to clarify a 1996 federal law aimed  
at curtailing federal court access for state prison inmates who 
seek to challenge their state prosecutions. The court said it will 
decide, probably sometime in 2000, whether convicted killer Antonio 
Slack is entitled to have a federal judge study the arguments he 
raised in a 1995 appeal. Lower courts concluded that Slack's appeal 
was an abuse of his right to appeal and refused to consider the 
arguments it raised. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that women have a constitutional  
right to end their pregnancies. And in a series of decisions dating 
back 20 years, the nation's highest court has barred states from 
giving parents of minor, unwed minors an absolute veto over 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The court has ruled that parental consent cannot be required  
without providing some alternative, such as letting the minor seek 
a judge's approval instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But parental consent and parental notification are different  
concepts, and the court never specifically has required states to 
provide a judicial bypass in parental-notification abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 Virginia law requires that unmarried girls under 18 and  
not living on their own tell one of their parents at least 24 hours 
before having an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The state law waives that requirement if the girl's doctor has  
reason to believe she has been victimized by abuse or neglect. And 
it allows a girl to bypass parental notification by proving to a 
judge she is mature enough to handle the abortion decision by 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The law says judges in such circumstances ``may'' authorize the  
abortion without parental notice. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of doctors and clinics that provide abortions challenged  
the law and initially succeeded in blocking its enforcement. But 
the entire 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted unanimously last 
August to uphold the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the appeals court's 10 judges ruled that  
parental-notification laws, unlike parental-consent laws, do not 
have to include a judicial bypass. The four other judges voted to 
uphold the Virginia law after interpreting ``may'' to mean judges 
must allow girls found to be mature to get an abortion without 
telling their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, abortion-rights advocates argued  
that the 4th Circuit court's ruling conflicts with other appeals 
courts' view on ``the important constitutional question of whether 
mature minors are entitled to obtain an abortion without parental 
notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a right ... relied upon for nearly two decades by a  
generation of young women in this country,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia officials urged the justices to reject the appeal. They  
noted that the appeals court said it would uphold the Virginia law 
even if parental notification had to be treated the same as 
parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Planned Parenthood of the Blue Ridge vs. Camblos,  
98-834.

<HEADLINE> California Poster Flap Opens War Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- Some view his actions as a fight for  
freedom of speech. Others see him as a pawn of a foreign 
government, intent on wreaking havoc in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all agree that Truong Van Tran has shaken up  
Westminster's Little Saigon, a normally peaceful gathering place 
for Vietnamese refugees in this sunny Southern California city. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Little Saigon has attracted riot gear-clad  
police and raucous demonstrators enraged by Tran's window display 
of his homeland's flag and a poster of the late communist leader Ho 
Chi Minh. 
</P>
<P>
	``This communist flag we call the blood flag. This is like the  
swastika,'' said Ky Ngo of the Vietnamese-American Community of 
Southern California. ``What they feel is hurt, anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The symbols, protesters say, are as offensive to the 200,000  
ethnic Vietnamese who live in Westminster as a swastika and a 
picture of Adolf Hitler would be to Jews who suffered during the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Many who survived atrocities under Ho's regime say Tran has  
reopened wounds they have struggled to heal since the fall of South 
Vietnam in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran said the emblems had been hanging on the wall of his video  
store for months without much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	That was before he faxed a taunt to anti-communist activists in  
the area in mid-January: ``Here, I dare all of you... if you all 
think you are great, then go ahead, come over to clear me out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They called his bluff with round-the-clock demonstrations, with  
crowds of up to 10,000 screaming protesters. Tran himself has been 
assaulted at least twice, dozens of demonstrators have been cited 
and one enraged woman even rammed her stroller -- with two children 
inside -- against a police barricade, prompting her arrest for 
alleged child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran's plight has attracted the American Civil Liberties Union  
of Southern California, which is giving the shopkeeper free legal 
representation. The ACLU says it's a freedom of speech case. 
</P>
<P>
	But protesters see a bigger picture: Tran as a pawn of the  
Vietnamese government who wish to intimidate those who fled. How 
the community reacts is a test of whether Vietnamese-Americans can 
stand up to their former rulers, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we lose today, we have no hope for the Vietnamese people,''  
said Thamh Nguyen, 40, who joined 10,000 people outside Tran's 
store Saturday. ``This is a very important event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ngo urged fellow protesters to be nonviolent, then cried nearby  
as some of them clashed with police. At least 12 people were 
arrested. Some protesters praised police, but others challenged 
officers to stand up to Tran in honor of Vietnam War veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran has denied having any connection to the Vietnamese  
government. He told reporters at an ACLU news conference Friday 
that his family actually fought the communists during the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran said he began displaying the communist emblems after a  
visit to Vietnam in November, which was his first trip back since 
fleeing the country in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw that Vietnam under communist rule is better than most  
Vietnamese-Americans believe, and he wanted to persuade others in 
the community to establish better relations with their homeland, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran said he sent the taunting fax after someone had knocked  
down his picture of Ho. He took down the flag and picture after a 
judge ordered him to do so, but he re-hung them Saturday after the 
judge reversed her own decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have emerged unscathed Saturday thanks to police who  
surrounded his store, but his troubles aren't over. Tran's landlord 
has ordered him to vacate the property for failure to pay rent and 
for causing a disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
	The California-based Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan (People)  
has criticized the United States for what has happened to Tran, 
saying it is unacceptable that ``extremists'' had been allowed to 
attack Tran. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers suspect Tran may simply be a media hound who  
likes the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to figure out why he's doing this,'' said Mark  
Knowles, a private security guard at the strip mall where Tran's 
shop is located. ``The truth is he wants to die famous.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Wetteland Hurts His Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- Texas Rangers closer John Wetteland  
strained his right ankle during a workout Monday and is expected to 
miss the next week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Wetteland, who had 42 saves and was 3-1 with a 2.03 ERA, will be  
sidelined while the swelling goes down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating because I put in a lot of sweat and hard work  
to get back to where I was feeling pretty good,'' Wetteland said. 
``It just shows that the ankle is an important part of the body, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wetteland had elbow surgery in the off-season and has been  
throwing without any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers pitchers and catchers reported to camp last week. The

<HEADLINE> Bowe Kidnap Sentencing Is Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Sentencing was delayed Monday for former  
heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe, who faces a prison sentence for 
kidnapping his estranged wife and five children. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Hinson, one of Bowe's lawyers, said federal prosecutors  
requested the delay and no new date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will probably be in two or three months,'' Hinson said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Bowe pleaded guilty to abducting Judy Bowe and their  
children from their home in Cornelius, just north of Charlotte. He 
attempted to drive them to his home in Fort Washington, Md., but 
Judy Bowe managed to telephone for help during a stop in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said then that Bowe would serve 18 to 24 months in  
prison under his plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay also postponed an appearance in U.S. District Court by  
O.J. Simpson defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr., who is 
representing Bowe on the kidnapping charges, Hinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowe arrived at his wife's home on Feb. 25, 1998, and threatened  
her with a knife, handcuffs, duct tape and pepper spray. He forced 
her and the youngsters into a Lincoln Navigator and headed to his 
Fort Washington, Md., home, according to a federal grand jury 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	After driving about 200 miles, they stopped at a restaurant in  
South Hill, Va., where Judy Bowe called her sister in North 
Carolina, who guided police to the restaurant. Judy Bowe told 
officers she and her children did not want to go to Maryland. They 
returned home, Judy Bowe with a superficial stab wound to her left 
breast allegedly inflicted by Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowe outpointed Evander Holyfield for the undisputed heavyweight  
championship on Nov. 13, 1992. He lost the WBC title when he didn't 
fight Lennox Lewis of Britain. He lost the WBA and IBF titles in a 
decision to Holyfield on Nov. 6, 1993.

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Bearing gifts and a song, Usher brought a smile  
to the face of an ailing 7-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The R&AMP;B sensation visited Detroit Children's Hospital on Sunday  
and paid a special visit to Jasmine Rowe, who suffers from a 
congenital birth defect that causes fluid to build up in her brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``How ya doin'?'' he asked, sitting gently on her bed. ``Can I  
get a hug?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since birth, Jasmine has had more than 40 surgeries to relieve  
the pressure in her head that produce terrible headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to two roses, the Grammy Award-nominee gave Jasmine  
a T-shirt he personalized for her. Looking as though he might cry 
himself, he posed for photographs with Jasmine and her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the days that make you the person that you are,''  
Usher said. ``Kids make the world go round.''

<HEADLINE> MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When last seen, David Wells was crying after the Yankees traded  
him out of New York. Now, the rival Mets seem eager to stop his 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, on the lookout to add an ace, already have spoken to  
the Toronto Blue Jays about a trade for Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did talk to the Blue Jays the day of the trade and  
(assistant general manager) Omar Minaya spoke with them the second 
day,'' Mets GM Steve Phillips said Sunday in Port St. Lucie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``But right now he's part of their staff, and they're not  
trading him,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays got Wells on Thursday as part of a three-player  
package for Roger Clemens. Wells does not seem thrilled at the 
prospect of pitching for his old team, and the Mets -- along with 
the Cleveland Indians -- are interested in acquiring the lefty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we'd be interested in is if there were a  
top-line starting pitcher available,'' Phillips said. ``Most trades 
probably won't happen until the end of spring, after the 
evaluations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells was expected to join the Blue Jays today at their camp in  
Dunedin, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting a good one in Wells,'' said Toronto catcher  
Darrin Fletcher. ``If you're going to get a starter, you might as 
well get one who is his caliber of player. We've been needing a 
left-handed starter, it has been the team's No. 1 priority. It cost 
us Roger Clemens, but we got him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also expected at camp today for his first workout was Oakland  
lefty Kenny Rogers. The Athletics' ace was the only one absent on 
the first day of practice for pitchers and catchers, though he 
showed up later at the team complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's somewhere in between harmless and a statement,''  
A's general manager Billy Beane said in Phoenix. ``I know this, 
Kenny doesn't like to leave his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers demanded a trade in November, then rescinded it 18 days  
later. But he's made it clear he'd like to be nearer to his family 
in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a couple of familiar faces showed up at spring  
training. Ken Griffey Jr. came by Seattle's camp in Peoria, Ariz., 
and talk-show host Jerry Springer took some swings with the 
Cincinnati Reds in Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey was asked about the Mariners' running regimen this  
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit 56 home runs and played center field behind a team with  
a 5.00 ERA,'' he said. ``I got a lot of running in last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, the former mayor of Cincinnati, wandered over from his  
home near the Reds' complex. He spoke with general manager Jim 
Bowden and manager Jack McKeon, and took nearly two dozen swings 
against coach Buddy Bell, never hitting a ball to the outfield 
grass on a fly. 
</P>
<P>
	``They laughed at me when I signed Deion (Sanders),'' Bowden  
said. ``What's the difference?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Joyner, meanwhile, liked what he was seeing in camp --  
especially after undergoing corrective eye surgery in the 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Padres' first baseman had vision of 20/3,000  
before the procedure. The surgery improved his sight to 20/20 in 
his right eye and 20/25 in his left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seeing the ball well, I'm hitting, my fielding's fine,''  
Joyner said. ``I was thinking, I've got a couple more years to 
play. I've played with these bad eyes all my career. If there's a 
possibility of getting better eyesight, let's see if it helps.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans At 23-Year Low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean futures tumbled to 23-year lows on the Chicago Board of  
Trade Monday after the Agriculture Department's chief economist 
predicted crop prices could fall to $4 a bushel later this year. 
Grain futures also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell after the USDA's Keith Collins told a farm outlook  
conference he sees no end to the decline in commodity prices during 
1999, largely because economic troubles in Asia have caused U.S. 
exports to fall sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for soybeans have fallen to new lows each day for more  
than a week amid indications world production will continue to 
increase even as there are few takers for the commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. farmers last year harvested a record large crop, and  
analysts predict they will plant record acreage this year because 
of farm programs that pay more for soybeans than other crops. 
Further exacerbating the problem are expectations for a near-record 
Brazilian crop and a large crop from Argentina, which are likely to 
keep competition strong throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
	South American soybeans account for a third of the world's  
supply, and Brazil, the biggest producer in the continent, is the 
world's second-largest grower behind the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins predicted farm income would drop this year by $3 billion  
to $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for March delivery fell 4 1/4 cents to $4.74 a bushel.  
Prices earlier in the session fell to $4.64 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
after the cost of borrowing the metal -- an indicator of demand -- 
fell for the first time in several days. The decline prompted 
speculation that consuming countries are not in as dire need of the 
metal as originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures rose sharply last week after borrowing, or lease,  
rates soared. That led to speculation that demand for the metal for 
such uses as photography, electronics and jewelry-making could be 
on the rise for the first time in months. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants also noted exchange warehouse inventories  
have been tight for more than a year, leaving those short of the 
metal in a precarious position should a large consuming country 
like India suddenly experience a jump in demand. 
</P>
<P>
	March silver fell 14 cents to $5.46 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures soared in the nearby contract month on the Board  
of Trade of the City of New York as textile mills scrambled to find 
high-quality supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad weather during the last growing season helped produce one of  
the smallest crops in recent history and seriously affected the 
quality of that which could be harvested. Still, the outlook for 
cotton has been poor because of weak world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA in its farm outlook said exports will remain at their  
second-lowest in 20 years, while cheaper Asian imports are starting 
to flood U.S. shores. 
</P>
<P>
	March cotton rose 2.59 cents to 62.68 a pound, while the May  
contract fell 0.04 cent to 57.39 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Saberhagen Predicts Healthy Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- A year ago, Bret Saberhagen went to  
spring training with a repaired shoulder and an uncertain future. 
Now he's back with a 15-win season and a contract that could keep 
him with the Boston Red Sox for four more years. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not surprising for someone who was so good that he won  
the first of his two Cy Young awards when he was just 21. It's 
shocking for someone who had major surgery at 32 and missed most of 
the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God that I got a second chance,'' Saberhagen says.  
``It's kind of like a dream come true again. I appreciate the game 
a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had surgery on his right shoulder on May 28, 1996, while with  
Colorado, missed that entire season and didn't pitch in the majors 
again until Aug. 22, 1997, when he made his first start since Oct. 
1, 1995. He was 0-1 with a 6.58 ERA in six starts for Boston in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	When spring training began the following season, the Red Sox  
were very careful about bringing Saberhagen along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had hopes to be in the rotation for my first start of the  
year,'' he said, ``but it took a lot of work to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen made it, beating Seattle and Randy Johnson 10-5 in  
the fifth game of the season. He allowed two runs on four hits in 
five innings. He went on to win five of his first six starts but 
was taken out after six innings in each of the other four wins to 
make sure his arm wasn't being overworked. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times it was frustrating, but it was just a matter of,  
after the game, sitting down and saying, `hey, we're not in this 
thing for one game,' '' Saberhagen said. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he's in it for a reborn career.  
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen ended up with a 15-8 record and 3.96 ERA in 31 starts  
and never missed his turn in the rotation. He pitched 175 innings, 
felt strong at the end of the season and wants to work at least 200 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's miles past where he was at this point last year,''  
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``He's stronger. His arm has a 
little more resiliency. We figure we can get another 10 or 12 
pitches out of him a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Pedro Martinez, Tim Wakefield and Saberhagen forming a  
solid starting corps, the Red Sox added veterans Mark Portugal and 
Pat Rapp to a rotation that's much more settled than last year's. 
Portugal was 10-5 with Philadelphia, which finished eight games 
under .500, and Rapp was 12-13 with Kansas City, which was 17 under 
.500. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were on our team, they'd have won a lot more last  
year,'' Saberhagen said. ``So we're going to be in a lot more 
ballgames'' this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen should be better prepared for the start of the  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been throwing down here for about a week now and been  
able to throw off the mound and come back and throw long toss the 
next day and feel very good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, manager Jimy Williams wants to make sure he doesn't get  
carried away by Saberhagen's success and use him too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get too glad happy about how well he did,'' Williams  
said. ``When you think about what the man has been through, you 
don't want to try to push the envelope too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox apparently are convinced that Saberhagen's arm has  
recovered fully. They signed him last season to a contract for 
three years and an option for a fourth, when he'll be 38 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	That, he figures, will be enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to win 200 games. I have 156 right now so I should be  
able to do that if I stay healthy,'' Saberhagen said. And he'd love 
to cap a career that was in jeopardy a couple of years ago with the 
Red Sox first championship since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning in Boston would be something else,'' he said. ``I  
don't think you can compare it to anything because the city has 
waited so long for a championship. I'd love to be part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a possibility again now that his shoulder is healthy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching was always something that just pretty much came  
natural to me,'' Saberhagen said, ``but after it's taken away and 
you've got to work to get back there you realize how tough it is 
and how fortunate you are.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Judge Won't Step Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge today turned down a  
request to step aside in a possible contempt case against President 
Clinton over his testimony about his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolly Kyle Browning, who claims a long-term affair with Clinton  
before he became president, had said U.S. District Judge Susan 
Webber Wright was not the best judge to decide whether Clinton 
should be held in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the only person to ask Wright to step aside.  
</P>
<P>
	Larry Klayman of the conservative group Judicial Watch, which is  
representing Ms. Browning, said Friday that Wright would likely be 
a witness in a contempt case and that she could eliminate one 
ground for possible appeal by the president if she didn't hear the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said today that Browning and Judicial Watch did not  
set forth sufficient grounds on why she should step aside and let 
another judge handle the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Browning was a witness in Paula Jones' sexual harassment  
lawsuit against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Browning says she and Clinton were classmates at Hot Springs  
and that they had a sexual relationship from the mid-1970s until 
sometime before January 1992. Clinton denied the relationship 
during testimony in the same case. 
</P>
<P>
	His motion also asked that the contempt issue be transferred to  
a federal court outside Arkansas, preferably the Northern District 
of Texas where Ms. Browning resides. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright had offered to step aside because of her contact with a  
House impeachment case manager. Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., wanted 
her testimony about Clinton's demeanor during his deposition 
testimony. But neither Clinton's nor Mrs. Jones' side requested 
such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who oversaw Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit  
against Clinton, said she waited to address the contempt issue 
because of the president's impeachment trial and an appeal of Mrs. 
Jones' case. The Senate voted earlier this month not to convict 
Clinton; Mrs. Jones' appeal ended with a settlement of the suit in 
December for $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge had dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit last April 1, saying  
Mrs. Jones had failed to prove key elements of harassment.

<HEADLINE> Chemo Cuts Cervical Cancer Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In the first breakthrough in the treatment of  
spreading cervical cancer since the 1950s, a series of studies 
found that adding chemotherapy to radiation can cut the risk of 
death in half. 
</P>
<P>
	The five studies, made public Monday, proved so convincing that  
the National Cancer Institute took the unusual step of mailing 
letters to thousands of doctors urging them to adopt the new 
approach immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the data are so compelling that this should change  
the way women are treated all over the country and indeed around 
the world,'' said Dr. Edward Trimble, head of surgery in the 
institute's therapy evaluation program. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, doctors routinely offer surgery for early-stage  
cervical cancer and radiation alone for cancer that has spread 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Radiation has been the standard treatment since the 1950s for  
cervical cancer that has spread nearby, and the five-year survival 
rate for these women is now about 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new approach involves giving radiation and chemotherapy  
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	The five studies, all sponsored by the cancer institute, tested  
various combinations of chemotherapy and radiation against 
radiation alone. The victims' cancer had begun to spread beyond the 
cervix but was still confined to the pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies showed that the drug and radiation combinations  
reduced the risk of death between 30 percent and 50 percent 
compared with radiation alone during follow-up periods ranging from 
three to eight years. The combinations involving the drug 
cisplatin, a common kind of chemotherapy, appeared to work best. 
</P>
<P>
	``While many have previously been cured by radiotherapy, we  
believe that the opportunity to substantially increase the cure 
rate for these women has really been demonstrated through this 
collection of studies,'' said Dr. Walter Curran Jr. of Thomas 
Jefferson University in Philadelphia, who did not take part in the 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the studies involved several hundred women at hospitals  
around the country. None of the reports have been published yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Three will appear in the April 15 issue of the New England  
Journal of Medicine. One will be published in the spring in the 
Journal of Clinical Oncology, while the fifth will be presented 
March 22 in San Francisco at a meeting of the Society of 
Gynecologic Oncologists. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mitchell Morris of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson  
Cancer in Houston, who directed one of the studies, noted how 
unusual it is to have five studies on a single subject come to 
light at one time with similar results. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means we can definitely make a change in treatment that  
will save lives,'' he said. ``We don't have to do more studies. We 
know this is the way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why the combination works better than either radiation or  
chemotherapy alone is not clear. Researchers suspect the drugs may 
make cancer more sensitive to radiation and make it less able to 
repair radiation's damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Cervical cancer is expected to kill about 4,800 women in the  
United States this year. It usually affects women between 35 and 
55. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidence of cervical cancer has dropped by half since the  
1970s, largely because of widespread screening with the Pap test, 
which is 90 percent effective in detecting the disease, even before 
symptoms appear. About 40 percent of U.S. women are not tested 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting. Pain  
usually does not start until late in the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Henry M. Keys of Albany Medical College said researchers are  
testing similar combinations on cancer of the lungs, head and neck, 
but ``in none of those areas have we seen anything as dramatic as 
the impact in these studies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Side effects of the combination included nausea, vomiting and  
low blood counts. These were more common and severe than women 
experienced with radiation alone.

<HEADLINE> WTO Sides With U.S. In Apple Hassle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- A World Trade Organization appeals panel ruled  
Monday that Japan is acting illegally by blocking imports of fruit 
on health grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel supported U.S. complaints that Japan's testing  
requirement for imports of apples, cherries, nectarines and walnuts 
is not backed by scientific evidence and is too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. apple farmers hope the ruling will open the way for them to  
export fruit more easily to the large Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan insists on repeated testing of quarantine treatments each  
time a country tries to export a new variety of a fruit. Japanese 
officials say it wants to protect its plants from the codling moth. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing takes at least two years and is also costly for the  
government and producers, according to the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	A WTO panel came out against Japan in November, but Japan  
appealed against the decision. The appeals panel upheld most of the 
original ruling.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Computer Skills Called Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools will spend about $88 a student on  
computers and Internet connections this year but just $6 a student 
to train teachers to use such high-tech tools. And that adds up to 
a nation wired but not ready for technology-based learning, a study 
concluded Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately this is about whether your child is experiencing  
the fruits of the information technology revolution,'' said Alan 
Spoon, president of The Washington Post Co. and co-chair of the CEO 
Forum on Education and Technology, a group of 20 business and 
education leaders that examined education data. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of the nation's 87,000 schools have Internet  
access; they have about 6 million computers among them. But, the 
report said, few teachers are ready to use technology in their 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five states require computer classes for teachers seeking  
a license. But just two states -- North Carolina and Vermont -- 
require teaching hires to prove they can use the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The group recommended Monday that teacher training in technology  
be mandatory by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get smart with technology, there is little doubt  
our kids won't have the advantages they need,'' said Kevin Colling, 
who oversees licensing standards for Vermont's 8,000 teachers. That 
state added the technology requirement for teacher licensing last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would think that change is painful, but my experience has  
been that teachers are hungry for this,'' Colling said. ``They know 
technology has a tremendous amount to offer to kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, an Education Department survey found that  
just 20 percent of teachers felt they could use the technology in 
their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	States are starting to spend more of their federal technology  
dollars on training, said Linda Roberts, who directs the 
department's Office of Technology. The office, which finances up to 
20 percent of some lower-income schools' technology budgets, gives 
money for teacher training, highlighting successes as examples for 
others to follow. The office suggests, but doesn't require, that 
schools spend about a third of the computer money on training. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally, what you want to do is convince people that it is so  
important that they will do it as a matter of course, instead of as 
a requirement,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology's expense can force schools to choose between  
equipment and training, said Colling of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get the know-how and the hardware in the same place is a  
real challenge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Archer Elementary School in Vienna, Va., has managed to  
do both. The school spends at least $10,000 of its $40,000 budget 
on technology. Each of the 25 classrooms has at least two 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 600-student school, cited in the report as a success story,  
pays substitute salaries to give teachers time to work with a 
district trainer who comes in to observe their lesson plans and 
practices. The trainer helps teachers decide how best to use their 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know their classes,'' said Dwayne Young, assistant  
principal. ``They know their curricula. What we are shooting for is 
the educated professional who is able to make these choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said:  
</P>
<P>
	--Simply using computers to drill students doesn't raise  
achievement. But students who use computers in more complex ways -- 
for example, to simulate science experiments -- do have higher test 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	--Despite increased targeting of programs for poor schools, such  
as the E-Rate subsidy of computer connections and equipment, those 
students were less likely to have access to computers -- 63 percent 
of their schools compared with 88 percent of more-affluent schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Just one-third of teachers colleges even had the equipment to  
instruct new teachers on how to use computers in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommends that educators and lawmakers put more  
money and time into preparing teachers and create rewards and 
incentives for using computers in classes. Businesses should 
support schools with money and volunteers to make sure they 
graduate students prepared for high-tech work, the report said.

<HEADLINE> US Checks Report on Lauder Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is investigating a  
report that a company chaired by cosmetics heir Ronald S. Lauder 
has signed a deal with a state-run Yugoslav communications company 
in violation of U.S. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Foley said Monday the  
administration became aware of the purported deal last August as a 
potential sanctions violation. In response to a Treasury Department 
request, Lauder's firm responded with a full report, Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley and a Treasury Department official said Treasury is  
reviewing the firm's activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged deal, first reported in Monday's New York Times, was  
said to involve RSL Communications, one of Lauder's companies, and 
Telekom Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauder, reached in Jerusalem, denied the report. ``We are not  
doing business there,'' he said. ``We submitted a proposal to the 
State Department and asked, `How about this?' That's where it 
stands.'' He said other telecommunications companies also are 
trying to do business with Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauder is a former ambassador to Austria and chairman-elect of  
the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Fischer, legal counsel for RSL, told the Times, ``Our  
belief is that we have not violated the sanctions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that before the deal was signed in August, the company  
briefed Treasury Department officials and got no objection. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer also told the Times the company had gotten approval from  
someone at the State Department but could not recall the person's 
name. Foley denied that the department had given such approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Another department official said the agency normally has  
contacts with the Treasury Department on such matters but that 
Treasury has the final say. At this point, the official said, the 
administration does not have enough information to know whether the 
alleged transaction is subject to an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Clinton signed an executive order barring U.S.  
investments in Serbia after Belgrade used police and military force 
to crack down on Kosovo Albanians. A number of other Western 
nations took similar steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia is one of two republics that make up the former  
Yugoslavia. The other republic, Montenegro, was exempted from the 
U.S. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Volvo Breaks Off Scania Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Vehicle-maker AB Volvo has broken off  
talks with the main owner of a rival Swedish truck and bus maker 
about a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo surprised the Swedish business community in January when  
it announced that it had acquired 13 percent of the shares in 
Scania and declared its intention to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	But several weeks of talks with Investor AB, which owns 45.5  
percent of the shares in Scania, have been ended because ``the 
conditions for reaching an agreement do not exist at the present 
time,'' a statement Monday from Volvo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot express an opinion on the conditions for possible  
future discussions with Investor on this matter, but we are in no 
hurry,'' said Volvo's Chief Executive Leif Johansson. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo's move for Scania came shortly before Volvo announced the  
sale of it automobile division to Ford Motor Co. for $6.45 billion. 
Volvo said selling the small but prestigious car division would 
allow greater focus on its other businesses, which include trucks, 
buses, construction equipment and marine and aerospace engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Johannson said the halt in talks doesn't mean Volvo has any  
intention of selling the stake it has acquired in Scania. 
</P>
<P>
	``Volvo wanted to ensure that it could participate in the  
discussions of Scania's future ownership, and we do not intend to 
sell our holding in Scania, regardless of possible changes in its 
ownership,'' Johansson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent reports have said Scania also is seen as a merger target  
by Volkswagen and Fiat.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Vaccines Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After losing one son to meningitis, Lynn Bozof  
spent $65 to vaccinate her other son against the disease, even 
though the vaccine's effectiveness is questionable and the chances 
of getting the ailment are rare. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it isn't a perfect vaccine, it's the best medical  
science has to offer right now,'' said Mrs. Bozof, whose son Evan, 
a college student, succumbed to the disease last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people know about the disease, but not a lot of  
people know about the vaccine. Why not give yourself the best 
chance to fight it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colleges around the country are starting to ask the same  
question. With meningitis cases among those between the ages of 15 
and 25 doubling since 1991, some schools are acknowledging that all 
students should be warned about the potentially deadly disease, 
even if the vaccination is expensive and not always covered under 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Meningococcal meningitis is an infection of the membranes around  
the brain and spinal cord. About 10 percent of cases are fatal. The 
illness is spread through direct exposure such as kissing, sharing 
kitchen utensils, coughing and sneezing. Symptoms include fever, 
headache, nausea and vomiting, neck stiffness, and skin rash. 
</P>
<P>
	Children under the age of 6 account for 80 percent of cases,  
while 15- to 25-year-olds account for 10 percent to 15 percent, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There 
were 2,633 cases nationally last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Moore, a Georgia Tech student recovering from meningitis,  
said his doctor told him he would have died if he'd waited three 
more hours to get checked out. He hadn't been vaccinated against 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty scary, how fast this thing can move,'' he said.  
``You could die from it before you know what you have. As soon as I 
get better, I'm going to get one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the College Health Association, just 70 colleges  
and universities nationwide have policies recommending vaccination. 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Bozof was a student at Georgia Southwestern State  
University when he died. Since then, his mother has turned 
immunization into a personal crusade. Working with the American 
College Health Association, Mrs. Bozof persuaded a committee of the 
Georgia Board of Regents to recommend a meningitis vaccine for all 
incoming students at state schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine, available through local health departments or  
through a physician, is about 65 percent effective, said Dr. Chris 
Woods of the CDC. The vaccine is not used on children under age 2, 
who are in the highest risk group. 
</P>
<P>
	With the disease relatively rare, not much of the vaccine is  
made and it's expensive. But Dr. Frederick Ruben, who works for the 
company that manufacturers the only licensed meningitis vaccine, 
says that's changing -- especially for college students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is more demand for it now,'' said Ruben, director of  
medical affairs for French drug maker Pasteur Merieux Connaught. 
``And on the cost issue, I've never heard of someone who needed a 
vaccination not getting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A CDC study already has shown campus bars help spread the  
disease. If more data is found linking the college environment to 
meningitis, the national Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices may recommend it for all incoming students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live with this and can see its effects,'' said Dr.  
Marjeanne Collins, director of health service at the University of 
Pennsylvania. ``We just have to get the word out that it can be 
prevented.''

<HEADLINE> Golfer Faldo Seeks Match Play Crown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- From the far corner of the range Monday,  
Nick Faldo laid a club in the grass to work on his alignment, then 
turned around and hit lob wedges to a practice green behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years removed from his last tournament victory, two days  
away from a high-stakes match against Tiger Woods, Faldo is looking 
for what he calls ``synchronicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had better find it pretty quick.  
</P>
<P>
	The Match Play Championship begins Wednesday, a 64-man field of  
single elimination over 18 holes at La Costa Resort with an early 
flight home for anyone who gets off to a bad start, $1 million for 
the player who can win six matches over five days against the best 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good opportunity,'' Faldo said, hopeful that a victory  
over the world's top-ranked player can help rejuvenate a Hall of 
Fame career that has fallen into disarray since winning in Los 
Angeles two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship is the first of  
the new World Golf Championship events, each with a $5 million 
purse but none as compelling as this one. 
</P>
<P>
	Match play has not been a part of the PGA Tour since a two-year  
experiment in Tucson ended in 1985. It has not been used in a major 
event that brings together the best players in the world since the 
1958 PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is too young to be a major,'' said Mark O'Meara, the  
Masters and British Open champion. ``But this is the first time to 
get the top 64 players in match play, and there's a tremendous 
buzz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The field was determined by the top 64 in the world ranking  
published a week ago, and the brackets were drawn up like an NCAA 
tournament. If everything goes according to plan, Woods, David 
Duval, O'Meara and Davis Love III will meet in the ``Final Four'' 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't count on it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anybody in this field whom you can take  
for granted,'' O'Meara said. ``People need to know we're talking 
about the top 64 in the world. It isn't like the No. 3 player 
against No. 300. The top 70 or 80 players are world class who can 
beat anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the 64th seed happens to be Faldo, who once held  
the No. 1 spot for 81 consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	That spot currently belongs to Woods, who is starting to play  
like he deserves it. Woods ended a nine-month drought by winning 
the Buick Invitational two weeks ago in San Diego. He was in 
position to win again last week in the Nissan Open, taking a brief 
lead in the final round Sunday before finishing two strokes behind 
Ernie Els. 
</P>
<P>
	Already possessing awesome skills that have sent him soaring to  
the top of golf in just over two years, Woods loves the format as 
much as any American and is partially responsible for the renewed 
interest in match play because of his record three straight U.S. 
Amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like Tiger has been gearing up for this,'' Jesper  
Parnevik said. ``He's been talking about this for a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how far he has fallen, Faldo is also a master of match  
play, having won more Ryder Cup matches than anyone in its 70-year 
history. His 39 victories around the world include two World Match 
Play Championships in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he didn't arrive at La Costa equipped with the same level  
of confidence as Woods. While Woods was serving notice to Duval and 
everyone else that he can still win any time he sticks a tee in the 
ground, Faldo was home in Florida with his fingers crossed. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed his last two cuts on the European tour to slip to No.  
65 in the world ranking, and only got in the field when Jumbo 
Ozaki, who rarely plays outside Japan, decided not to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Faldo finds out what he can do with the opportunity. The  
fact the first five matches will be contested over 18 holes could 
be an advantage. Sunday's finals will be 36 holes, considered a 
fairer test of match play. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a stamina factor in 36 holes, and a bit more  
strategy,'' Faldo said. ``Eighteen holes is more like a sprint. But 
it's still match play. You play your opponent, don't you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen reporters followed him from the range to the 10th  
tee, and Faldo was clearly annoyed, sensing the hype over his 
opening match with Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, this must be my official tournament interview,'' he said.  
``You know it's a big ... tournament when they come onto the tee 
with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded by a spectator that there were children in the  
vicinity, Faldo pointed to reporters and said, ``Yes, they're right 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he turned around, hit his first drive down the middle and  
walked down the fairway with caddie Fanny Sunesson and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be like that Wednesday. Woods will be with him, as well  
as thousands of people swept up in the drama of match play.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let stand findings  
that Japan's largest computer maker tried to sell four 
supercomputers to a U.S. research consortium at illegally low 
prices in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which NEC  
Corp. said it was denied a fair and impartial hearing before the 
Commerce Department found it in violation of antidumping laws by 
offering the supercomputers at prices far below their fair market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a  
consortium partially funded by the federal government, decided in 
1995 that it would buy advanced supercomputers. It solicited bids 
from three companies, one of which offered to provide NEC products. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC is Japan's largest PC maker and the world's second-largest  
computer chip maker behind Intel Corp. It owns more than 50 percent 
of California-based Packard Bell NEC, which controls about 10 
percent of the world's computer market. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Science Foundation, a federal agency, ordered UCAR  
to investigate whether the NEC bid involved illegal dumping. Later 
that year, the Commerce Department began its own investigation and 
determined that substantial dumping was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the four supercomputers would cost about $13.2 million  
in the first year of procurement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, one of the two other companies that had bid for the  
UCAR contract filed an antidumping petition with the Commerce 
Department to complain about the NEC bid. The department responded 
by initiating an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC sued in the federal Court of International Trade, contending  
that the Commerce Department's antidumping investigation could not 
be impartial because its officials already had concluded that NEC 
was guilty of violating federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
	That court rejected the lawsuit, and its ruling was upheld last  
August by a federal appeals court specializing in commercial 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``NEC can prevail on its claim of prejudgment only if it can  
establish that the decision-maker is not capable of judging a 
particular controversy fairly ... that the decision-maker's mind is 
irrevocably closed,'' the appeals court said. It ruled that NEC had 
failed to prove that. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for NEC Corp. argued that  
the ``irrevocably closed'' mind standard is too difficult to prove 
for someone who contends they were denied an impartial hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal standard should be whether a ``disinterested observer  
may conclude that the decision-maker has in some measure adjudged 
the facts as well as the law of a particular case in advance of 
hearing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is NEC Corp. vs. U.S., 98-740.

<HEADLINE> Man Held in Death of Ailing Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEARL RIVER, N.Y. (AP) -- An 86-year-old retired plumber has been  
charged with shooting his ailing wife to death on her 88th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Papeman called 911 about 5:15 p.m. Sunday and told  
dispatchers that he had just shot his wife, Louise, in the chest 
with a rifle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Papeman, a former volunteer firefighter and World War II  
veteran, calmly surrendered to police who showed up at the couple's 
home in Pearl River, a New York suburb. Papeman pleaded not guilty 
to second-degree murder and was being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Papeman had been sick for a year and had started dialysis  
six months ago, friends and neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Sgt. Terry Hutmacher confirmed she was in poor health,  
but refused to give details or say whether Papeman could have shot 
his wife to end her suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Papemans, who had no children, celebrated their 50th wedding  
anniversary in June. They loved to socialize, and Mrs. Papeman was 
active in community service with the Salvation Army, Meals on 
Wheels and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a wonderful couple,'' said Maureen Walker, a friend  
of the Papemans for more than 30 years.

<HEADLINE> United Tech To Acquire Sundstrand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Technologies Corp. is snapping up smaller  
rival Sundstrand Corp. in a $4.3 billion cash-and-stock bid aimed 
at bolstering United Technologies' position in the rapidly 
consolidating aerospace and industrial parts industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartford, Conn.-based maker of Pratt &AMP; Whitney jet engines  
announced Monday it plans to fold Rockford-based Sunstrand into its 
Hamilton Standard division. The deal requires shareholder and 
regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination, to be renamed Hamilton Sundstrand and based in  
Connecticut, would allow United Technologies to better compete 
against such companies as General Electric Co. and Rolls Royce PLC 
in making smaller engines for the fast-growing regional jet market 
and in providing aircraft control systems, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies such as Boeing and Airbus Industrie increasingly are  
subcontracting aircraft systems, and a United Technologies 
acquisition of Sundstrand would better position it to offer 
one-stop shopping for various components, said Jon Kutler, 
president of the investment bank Quarterdeck Investment Partners, 
which specializes in the aerospace and defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the action now is in the subcontractor base, where you're  
seeing the players try to assemble businesses that make the guts of 
what ties an aircraft together,'' Kutler said. ``Each is trying to 
be more and more important to the prime (contractor), so they're 
offering a combination of services and products that lets the prime 
deal with fewer players and maintain tight schedules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, each Sundstrand share would be  
exchanged for $35 in cash plus 0.2790 share of United Technologies 
stock, for a minimum of $70, based on Friday's closing share price. 
</P>
<P>
	While the companies gave little indication of what effect the  
deal might have on Sundstrand's 10,400 employees, analysts said 
widespread plant closings were unlikely. Sundstrand spokesman Pat 
Winn said company was reviewing the 100 positions at the company's 
corporate offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase, expected to close by June, would add slightly to  
per-share earnings this year, with additional earnings growth in 
later years, United Technologies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundstrand chairman Robert H. Jenkins will become chairman of  
Hamilton Sundstrand. Its president will be Ray Kurlak, Hamilton 
Standard's president. In 1998, nearly 60 percent of Sundstrand's $2 
billion in revenue came from aerospace customers, both in the 
military and commercial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	United Technologies also owns No. 1 elevator maker Otis and No.  
1 air-conditioner maker Carrier, although its biggest moneymaker 
has been the Pratt &AMP; Whitney division. United Technologies earned 
$1.26 billion on $25.72 billion in revenue in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company in recent months has moved to cut costs and boost  
higher-margin businesses. It announced last week it had put its 
automotive unit up or sale as competition in the subcontractor 
market heats up. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundstrand shares rose $10.25, or 17 percent, to $68.25 on the  
New York Stock Exchange. United Technologies stock fell $1.06 1/4, or 
less than 1 percent, to $126 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 89 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks pushed higher this morning along with  
bond prices, amid optimism that interest rates will fall or at 
least remain stable through Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's Congressional testimony on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also got a boost from a spate of merger  
announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 89.84 at 9,429.79, led by banking and technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher, with the Nasdaq composite  
up 13.07 at 2,296.67, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 1.12 
at 1,250.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 12-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 107.09 million 
shares, below even Friday's slow pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ahead of Mr. Greenspan's testimony, we've got thin markets and  
a much firmer tone to the bond market,'' said William Meehan, 
market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``People think that his 
testimony will be rather neutral, that he will say, `We're keeping 
our eyes out for inflation, but the risks are balanced.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said the lower interest rates have also paved the way for  
investors to return to technology stocks, which they had sold last 
week in favor of manufacturing and consumer names, Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow ended a roller-coaster session up 41.32 at  
9,339.95, after trimming a 97-point gain to zero and then 
recovering, all in the final 15 minutes of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led higher by IBM, up 2 13/16 at 174 7/16;  
Hewlett-Packard, up 3 5/8 at 71 15/16; American Express, up 2 13/16 at 
106; and Citigroup, up 1 1/16 at 55 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial issues moved higher as yields in the bond market fell.  
The 30-year Treasury bond was up 3/8 point, pushing its yield, which 
moves opposite the price, down to 5.36 percent from 5.38 percent 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual stocks involved in merger announcements, including  
two big energy-company deals, were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Resources agreed to buy gas and oil-pipeline company  
Consolidated Natural Gas for $6.3 billion. The union would create 
one of the country's largest electric and gas utilities. Dominion 
Resources' shares were down 1 11/16 at 40 5/8, while CNG's shares were 
down 1/4 at 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra Energy agreed to acquire KN Energy, a big natural-gas  
pipeline and storage operator, for $1.9 billion. KNE's stock was up 
1 1/16 at 22 5/8, and Sempra's shares were down 1 1/6 at 22 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, aircraft engine maker and Dow component United  
Technologies said it would buy Sundstrand for about $4.3 billion in 
cash and stock, in a move that will expand United Technologies' 
aerospace and aviation businesses. United Technologies' shares were 
down 3 7/16 at 122, but Sundstrand's shares were up 9 3/16 at 67 
3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Telecom Italia, the leading telecommunications service  
provider in Italy, is the target of a hostile takeover bid by 
smaller rival Olivetti. Telecom Italia's shares were up 2 3/16 at 
108 5/8.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A Spanish woman who was kidnapped while  
trying to adopt a child in Colombia was released Monday, but her 
husband remained in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria del Pilar Rojo, 36, and her husband Santiago Cavanas, 46,  
were abducted Sunday while driving in the rural zone of Sonson 
about 75 miles northwest of the capital Bogota, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the region is rife with leftist rebels who often  
kidnap people to help finance their armed struggle, though the 
kidnappers could also be common criminals or paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavanas's kidnapping brings to 15 the number of foreigners being  
held in Colombia, which has the world's highest kidnapping rate. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 260 Colombians are being held by kidnappers. Last  
year, 1,794 people were kidnapped in Colombia, according to the 
president's office.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru will complete the privatization its state  
companies this year, bringing in $8.5 billion directly and $7 
billion in investment commitments, a top privatization official 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Alberto Fujimori's government began the successful  
privatization program in 1992 and has sold off 179 state companies 
to date, Juan Barcellos, director of Peru's Commission to Promote 
Private Investment, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crown jewel of the program was the sale of a controlling  
stake in state telephone monopoly Telefonica del Peru to Spain's 
Telefonica de Espana in 1994 for $2 billion, far more than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the state properties Peru plans to sell this year are the  
Cerro de Pasco mine, its train system, part of its electricity 
distribution grid, phosphate fields, and concessions to operate 
ports, airports and roads.

	The body of Gaetano Pitruzzella, who disappeared on Saturday,  
was found by local fishermen, said the state's deputy attorney

	Maldonado said Pitruzzella was dragged away by strong tides at  
Zipolite beach, which prevented his companions from attempting to

<HEADLINE> Angels' DiSarcina Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Anaheim shortstop Gary DiSarcina is expected  
to miss at least one month after breaking his left forearm at 
training camp in yet another freak accident for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina, a sound fielder who hit .287 last season, was injured  
Sunday. Following a round of batting practice, he blindly turned 
and walked into the swing of first-base coach George Hendrick, who 
was hitting ground balls to infielders. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina said he's generally a fast healer, so he's confident  
he'll be back before the Angels' opener April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be around all the time, running a lot, because I want to  
be with the guys,'' he said. ``This is not going to ruin our frame 
of mind entering the season. I'm determined to make sure of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angels manager Terry Collins said he overheard players in the  
training room asking aloud, ``When is this going to stop?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the spring of 1997, the Angels lost Chuck Finley for a few  
weeks when reliever Mike James accidentally lost control of a bat 
that hit the starting pitcher in the face and broke an orbital 
bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the season, Finley broke his wrist when he slipped while  
backing up home plate. The next game, catcher Todd Greene broke his 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it isn't going to stop. Maybe this is a team that will  
always face adversity and have to overcome it,'' Collins said. 
``But we will not let that injury change our attitude because 
DiSarcina will be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first workout for position players is scheduled for Tuesday.  
Collins said Craig Shipley, Jeff Huson, Luis Rivera, Andy 
Stankiewicz and rookie third baseman Troy Glaus will each get a try 
at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Craig can play shortstop because he has for me  
before,'' Collins said. ``I thought at one time Jeff Huson was 
going to be an outstanding major league shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rivera was an outstanding major league shortstop a few years  
ago. And Andy Stankiewicz grinds it out as good as any extra player 
I've been around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The intriguing possibility is Glaus, a first-round pick in 1997  
who played some shortstop during an All-American career at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We moved him to third because of Gary DiSarcina,'' Collins  
said. ``Had Gary not been on the team, Troy Glaus would still be 
playing shortstop.''

<HEADLINE> Profanity Found in TV Wrestling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A popular two-hour wrestling show on cable  
television averages only 36 minutes of actual wrestling -- leaving 
plenty of time for crotch grabbing, obscene gestures and simulated 
sexual activity, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	A detailed Indiana University study of 50 ``WWF Raw'' episodes  
last year on the USA network turned up a staggering amount of 
profane or risque incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, researchers counted 1,658 instances of a character  
grabbing or pointing to their own crotch -- or roughly eight every 
half hour, not counting slow-motion instant replays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see where an adult would be very concerned with the  
frequency at which these behaviors were aired, particularly at this 
time of day,'' said Walter Gantz, professor at Indiana's Department 
of Telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past year, wrestling programs on USA or TNT have  
consistently been among the highest-rated shows each week on basic 
cable. But they're far from the goofy fun of the old days. 
</P>
<P>
	The syndicated news show ``Inside Edition'' commissioned the  
Indiana University study for a two-part report airing this week. 
Reporter Matt Meagher said he became interested in looking at 
wrestling when his wife, a middle school teacher, told him about 
her students imitating the behavior seen on the shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers counted 157 instances of wrestlers or audience  
members making an obscene gesture and 434 times when people either 
said a sexually charged slogan or displayed one on a sign. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 128 episodes of simulated sexual activity and 47  
references to Satanic activity. One segment featured people 
supposedly draining blood from a ``dead'' wrestler and drinking it, 
Gantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also 609 instances of wrestlers or other being struck  
by objects like garbage cans or nightsticks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow they managed not to hurt each other,'' Gantz said.  
``I'm not certain that a 10-year-old realizes that they are skilled 
at doing this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Byrne, senior vice president of marketing for the World  
Wrestling Federation, said they were ``responsible broadcasters.'' 
WWF places a parental warning on ``WWF Raw'' and provides calmer 
programs during hours when children are more likely to watch, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``WWF Raw'' has plots like those in ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Beverly  
Hills 90210,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans are tuning in for the story lines and the fact that  
we are somewhat edgy makes it more attractive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A USA network representative had no immediate comment on the  
study.

<HEADLINE> Jones Case Judge Won't Step Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge Monday refused to step  
aside and let another judge decide whether to cite President 
Clinton for contempt over his testimony in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright said a conservative  
legal group did not provide sufficient grounds for why she should 
remove herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright had offered to consider stepping aside because of her  
contact with a House impeachment case manager and because her law 
clerk provided House managers with an affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	The only request that Wright step aside came from Judicial  
Watch, a legal group representing Dolly Kyle Browning, a witness in 
Mrs. Jones' case who said she had an affair with Clinton before he 
became president. 
</P>
<P>
	Judicial Watch said that Wright could be a witness against the  
president and that her stepping aside now would eliminate one 
ground for possible appeal later. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright is considering a contempt charge against Clinton over his  
remarks about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The president 
said in a 1998 deposition that he did not have a sexual 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He later acknowledged an 
``inappropriate relationship'' with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, Wright dismissed Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment  
lawsuit. The judge said she waited to address the contempt issue 
because of the president's impeachment trial and an appeal of Mrs. 
Jones' case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' case ended in an $850,000 settlement in December.  
</P>
<P>
	The punishment for contempt can range from a reprimand to a fine  
or jail.

<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Big Mac is back taking his big swings with  
the St. Louis Cardinals -- two days ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	After traveling by private jet Sunday night, Mark McGwire  
reported to the Cardinals' spring training camp. Cardinals co-owner 
David Pratt, who owns the jet, personally escorted McGwire in 
Monday morning 
</P>
<P>
	After hanging up pictures on his locker of his son, Matthew, and  
Pope John Paul II, whom he met in St. Louis last month, McGwire 
chatted with teammates, worked in the weight room, took batting 
practice. He then played table tennis with some other players on a 
new table set up in the clubhouse earlier in the day, then left. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the people in St. Louis, and here, will give him some  
space, let him go to a restaurant, go to the mall,'' Cardinals 
manager Tony La Russa said. ``I'm betting on the people in St. 
Louis. He's their guy. I can't imagine anyone would do anything to 
hurt him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who set the home run record last season by hitting 70,  
did not speak with reporters. The Cardinals have scheduled a news 
conference for Wednesday after the team's first full-squad workout 
of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was expected to join in a team party Monday night at a  
local restaurant to watch an episode of the TV show ``Mad About 
You.'' McGwire plays himself in the episode.

<HEADLINE> Senators Near Top on NHL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Ottawa Senators' days as NHL doormats are over. Now they're  
the ones doing the stomping. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it is great -- we can win any game,'' said captain  
Alexei Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about respectability, the once-lowly Senators suddenly have  
the second-best record in the Eastern Conference -- one point behind 
Philadelphia. Their 32-16-8 mark is just two victories shy of their 
franchise best set last season. 
</P>
<P>
	High times for an expansion team that broke into the NHL in  
1992-93 with a 10-70-4 record and had only a 51-224-23 mark after 
the first four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a good, hard-checking team and they are on you  
quick,'' Flyers coach Roger Neilson said after Saturday night's 4-1 
loss to the Senators. ``Once they got the lead, they didn't give us 
many opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's generally been the case of late for any team facing the  
surging Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa has lost only three of its last 25 games (17-3-5). Their  
18 wins at the Corel Centre are already a record for home games, 
and their 16 games over .500 is a club best. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five years ago, it was bad -- the worst team I have been on in  
professional sports,'' Yashin said. 
</P>
<P>
	For trivia fans, the original starting lineup of the Senators:  
Peter Sidorkiewicz in goal, Ken Hammond and Brad Shaw on defense, 
Neil Brady at center, Jody Hull on right wing and Sylvain Turgeon 
on left wing. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one consolation for a last-place team: a high draft  
pick after the season. The Senators slowly but steadily built 
through the draft -- getting Yashin in 1992 and Daniel Alfredsson in 
1994 -- and with trades such as the deal for Shawn McEachern in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	They began turning things around in the 1996-97 season,  
finishing 31-36-15 and earning their first playoff berth. Last 
season, they finished over .500 for the first time at 34-33-15 and 
raised some eyebrows by beating the Eastern Conference-leading New 
Jersey Devils in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Damian Rhodes was a hero in Ottawa then, considered the  
Senators' No. 1 goalie. This season, Ron Tugnutt has taken over the 
spotlight while sharing the goaltending load with Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tugnutt leads the NHL with a 1.57 goals-against average, and has  
been one of the backbones of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been playing very good defensively, and great  
goaltending is always a very important part of a hockey game and 
very important part of winning success,'' Yashin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks both Tugnutt and Rhodes are playing very well.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably why our team's been winning,'' Yashin said.

<HEADLINE> MOMA Presents Major Italian Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American lives may have no second acts, but some  
Italian lives are getting another chance -- on an American movie 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Second Act: Second Season,'' the Museum of Modern Art  
presents a series of postwar Italian films, most never commercially 
released in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of the show, which runs until March 2, include works  
by directors Federico Fellini, Lina Wertmuller, Sergio Leone and 
Francesco Rosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Italian filmmaking from the late 1940s onward has helped  
define the idea of contemporary cinema and introduce new narrative 
strategies and expressive styles,'' says Lawrence Kardish, MOMA's 
curator of film. 
</P>
<P>
	Alessandro Blasetti's ``Peccato Che Sia Una Canaglia'' (Too Bad  
She's Bad, 1955) is a comedy featuring the first onscreen teaming 
of Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren, as a Roman cab driver and 
the wily thief who wins his heart. The film spins on a politically 
incorrect, whimsical relationship in 1950s Italy -- a film era of 
romance wrapped in realism. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-week series which opened Thursday demonstrates that  
``film must be neither political nor correct. It's art,'' said 
Antonio Monda, a New York University professor of cinema who 
co-curated the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Also featured is Fellini's directorial debut, ``Luci del Varieta  
(Variety Lights, 1950), a love story in a vaudeville company 
starring Fellini's wife, Giulietta Masina; and Wertmuller's first 
film, ``I Basilischi (The Lizards, 1963), a look at provincial life 
in southern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Leone's ``Once Upon a Time in America,'' a 1984 film starring  
Robert DeNiro, didn't fare well with U.S. critics when first shown 
here. Some blamed the failure of the Prohibition-era epic on a 
shortened, edited version released for the American market. This 
time, the movie arrives in its original 218-minute, director's cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Another rarity, ``Milarepa,'' is director Liliana Cavani's 1973  
parable about a young man driven by a life crisis to search for a 
new existence through Buddhism. The film anticipates the 
alternative spirituality later addressed by directors such as 
Martin Scorsese and Bernardo Bertolucci. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk so much about Tibetan chic these days,'' says Monda.  
``But this is so much purer, simpler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A film that also touches on spirituality is the 1984 ``Il Futuro  
e Donna'' (The Future is Woman), directed by Marco Ferreri and 
starring Gerard Depardieu. The story of a married couple and a 
lonely woman who enters their lives ``is about the mystery of a 
pregnant woman, and the sacred act of giving birth,'' says Monda. 
``It's a tough, great film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the reference in the series title to F. Scott  
Fitzgerald's dictum -- ``There are no second acts in American 
lives'' -- Italian directors seem to create characters with endless 
options in the face of life's scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, MOMA presented its first ``Second Act'' of Italian  
films that have left an imprint, but have long been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's dozen films embrace three general themes -- the quest  
for spirituality, the individual caught in a socio-political drama, 
and the ``eternal'' soul of Italy's south.

<HEADLINE> USOC Waits, Worries About IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- If the top official of the  
Olympics is looking for a ringing endorsement for his leadership in 
dealing with the Salt Lake bribery scandal, he should look 
someplace other than the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In what has become a trend of distancing the USOC from the  
fallout of the Olympics' worst corruption case, executive director 
Dick Schultz said the International Olympic Committee might be 
unable to deal with needed reforms -- and that president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch might not necessarily be the right person for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``That depends who replaced him,'' Schultz said when asked if it  
would be in the best interest of the USOC for Samaranch to step 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a weekend meeting of the USOC's executive committee,  
Schultz said his faith that the IOC could come to grips with the 
worst corruption case in its history at an emergency session March 
17-18 was ``a wait-and-see thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they are going to fall apart,'' he said. ``But I  
don't think they will get all they are trying to get done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An ethics report on the bribery scandal surrounding Salt Lake  
City's successful quest for the 2002 Winter Games identified 24 IOC 
members -- a fifth of the membership -- who benefited from $1.2 
million in cash, travel, medical care and other improper 
inducements from Utah bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members have resigned or been expelled and another 13  
remain under investigation by the IOC, which has called the special 
session in Lausanne, Switzerland, to endorse the expulsions and 
consider reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Those under investigation include one of the most powerful  
people in international sports: Kim Un-yong, an IOC executive board 
member from South Korea and president of the international 
confederation of Olympic sports bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be interesting to see if they will be able to  
expel the people that, according to the information they have, they 
ought to expel,'' Schultz said. ``It's going to be an interesting 
meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting also will be asked to give a vote of confidence to  
Samaranch, who has been the target of increasing calls to resign in 
the wake of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those calls have come from outside the Olympic  
community, although international sponsors of the IOC -- most of 
them American based -- have complained loudly that not enough is 
being done to clean up the mess and retain the luster of their $50 
million investments in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz, who has maintained close ties with Samaranch since  
taking over at the USOC in 1995, did not call for the 78-year-old 
Spaniard to step down. But he also failed to give Samaranch 
overwhelming support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is that Samaranch can continue until they get some of  
these new things in place,'' Schultz said. Samaranch's term expires 
in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board last month recommended changes in the  
way Olympic host cities are picked, most notably taking the vote 
away from the rank-and-file and giving it to a 15-member 
commission. That proposal has been sharply criticized by members, 
who say they would be punished for the corruption of others and 
stripped of one of the few meaningful duties they have. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz, speaking at the end of a weekend USOC executive  
committee meeting, said he understood IOC leaders were preparing a 
longer list of recommendations to be presented at the March session 
and afterward. He did not have details. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president and a USOC executive  
committee member, was traveling Sunday and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC leadership was briefed by former Senate Majority Leader  
George Mitchell, whose independent ethics commission report on the 
Salt Lake scandal is due for release March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell told a news conference Saturday the report would focus  
on preventing other scandals as U.S. cities bid for the Olympics in 
2012 and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis will be on recommendations for rules, compliance  
and enforcement, which we hope, if adopted, will prevent the 
occurrences that led to the creation of the commission,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Javelin Change Wipes Out Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Jackie Joyner-Kersee will lose her  
heptathlon world record at the end of the year because of a design 
change to the javelin. 
</P>
<P>
	The world governing body of track and field said Monday that a  
new javelin with a slightly different center of gravity -- allowing 
it to land more frequently on its tip -- will go into use beginning 
April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee set the world record of 7,291 points at the 1988  
Seoul Olympics. The javelin is one of the seven events in the 
heptathlon. 
</P>
<P>
	The new world record will go into the books Jan. 1, 2000, and  
will come from the best performance with the new javelin, which 
will not go as far as the old implement. 
</P>
<P>
	The current women's javelin record of 262 feet 5 inches, set by  
Petra Felke of East Germany on Sept. 9, 1988, also will be erased. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF made a similar change to the men's javelin in 1986,  
wiping out Uwe Hohn's throw of 343-10. However, Daley Thompson's 
decathlon record of 8,847 points -- set with the same javelin -- was 
allowed to stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, there will be new records,'' said Giorgio Reineri,  
an IAAF spokesman. ``It is not a political decision, it's a 
technical decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee was not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee, who retired last year, won two Olympic gold  
medals in the heptathlon and one in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the IAAF elected to keep Thompson's decathlon record,  
Reineri said, ``I think they (the technical committee of the IAAF) 
believed what was done 13 years ago was a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the marks of Joyner-Kersee and Felke would be noted  
in IAAF records ``as coming under different conditions.''

<HEADLINE> Securitas To Acquire Pinkerton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Security services firm Pinkerton  
Inc. is being acquired by Securitas AB of Sweden for $384 million 
in a deal they say will create the world's largest full-service 
security firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton was founded in 1850 by Allan Pinkerton and is one of  
the world's best-known security providers, with annual revenue 
exceeding $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton has more than 250 offices and 48,000 employees  
throughout the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, Asia and 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger is a dramatic milestone for the security  
industry,'' said Thomas Berglund, Securitas president and chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have spent 10 years building a strong and comprehensive  
European platform and Europe still represents a huge potential for 
further growth and improved profitability. The acquisition gives us 
a strong second base for a duplication of the last 10 years of 
development in Europe,'' Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint announcement by Westlake Village-based Pinkerton and  
Stockholm-based Securitas said Securitas will pay $29 a share in 
cash for all outstanding shares of Pinkerton. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual revenue for the new company is expected to hit $3.5  
billion annually. It will employ 114,000 employees in more than 30 
countries in Europe, North and South America, and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined firm would account for about 5 percent of revenue  
generated in the global security market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This combination of two powerful security leaders will provide  
global corporations with access to a truly global network of 
security services,'' said Denis R. Brown, Pinkerton's chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are finding that U.S. corporations, in particular, are  
seeking to consolidate their security with fewer providers in order 
to create more integrated, well-planned security environments for 
their assets worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Securitas  
under the deal, which has been approved by the boards of both 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal requires regulatory approval.  
</P>
<P>
	Securitas said Brown would remain chief and become chairman of  
Pinkerton. Brown will also be nominated to the Securitas board.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Reach Steel Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia, facing the prospect of punitive  
tariffs on its steel shipments to the United States, agreed Monday 
to slash those shipments by 70 percent in return for continued 
access to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal with the United States, Russia will limit  
shipments of hot-rolled steel to levels that existed in 1996 and 
restrict shipments of 16 other types of steel to 1997 levels. That 
was before the global financial crisis triggered a surge in cheap 
imported steel into the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, struggling to deal with the  
political problems caused by a record-high trade deficit, said the 
deal would save American jobs and help the struggling Russian 
economy at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``These agreements deliver on the administration's commitment to  
respond vigorously to the surge in imports that has threatened the 
livelihoods of communities and workers around the nation,'' said 
Commerce Secretary William Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley acknowledged the administration was trying to strike a  
delicate balance between helping the U.S. industry and not shutting 
the door to all Russian steel at a time when the Russian economy is 
in a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a legitimate concern about taking Russia to its  
knees,'' Daley said, noting steel production accounts for 7 percent 
of Russia's total economic output. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. steel industry, its union and many of its  
supporters in Congress were quick to attack the agreement, saying 
it offered too little relief when a flood of imported steel is 
forcing production cutbacks, bankruptcies and thousands of layoffs 
at domestic steel plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Barnett, president of Bethlehem Steel Corp., said the  
industry was ready to bring suit in federal court if the 
administration implements the agreement as now written. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will have the effect of simply authorizing the continued  
dumping of Russian steel at below its cost of production into the 
American market and continue serious injury to our companies and 
the loss of steel worker jobs,'' Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement still allows too much steel to be imported at  
too low of a price,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry is pushing a bill in Congress that would  
impose worldwide quotas on the amount of steel that could be 
shipped into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure has attracted 167 co-sponsors, but the Clinton  
administration is opposed, arguing the approach would encourage 
protectionist retaliation and increase trade barriers around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia requested a negotiated settlement after the U.S. industry  
filed complaints charging Russia, Japan and Brazil with ``dumping'' 
steel in the United States at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department on Feb. 12 ruled against Japan and  
Brazil, announcing a preliminary determination for penalty duties 
as high as 80 percent on hot-rolled steel. That level of tariff 
would effectively block those two countries from the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, is now in a  
recession of its own because of the global financial turmoil. It 
asked the United States last week to begin negotiations on a 
``suspension agreement'' similar to the one Russia received Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But outside experts said such a deal would be harder to grant to  
Brazil because of the way U.S. law is written. The administration 
had more leeway to negotiate an agreement with Russia because it's 
classified as a non-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported last week that America's trade deficit  
surged by more than 50 percent last year to an all-time high of 
$168.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The global economic crisis has cut demand for U.S. exports while  
triggering cheaper imports into the country because of slumping 
demand in the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement with Russia, the annual quota for hot-rolled  
steel from that country was set at 750,000 metric tons with a floor 
put on the price this steel can be sold at, ranging from $255 to 
$280 per metric ton. Russia also agreed to an initial six-month 
moratorium on shipping any hot-rolled steel to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Russia agreed to separate quotas in 16 other steel  
product areas. Taken together, the quotas for hot-rolled and the 
other steel products will keep Russian shipments almost 70 percent 
below the levels reached in 1998 for the five years of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Commerce said it would not impose penalty tariffs on  
hot-rolled steel. Those could have ranged up to 218 percent.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Family Sues Tobacco Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Jesse Williams was a loyal smoker of  
Marlboro cigarettes for four decades until he died of lung cancer 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Now his wife and six adult children are seeking more than $110  
million in damages from Philip Morris Inc. in a lawsuit that goes 
to trial this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming in the wake of a San Francisco jury's stunning $51.5  
million award to a former smoker, a jury verdict could ``turn a 
fluke into a trend -- that is something the industry would terribly 
want to avoid,'' said John Banzhaf, a law professor at George 
Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	Banzhaf, who runs a nonprofit legal advocacy group, Action on  
Smoking and Health, said the Williams case is shaping up as another 
key battle in a campaign to make tobacco companies legally 
responsible for the health effects of their products. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it would do is multiply by many times the number of  
people who would want to bring these suits and the number of 
lawyers who want to take them,'' Banzhaf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Charles Tauman of Bennett, Hartman &AMP; Reynolds, one of  
three Portland firms representing the Williams family, declined to 
comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection begins today and opening arguments before  
Multnomah County Circuit Judge Anna Brown were scheduled to begin 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a retired Portland Public Schools employee, was  
diagnosed with small-cell carcinoma of the lungs in October 1996 
and died five months later at age 67. The family maintains that 
Philip Morris exploited Williams' inability to stop smoking and 
deceived the public about the health dangers and addictive nature 
of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit makes claims similar to Patricia Henley, 52, of San  
Francisco, who on Feb. 10 won punitive damages against Philip 
Morris that were three times the amount she had asked for. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal analysts said the tobacco companies' agreement last year  
to pay a $206 billion settlement with 46 states for the cost of 
treating tobacco-related illnesses might have made the industry an 
easier target, if jurors view the settlement as an admission of 
guilt and an indicator of how much money the industry has to spare. 
</P>
<P>
	A Philip Morris lawyer said the Henley verdict is unlikely to  
stand on appeal; two similar verdicts in Florida and one in New 
Jersey against cigarette makers were all overturned by appeals 
courts. Regardless, the Henley suit would have no bearing on the 
Williams case if jurors base their decision on the evidence, the

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Tokyo Share Prices Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Group of Seven nations' apparent approval of a  
weak yen sent the dollar to an 11-week high in Tokyo today. 
Japanese share prices finished higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.98 yen in late trading, up 1.92 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 121.15 
yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 158.63 points,  
or 1.13 percent, to close the day's trading at 14,256.67. On 
Friday, the average closed down 48.75 points, or 0.34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar climbed above 122 yen for the  
first time in 11 weeks after a weekend meeting of G-7 finance 
ministers and central bankers in Germany concluded without 
reference to the weaker yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors saw this as tacit acceptance of the currency's  
depreciation, and quickly bought up dollars, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-dollar sentiment was then reinforced when Bank of Japan  
Governor Masaru Hayami remarked after the meeting that the yen's 
recent weakness had been a ``desirable development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sentiment toward the dollar is really bullish. Overseas  
players who are short on dollars keep buying and buying,'' said 
Hajime Sato, assistant general manager of foreign exchange at Daiwa 
International Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's continued strength also derived from new U.S. data,  
released Friday, showing that the American economy remains robust. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that inflation  
remained tame, with consumer prices rising a barely perceptible 0.1 
percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade  
deficit in December narrowed unexpectedly to $13.8 billion, a 10 
percent drop over November. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged today from a low of 120.52 yen to a high of  
122.55 yen. In other currencies, the euro was traded at 134.40 yen, 
up from 134.17 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Japanese shares closed higher as the yen's  
retreat against the dollar prompted investors to buy 
export-oriented electronics and auto issues, including Toyota, 
Honda and Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	``International blue chips are rising as Hayami's comments  
indicated the dollar could continue to rise,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, 
general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker yen makes Japanese products more competitive in  
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of NEC Corp. also surged in value as investors expressed  
their approval for a major restructuring project the company 
announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The falling yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond -- an effect of moves by the Bank of Japan to curb 
rising interest rates -- drove up share prices as well, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower yields are a boon to companies, since they reduce the cost  
of borrowing money. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond yield dropped to 1.735 percent from Tuesday's finish of  
1.750 percent, driving its price up to 100.52 yen from 100.40 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 409 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, up from 402.96 million 
shares Friday. Advances outnumbered declines 840 to 296, with 157 
issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 14.41 points, or 1.32 percent, to 1,108.91 
points. The TOPIX closed down 0.77 points, or 0.07 percent, on 
Friday.

	Both Sides Rest in Dragging Case  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Dr. Tommy Brown, a pathologist, was the  
last of 43 prosecution witnesses to take the stand at the trial of 
John William King, one of the three white men accused of killing 
James Byrd Jr. last June because he was black. Brown said Byrd was 
conscious when he was dragged along a road by a chain around his 
ankles until his head was torn off by a concrete drainage duct. 
Prosecutors need to prove Byrd was alive when he was dragged in 
order to prove kidnapping and murder, which together would expose 
the alleged white supremacist to the death penalty. The defense 
also rested today, after presenting just three witnesses. Closing 
arguments were scheduled to begin tomorrow.

	Kosovo Albanians Deciding on Plan  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians met tonight to  
decide whether to accept a peace agreement for Kosovo by tomorrow's 
deadline. Negotiators for the ethnic Albanians were holding out for 
a referendum after three years that could pull them out of Serbia, 
while the Kosovo Liberation Army was bargaining for a future role 
in Kosovo. The plan calls for autonomy but not self-rule. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright has said that NATO would not carry out 
the threatened bombing strikes against Serbs if the agreement does 
not have full support from the Kosovar Albanians. Albright also met 
today with the Serbs, but without making any apparent headway in 
breaking down resistance to using NATO peacekeepers -- a key 
provision of the pact.

	Turkey Warns Greece Over Kurd Aid  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey asserted today it has a ``right to  
self-defense'' if Greece provides support to separatist Kurds -- a 
thinly veiled threat of military force against its neighbor and 
rival. The warning came as a Turkish newspaper reported that 
imprisoned rebel warlord Abdullah Ocalan had told interrogators 
that Greece gave his fighters weapons and training, claims that 
Greece has rejected in the past. Ocalan is expected to stand trial 
for waging a nearly 15-year insurrection in Turkey's southeast that 
has claimed an estimated 37,000 lives. Formal charges are expected 
to be filed tomorrow.

	Clinton Meets With Governors  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and the nation's governors  
grappled with differences over education policy, tobacco money and 
Internet sales taxes today. Clinton told the governors, ``I want to 
work with you.'' But he complained that some critics were trying to 
frame the political debate ``in partisan or ideological terms.'' 
Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Republican, said the issue of Internet 
taxes was ``the most difficult issue to solve.'' The governors are 
pushing for a system to collect sales taxes on Internet commerce, 
but the computer industry largely opposes the idea.

	Dow Gains 212.73 As Stocks Soar  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials climbed 212.73 points to  
9,552.68 one day before Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's 
semiannual testimony on the state of the economy. Today's point 
gain was the biggest in five weeks, leaving the Dow about 90 points 
shy of the record 9,643.32. On the NYSE, advancers led decliners 
1,953-1,061. The Nasdaq was up 58.41 at 2,342.01.

	Treatment Cuts Cervical Cancer Deaths  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A series of studies on cervical cancer has found  
that adding chemotherapy to radiation can cut the risk of death in 
half. Radiation has been the standard treatment since the 1950s for 
cervical cancer that has spread nearby, and the five-year survival 
rate for these women is now about 50 percent. The new studies 
proved so convincing that the National Cancer Institute took the 
unusual step of mailing letters to thousands of doctors urging them 
to adopt the new approach immediately.

	HMO Trade Group Urges Reviews  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As prospects for ``patients' rights''  
legislation brighten, the HMO trade group is urging its members to 
voluntarily let patients who are denied care appeal to outside 
experts. And fearful that Congress' legislation will give patients 
the right to sue HMOs, the American Association of Health Plans 
today endorsed a set of principles that could be used in an 
external review process. External appeals give patients the right 
to challenge decisions by appealing to doctors not associated with 
the insurance company.

	Astros' Alou May Miss Season  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Houston Astros outfielder Moises Alou has torn  
the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and likely will 
miss most, if not all, of the season. The All-Star hurt himself 
last week when he fell off a treadmill while training at his home 
in the Dominican Republic. Alou finished third in the NL MVP voting 
last season behind Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Papers Should Correct Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Newspapers can regain lost credibility with  
their readers by emphasizing fairness and by correcting errors 
quickly, a panel of editors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people expect us to be perfect, but they expect  
us to be honest and straightforward,'' said Karen Baker, senior 
editor of The News Tribune of Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more newspapers are explaining how they make  
judgments, and that helps our credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Baker was among 10 journalists who took part in a discussion  
of media credibility Saturday. The Scripps Howard Foundation 
sponsored the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Panelists discussed national surveys that indicate many  
Americans have lost faith in newspapers and broadcast news outlets. 
Many people doubt the fairness and accuracy of news reports because 
they see obvious errors and simple misspellings, the surveys say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly we have problems,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, president  
and chief executive officer of The Associated Press. But he also 
said the United States has the most free, vibrant press in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Woodruff, a CNN anchor who moderated the discussion, said  
every newsroom needs to have safeguards to ensure accuracy and 
fairness. CNN stepped up its awareness after retracting a report 
that the U.S. Army used chemical weapons on suspected deserters 
during the Vietnam War, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Panelists said credibility can be fostered by enacting firm  
newsroom policies against shoddy reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our reporters are told they will be fired for plagiarism,''  
said Mike Jacobs, editor of the Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Law on Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to use a Nevada  
case to clarify a 1996 federal law aimed at curtailing federal 
court access for state prison inmates who seek to challenge their 
state prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will decide, probably sometime in 2000,  
whether convicted killer Antonio Slack is entitled to have a 
federal judge study the arguments he raised in a 1995 appeal. Lower 
courts concluded that Slack's appeal was an abuse of his right to 
appeal and refused to consider the arguments it raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Slack was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to  
life in prison in 1990 for killing Alanna Holms, 12. He admitted 
killing the girl but said it had been an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Supreme Court upheld Slack's conviction in 1991,  
rejecting various constitutional issues his appeal had raised. 
Slack then sought help from a federal judge, in an appeal lawyers 
call a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. 
</P>
<P>
	State prison inmates are allowed to file such appeals if they  
contend that their state court prosecutions in some way violated a 
right protected by the federal Constitution. A 1996 law, the 
Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, limits most inmates 
to just one such appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Before state prosecutors could respond to Slack's federal court  
appeal, he asked that those proceedings be postponed until he could 
pursue additional claims in state appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal judge dismissed Slack's case without prejudice in  
1992, leaving him the chance to refile it after exhausting all 
state remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Slack lost those state appeals, and in early 1995 returned to  
federal court. But a federal judge last year threw out the appeal, 
ruling that it was abusive and illegal because it raised issues 
that were not contained in Slack's 1992 federal appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, turning away  
Slack's last July. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Slack's public defender argued,  
``Mr. Slack has never received an adjudication by the federal 
courts of any of his claims; and yet, the lower courts have ruled 
that his initial, uncounseled foray into federal court ... has 
essentially foreclosed him from raising all available claims during 
his initial round of federal habeas proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Slack vs. McDaniel, 98-6322.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Arrives at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Big Mac is back taking his big swings with  
the St. Louis Cardinals -- two days ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	After traveling by private jet Sunday night, Mark McGwire  
reported to the Cardinals' spring training camp. Cardinals co-owner 
David Pratt, who owns the jet, personally escorted McGwire in 
Monday morning 
</P>
<P>
	After hanging up pictures on his locker of his son, Matthew, and  
Pope John Paul II, whom he met in St. Louis last month, McGwire 
chatted with teammates, worked in the weight room, took batting 
practice. He then played table tennis with some other players on a 
new table set up in the clubhouse earlier in the day, then left. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the people in St. Louis, and here, will give him some  
space, let him go to a restaurant, go to the mall,'' Cardinals 
manager Tony La Russa said. ``I'm betting on the people in St. 
Louis. He's their guy. I can't imagine anyone would do anything to 
hurt him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who set the home run record last season by hitting 70,  
did not speak with reporters. The Cardinals have scheduled a news 
conference for Wednesday after the team's first full-squad workout 
of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was expected to join in a team party Monday night at a  
local restaurant to watch an episode of the TV show ``Mad About 
You.'' McGwire plays himself in the episode.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia Shares Jump 10 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Trading of Telecom Italia shares was briefly  
suspended today after they jumped more than 10 percent on Olivetti 
SpA's $58 billion weekend takeover bid for the Italian 
communications giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Premier Massimo D'Alema said the government wanted  
Telecom to stay in Italian hands but would keep neutral in the 
takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's biggest unions today called for an urgent meeting with  
D'Alema to discuss worries that a takeover would cost jobs. 
Telecom, the world's sixth-largest phone company, has some 126,000 
employees, mostly in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after the Milan market opened, shares of Telecom Italia  
and Telecom Italia Mobile shot up 10 percent from Friday's closing 
price. The shares later gave up a bit of their gains, but still 
were up about 7 percent. Telecom Italia owns 60 percent of Telecom 
Italia Mobile, Europe's biggest wireless telephone operator. 
</P>
<P>
	If Olivetti -- which is about a fifth of Telecom Italia in terms  
of market value -- pulls of the bid, it would be one of Europe's 
biggest deals ever. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Olivetti's filing with Italy's stock market regulatory  
body fails to provide all the information required by law, then 
Telecom Italia would be free to try to counter the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom, a former state monopoly, said Olivetti's bid is ``full  
of holes'' and scheduled a board meeting for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti announced a board meeting for Wednesday, when it plans  
to take steps towards approving the capital increase needed to 
complete the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	A potential problem for Olivetti could be its plan to raise some  
of the cash it needs by selling its investments in mobile operator 
Omnitel Pronto Italia, as well as fixed-line operator Infostrada, 
to Mannesmann AG, a German industrial holding company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government granted Omnitel's operating license on  
condition that it not be sold off for five years, and there is one 
year left to meet that proviso. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti and Mannesmann control those two via a holding company  
50.1 percent owned by Olivetti and 49.9 percent owned by 
Mannesmann, the biggest rival to the former German telephone 
monopoly Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany on Sunday, Mannesmann said it will pay Olivetti the  
equivalent of $8.45 billion for its stakes in Omnitel and 
Infostrada if the Telecom Italia takeover succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Possibly complicating maneuvers further is the Italian treasury  
ministry's so-called ``golden share'' in Telecom Italia, which was 
privatized in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	While holding just 3.4 percent of common stock, the ministry has  
veto powers over major decisions through 2000. Specifically, the 
state can block an investor's acquisition of more than 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's bid relies heavily on financing from three U.S.  
investment bankers -- Chase Manhattan, Lehman Brothers and 
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette -- as well as Italy's Mediobanca.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Plans To Sign With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- There were tears. There was talk of  
sex. There were obscenities. There was flamboyant fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Just another Dennis Rodman news conference.  
</P>
<P>
	And for all the commotion during Monday's latest installment of  
``As The Worm Turns,'' all that happened was this: Rodman moved 
closer to playing for the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The team hopes to have the seven-time rebounding champion in  
uniform ``sometime very soon.'' And Rodman, at one point in tears, 
said he hoped to sign a contract before Monday was through. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus ended an uncertain three weeks since the Lakers first made  
clear their desire to sign the 37-year-old tattooed forward, a 
member of five championship teams, including the last three with 
the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed conservatively -- for him -- except for a wide,  
multicolored hat and dark glasses, Rodman arrived 30 minutes late 
for his news conference. He was accompanied by his wife, actress 
Carmen Electra, agent Steve Chasman and sister Debra. But nobody 
from the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came a series of bizarre and conflicting statements. And  
the news conference ended abruptly after some 20 minutes with a 
tearful Rodman being asked if he had been selfish by not announcing 
a decision earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman began by saying he wanted to sign with the Lakers, but  
matters were incomplete. When angrily questioned why he called the 
news conference if he had no announcement to make, Rodman snapped: 
``You don't have to be here.'' Shortly thereafter he said he hoped 
to sign Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I'll be playing this week , and, hopefully, the  
Lakers and the people of California will accept me for who I am and 
what I do,'' he said. ``If not, I'll move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said he had spoken with Lakers owner Jerry Buss several  
times and hoped to sign a two- or three-year deal with the team. He 
insists he is in good shape and could immediately play 30 to 35 
minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would be reliable, pointing out he played 80 of  
a possible 82 regular-season games for the Bulls last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can count on me, you can count on me going to practice,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said the Lakers weren't a championship team now and must  
change their approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the guys want to be superstars,'' he said. ``Everybody has  
to play a role. This team doesn't understand that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he wasn't returning because of money.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy at all,'' he said, referring to the fact that  
the Lakers could offer him only a $1 million veterans' minimum, 
which would be prorated to under $500,000 because of the shortened 
season and the games he has missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will make me happy is if I can bring this city a ring  
just like I did in Chicago,'' he said. ``I'm here just because I 
want to make people happy. I miss entertaining. I miss entertaining 
for the people. I play for the people, I give the people what they 
want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It had been reported Rodman would receive an extra $3 million as  
part of his contract with Converse if he played in New York, 
Chicago or Los Angeles this season. But he said he was going to 
have to ``fight them in court to get that money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the news conference resembled an episode of ``The  
Jerry Springer Show'' -- although there was no fighting, Rodman used 
four-letter words and made sexual references about his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, when asked about being selfish, Rodman started crying  
and said, ``I'm never going to win, no matter what I do for this 
league, for the game of basketball, I'm never going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, opening a piece of paper, he said, ``I've got 10 charities  
here that I'm going to give $10,000 to. Even with this here, I'm 
still not going to win. You tell me if that's selfish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sister interjected, ``He doesn't have any money.''

	Rodman then waved off reporters and left the microphone a bit  
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers great Magic Johnson, a part-owner and vice president of  
the team, expressed relief that Rodman had made a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was tired of it dragging on because it was doing nothing but  
being a distraction for our players, the coach, as well as our 
franchise,'' Johnson said Monday in Indianapolis. ``We were just 
hoping this day would finally come, either tell us you're coming or 
tell us you're not coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy it's all over with. We know he's coming. Now  
coach (Del) Harris can get him in there, get him learning the plays 
in the system, try to get him in shape as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had criticized Rodman on David Letterman's show Thursday  
night, saying he was causing a distraction and he hoped the Lakers 
would ``just forget it.''

<HEADLINE> O'Neal, Pippen Fined for Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal was fined $10,000 Monday and  
Scottie Pippen received a $5,000 fine for their actions toward the 
referees over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal was upset with the officiating crew of Bennett Salvatore,  
Gary Benson and Tom Washington after Sunday's 92-89 loss at 
Seattle. O'Neal thought he was manhandled by Sonics center Olden 
Polynice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every team plays hack-a-Shaq defense and I still don't get the  
calls,'' he said. ``I'm going to start to break people up. Whatever 
it takes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they (the NBA) fine me.''  
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was ejected from Houston's 109-83 loss at Orlando.  
</P>
<P>
	He was called for a technical foul while sitting on the bench  
early in the fourth quarter, then was ejected after exchanging 
words with referee Hue Hollins with 4:41 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The fines were announced by Rod Thorn, the NBA's senior vice  
president of basketball operations.

<HEADLINE> US Warplanes Bomb Iraqi Radar Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes bombed Iraqi military sites  
today after being targeted by Iraqi radar in the northern 
``no-fly'' zone, the U.S. military said. 
</P>
<P>
	An unspecified number of U.S. F-15s dropped nine  
precision-guided bombs on Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery and radar 
sites near Mosul, the Germany-based U.S.-European command said in a 
statement sent to The Associated Press. Mosul is 250 miles north of 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the planes was damaged and all returned safely to their  
base of Incirlik, in southern Turkey. The statement said damage to 
the Iraqi sites was being assessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has challenged allied forces in the ``no-fly'' zones almost  
daily since December and has threatened to attack Turkey, Kuwait 
and Saudi Arabia if the U.S. and British flights continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied warplanes have barred Iraqi military flights over  
northern and southern Iraq since after the 1991 Persian Gulf War to 
protect Kurdish rebel and Shiite Muslim groups.

<HEADLINE> Running May Build Up Brain Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jogging might just build up your brain, a study  
in mice suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice that ran on an exercise wheel whenever they wanted created  
more new cells in one area of the brain than did mice that pursued 
other activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Now scientists are trying to find out if the extra brain cells  
make mice smarter. 
</P>
<P>
	So can jogging build up people's brain cells too?  
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to answer that question, you're going to have to  
do some experiments in humans,'' said Fred Gage of the Salk 
Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif. But ``more 
people in my lab have started running since we found this result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gage is senior author of the study, published in the March issue  
of the journal Nature Neuroscience. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a surprise, and it's not clear how to explain it,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study followed up on previous work that found mice created  
more new cells in the hippocampus, an area involved in learning and 
memory, if they spent time in a playground-like environment rather 
than a standard cage. The new work was aimed at pinpointing what 
kind of experience was responsible for the effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Some mice got to use the running wheel when they wanted to.  
Others were trained to learn the location of a hidden underwater 
platform, and still others swam. An injected chemical marker 
identified newly created brain cells in the hippocampus for each 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	William Greenough of the University of Illinois said the  
findings might indeed mean that jogging can boost the number of 
hippocampus brain cells in people. But it's also possible that 
people would require a different activity to get that effect, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> David Wells Reports to Blue Jays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- David Wells joined the Toronto Blue Jays  
today, four days after the World Series champion New York Yankees 
traded him for Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not knocking the Toronto Blue Jays, they're a fine  
organization,'' Wells said on his way into the clubhouse to take 
his physical, ``I've had my ups and downs with this organization, 
but you've got to turn over a new leaf and just move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells began his major league career with the Blue Jays in 1987  
and spent six years in Toronto before being released. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week, Wells was the toast of New York, a major  
celebrity following his perfect game against Minnesota last May. 
Following the stunning trade, Wells went to Miami for a few days of 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the business of baseball, it (stinks),'' Wells said.  
``But we have no reason to be discouraged because we're still 
playing the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto general manager Gord Ash said he has no intention of  
trading Wells. Cleveland and the New York Mets have been mentioned 
as possible suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not discuss any deals with David Wells,'' Ash said.  
``In the words of George Bush: Read my lips -- David Wells will not 
be traded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Graeme Lloyd, traded along with Wells and infielder  
Homer Bush, also returned to the familiar surroundings. He played 
in the Blue Jays' minor league organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks the same as it used to,'' Lloyd said. ``There are  
some different names now, but it's still the same situation.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Mike Lowell Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Marlins rookie third baseman Mike  
Lowell underwent surgery for testicular cancer and awaited 
pathology reports that will help determine further treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prognosis for recovery is excellent,'' general manager  
Dave Dombrowski said Monday. ``It is not a life-threatening 
situation. We will know much more in the next 24 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A small testicular mass was discovered Friday when Lowell  
underwent a routine physical examination. Lowell, 24, had a 
testicle removed Sunday in an outpatient operation at a Fort 
Lauderdale hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did run some tests that showed it had not spread, so that  
was tremendous news,'' Marlins owner John Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, who grew up in Miami, is a top prospect acquired Feb. 1  
from the New York Yankees for three pitching prospects. He's 
expected to battle veteran Kevin Orie for Florida's starting job at 
third base. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Lowell hit .304 at Triple-A Columbus with 26 home runs  
and 99 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlins pitchers and catchers opened spring training Monday.  
Lowell, due to receive the pathology reports Tuesday, is scheduled 
to begin workouts with other position players Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everything is OK, he's not going to skip a beat,'' manager  
John Boles said. ``He'd miss three or four weeks. He's in such good 
shape and he's such a strong young guy that he'd bounce back from 
this without any problem. The key is the pathology report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several prominent players have been stricken with cancer since  
1996, including Andres Galarraga, Brett Butler, Eric Davis and 
Darryl Strawberry. Galarraga, the Atlanta Braves' first baseman, 
was diagnosed just last week with a cancerous tumor in a bone in 
his back and will miss the 1999 season.

<HEADLINE> Levi Strauss To Slash 5,900 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Levi Strauss, the company that put baby boomers  
in jeans but has been shunned by today's teens, is closing 11 
plants and laying off 30 percent of its work force in the United 
States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks announced Monday are Levi's latest step to bridge a  
generation gap that has seen sales of its stodgy five-pocket jeans 
eroded by trendier offerings from the likes of Old Navy, the Gap, 
Tommy Hilfiger, MUDD and JNCO. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no buzz for Levi's anymore,'' said Irma Zandl, who  
runs the marketing consulting firm Zandl Group. ``They missed the 
beat over and over, and kids have just moved on to hipper brands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only one I know who wears Levi's is my dad,'' agreed Susan  
Chang, 15, of New York's borough of Queens, who wore a pair of JNCO 
jeans as she strolled down a Manhattan street Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have any styles I want,'' added her friend Sam Lee,  
15. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's will shutter 11 of its 22 plants in North America and lay  
off about 5,900 employees in the United States and Canada. Last 
year, it closed 13 U.S plants and cut more than 7,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization follows a tough year for Levi's, which  
watched its sales fall 13 percent to $6 billion. Levi's is 
privately held and doesn't disclose profits. 
</P>
<P>
	As it moves more production overseas -- where costs are much  
lower, Levi's said it will now have more time and money to spend on 
product development and marketing, two areas where it has been 
lagging in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's has been especially slow at spotting current fashions and  
producing products quickly. For instance, it failed to jump on the 
trends in recent years for super, wide-bottom slacks or cargo 
pants, which have large pockets on the thighs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is truly a fast-food consumer who we are dealing with out  
there,'' said John Ermatinger, president of the Americas division 
for Levi Strauss. ``We need to get better at getting intimate with 
our consumer and understanding what they want immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among initiatives to jump-start sales, Levi's will try to  
release new products every 60 days -- it used to take up to a year. 
It will work closely with retailers to develop merchandise 
exclusively for their stores, Ermatinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Levi's began a new advertising campaign called  
``What's True,'' featuring teens wearing its jeans in ways that fit 
their personal style. For instance, in one print ad, a young 
dreadlock-sporting youth wears dark, baggy Levi's while standing on 
a sidewalk with a sign that reads ``Conformity Breeds Mediocrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company is also arranging to have its baggy jeans and sexy  
shirts worn in movies and is using youthful celebrities such as 
actress Claire Danes to promote its brand.. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts said Levi's revival will depend on whether it  
can get the masses -- especially the teen population -- talking about 
its brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Levi's is very anxious to get cool again,'' said Zandl, the  
marketing consultant. ``But what they need is a marketing blitz 
that everyone notices and is talking about, like the dog in the 
Taco Bell ads or the Gap's great swing ad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Levi's focuses about winning back customers, thousands of  
its employees will lose their jobs in the next year. Levi's will 
close 10 U.S. plants and one in Ontario, Canada. Four plants in 
Texas will close, two in Tennessee, one in Georgia, one in 
Arkansas, one in Virginia, and one in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	At a sewing plant in El Paso, Texas, which makes 501 red tab  
jeans, 700 employees were told that their jobs would be terminated 
in the next year. It's the sixth Levi's plant to close in El Paso 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been working here for about 20 years and you know, it's  
like a family. I feel bad,'' said machine operator Thomas Alvarado, 
55, of El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's will be offering benefits packages to U.S. employees that  
include up to three weeks of severance pay for each year of 
service, extended medical coverage and up to $6,000 towards 
training, education and business start-up expenses.

	Fighting Breaks Out in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces battled ethnic Albanian  
rebels northwest of Pristina today as negotiators tried desperately 
to save the Kosovo peace process. It was initially reported that 
Serb police were separating men from women and children in two 
ethnic Albanian villages near the fighting, which was the precursor 
to past group slayings, but one official said the report was 
untrue. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
says the latest fighting began when about 10 Serb military vehicles 
came under fire. But ethnic Albanians say the fighting started when 
government troops attacked three villages. There is no word on 
casualties. 

</P>
<P>
	Albright Seeks Help for Kosovo Deal  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
pressured ethnic Albanians today to sign a Kosovo peace accord, so 
the full focus of diplomacy could be aimed at the holdout Serbs. A 
U.S. official said the future of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army 
remained a sticking point for the ethnic Albanians. Under the 
proposed three-year interim plan, the KLA would be disarmed. Serb 
negotiators say they are prepared to sign a deal giving Kosovo 
Albanians wide autonomy, but they refuse a military annex to the 
agreement that calls for up to 30,000 NATO troops to enforce the 
deal. The NATO-imposed deadline for peace is less than 24 hours 
away. NATO has threatened to launch airstrikes on Yugoslavia if the 
sides don't agree.

	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes bombed Iraqi military sites  
today after being targeted by Iraqi radar in the northern 
``no-fly'' zone, the U.S. military said. An unspecified number of 
U.S. F-15s dropped 11 precision-guided bombs on Iraqi anti-aircraft 
artillery and radar sites near Mosul, officials said. U.S. and 
British planes also struck in the southern no-fly zone today after 
two Iraqi planes crossed into the zone. Allied warplanes have 
barred Iraqi military flights over northern and southern Iraq since 
after the 1991 Persian Gulf War to protect Kurdish rebel and Shiite 
Muslim groups.

	CIA Killer Wants Intervention  
</P>
<P>
	WAVERLY, Va. (AP) -- The convicted killer of two CIA employees  
wants the International Court of Justice to hear his case. Mir 
Aimal Kasi of Pakistan said he hasn't received justice in the 
United States and should be considered a political prisoner who 
``did my moral duty by attacking CIA.'' Kasi gunned down CIA 
communications worker Frank Darling, 28, and CIA analyst and 
physician Lansing Bennett, 66, as they sat in their cars at a 
stoplight. He said he was angry over the agency meddling in Muslim 
nations. Without intervention by the international court, Virginia 
will execute Kasi when his appeals are spent.

	New Arrest in Omagh Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Police arrested an eighth man  
today on suspicion of involvement in last year's car bombing in 
Omagh, the deadliest attack in the 30 years of Northern Ireland's 
conflict. Twenty-nine people were killed and about 370 were wounded 
by a bomb that tore through a crowd of Protestants, Catholics and 
Spanish tourists in the market town 60 miles west of Belfast. All 
of those arrested are allegedly members of an Irish Republican Army 
dissident group.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is urging advertisers and

minority listeners. Vice President Gore and the chairman of the 
Federal Communications Commission will be making the pitch today at 
an advertising conference. The FCC head is expected to suggest that 
the advertising and broadcasting industries develop a voluntary 
code guided by the principal of ``fair competition.'' A by the FCC

<HEADLINE> Ravens Logo Lawsuit Verdict Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A federal judge has upheld a jury's verdict  
that the Baltimore Ravens copied their logo design from a security 
guard, who sued the NFL franchise for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion dated Feb. 19, U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis  
denied the team's request for a new trial, saying the jury's 
verdict last November was ``supported by adequate evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also rejected defense lawyers' suggestion that one juror was  
coerced by a deadlocked panel into deciding in favor of security 
guard Frederick Bouchat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens contend the design was created by league artists at  
NFL Properties in New York without any input from Bouchat. The 
Ravens' logo features outspread raven wings flanking a shield 
bearing the letter ``B.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchat, a former security guard, claims that while working at  
the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation in downtown 
Baltimore, he decorated a Cleveland Browns helmet with a logo he 
designed shortly after state officials lured the Browns to 
Baltimore in November 1995. He says he placed the helmet on his 
desk in the building's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts to be called dishonest by the court system, and  
that's basically what's happened so far,'' Ravens spokesman Kevin 
Byrne said Monday. ``We hope to prove our integrity down the 
line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's lawyer, John Paul Reiner, and NFL officials could not  
be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchat declined to comment on the ruling, referring the matter  
to his attorneys. But the judge's decision bolstered Bouchat's 
claim, said his lawyer, Howard Schulman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident that the verdict will hold up,'' Schulman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount Bouchat will receive will be determined at a later  
hearing before another federal jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate motion, the judge opened the way for Bouchat's  
lawyers to investigate a Ravens' employee's claim the team had 
Bouchat's design at their headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Ravens will likely appeal, Garbis wrote ``it cannot be  
said that any further evidence relating to the Ravens' access (to 
the logo design) is, necessarily, moot.''

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Under Interrogation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Imprisoned rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan  
has provided interrogators with a detailed accounting of Greek aid 
to his rebel group, the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, a Turkish 
newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's president, meanwhile, used forceful language to warn  
rival Greece against supporting the Kurdish insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Greece chooses to continue with its illegal actions, we  
retain our right to take the necessary precautions for our right to 
self-defense which arises from international law,'' the state-run 
Anatolia news agency quoted Suleyman Demirel as telling Philippines 
television while on a visit to Manila. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan, captured in Kenya a week ago and taken to a Turkish  
prison island, is expected to stand trial for waging a 15-year war 
of insurrection that has claimed around 37,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The national daily newspaper Hurriyet said Ocalan had  
acknowledged that Greece provided his guerrilla army with weapons 
and training, as well as a Greek Cypriot passport he used in his 
travels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greece has for years supported the PKK movement. They even  
gave us arms and rockets. Greek officers gave guerrilla training 
and explosives training to our militants'' at a camp in Lavrion, 
Greece, the newspaper quoted Ocalan as telling interrogators. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has frequently alleged in the past that Greece provides  
backing to the PKK, which it -- like the United States -- considers a 
terrorist group. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response to the allegations in Greece,  
where today was a public holiday. Lavrion is the site of a United 
Nations refugee center, housing mainly Kurdish refugees from 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to past Turkish allegations, the camp has been  
examined repeatedly by international observers, who were unable to 
substantiate charges it served as a military training center for 
the PKK. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the interrogation sessions were being  
videotaped, but did not say how it had obtained the rebel leader's 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Ocalan had also told investigators of Greek  
assistance during five months of wandering as he attempted to find 
a country that would give him asylum. Just prior to being seized by 
Turkish commandos, he had been sheltering at the Greek ambassador's 
residence in Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has been harshly critical of Greece's aid to Ocalan and  
the PKK, and is demanding some form of censure of Greece by the 
European Union -- of which Greece is a member but Turkey is not. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ocalan affair has caused a political storm in Greece, with  
top government officials losing their jobs in the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope Greek politicians may come to realize that dialogue  
with Turkey would be a much safer way of addressing common problems 
than giving support to terrorism,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit 
told reporters Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan has not yet been formally arrested. At the time of his  
capture, he was already on trial in absentia on terrorism charges. 
A new set of formal charges could come this week.

<HEADLINE> Marine Pilot Called 'Reckless' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine Corps pilot intentionally  
flew low and fast before his EA-6B Prowler cut a ski gondola cable 
and killed 20 people, an accident expert testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was reckless,'' Bernard Coogan said. ``There was no need to  
be down in that valley so low at that speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coogan testified as the manslaughter trial for Capt. Richard  
Ashby entered its third week. Ashby, 31, was at the controls of the 
Prowler on Feb. 3, 1998 when it cut the cable at Cavalese, Italy, 
killing everyone on the gondola. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Ashby was flying too low and fast, against  
regulations. The defense contends Ashby was the victim of a faulty 
radar altimeter, a map that didn't have the cables on it and that 
an optical illusion made him think he was higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Coogan, a former military pilot who has investigated more than  
1,000 aircraft accidents, said he concentrated his examination on 
the final six to eight seconds of the Prowler's flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a three-dimensional topographical map of the valley with  
radar plots and witness statements, Coogan traced the Prowler's 
flight path. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby didn't have a good military reason to fly so low -- the  
cables were struck under 400 feet -- because he didn't time the 
flight, Coogan testified. Usually, a low level flight is run 
against the clock, so at best the flight was an orientation run 
that should have been conducted at higher altitude, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Ashby's squadron testified last week they never were  
told about a 2,000-foot winter altitude limit over the snow-covered 
mountains. Coogan said the minimum altitude was increased from 
1,000 feet four months before the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's speed along the route was at least about 590 mph, Coogan  
said, but a better speed would have been around 480 mph. The jet 
also deviated from the center line of the route by more than a mile 
and a half at times, he said, which showed a lack of concentration. 
</P>
<P>
	Coogan said the radar altimeter wasn't a critical instrument  
during the low-level flight because a pilot flying low should spend 
his time looking outside. He also said there was no optical 
illusion to make Ashby think his flight, at times lower than 
buildings perched on mountainsides, was higher than it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Coogan, who flew for the CIA in Vietnam, said under cross  
examination that he had not flown a military plane since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and  
one count each of destruction of private property, destruction of 
government property and dereliction of duty. If convicted, he could 
receive a maximum sentence of more than 200 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> States Target Sweepstakes Gimmicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Opposition to gimmicks used in mail-in  
sweepstakes may get a boost this week when attorneys general from 
nine states and representatives from 16 others gather here to 
discuss the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	States have battled sweepstakes companies using lawsuits, but  
that approach is often costly. The multi-state meeting is geared 
toward seeking further agreements with the industry and new laws 
that might help consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the only tool we have to deal with deception and  
fraud in the sweepstakes industry is to file a lawsuit, and that's 
a very inefficient way of dealing with the problem,'' Indiana 
Attorney General Jeff Modisett said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana has lawsuits pending against American Family Publishers  
and Publishers Clearing House, two of the giants in the industry, 
claiming they use deceptive mailings to trick people into 
purchasing magazines and other products to help their chances at 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies say they promote their disclaimers prominently  
and have paid out millions of dollars to winners, including many 
who didn't purchase a thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states have filed similar lawsuits against sweepstakes  
companies and settlements have been reached in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Other attorneys general planning to attend the meeting, which  
starts Wednesday, are from Oklahoma, Florida, Mississippi, 
Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Raines, of Willard, Mo., is coming to Indianapolis for the  
meeting to share the story of her father Neil Hancock, who died in 
April at age 80. After taking control of his finances in 1997, 
Raines discovered he had written dozens of checks totaling $102,000 
to contest promoters over a four-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	She begged him to stop sending money.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of course he wasn't about to because he thought he was in the  
final stages of winning $12 million or $35 million or whatever,'' 
Raines said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say they are legally within the limits, that you're a  
winner only if your number is selected, in small print. But they do 
a lot of things I think are unfair and deceptive and to me it's a 
crime, because they are targeting the elderly,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits companies from requiring a purchase or  
charging a fee to people who enter sweepstakes. People who don't 
buy magazine subscriptions, for example, must have the same chance 
of winning a prize as people who make a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a bill filed in the U.S. Senate earlier this month,  
sweepstakes that use deception to lure people into buying products 
could be fined up to $2 million.

<HEADLINE> Rough Weather Stalls Ship Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Rough weather forced Coast Guard crews to  
stop pumping oil from the grounded cargo ship New Carissa again, 
shifting efforts today to preparing to tow the broken bow section 
out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
	An 825-yard cable being flown in from the Netherlands was  
expected to arrive today, allowing a tug to take another try at 
pulling the bow from the beach when the weather allows, perhaps 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A team was flown by helicopter to the ship today to assess the  
extent of fractures that have been growing in the bow section over 
the course of 19 days grounded in the pounding surf. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy surf from a winter storm forced pumping from the ship to  
tanks on shore to stop Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 100,000 gallons of liquid has been pumped into  
containers on shore. Because it is a mixture of oil and water, 
crews could not immediately determine how much of the estimated 
135,000 gallons of fuel oil remain on board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are definitely going to try to get the ship off, even if  
there is some oil still on,'' said Mike Szerlog, the Oregon 
Department of Environmental Quality's on-scene representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Pumping began about 6 p.m. Saturday and was stopped at midnight  
because of high tide and heavy surf threatening the hose lines. It 
had resumed shortly after noon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy explosives team set the ship afire in a spectacular blast  
on Feb. 11, and the burning ship broke in two by the next morning. 
The bow section of the 640-foot vessel still had one-third of the 
original 400,000 gallons of gooey black fuel oil aboard, despite 
the efforts to burn it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the ship drifted aground Feb. 4, at least 70,000 gallons  
have leaked into the ocean along one of the most environmentally 
sensitive beaches in the state. Biologists have found oil coating 
27 of the 97 snowy plovers that have been counted in Oregon. The 
bird is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 70 dead birds have been found, 32 of them oiled.  
Another 50 birds were in rehabilitation Sunday, including 15 snowy 
plovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather will be a factor in the decision to begin towing, but  
rough seas actually may lend salvage crews a hand by rocking the 
ship free. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for weather to pick up a little to help get the  
vessel off the sand,'' said Coast Guard Chief Gene Maestas.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co. Tops Soft Money List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tobacco giant Philip Morris, which pushed for  
defeat of anti-smoking legislation last year, gave $2.4 million in 
so-called soft money to the two major political parties over the 
last two years, the advocacy group Common Cause said Monday. The 
company gave more than any other contributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris contributed $2 million to the Republicans and  
$419,164 to the Democrats, between Jan. 1, 1997, and Dec. 31, 1998, 
according to Common Cause, which supports public financing of 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans last June killed legislation that would have  
raised an estimated $516 billion over 25 years through a $1.10 tax 
increase on a pack of cigarettes and would have given the 
government new authority to regulate nicotine. Philip Morris also 
was the biggest soft money giver during the 1995-96 election cycle, 
Common Cause said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money is not subject to federal contribution limits and is  
supposed to be used for party-building activities such as 
get-out-the-vote drives. Increasingly, the money is being used for 
issue advertisements that support or oppose a political party but 
do not specifically urge a vote for or against a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	In helping to defeat the bill, the tobacco industry gave more  
than $40 million in the first half of 1998 lobbying Congress and 
another $40 million on television commercials opposing the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tobacco company, R.J. Reynolds, contributed $1.1 million  
in soft money, $1 million of that to the GOP, in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	The second- and third-largest soft money givers during the  
1997-98 election cycle were labor unions that made all of their 
contributions to the Democrats: the Communication Workers of 
America, $1.5 million, and the American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees, $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions strongly opposed a Republican plan to require them to get  
the written consent of their members before using dues for 
political purposes. Labor also opposed legislation allowing 
President Clinton to bring trade agreements to Congress for a 
straight yes-or-no vote without amendments, a procedure known as 
fast track. Both proposals failed to pass in the last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties overall raised $193 million in soft money during the  
1997-98 election cycle, more than double the $85 million they took 
in during the previous off-year elections, 1993-94.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jan Hawkins, a Cambridge University Press editor  
who worked to bring computers into schools, died of breast cancer 
on Feb. 9. She was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hawkins had been teaching on the education faculty at  
Harvard University and also served as director of the Center for 
Children and Technology, where she had worked since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cambridge University Press, she worked on the ``Learning by  
Doing'' series, and often helped museums and schools bring 
computers and other technology into their programs.

<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Ill. (AP) -- Glass artist and designer Michael  
Higgins, half of the husband-wife team who created the colorful and 
sought-after ``higgins'' glass, died Feb. 13 at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the household objects he and his wife Frances created  
from vividly colored fused glass over their 50-year joint career 
are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the 
Smithsonian Institution, the Corning Glass Museum and London's 
Victoria and Albert Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s and '60s, the couple worked with major glass  
manufacturers and potteries to adapt their techniques for mass 
production, but in 1966 they moved to Riverside to return to 
independent studio work.

<P>
	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- The Rev. Walter Lini, the father  
of independence for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, died on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death of the Anglican priest, who was born in 1942,  
was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanuatu, formerly known as the New Hebrides, gained independence  
from joint British and French rule in 1980. It has about 170,000 
residents, and is 1,200 miles northeast of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lini served as the fledgling republic's prime minister from  
independence until he was ousted in 1991. He since had other 
Cabinet roles, including deputy prime minister for most of last 
year. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Wilmer Mizell    	
</P>
<P>
	Kerrville, Texas (AP) -- Former congressman and major league  
baseball pitcher Wilmer ``Vinegar Bend'' Mizell died Sunday while 
visiting his wife's family. He was 68 and had suffered a heart 
attack four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mizell, who lived in Midway, N.C., served from 1968 to 1974 as  
the representative from North Carolina's 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
	Mizell acquired his nickname from the place where he grew up,  
Vinegar Bend, Ala. From 1952-62, he pitched for the St. Louis 
Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, Mizell helped the Pirates win the World Series. He  
posted a 13-5 record with a 3.12 ERA that season with the Cardinals 
and Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from baseball, Mizell was elected as a  
commissioner in Davidson County. After he lost his U.S. House seat 
in 1974, President Gerald Ford appointed the Republican as 
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Ronald Reagan picked him to become an assistant  
secretary of agriculture for governmental affairs -- the agency's 
top lobbyist in Congress.

	HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Ralph F. Reikowsky, a longtime  
editor with the Washington Post, died Friday. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not available.  
</P>
<P>
	Reikowsky was an editor for the Washington Post for 32 years  
until his retirement in 1982. After his retirement he moved to 
Hendersonville. 
</P>
<P>
	He served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II.

                           *Paul Schmidt    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul Schmidt, who translated Arthur Rimbaud's  
poems and Anton Chekhov's plays and worked in avant-garde music and 
theater for much of his life, died Friday from complications from 
AIDS. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert in Slavic languages, Schmidt spent many years  
translating the writings of Velemir Khlebnikov, an obscure Russian 
poet who died in 1922. Schmidt brought Khlebnikov's play 
``Zangezi'' to the stage in Los Angeles in 1986. It later ran at 
the Brooklyn Academy of Music. 
</P>
<P>
	For the academy's 1995 Next Wave Festival, he composed a  
libretto for the opera ``Alice,'' which was based on Lewis 
Carroll's ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ``Through the 
Looking Glass.'' Composer Tom Waits and director Robert Wilson 
collaborated on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt's collection of Rimbaud translations, titled ``A Season  
in Hell'' after the poet's masterpiece by the same name, was 
published in 1997, with photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe.

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Film critic Gene Siskel, known for the thumbs-up  
and thumbs-down reviews he and Roger Ebert shared on their popular 
TV show, died Saturday. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel had surgery in May to remove a growth from his brain, but  
returned to the syndicated television show ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' soon 
afterward. He announced earlier this month he was taking time off 
from that show to spend time recuperating from the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel wrote movie reviews for the Chicago Tribune and also did  
reviews for ``CBS This Morning,'' WBBM-TV in Chicago and TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel and Ebert were likely the most recognizable movie critics  
in the nation. Their trademark ``thumbs-up'' and ``thumbs-down'' 
reviews became a benchmark for the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Their show's continuing success was largely attributed to the  
chemistry between the tall, balding Siskel and the heavyset Ebert. 
They appeared to practice a one-upmanship that was in the tradition 
of the rivalry of their newspapers. Ebert is a critic for the 
Chicago Sun-Times.

</P>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- Joseph E. Tawil, an Archbishop Emeritus of  
the Melkite Catholic Diocese in Newton, died Wednesday. He was 86 
and had Parkinson's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Tawil was appointed Patriarchal Vicar in Alexandria and was  
consecrated bishop in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, Tawil was appointed Apostolic Exarch for the United  
States by Pope Paul VI. He succeeded Bishop Justin Najmy, the first 
Melkite bishop in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Melkites are part of the Eastern Rite, a group of Catholic  
churches organized under ethnic lines and traceable to the churches 
established during the earliest days of Christianity. Melkites 
accept the authority of the pope but have considerable autonomy in 
ritual. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure, Tawil founded eight new parishes and five  
missions.

<HEADLINE> Chilean IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Chile's Sergio Santander became the latest Olympic  
executive touched by the Salt Lake City scandal when he resigned 
Monday as president of his country's national Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-year-old Santander, facing explusion from the IOC, has  
admitted receiving $4,700 from Tom Welch, former president of the 
Salt Lake City bid organizers, but called it a personal 
contribution to an unsuccessful political campaign in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander cited medical reasons for stepping down, but asked to  
remain in the job until March 31 ``to retrieve my personal 
belongings and formally finish various administrative matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC plans to end its investigation this weekend into  
possible misconduct by members implicated in the Salt Lake City 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials said Monday the six-man investigative panel  
will begin meeting late this week at International Olympic 
Committee headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have three options,'' said one panel member, speaking on  
condition of anonymity. ``We can exonerate (members). We can issue 
a warning or propose a warning, or we recommend expulsions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings will be private, with no news conferences or  
announcements planned, pending final decisions by the IOC executive 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do hope we will have completed our work by the end of the  
week,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard said. ``We will then 
prepare recommendations for the executive board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No board meeting is scheduled until March 14-15, just before the  
March 17-18 general assembly called to deal with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said it is possible the board could decide earlier by  
conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to the executive board if they want to wait until the  
14th or take a decision next week,'' he said. ``In any case, there 
will probably be nothing to announce before early next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the IOC inquiry panel recommended the expulsions of  
six members for accepting cash payments, scholarships for their 
relatives or other inducements stemming from Salt Lake City's bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those six members has since resigned, joining two others  
who had quit previously. The IOC panel notified three other members 
they were still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, 10 additional members were cited for possible rules  
violations in a report by a Salt Lake City ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cases of expulsion will be put to next month's general assembly,  
where a two-thirds vote is required for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the previous cases, the IOC sent letters seeking  
explanations to those members named in the Salt Lake report. The 
members were given a chance to reply in writing or in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to study the files for which we've sent letters  
to all the members on the second list,'' the panel member said. 
``The general interest is to decide on the cases as soon as 
possible, especially for the members themselves whose names have 
been mentioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official said he believes the commission will also complete  
its inquiry into the three previous pending cases involving South 
Korea's Kim Un-yong, Russia's Vitaly Smirnov and Ivory Coast's 
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, a senior IOC executive board member, is the highest-ranking  
official implicated in the Salt Lake case. He was cited in both the 
IOC's internal investigation and that of the Salt Lake ethics 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has mounted an aggressive defense, describing the  
allegations against him as a politically motivated plot to smear 
his name and undermine his ambitions to succeed Juan Antonio 
Samaranch as IOC president. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel member said it's possible that not all remaining cases  
will be completed this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not unthinkable that we might need more information on  
one or two cases,'' he said. ``This is a serious matter. You are 
not going to judge on incomplete documents or information. You 
cannot rule out that some cases will be deferred to the future. I 
would hope not in the interest of the members themselves, but you 
cannot be sure.''

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A spring full of optimism turned cloudy Monday for the Houston  
Astros when they learned All-Star outfielder Moises Alou will 
likely miss most, if not all, of the season because of a knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou, who hit .312 with 38 home runs and 124 RBIs in helping win  
the NL Central championship, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in 
his left knee last week when he fell off a treadmill at his home in 
the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros hoped the injury was not serious, but an MRI in  
Houston revealed a torn ACL. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a devastating blow for our team,'' Astros general  
manager Gerry Hunsicker said by telephone from training camp in 
Kissimmee, Fla. ``Clearly, this was the worst-case scenario we 
could have imagined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minus Alou, a World Series star for the Florida Marlins in 1997,  
the Astros will rely on Carl Everett and young Richard Hidalgo to 
fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anaheim Angels also need to make adjustments while shortstop  
Gary DiSarcina is sidelined for at least one month because of a 
broken left forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina, a sound fielder who batted .287 last season, broke  
the arm in a freak accident Sunday at camp in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking batting-practice swings, he blindly turned and  
walked into the swing of first-base coach George Hendrick, who was 
hitting ground balls to infielders. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it had to happen, I wish George Hendrick would have got  
hit, not Gary,'' joked Angels manager Terry Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said Craig Shipley, Jeff Huson, Luis Rivera, Andy  
Stankiewicz and rookie third baseman Troy Glaus will each get a try 
at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	David Wells, meanwhile, showed up at camp for his new team and  
offered an immediate assessment of the trade that sent Roger 
Clemens to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Toronto got the better part of the deal,'' Wells said  
at the Blue Jays' camp in Dunedin, Fla. ``The key to winning is 
pitching and this team has some good pitchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto general manager Gord Ash, who got the big lefty,  
reliever Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush for Clemens 
last week, said he intends to keep Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not discuss any deals with David Wells,'' Ash said.  
``In the words of George Bush: Read my lips -- David Wells will not 
be traded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets and Cleveland supposedly are interested in  
Wells, who went 18-4 during the regular season and 4-0 in the 
postseason for the World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The player certain to attract the most attention this spring --  
Mark McGwire -- also made an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	After hanging up pictures on his locker of his son, Matthew, and  
Pope John Paul II, whom he met in St. Louis last month, McGwire 
talked with St. Louis Cardinals teammates at Jupiter, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also worked out in the weight room, took batting  
practice and played table tennis on a new table set up in the 
clubhouse earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire did not speak to media about his 70-homer season. He  
will hold a news conference Wednesday after the team's first full 
squad workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the people in St. Louis, and here, will give him some  
space, let him go to a restaurant, go to the mall,'' Cardinals 
manager Tony La Russa said. ``I'm betting on the people in St. 
Louis. He's their guy. I can't imagine anyone would do anything to 
hurt him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was expected to join in a team party Monday night at a  
local restaurant to watch an episode of the TV show ``Mad About 
You.'' McGwire plays himself in the episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle, meanwhile, took his first swings for the Baltimore  
Orioles in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather have come to Baltimore than the Yankees,'' said  
Belle, who worked out two days early. ``You look at their 
situation, they're the kingpin and you want to be that underdog 
that knocks them off the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty much the situation I've been in my whole career.  
It just makes for a better season when you knock the big guys off 
the top,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida rookie third baseman Mike Lowell, however, was  
recovering after undergoing surgery for testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A small mass was found during a routine physical examination  
Friday, and Lowell had a testicle removed Sunday in an outpatient 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prognosis for recovery is excellent,'' general manager  
Dave Dombrowski said. ``It is not a life-threatening situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, a top prospect acquired from the New York Yankees on  
Feb. 1, was expected to be the Marlins' starting third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell was scheduled to begin workouts with other position  
players Friday at Melbourne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins began workouts Monday and among the players taking  
part was pitcher Alex Fernandez. He took another step in his 
recovery from rotator cuff surgery by throwing for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice to be in uniform again and be around the guys and  
participate like a regular ballplayer,'' said Fernandez, who missed 
all of last year. ``It was emotional for me, but the most important 
part is that I felt very good.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Employee Contradicts Exec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Directly contradicting Microsoft's most senior  
executives, including Chairman Bill Gates, an employee accused of 
conveying an illegal proposal to a software rival insisted Monday 
he didn't believe the rival, Netscape, posed a threat to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Rosen, general manager for new technology at Microsoft  
Corp., testified before a judge who was clearly unimpressed with 
his answers and to muted laughter from the courtroom audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates once criticized Rosen in  
e-mail to another Microsoft executive as ``a little naive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway through Rosen's testimony Monday, U.S. District Judge  
Thomas Penfield Jackson urged Justice Department lawyer David Boies 
to ``accelerate the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, when Boies complained in a private meeting among  
lawyers and the judge that Rosen's answers were causing delays, 
Jackson empathized: ``I know exactly what he is doing, Mr. Boies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen was an important witness because he led a Microsoft  
delegation in June 1995 to a disputed meeting with executives from 
Netscape Communications Corp., whose own Internet browser software 
at the time dominated the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most sensational allegations of its antitrust  
case, the government accuses Microsoft of offering at the meeting 
to illegally divide the market for such software, threatening to 
``crush'' Netscape if it continued selling its browser on computers 
using newer versions of the Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen earlier called the charges ``fiction, absurd and untrue''  
and said they were ``either fabrications or the products of a 
fundamental misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Boies confronted Rosen with e-mail he wrote in June 1995  
describing his attempts to ``establish Microsoft ownership of the 
Internet (browser) platform for Win95,'' Rosen said that 
``ownership'' meant keeping a promise to Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The word 'ownership' means delivering on something you  
promise?'' the judge asked incredulously. When Rosen said yes, the 
judge rolled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	At other times during Rosen's testimony, the judge thumped his  
hands on his bench and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen contended that he didn't believe Netscape posed a threat  
to Microsoft until late in 1995, despite the company's most senior 
executives telling him otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Government attorneys showed Rosen sworn testimony from the  
company's senior vice president, Paul Maritz, calling Netscape at 
the time ``a significant potential serious competitor.'' And they 
showed Rosen e-mail that Gates sent in May 1995 to all employees 
announcing that ``a new competitor born on the Internet is 
Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember thinking that Bill was probably wrong. ... I  
probably had a better perspective than Mr. Gates did about 
Netscape's intentions,'' Rosen testified, bringing gasps from the 
courtroom audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said he had talked with James Barksdale, Netscape's chief  
executive officer, ``and I believed him when he said he was not 
trying to be a competitor with Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies also confronted Rosen with e-mail he wrote in May 1995,  
weeks before the disputed Netscape meeting, proposing that 
Microsoft ``wrest leadership of the (browser) evolution from 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen initially denied sending the e-mail until the government  
showed that at least one person had received it. Then he explained 
that his use of the word ``wrest'' actually meant ``take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You mean, you wanted it, and Netscape wanted to give it to  
you?'' Boies asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Rosen said to more laughter from the courtroom.  
</P>
<P>
	Rosen's testimony left Boies clearly exasperated by day's end.  
In the middle of a long answer, the government's lawyer interrupted 
Rosen to announce curtly, ``Your Honor, I have no more questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The points on the witness' credibility had been made,'' Boies  
said later outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which called Rosen a ``low-level employee,'' said the  
sudden decision to stop questioning the witness meant that ``the 
bulk of Mr. Rosen's testimony about the meeting was unchallenged,'' 
spokesman Mark Murray said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Military Pay Raises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate pressed ahead Monday with  
politically popular legislation that would give the military a 4.8 
percent across-the-board pay raise next Jan. 1, despite a plea from 
the Clinton administration that Congress first find the money to 
pay for the increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is the first major piece of legislation considered by  
the Senate this year, and GOP leaders said they wanted to send an 
important message to men and women in the Armed Services -- 
particularly in light of a possible new military deployment in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed a 4.4 percent military pay raise.  
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to senators as debate began on the Senate floor,  
Defense Secretary William Cohen said he was concerned that the 
legislation, while well-meaning, could end up ``raising hopes that 
cannot be fulfilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be counterproductive,'' Cohen wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	If enacted, the pay raise would be the largest for the military  
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also provide more generous retirement and  
GI Bill educational benefits. The administration claims the measure 
is $7 billion more expensive over the next five years than the 
$36.5 billion benefit increase package proposed by Clinton in his 
fiscal year 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen cautioned that, with no clear indication of where the  
extra money might come from, meeting the ``unfunded requirement'' 
could mean cuts in other essential military programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee, described the defense secretary's concerns as 
``constructive criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, we're going to forge ahead,'' Warner said.  
``Even if this bill is expensive, the alternative is 
unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation appeared to have wide support in both parties  
and was expected to win Senate approval later this week. However, 
several Democrats echoed the administration's concerns over the 
pricetag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little consideration seems to have been given to how we will  
pay for this. There could be serious consequences,'' said Sen. Carl 
Levin of Michigan, the committee's senior Democrat. He said the 
measure could become ``a promise to the troops that may or may not 
be possible to redeem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., a sponsor of the bill, told the Senate  
that while he was glad the it had taken up the bill, ``My concern 
is that we may be moving too quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has predicted the  
Senate would pass the ``long overdue'' pay raise within a few 
weeks. His spokesman, John Czwartacki, said the possibility that 
U.S. troops would soon be on their way to Kosovo provided even more 
impetus for fast passage of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was deliberately made first on the Senate calendar  
after the impeachment trial of Clinton, Czwartacki said. ``We're 
back in the mode where senators can be senators,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's plan calls for a 4.4 percent  
across-the-board military pay raise in 2000 and annual raises of 
3.9 percent over the following five years. The Senate bill gives a 
4.8 percent increase starting Jan. 1, then would give the military 
an additional raise in each succeeding year of 0.5 percentage 
points above the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also allow military personnel to retire at 50  
percent pay after 20 years service -- a plan that was in effect 
prior to 1986. Or, they could accept a $30,000 cash bonus and 
remain in the current retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also give service members the option of  
contributing up to 5 percent of their basic pay to a 401(k) type 
savings account, to which the services could, under certain 
circumstances, make matching contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon contends that military personnel are paid as much  
as 13.5 percent less than civilian personnel with comparable jobs 
in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the independent Center for Strategic and Budgetary  
Assessments, in a report on the measure, suggested this claim was 
somewhat misleading. ``One problem is the overall private-sector 
workforce differs greatly from the military's workforce in terms of 
education, age, sex and other factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It cited a 1994 RAND study based on the 1992 workforce that  
``found that when compared to changes in pay for a subset of the 
civilian workforce that closely resembles the military ... there 
essentially no pay gap, at least in 1992.''

<HEADLINE> United Tech May Buy Sundstrand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Industrial group United Technologies Corp. is  
expected to announce its acquisition of aerospace components maker 
Sundstrand Corp. on Monday in a deal valued at about $4 billion, 
The Financial Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based newspaper reported that both companies' boards  
met over the weekend and were expected to approve the deal, 
although unnamed sources close the expected transaction were quoted 
by the newspaper as saying that it could still be halted. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company could be reached for comment Sunday evening by  
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundstrand, which was at the center of a major scandal in the  
1980s when it admitted to overbilling the United States government 
for aircraft components, is worth $3.2 billion based on Friday's 
closing stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, shares of Sundstrand rose $6 to $58 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange, moving largely on rumors of an unspecified 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockford, Ill.-based Sundstrand makes aerospace and  
industrial products for both military and commercial customers. In 
1998, nearly 60 percent of Sundstrand's $2 billion in revenue came 
from aerospace customers, including Boeing Co. and Airbus 
Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies and its subsidiaries  
make a variety of products, ranging from air conditioners to 
aircraft engines. It earned $1.26 billion on $25.72 billion in 
revenue in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Farm Exports Expected To Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Projected U.S. farm exports for the year  
were lowered today by $1.5 billion as global demand lags while 
farmers' supplies increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fiscal year 1999 estimate of $49 billion is a sharp  
decline from November's $50.5 billion estimate and is $4.6 billion 
below fiscal 1998, the Agriculture Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no point in trying to put a shiny gloss on it,''  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said before the department's 
annual Agricultural Outlook Forum. ``The facts are the facts. I 
wish I could say we are about to turn the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One commodity particularly vulnerable to the global slowdown is  
cotton, said USDA chief economist Keith Collins, noting that the 
projected $1.4 billion in cotton exports is the second lowest level 
in 20 years. Cotton exports were at $2.5 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asian textiles and apparel are flooding the world market,''  
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just today, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. said it would close 11 of its 22  
plants in North America and lay off about 5,900 employees to deal 
with slumping sales. Last week, Cone Mills -- the world's largest 
producer of denim fabrics -- said it would cut 11.5 percent of its 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said when Americans buy clothes today, ``About 45  
percent of the cotton in those textiles is imported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it will be three to five years before U.S. exports  
recover to the peak level of $60 billion in 1996, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports began falling last year due to the Asian economic crisis  
and strong competition from other countries. Since then, Russia's 
economy -- a major customer of U.S. poultry for instance -- has 
joined the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in exports will likely cause further financial strain  
in the nation's farmland. Ever since the phasing out of government 
payments to farmers in the 1996 farm law, exports have become 
increasingly important for maintaining prices for U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, farmers saw their prices drop to extremely low levels  
in both commodities and livestock. Congress late last year passed a 
$6 billion bailout to help. The government also agreed last month 
to give $50 million to hog farmers, now getting their lowest prices 
in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman reiterated a call for Congress to help farmers, mainly  
by overhauling the crop insurance program. ``We've got to be 
creative in the way we help our farmers,'' he said. ``Lurching from 
one ad hoc relief bill to the next is not the best way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the largest drops in exports is to Japan, where the  
continued recession has dropped the export estimate to $8 billion, 
15 percent below 1998. Overall, exports to Asia are forecast at 
$16.8 billion, compared to $19.6 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean exports are forecast to drop almost $3.5 billion from  
last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Govs. Clash on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and the nation's governors  
grappled with differences over education policy, tobacco money and 
Internet sales taxes Monday, as Washington went back to work after 
the impeachment fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton complained that some critics were trying to frame the  
political debate ``in partisan or ideological terms and try to 
force everyone to take sides.'' He told the governors, ``I want to 
work with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans -- and some Democrats -- groused that Clinton was  
imposing too many conditions on school money from Washington. ``The 
federal government should be a limited partner not a general 
partner,'' said Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has been urged by 
many Republicans to run for president in 2000. ``If they feel like 
sending money back to the states, fine. But don't tell us how to 
run things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Republican leaders of the Senate and House will  
get their first chance in 19 months to sit down with the president. 
Many GOP lawmakers are still licking their wounds from their failed 
struggle to drive Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey said Republicans would push  
Clinton for more details of his plans to save Social Security and 
the possible deployment of U.S. troops to Kosovo, if a peace accord 
can be reached there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we are capable of fulfilling another  
deployment responsibility'' without a clearer idea of the terms and 
conditions, as well as an accounting of how it would be paid for, 
Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembled for their winter meeting, the governors piled onto  
three buses in sunny if frigid weather and rode to the White House 
for a roundtable discussion with Clinton and Vice President Al 
Gore. Later, the president was invited to address a Democratic 
Governors' Association fundraiser expected to net $3 million. 
Republicans were holding their own fundraiser, bringing in $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors are unhappy that Washington wants to grab a big  
share of the $195 billion tobacco settlement reached between the 
states and the tobacco industry last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is state money,'' said Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, a  
Republican. ``The federal government was invited to participate but 
declined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said the federal government  
is required by law to try to recoup Medicaid spending. But he said 
Clinton told the governors he's willing to consider waiving that 
requirement if states guarantee they will use their proceeds for 
health care, programs that reduce teen smoking and assisting 
tobacco farmers whose livelihoods are hurt by the anti-smoking 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors also are pushing for a system to collect sales  
taxes on Internet commerce. Michigan Gov. John Engler, a 
Republican, said that was ``the most difficult issue to solve.'' 
The computer industry largely opposes taxes on the Internet. An 
advisory commission created by Congress is to report 
recommendations on the tax issue in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some governors also raised doubts about Clinton's education  
initiative to build more schools, hire more teachers and penalize 
states for poor classroom performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican, said the federal  
government's role in education should be to ``do as much as they 
can to stay the heck out of it. I'm for funds to build schools 
where school buildings need to be built. But what we need to be 
building is better kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engler said different states have different priorities. ``So it  
became apparent -- the impossibility of the federal government 
designing a one-size-fits-all system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton, a Democrat, said, ``We need to get  
the federal government back as a partner, not telling us what to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the federal government should give the states more  
flexibility while demanding more accountability. ``I have no doubt 
that these ideas eventually will spread to every state and school 
district in America,'' he said. ``The question is, how long will it 
take to happen.''	   Some governors are seeking waivers from the Department of 
Education for flexibility to use federal dollars allocated for one 
purpose, such as reducing class size in primary grades, for others 
such as preparing 10th graders for high school graduation exams. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the kind of flexibility states need,'' said California  
Gov. Gray Davis. ``In the best of all worlds, they just give us the 
money and hold us accountable for results. But that's a long 
process to change. So I'm happy to work within the system.''

<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- On his first day with the Toronto Blue  
Jays, David Wells said part of him was still with the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the enemy now but they are in my heart and on my  
mind,'' Wells said Monday, four days after New York dealt him to 
Toronto for Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, who has always been a Yankees fan, became a star in New  
York by pitching a perfect game against Minnesota last May. He even 
wore an original cap worn by Babe Ruth on the mound one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fun while it lasted,'' the 35-year-old left-hander  
said. ``There were no heroes last year; we just played as a team. I 
love everyone of them as my brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, who didn't want to talk about his feelings on the day of  
the trade, was angry at reporters who went to his residence in Palm 
Harbor, saying they were ``invading my privacy,'' and at one point 
made an obscene gesture at media members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming onto private property is something that's uncalled  
for,'' he said. ``It's something that in the situation that went on 
was very emotional for me. But to come over to my house and bother 
me like that, is very inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells began his major league career with the Blue Jays in 1987  
and spent six years in Toronto before being released. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm clear-minded and ready to get started and ready for the  
1999 season, to help this team win the pennant,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto general manager Gord Ash said he has no intention of  
trading Wells. Cleveland and the New York Mets have been mentioned 
as possible suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not discuss any deals with David Wells,'' Ash said.  
``In the words of George Bush: Read my lips -- David Wells will not 
be traded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the stunning trade, Wells went to Miami for a few days  
of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went down there, played golf and saw some friends,'' he  
said. ``Being traded isn't fun, but I'm a grown man and I can 
adapt. It's tough to leave a team that won 125 games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto thinks the deal, in which it also acquired reliever  
Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush, makes it a wild-card 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Toronto got the better part of the deal,'' Wells said.  
``The key to winning is pitching and this team has some good 
pitchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have to prepare himself for a return to SkyDome, a much  
different place to play than Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different culture in Toronto and you have to adjust,''  
he said. ``The fans aren't like in New York but they're fans. Now 
I'll make those fans happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells said his carefree personality won't change.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just like to have fun; I just like to be me,'' he said.  
``It's what my Mom made me -- she made me a complete person. You 
live your life the way you want it, as long as you do your job 
between the lines.''
