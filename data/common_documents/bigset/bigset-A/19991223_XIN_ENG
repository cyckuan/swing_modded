<P>
PARIS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The French film star Jean Gabin
has become the ``actor of the century'' in a poll published on
Wednesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Britain's Pets to Become Passport-holders in February 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Wednesday that
radical changes to its stringent quarantine laws would come into
effect earlier than planned from the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The first pets to enter Britain without going into kennels for
six months will be able to travel from 28 February 2000, the
Reuters quoted Baroness Hayman, junior agriculture minister, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The scheme had been due to come into effect from April.
</P>
<P>
When they bring their pets into Britain, owners will need to
bring veterinary certificates to show the animal meets certain
conditions allowing it to travel freely to and from European Union
countries, Norway, Switzerland and Iceland, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The initial scheme is a one-year pilot and if it is successful
and rabies is kept out of Britain, it will be extended, the
government said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has not had a rabies scare since 1969, and successive
governments have argued that it has kept the disease out of the
island with tough quarantine laws.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and 11
others injured on Wednesday in a traffic accident in southern
Egypt, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place when a truck ran head-on into a mini-bus
near the Safa traffic point in the governorate of Minya, 220
kilometers south of Cairo, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the injured have been rushed to the Menya General
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
But it did not mention how many people were on the two vehicles
and the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents are common in Egypt due to high speed and failure
to abide by the traffic rules and regulations. Official estimation
has put the annual death toll at nearly 6,000 people. Another 30,
000 people are injured. In addition, traffic accidents lead to a
loss of about 1 billion U.S. dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
A government committee is looking into the rising number of
fatalities on Egyptian roads, especially in rural areas. The roads
in rural areas have been dubbed by local media as "roads of death."

<HEADLINE> Putin, U.S. Envoy Discuss Bilateral Ties, Strategic Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin and visiting U.S. Deputy State Secretary Strobe Talbott
discussed issues of the relations between their countries and
global strategic stability here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sides admitted that "possibly the outgoing year was not the
best in bilateral relations but the two countries managed to build
a bridge of understanding into the future," Putin's press
secretary Mikhail Kozhukhov told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Kozhukov, Putin informed Talbott about the
attitude of the Russian government to the North Caucasus, and the
tasks and objectives of the Russian federal force there.
</P>
<P>
Putin said Russia "is ready to cooperate with the international
community in resolving humanitarian problems."
</P>
<P>
The meeting also focused on arms control, the START-II treaty(
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty-II) and international problems of
mutual interest. The ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty) subject
was raised "in the most general terms" and the sides expressed
their ideas and wishes to this end, Kozhukhov said.
</P>
<P>
Putin noted Russia cannot remain indifferent to bilateral
security issues, notably the future of the START-II and ABM
treaties.
</P>
<P>
"The earlier START-II is ratified, the better," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"All of us want a safe world. The search is underway for ways
to promote a safe world and to strengthen Russia's position in the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Talbott conveyed U.S. President Bill Clinton'
s congratulations on the completion of Russian parliamentary
elections.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Party Threatens to Make Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the
main Mozambican opposition party, Mozambique National Resistance
(Renamo), Wednesday threatened to make the country "ungovernable".
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in his Maputo residence, Dhlakama
said the results announced by Jamisse Taimo, Chairman of the
National Elections Commission (CNE), on Wednesday morning had been
"forged" by the ruling Frelimo (Mozambique Liberation Front).
</P>
<P>
Frelimo had "stolen" its victory in the general elections from
December 3 to 5, he said.
</P>
<P>
If those election results are allowed to stand, the country
would become "ungovernable", he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the results announced by the CNE, the incumbent
President Joaquim Chissano beat his rival candidate Dhlakama by
winning a majority 52. 29 percent of the votes while the latter
only got 47.7 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
In the parliamentary election, Frelimo won 133 seats out of the
250-seat parliament while Renamo only secured 117 seats.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama insisted that in reality Renamo had won and demanded a
recount of the votes, saying that Renamo was taking this to the
Supreme Court, which has the final say in electoral disputes.
</P>
<P>
He blamed that the Renamo technical staff had been denied
access to the computerization of the election data, both in the
provinces and at the Maputo headquarters of the Electoral
Administration Technical Secretariat (STAE), the executive arm of
the CNE.
</P>
<P>
The staff appointed by Frelimo had handled the computerization
on their won, he said, stressing that not all the polling station
notices had been introduced into the computers.
</P>
<P>
"Our document will be based on proof of theft of votes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Dhlakama did not specify precisely what kind of
measures the opposition party would take if the Supreme Court
throws its appeal out. He would not even state whether the newly
elected Renamo MPs will take their seats in the new parliament.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- An multi-nation Middle East energy system scheduled to
be completed by the year end was put off until 2002, reported the
Anatolia News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The system, which involves Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq and
Syria, had to be postponed as Syria failed to accomplish its
commitments regarding the project, said officials of the Turkish
Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
According to the original program, the Islamic Development Bank
would provide 20 million U.S. dollars to finance the 60-kilometer
energy transportation line in the Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The total assets of Lebanese commercial banks in the
first 11 months of 1999 rose to 40 billion dollars from 35.8
billion dollars in 1998, the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total deposits in November rose to 33 billion dollars from 30
billion dollars in the same period of last year, an increase of 11.
6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in assets, bankers in general predicted
that year-on-year growth in the sector would not exceed 10 percent
by the end of 1999, compared with an average of 20 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Beirut Stock Exchange-listed shares of real estate
Solidere, Lebanon's largest company, surged 5 percent to 7.875
dollars Tuesday on investor confidence over growing peace
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Al Mustaqbal newspaper reported Wednesday that Solidere stocks A
and B, which make up more than 50 percent of the bourse's market
capitalization, hit the bourse's 5 percent ceiling for a single-day
share rise because of raised expectations of peace between Syria
and Lebanon on the one hand and Israel on the other.
</P>
<P>
The stocks of the real estate giant had shed nearly 30 percent
of their value since the beginning of this year because of lagging
economic growth and earlier failed attempts to restart the Syrian-
Israeli peace process, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem -- Israeli Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Eli
Yishai said Tuesday that 1.02 million people, including 440,000
children, live under poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The poverty line is put at 346 dollars per person per month and
at an average monthly income of 885 dollars for a family of four
members.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the Israeli National
Insurance Authority, there were about 267,000 poor Israeli families
in 1998 as against 260,000 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said the poorest Israeli towns are Beni Brak
near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Beersheba in the southern Israeli
Negev desert.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the richest 10 percent of Isaeli people
acquire 28 percent of the country's wealth.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also reveal that the poorest Israelis are Jews of
Arab origin, diehard Israelis and Arab Israeli.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian labor force in Yemen has sharply declined to
8,600 in 1999 from 31,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating economic situation in Yemen resulted in
decreased salaries and wages and less teachers employed by the
Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Open market and free entry without visa into Yemen have led to
high number of irregular Egyptian labors in Yemen. Though Iraqis
and Palestinians have posed competition in teacher employment, the
opportunity was also tipped in Egyptians' favor.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged To Uphold Unity Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) Wednesday urged the
country to uphold the principle of unity in the new millennium in
an effort to realize economic liberation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabweans should be united in the fight against "formidable
enemies" in the international community, who have been attacking
the ZANU-PF government for its uncompromising stance on the land
acquisition program, said ZANU-PF National Chairman John Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
He called on the people of Zimbabwe to rededicate themselves to
the challenges of global economy, poverty and industrialization
facing the country.
</P>
<P>
The chairman praised the signing of a historic unity accord in
1987 to end years of conflict between the ZANU-PF led by Robert
Mugabe, who is now President of the country and the Zimbabwe
African People's Union (ZAPU) led by Joshua Nkomo, former Vice
President of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"The 1987 accord was to help us create an environment which
brings into the country a system of governance that would promote
democracy and human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed critics who have been saying that the death of
Nkomo in July has left a vacuum in the party and that the unity
accord will now collapse.
</P>
<P>
As far as the ZAPU side is concerned, the spirit of the unity
accord remains, he said.

ANKARA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Inmates set ablaze sheets and
blankets in the Ankara Maximum Prison on Wednesday in a conflict
with prison authority, the Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The authority beefed up security measures when a group of
inmates took four prison guards hostage after it refused to let
visitors in.
</P>
<P>
Other inmates, who could not return to their wards due to the
incident, gathered in the yard and started setting fire to sheets
and blankets.
</P>
<P>
Six inmates were injured in the fire, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Prison unrest has increased in recent months across the country.
Inmates often set fire, stage hunger strikes or take hostages in
protest against prison authorities.
</P>
<P>
The public chided the prison authorities for loosening control.
But the authorities pointed their fingers at foreign human rights
groups, who accused Turkey of power abuse and torture in prisons.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hails Sudanese President's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CAIRO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Wednesday welcomed Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's
visit to Egypt, which he said was of top importance.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir arrived in Cairo earlier in the day after a two-day
visit to Libya and held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on the latest developments in Sudan, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir's visit came at a time "when Sudan is passing through
special situation" and it is "part of Egypt's endeavors to help
solve the problems" in the southern Arab neighbor, Moussa told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt sees al-Bashir as the head of the Sudanese state and as
a representative of his country," he was quoted by the news agency
as saying. Egypt and Sudan are bound by "eternal, special,
historical, and future relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Sudanese summit will tackle bilateral issues,
developments in Sudan and inter-Sudan dialog, the Egyptian foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir declared on December 12 a three-month state of
emergency and dissolved the National Assembly (parliament) in an
apparent effort to foil the attempts of former Parliament Speaker
Hassan al-Turabi to shrink presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
Egypt immediately expressed support for al-Bashir's steps,
which it said were aimed at securing Sudan's unity and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Egypt says it is keen on helping Sudan maintain sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and has proposed jointly with Libya a peace
plan aimed at helping end the 16-year-old civil war in Sudan and
realize national reconciliation in the Africa's largest country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's efforts are mostly prompted by its concern that a
possible disintegration would endanger its main water source, the
Nile River.

<HEADLINE> UK Military on Millennium Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The armed forces in Britain
could be called in to help deal with any large-scale emergencies
that occur over the millennium period, said government officials.
</P>
<P>
Government contingency plans rule out the widespread use of
troops to deal with any major problems sparked by the millennium
bug or new year's eve celebrations.
</P>
<P>
However, some resources such as helicopters may be drafted in
to assist the civilian services that will be on duty.
</P>
<P>
Detailing plans for the millennium, Home Secretary Jack Straw
said that all police leave would be cancelled over the period.
</P>
<P>
Parliament could be recalled in the event of significant
disturbance, he said.
</P>
<P>
A police readiness unit will operate at Scotland Yard,
receiving information from every force in the UK to ensure a co-
ordinated response to any problems that arise.
</P>
<P>
Additional ambulance and fire service personnel will also be on
duty.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern has been to ensure that the celebrations across
the country are conducted safely and if anything does go wrong our
emergency services are able to cope effectively," Straw told
members of the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
"This is an exercise in predicting the unpredictable. We hope
these arrangements work, that we have anticipated everything that
could go wrong."
</P>
<P>
Straw said that millions of people were expected to visit the
capital to celebrate the millennium and he warned "those who don't
like crowds should not come into London".
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that there were "very special arrangements"
in place to ensure safety along the River Thames.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government claimed that it had completed all the
necessary work to ensure vital government services are not
disrupted by the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The health service and government departments all have back-up
plans to deal with any computer crashes.
</P>
<P>
Special millennium centers will be operating across the UK from
December 31 to January 7.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Rating Affirmed At 'AA': Fitch IBCA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) - Fitch IBCA, the international
rating agency, Wednesday affirmed Singapore's Long-term foreign
currency rating at 'AA+' and its Short-term foreign currency
rating at 'F1+'.
</P>
<P>
These rating apply to all senior, unsecured foreign currency
debt issues of Singapore and set a ceiling for Fitch IBCA rated
entities in Singapore, according to the rating agency.
</P>
<P>
The Long-term local currency rating of 'AAA' was also affirmed
and applies to sovereign issues denominated in Singapore dollars,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the affirmed ratings, Fitch IBCA said that it was
inevitable that a small, open economy like Singapore would sustain
a substantial external shock in the wake of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's highly competitive manufacturing sector is now
enjoying a very strong cyclical upturn, powering real GDP of some
5.5 percent in 1999 and a prospective 5-6 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Fitch IBCA said Singapore's banking system remains among the
strongest in Asia: the banks are well capitalized and non-
performing loans have been contained at just over 7 percent of
total assets.
</P>
<P>
Its main challenge remains that of a significant net external
creditor searching for adequate returns on its overseas investment,
the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak to Meet in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
will meet again in January to give momentum to the peace talks, a
senior Palestinian official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's advisor Nabil Abo-Redinah said the meeting between
Arafat and Barak in the West Bank city of Ramallah Tuesday night
led to a positive result regarding the Israeli pullout from the
Wast Bank and the release of a third batch of Palestinian
detainees.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to hold another meeting after Arafat's
visit to Washington early next January. The visit will be in
response to United States President Bill Clinton's invitation as
part of the efforts to push forward the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak met Arafat Tuesday evening in the house of Secretary
General of the Palestine Liberation Organization Abu Mazen to
discuss the problems facing the interim and final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour talks were held in a "friendly and promising
atmosphere," according to informed Palestinian sources.
</P>
<P>
The talks dealt with the delayed second Israeli redeployment in
the West Bank, the release of the third batch of Palestinian
political prisoners, the Jewish settlements as well as political
and financial issues, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Barak briefed Arafat on the results of the Israeli-Syrian peace
talks that were recently resumed in Washington, noting that the
Syrian track would not negatively reflect on the Palestinian one.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended also by Abu Mazen, Speaker of the
Palestinian Council Abu Ala, Palestinian chief negotiator in the
final status talks Yasser Abed Rabbo and Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, Barak's advisor Dany Yatom and Israeli chief negotiator
Oded Eran.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was originally scheduled to be held in Jericho on
Sunday but the Israeli side postponed it due to security concerns
after an Israeli source disclosed the time and place beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was the eighth of its kind since Barak took
office in July.
</P>
<P>
The interim stage faced many difficulties due to the differences
between the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on the maps of the
Israeli redeployment from 5 percent of the West Bank territories.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment was postponed for five weeks and Israel failed
to release the third batch of Palestinian detainees before the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan as set in the Sharm el Sheikh
Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The new round of interim talks starts Wednesday evening in
Jerusalem between Eran and Palestinian chief negotiator for interim
talks Saeb Erakat.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of State of Prisoners Affairs Abdul Raziq said on
Tuesday that the third group of Palestinian detainees will be
released within 10 days. However, Israeli sources said after Barak-
Arafat meeting that Barak might made a decision on the question
within two days.
</P>
<P>
As for the final status talks, the Palestinian side considers
the Jewish settlement activities the main obstacle hindering the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to form two joint committees on borders and
settlements and to work out a framework agreement.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russia's Federation Council,
the upper house of the parliament, Wednesday unanimously approved
the Russian- Belarussian Union Treaty.

<P>
The voting was witnessed by parliamentary delegations from

countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on December 13, the Russian State Duma, lower house of
the parliament ratified the treaty on the establishment of the
Russian-Belarussian Union State. A total of 382 deputies voted for

<P>
KATHMANDU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The special session of the
House of representatives was prorogued Wednesday after adopting
the motion tabled by the leader of the opposition party along with
amendments proposed by whip of the ruling Nepali Congress.
</P>
<P>
The motion stated that directives have been issued to the
government to immediately formulate and implement necessary
programs and make necessary improvement in the management to
provide relief to the people hit hard by price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The special session was summoned on December 15 by King

Communist Party of Nepal-United Maxist and Leninist (CPN-UML) to
deliberate on the price hikes of various goods and services in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML maintained the government should withdraw the price
hikes which had affected the daily life of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Special sessions of parliament have been called six times after
the restoration of democracy in 1991 to discuss the power equation,
but the present special session had focused on censure motion
pertaining to price hikes.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Calls for Fast Regional Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings has urged West African countries to work toward promoting
the economic integration of the sub-region, according to a
Pan-African News Agency report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the appeal when he received a visiting
Nigerian trade delegation in capital Accra on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said that West Africa should not allow itself to be
balkanized economically and praised the initiative being taken by
Ghana and Nigeria to make the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) move at a faster pace.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day ministerial meeting held in Accra, Ghana and
Nigeria have agreed to adopt a "fast-track" approach toward the
achievement of a single monetary zone for the 16 member countries
of the ECOWAS which was designed to spearhead West Africa's
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ghanaian Foreign Minister Victor Gbeho told
reporters that "West Africa cannot afford to lag behind. The
process of integration is now inevitable. Ghana and Nigeria will
keep on the momentum until the ECOWAS miracle is attained."
</P>
<P>
The process of a single monetary zone in West Africa will first
involve the creation of a second monetary zone for the Anglophone
area of ECOWAS before the subsequent move toward a single monetary
zone for the entire 16 ECOWAS members, said Nigeria's Co-operation
and Integration Minister Jerry Gana who attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Russian-Belarussian Union Won't Harm Regional Status: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian-Belarussian Union
Treaty will not influence the status of constituents of the
Russian Federation, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said
Wednesday at a meeting of the Federation Council, upper house of
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The possible inclusion of Belarus into the Russian Federation
or equalizing its status with that of Russian constituents lays"
outside the framework of this document," Putin said, while
submitting this treaty for ratification in the upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
The union "is not aimed to fully merge Russia and Belarus but
to create a voluntary alliance with equal rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government and presidential structures will focus its
integration work exclusively in Russia's interests, and regions'
rights won't be hindered," he said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty's coming into effect would not require amendments to
either the Russian or Belarussian Constitutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The union state will be created gradually. We would multiply
our military and political potential while Belarus is going to
retain its nuclear-free status," he said.
</P>
<P>
This treaty "doubtlessly meets Russia's genuine national
interests" in both economic and military-political fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Integration will not "harm Russia" or "draw resources to the
side," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, the Russia's Federation Council, upper house
of the parliament, approved the Russian-Belarussian Union Treaty
by a vote of 158 against two.
</P>
<P>
In the same day, Belarus' Council of the Republic, or upper
house of the parliament passed the Russian-Belarussian Union
Treaty in a unanimous 54 votes, reported the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko signed the treaty in Moscow on December 8.

<P>
OTTAWA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada saw a one percent drop
in violent crime by youths in 1998, as compared with the previous
year, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the third annual drop, but still 77 percent higher
than in 1988, according to the official agency.
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg was reported to have the highest rate for youth
violent crimes in 1998, while the rate was found to be the lowest
in Quebec City of the country's nine largest urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The report noted an apparent rise in violent crimes among girls,
saying that the crime rate for female youths was one-third of the
rate for males in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Girls charged with violent crime tended to be younger than boys,
with the crime rate recording the highest among 17-year-old boys
in comparison with the highest rate for girls of 14 to 15 years
old, said the agency.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Receives Message From Jordan's King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on Wednesday received a written message from Jordanian King
Abdullah
Bin Hussein on bilateral relations, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed to Saddam by visiting Jordanian Foreign
Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib, whose visit is the first by a high
ranking Jordanian official to Baghdad since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The message is the first from King Abdullah to Saddam since he
came to the throne in February following the death of his father
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said Khatib would discuss with Iraqi
officials the renewal of an oil deal between Jordan and Iraq that
expires at the end of December.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed the oil agreement in January under
which Baghdad would supply Amman in 1999 with 4.8 million tons of
crude oil, of which half will be free of charge and the rest at a
preferential price.
</P>
<P>
The deal is separate from Iraqi oil exports under the
U.N.-authorized oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell
limited amount of oil to buy humanitarian supplies for its people
reeling under the nine-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
However, during Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammed Rashid's visit
to Amman earlier this month, the two sides failed to reach
agreement
on details of the deal for the year 2000 due to price differences.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iraq asked for 19 U.S dollars a barrel for
the oil it sells to Amman, and the latter said it could only pay 15
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since ascending to the throne, King Abdullah has repeatedly
expressed his support for the territorial integrity of Iraq and for
putting an end to the sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> German Police Shot Dead Gunman, Free Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- After a 50-hour tense standoff,
German police Wednesday shot dead a lone gunman who attempted to
rob a local bank and took three people hostage in the border city
of Aachen, the German news media reported.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the fully armed gunman hijacked a security company
vehicle carrying banknotes and took three employees -- two men and
a woman -- hostage before driving 10 kilometers to the local bank.
</P>
<P>
As the bank is in the vicinity of the local railway station,
police had to seal off the area, temporarily preventing local
residents from entering their homes and shutting down all shops.
</P>
<P>
During the ensuing three days of standoff, the gunman agreed to
negotiate directly with police and relayed demands for money and
free passage through two hostages who were freed earlier.
</P>
<P>
Then, police and the gunman reached a "compromise" that he
could flee the area together with the remaining hostage and a sum
of money.
</P>
<P>
While the gunman holding the hostage was trying to get into a
car provided by police, he was shot dead on the spot, according to
the local media.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the hostage was later rescued unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Aachen is on the Germany's common border with Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Norway Offers Relief Fund to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Norway has recently
contributed more than two million U.S. dollars to assist
Ethiopian people affected by food shortage, the United Nations
World Food Program (WFP) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the package aid, about 1.2 million dollars are allocated to
the emergency operations to assist the internally displaced due to
the Ethio- Eritrean conflict which started in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rest 800,000 dollars will be used to support those
ethiopians affected by crop failures and drought, the WFP said in
a press release.
</P>
<P>
The WFP Emergency Operation appealed early this year for over
45,000 tons of food aid but is currently still 4.9 percent
under-resourced.
</P>
<P>
According to the WFP, up to 80 percent of those affected in
Ethiopia are women, children and the elderly people.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- In efforts to diversify foreign
trade, Turkey has recently strengthened its economic relations with
two African countries - Chad and the Sudan, reported the Anatolia
News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish State Minister, Ramazan Mirzaoglu, has just

</P>
<P>
During his stay in Chad, an agreement of cooperation on trade,

<HEADLINE> New Political Climate Created on Cyprus: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides Wednesday said the European Union (EU) summit
has created a new political climate on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a visit to Greece, the Cypriot
government's long-standing ally, Kasoulides also underlined that
the process of proximity peace talks on Cyprus is the only way to
settle the island's protracted issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
U.N.-sponsored proximity talks aimed at reviving the stalled
peace talks in the island were held in New York on December 3-14.
The two sides have agreed to hold a new round of talks in Geneva on
January 27.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit held in Helsinki, Finland, earlier this month gave
Turkey a candidate status for EU membership and made it clear that
a settlement on Cyprus issue should not be set as a precondition
for the Cyprus' EU accession.
</P>
<P>
EU agreed to start accession talks with Cyprus while dropping
Turkey from the EU membership candidates list, which prompted the
Turkish Cypriots in the island to walk out of the peace talks in
1997.
</P>
<P>
He added that the only way through which the Turkish Cypriot
leader can tackle Europe is "accepting the invitation President
Glafcos Clerides extended to the Turkish Cypriot community to
nominate representatives in a joint team negotiating Cyprus'
accession."
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides pointed out that now "the EU is monitoring
developments in efforts to settle the Cyprus problem."

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM Urges Private, Public Sectors Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef
Obeid said here Wednesday that the government is making efforts to
boost partnership between the public sector and the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, Obeid
said that close cooperation and coordination will help increase the
rate of production of the two sectors, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
With the target reached, Obeid added, both sectors are expected
to play a key role in the country's economic development process,
which he said is vital to the relief of the burden of employment.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show Egypt's jobless rate stands at 8.3
percent. But unofficial estimates put it at around 12 percent. Only
when the economy grows at a speed of 7-8 percent a year will Egypt
be able to absorb the 500,000 youngsters entering the labor market
each year in the next 10-15 years.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, up to 80 percent of Egypt's economy would be in private
hands and the government hopes the private sector will do more in
the creation of job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Obeid expressed hope that Egypt and France
will further promote economic, trade and investment cooperation and
that France and other Western industrialized countries will
transfer to Egypt advanced technology, expertise and modern
equipment, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The French prime minister arrived in Cairo Tuesday for a private
visit.
</P>
<P>
An economic study, issued by the Egyptian Trade Representation
Department on the occasion of Jospin's visit, envisaged a surge of
French investments in Egypt, especially in the new urban and
industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
France's direct investments in Egypt rose to 150.7 million U.S.
dollars by the end of 1998, up 47.75 percent from the previous
year, making it the fourth largest European investor in Egypt after
Britain, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

<P>
The transition from INTERFET led by Australia to the U.N. force
"is to take place between the beginning and end of February under
an agreed concept that ensures that a strong operational capacity
will be maintained throughout," the official said.
</P>
<P>
While much of the 9,000-strong U.N. force will come from
INTERFET in operation since September 20, "a number of important
assets will need to be brought in from abroad", said Assistant U.N.
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Hedi Annabi.
</P>
<P>
"These include in particular engineering units and helicopter
support," he briefed the Security Council on the current situation
in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He said the security situation in the territory continued to be
stable, and the humanitarian situation has improved. Some 120,000
refugees had returned as of December 20.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission has established a skeletal administration in
all 13 districts, deploying 275 international civilian police
throughout the territory which goes independent in two to three
years.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission which is responsible for all affairs during
the transitional process, is working closely with the local people
and will be setting up a commission to deal with the appointment
of civil service, Annabi said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Tightens Security Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- With the new year and
millennium approaching, U.S. security authorities are tightening
security to prepare for any possible attack from terrorists around
the world.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton assured Americans Wednesday that the
authorities are doing "everything in our power" to prevent
terrorist attacks during the holidays, from tightening security at
airports to investigating whether recent threats are connected to
Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Laden, a Saudi exile that U.S. officials allege masterminded
the bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa last year, is on the
list of 10 most wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
.
</P>
<P>
"We're taking extraordinary efforts in the government to act
based on the incident out in the Pacific Northwest," Clinton said,
referring to the arrest last week of an Algerian trying to bring
bomb-making equipment into Washington state.
</P>
<P>
The State Department Tuesday issued a new warning to Americans
across the world that they may be the target of terrorist attacks
from now and through mid-January, especially at holiday gatherings
and millennial celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The warning, the second in 11 days, said the recent arrest of
13 people in Jordan produced information that hotels, tourist
sites and tourist buses may have been targeted there. U.S. reports
said terrorism suspects arrested in Jordan have been linked to Bin
Laden's network.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Americans abroad to "review their security
practices, to remain vigilant to their surroundings and to
exercise caution" and asked them to "avoid large crowds and
gatherings, keep a low profile, and vary routes and times of all
required travel."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, CIA Director
George J. Tenet, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, held a high-level meeting at the White House,
showing their increasing concern about possible terrorism tied to
the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the law enforcement agencies have tightened their
grip at the nation's borders, increasing inspectors and redoubling
security at airports.
</P>
<P>
In Vermont, an Algerian man and a Canadian woman were arrested
Tuesday at a border crossing and charged with immigration
violations after dogs found what may have been traces of
explosives in their car.
</P>
<P>
Canadian and U.S. authorities are trying to determine whether
the pair was in any way connected to Algerian-born Ahmed Ressam,
who was arrested in Washington State on Dec. 14 after he arrived
on a ferry from Canada with a carload of bomb-making materials.
</P>
<P>
Since Ressam's arrest, the U.S. Customs Service has transferred
more than 300 employees to points of entry along the Canadian and
Mexican borders, asked part-time employees who usually work during
the summer tourist season to return to duty, and waived overtime
limits so inspectors can work longer hours.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced Tuesday
that it planned to institute similar measures in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing everything in our power to prevent any attacks
from occurring and to bring to justice those people responsible
for planning any such attacks," U.S. Deputy Attorney Eric Holder
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government doesn't have any specific information of
particular sites being targeted in the United States, but asked
Americans to be on the lookout for anything suspicious, such as
unguarded packages, especially at millennium and holiday
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Dale Watson, FBI counter-terrorism chief, said U.S. authorities
are aware that Bin Laden had issued Islamic calls to action
against the United States, known as fatwas.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the fact that Osama Bin Laden has issued
fatwas. We are working very hard with our intelligence partners to
investigate any threat... that targets Americans," Watson said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Back for Sudan's Territorial Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CAIRO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa reiterated on Wednesday his country's support for Sudan's
sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is keen on helping Sudan foil attempts to endanger its
national security and territorial integrity, Moussa told reporters
after a meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that Egypt's stance has been "clear and positive"
towards Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir arrived in Cairo earlier on Wednesday after a two-day
visit to Libya, and discussed with Mubarak the latest situation in
Sudan and other issues related to the Africa's largest country.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Sudanese summit was held "in a positive and
cordial atmosphere," which reflects Egypt's interest in Sudan's
affairs and moves towards securing stability and unity in the
country, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The talks covered the latest developments in Sudan, the
Egyptian-Sudanese relations along with Khartoum's ties with other
neighbors and ways of promoting Sudan's peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir declared on December 12 a three-month state of
emergency and dissolved the National Assembly (parliament) in an
apparent effort to thwart attempts by former Parliament Speaker
Hassan al-Turabi to shrink presidential powers. Egypt expressed
support soon after al-Bashir took the steps.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's unity is part the Egyptian principle and policy, which
forms the basis of the Egyptian-Libyan initiative on Sudan, and any
attempts to jeopardize Sudan's integrity will not materialize, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya have proposed a peace plan aimed at helping end
Sudan's 16-year-old civil war and realize national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's efforts regarding Sudan are believed to be prompted
mostly by its concern that a possible disintegration of Sudan would
endanger its main water source, the Nile River.

<HEADLINE> Americans Less Concerned About Y2K Computer Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 22 (Xinhua) -- With a few days until the
New Year, Americans report a continued downward trend in their
concern and worry levels regarding year 2000-related computer
problems, according to a new Gallup poll released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Only seven percent of Americans, down from 12 percent in
November, think major problems will result due to year 2000
computer mistakes. Despite previous media accounts that some
Americans are preparing for food or water delivery systems to fail,
the new poll found that 93 percent respondents say they will not
withdraw all their money from the bank, and only one-quarter of
Americans believe food and retail distribution systems will fail,
causing grocery and other store shortage.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide telephone poll, conducted in partnership with
the National Science Foundation (NSF), surveyed 1,011 adults
between December 16 and 19.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the poll results, NSF said that a well-
information and educated public is able to increase its
understanding of the consequences of Y2K and make informed
decisions for themselves and their families. "As the public's
knowledge and awareness of 'Y2K' rises over the past year, its
level of worry, fear and concern falls," NSF said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of those polled this time say they have seen
or heard "some or a great deal" about the year 2000 computer issue,
or Y2K, which arises from computers that are improperly programmed
to comprehend a computer's date field correctly.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the adults polled believe the computer
problems will last only a few days. Forty percent of respondents,
down from 68 percent a year ago, say Y2K effects may last from
several weeks or from several months to a year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Interim Disputes Unresolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between Israeli
Chief interim negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian counterpart
Saeb Erekat Sunday night made no progress on deadlock issues on
interim peace track, sources close to the negotiation said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at a Jerusalem hotel, lasted more than two
hours. The two sides discussed the delayed second-stage withdrawal
by Israeli troops from the West Bank and the overdue release of
Palestinian prisoners promised by Israel as a goodwill gesture for
the Moslem holy fasting month of Ramadan, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said after the meeting that he felt regret that the talks
failed to have any positive results although there was great hope
after the successful meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Tuesday night in the
West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said he
expected Israel to transfer 5 percent West Bank land to Palestinian
rule in the coming days, for the Arafat-Barak meeting had "renewed
the trust and cooperation between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
Under their Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum signed in September, 2
percent of West Bank land should have been turned from Area B
(joint Israeli-Palestinian control with Palestinian civil
administration) to Area A (full Palestinian control) and another 3
percent from Area C (sole Israeli control) to Area B by November
15.
</P>
<P>
But a dispute over the withdrawal maps has delayed the pullback
for more than five weeks, as the Palestinians demanded the transfer
of areas more densely populated than what Israel had proposed.
</P>
<P>
Israel had agreed to release another batch of Palestinian
prisoners before Ramadan, which has already started two weeks ago.
But the release was also postponed because of disputes.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Addis Tyre Factory,
the sole of its kind in Ethiopia, is to begin tyre production on a
trial basis with local rubber tree cultivated in Oromiya State.
</P>
<P>
The factory is under preparation to launch the production as
the rubber seedlings imported from abroad and those of local
cultivation have already been grown up, said General Manager
Tsegaye Tilaye here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chemicals and other equipment necessary for the making of tyre
have been purchased, he said.

enable the country to save three million birr (about 370,000 U.S.
dollars) in hard currency annually.

Ethiopia launched its first rubber tree plantation on 20
hectares of land in 1988.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ends Direct Flight Ban Against Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The flight from New York to
Africa's largest city Lagos would soon resume after the United
States relinquished its six-year ban against direct air links with
Nigeria on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Transport Secretary Rodney Slater said in Washington on
the day that the Murtala Mohammed Airport in Lagos had been found
up to the Federal Aviation Administration standards.
</P>
<P>
Although insecurity at the Lagos airport was taken as the
official reason for the ban in 1993, the move was widely regarded
as a punishment for Nigeria's then military rulers.
</P>
<P>
Appeals to end the ban during Nigeria's past administrations
failed until Olusegun Obasanjo took office in May, ending a
15-year long military rule in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
"Of course it is good that the ban has been lifted. It is
another mark of the changing attitudes towards Nigeria now that we
have a respected government," said a presidency official in Abuja,
Nigeria's capital.
</P>
<P>
The ban also ends a lucrative monopoly of the European airlines
for a detoured trip to America via Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Lagos-Paris and Lagos-London airlines have long been among
the most lucrative lines on the international aviation market.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Nigerians -- including Obasanjo himself -- have
family members working or studying in the U.S. and several members
of Obasanjo's government have homes there.
</P>
<P>
U.S. oil firms, such as Exxon-Mobil, Chevron Corp. and Texaco
Inc., all have big oil-producing operations in the West African
country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the fifth biggest crude oil supplier to the United
States.

<HEADLINE> India to Impose 50 Pct Duty on Wheat Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian parliament
Thursday approved a statutory resolution to impose 50 percent duty
on wheat imports as measures to discourage buying of foreign
foodgrain in view of good crop in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted by Rajya Sabha (Upper House) after a
brief reply by Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha, who said that the
action was taken after review of the wheat situation in the
country, which was already very comfortable and a forecast of good
production this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that 50 percent duty was well within the WTO bound duty
of 100 percent of wheat and the government decided on this rate as
it felt it was more than enough to deter its imports.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Industrial Production Grows 10.3 Pct in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial production
growth rate has slowed down to 10.3 percent this year, Vietnam's
official news agency VNA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of Vietnam's industrial production is the
lowest one in the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
The growth rates of the State-run, foreign-invested and non-
State sectors registered increases of 5.3 percent, 19.4 percent
and 8.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown of the growth rate of Vietnam's industrial
production is attributed to low business efficiency, sloppy
enforcement of guidelines and policies, out-of-date equipment and
the regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Coal Corporation has faced the biggest ever
difficulties since its establishment, and had to limit production
as a result of oversupply.
</P>
<P>
In spite of considerable efforts, steel and paper productions
of the country are slowing down.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's electricity sector has made the most remarkable
progress, meeting the demand in production and daily life.
</P>
<P>
The garment and textile industry is leading the country in
terms of export turnover with 1.73 billion U.S. dollars, a rise of
130 million U.S. dollars over the yearly target.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Milk Company has trebled its export turnover to 51
million U.S. dollars, chiefly from the export of children
nutrition powder and condensed milk.
</P>
<P>
The export of cooking oil and artificial flavorings has also
doubled last year's figure.

<HEADLINE> Constraints Attributed to Canada's Low Fertility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Financial constraints and the
selfish values of the younger generation constitute major factors
for the steady decline in Canada's fertility rate, the country's
National Post newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing Statistics Canada in its report of the first kind, the
newspaper said that the country saw the lowest fertility rate of 1.
55 children per woman in 1997, far short of the rate of 2.1
children per woman to replace the population as it dies off.
</P>
<P>
Drawing on theories by American economists about the economic
influence on a couple's decision to have children, Canadian
researchers found that the country's low fertility rate was linked
to the income shrinking for young couples.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the young male earners brought home an average
household income that equalled one-third (in proportion) of a
middle-aged couple with one or more children.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, young men were only bringing home 16 percent of the
older generation's household earnings, said the newspaper, adding
that young women with full-time jobs also saw their earnings fall
relative to the incomes of older Canadians.
</P>
<P>
As young couples are struggling to earn as good a living as the
older generation did, more and more women have entered into the
labor market, making child-bearing even less financially
attractive.
</P>
<P>
In the face of high rate of unemployment, three recessions and
shrinking real wages in the past 25 years, the self-centered post-
Boomer generation has conspired to push babies off the priority
spending list, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
If the downward fertility trends continue, the Canadian
fertility rate will be only 1.3 children per woman by 2010, warned
the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Maiden Flight From Changdu to Lhasa Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A China Southwest Airlines
Boeing 757 aircraft landed at 10:29 a.m. this morning at Gonggar
Airport in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region,
after a one-hour maiden flight from Changdu's Bangda Airport in
eastern Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The direct flight between the Bangda and Gonggar airports, the
world's two highest airports, was the first and one of the most
difficult flights in the history of civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
The Bangda Airport on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau which is
known as "the roof of the world," is 4,334 meters above sea level,
and the Gonggar Airport is at an elevation of 3,600 meters.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the 715-km-long Changdu-Lhasa air route brings
the number of air routes now flown by the airline to eight. The
route has shortened the time from Changdu, a political and
cultural center of eastern Tibet, to Lhasa from four to five days
by bus to only one hour by plane.
</P>
<P>
This flight will be available once a week.
</P>
<P>
China Southwest Airlines also has domestic air routes from
Lhasa to Chongqing, Beijing, Xi'an, Xining and Chengdu, and from
Changdu to Chengdu. It also has an international air route from
Lhasa to Katmandu, the capital of Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Macao' Return to Motherland is Great Success of China: BCCEMCC President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- President of Bangladesh-China
Cultural, Economic and Mass Communication Center (BCCEMCC) F.R.
Siddiqui said Thursday that the homecoming of Macao is a great
success of the Chinese government and its international peace
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a discussion meeting here, Siddique said Macao's
return to the motherland is the practice of late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping's theory of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
"It will accelerate the peaceful reunification of Taiwan to the
motherland," he said, adding "as a Third World country, we are
proud of such historic development of China."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, former Chief of Army Staff Lt. General M
Mahabubur Rahman said that Macao's return to the motherland is a
great success of the "one country, two systems" policy followed by
the Chinese government and "Taiwan will also be reunified with its
motherland on the basis of the same policy."
</P>
<P>
Rahman noted that "China is thriving and prospering day by day
and will play a very important role in the world."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Wang Chungui, more than 100
personalities of various circles of the country were present at
the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman on China's Diplomacy in 1999 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese foreign ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue gave a review of China's diplomacy this
year in response to a question raised at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
In the face of an ever changing world, she said, the Chinese
government has carried out an independent foreign policy of peace,
continued to maintain world peace and opposed hegemony and power
politics while keeping in mind the fundamental interests of the
Chinese people and people around the world for common development.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, China has played the role of a peace-loving,
cooperative and responsible big country, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, China resolutely safeguards its independence,
sovereignty, and national dignity, Zhang said. The Chinese
government and people conducted a resolute and vigorous struggle
after the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia by U.S.-led
NATO forces, which demonstrates the determined will of the Chinese
people to safeguard sovereignty and national dignity.

<P>
China has effectively fought against the so-called "two states
theory" advocated by Lee Teng-hui and dealt with the separatists
in Taiwan and again safeguarded national sovereignty, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, she said, China has continued to uphold justice,
oppose hegemony and maintain peace in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the Kosovo war, China stuck to the purposes and
principles of the United Nations Charter all the time, firmly
opposed to NATO's use of force, and proposed to resolve the
dispute politically by respecting the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia and ensuring the legal rights and
interests of all ethnic groups in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
China's stance on the Kosovo crisis was highly valued by the
international community, which illustrated the constructive role
of China in solving the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, China has taken an active role in participating in
multilateral diplomatic activities, and devoted its efforts to
promoting the establishment of a new international political and
economic order.

Fourthly, China has consistently insisted on the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence to further develop friendly
relations with other countries, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
China has been promoting cooperation and solidarity with
developing countries, and has strengthened good-neighborly and
trustworthy partnership with neighboring countries Zhang said,
adding that China's relations with the world's major powers have
maintained relatively stable, and ties with developed countries as
a whole have improved steadily.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Macao's smooth return to the motherland a few days ago
is another significant milestone in the cause of China's
reunification following the return of Hong Kong. It is also
another major event in China's diplomacy this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the guiding principle of "one country, two systems", "the
Macao people administering Macao" and a high degree of autonomy,
Macao's future will be much brighter.
</P>
<P>
Zhang predicted that China's diplomacy in the new century will
make even further progress.

<HEADLINE> 585 Rescued From Sinking Philippine Ferry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Coast Guards said
that 585 passengers have been rescued after ferry MV Trans Asia
South Korea sank Thursday morning near Cebu in the central
Philippines with more than 600 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, owner of the ill-fated 2,840-gross
ton ferry, said nine people have been confirmed dead in the mishap
while dozens are still missing.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada assured families of the
passengers and crew of the ferry that government rescue teams will
continue to work round-the-clock and are doing everything to
secure the safety of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers, including navy frogmen, are still searching for
survivors at the site of the sinking, some 10 nautical miles from
Bantayan island off the northernmost tip of Cebu.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Presidential Palace said the ship, with 578
passengers and 52 crew members on board, left Cebu City at 23:00 (
15:00 GMT) Wednesday for Iloilo City and capsized at 5:30 Thursday
(21:30 GMT, Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
However, Jonji Gonzales, a spokesman of Trans-Asia Shipping
Lines said the ferry carried 606 passengers and 56 crew members
when it left Cebu port.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales also brushed aside reports that the vessel was
overloaded, saying the ferry has a passenger capacity of 614 but
was carrying only 606 passengers when it sank.
</P>
<P>
Angelo Reys, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines, said he has dispatched 3 Philippine navy vessels and
air force helicopters to conduct search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Glen Gerald Dalisay, a 24-year-old survivor, said in a radio
interview that he noticed the ship tossing heavily on rough waters
at dawn until it stopped and sank.
</P>
<P>
He was rescued some six hours after the incident and was taken
to Hilutungan island where he was given warm food and clothing by
local officials.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Chief Orlando Mercado, who arrived at Cebu
city late Thursday afternoon, has ordered the setting up of
command posts to accommodate and assist survivors along the
shorelines near the sinking site of the ship.

CHONGQING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing's No. 1
Intermediate Court today sentenced a former county Party secretary
to life imprisonment for corruption and dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kaike, a former secretary of the Qijiang County
Committee of the Communist Party of China, was found guilty of
taking 96,000 yuan in bribes and apartments valued at 242,000 yuan,
as well as causing 1.6 million yuan in state tax revenue losses
due to his arbitrary granting of tax exemption and reduction of
legal penalties.

<P>
The court ordered the confiscation of his property worth 100,
000 yuan, and all his illegally gained money and other property.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was also confirmed to be guilty of dereliction of duty

which claimed 40 lives and injured 14 others, and caused 6.21
million yuan in direct economic losses.
</P>
<P>
The court said Zhang was responsible for the collapse of the

More than 300 people from all walks of life in this large
municipality in southwest China attended the trial.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will launch a pilot
scheme to train young school leavers and unemployed people to take
up jobs as junior IT assistants, said Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"With the increasing popularity of electronic commerce and the
use of internet, many companies require junior assistants to
perform such tasks as the maintenance and updating of web sites,
processing of trade documents in electronic format and office
database application," Tsang said after chairing the 17th meeting
of the Task Force on Employment here.
</P>
<P>
"With suitable training, young school leavers and unemployed
people can acquire the necessary skill to take up jobs such as web
administrator, computer graphics designer, electronic data
processing clerk and IT technical trainee," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government will earmark 3 million HK dollars (380,000 U.S.
dollars) for the pilot course, which will provide 170 training
places.
</P>
<P>
The course, to be jointly run by the Vocational Training
Council and the Employees Retraining Board, will commence between
February and March next year and will last for about 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The course is specially designed with active input from the IT
industry. Emphasis will be put on practical knowledge and training
to meet the needs of the industry," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
A Working Group has been set up by the Education and Manpower
Bureau to devise the scheme.
</P>
<P>
"We will conduct a review upon the completion of the pilot
scheme in May 2000, and if the results are satisfactory, we will
consider expanding the training capacity to benefit more people,"
Tsang said.

He pointed out that the structural reform of local government
organs is of great importance to local Party committees and
governments, adding that local governments should seize the
opportunity to discover and foster new talent and improve their

<P>
MACAO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Following three days of
celebrations and cocktail parties, some 17,000 civil servants of
the newly established government of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) got down to business and started their
first working day today.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the Macao SAR government sported a giant
national emblem of the People's Republic of China, as well as the
national and regional flags.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive of the Macao SAR, arrived on
time this morning and told journalists that the date "is of
unusual significance."
</P>
<P>
"The first working day marks a new beginning, the future
development of Macao will largely weigh on our work performance,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
As soon as he arrived at his office, Edmund Ho called together
the heads of five government departments for their first meeting
after the founding of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Florinda da Rosa Silva Chan, secretary for administration and
justice, asked journalists to convey her Christmas greetings to
fellow Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
"Excluding those on vacation, all the civil servants are on
duty today," she said. "Although they practically do the same job,
they feel different. They have a feeling of pride as they are now
masters of their own affairs."
</P>
<P>
Despite the chilly marine gale, "warmth" was the word Ho Chio
Meng, procurator-general of the Macao SAR procuratorate, described
his feeling about the first working day.
</P>
<P>
"When I see the national emblem above my head, I feel warmed in
my heart," he said. "Surely we are rather busy at the beginning of
our work, but we will achieve better efficiency as we are masters
of our own fate."
</P>
<P>
Telephones rang all the time in the offices of Macao SAR
government departments, and the staff members were busy but in an
orderly way.

"For most government employees, it is the first working day,
but for us, it is not," said staff Maggie Lou Kuai Lan. "We have
started work since December 20, and slept only a few hours each
day. We don't feel tired, but excited."
</P>
<P>
Across Macao, employees of some government organs were busy
hanging new signboards to replace the old ones with signs of
Portuguese rule. In fact, many plates had been changed over the
past several days.
</P>
<P>
Likely, local policemen began to wear new arm badges as soon as
China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Macao and the Macao
SAR was set up.
</P>
<P>
"The new badges with lotus flower look more beautiful and
comfortable," one policeman said, noting that "surely we will work
hard to improve the public security."
</P>
<P>
He added that Cheong Kuok Va, secretary for security of the SAR
government, assembled the first security conference this morning
and asked police forces to "live up to the expectations of Macao
residents."
</P>
<P>
Inside the office building of the Macao Monetary and Foreign
Exchange Authority, work was going on in an orderly way and
employees seemed excited.
</P>
<P>
"We are house-keepers of our own government today," said
Stanley T.K. Tang, a senior manager with authority. The government
coffer of 30 billion patacas (3.75 billion U.S. dollars) today
will lay a solid foundation for the region's economic development
in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
In front of the office of Macao Identification Services, many
people queued in a long line to apply for the passport and travel
permit of the Macao SAR. And staff workers said they had been kept
on working busily for days.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the services began to receive applications for
Chinese nationality today.
</P>
<P>
Lim Fa-san, a businessman holding a Canadian passport, came
early to ask for an application sheet.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Macao to the motherland is a major event for all
the Chinese people. As a Chinese, I definitely want to obtain the
nationality of China," he said, adding that he was also applying
for a passport of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Banks in Macao were just as crowded as before and post offices
were packed with more customers. The first working day in Macao
SAR was busy, exciting and full of joy.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control on SOE Materials Procurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENJIANG (Jiangsu), December 23 (Xinhua) -- China has carried
out a series of regulations to standardize and control the
procurement of materials made by state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Shao Ning, director of the enterprise reform bureau under the
State Economic and Trade Commission, urged SOEs nationwide to
fight against seeking private gains at public expense when
purchasing materials for their enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said at a national conference on SOEs' materials procurement,
which opened today in this coastal city in east China's Jiangsu
Province, that the campaign against waste and corruption in this
area will help SOEs save considerable amounts of money and
increase profits.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, the commission asked SOEs to
compare the offered prices and go to the reasonable one before
placing orders.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of November, SOEs in Jiangsu saved 2.45 billion
yuan by implementing this practice. Liaoning Province, an
important industrial base in northeast China, also saved 900
million yuan in materials costs.

<HEADLINE> Japan Promises to Resolve Waste Issue With Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan has promised to resolve
its waste problem with the Philippines by January 11 next year,
the Japanese embassy in Manila said Thursday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted Japan will "make best efforts to complete
the removal of the entire wastes," purportedly shipped out of
Japan a month ago by still unknown entities and still left
unclaimed at the port of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Reports said more than 2,000 tons of municipal and household
garbage, including syringes, adult diapers and sanitary napkins,
had been dumped in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Philippine officials Thursday, Japanese
consular officials said they will accelerate "the relevant
procedures" for the waste removal, in keeping with the Basel
Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides decided to establish a bilateral working group
to prevent a recurrence of such incidents through various efforts,
including the review of the export/import procedures of the two
countries under the Convention," the embassy said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
On December 19, Japan sent a fact-finding mission to Manila,
which also conducted on-site surveys and investigation at the port
of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent reports on the inspection said the mission was
unable to conclude whether or not the shipments were toxic, as
feared by concerned sectors.

<HEADLINE> HK to Fund Training on IT Technical Assistants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will launch a pilot
scheme to train young school leavers and unemployed people to take
up jobs as junior IT assistants, said Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang today.
</P>
<P>
"With the increasing popularity of electronic commerce and the
use of Internet, many companies require junior assistants to
perform such tasks as the maintenance and updating of web sites,
processing of trade documents in electronic format and office
database application," Tsang said after chairing the 17th meeting
of the Task Force on Employment here.
</P>
<P>
"With suitable training, young school leavers and unemployed
people can acquire the necessary skill to take up jobs such as web
administrator, computer graphics designer, electronic data
processing clerk and IT technical trainee," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government will earmark three million HK dollars (380,000 U.
S. dollars) for the pilot course, which will provide 170 training
places.
</P>
<P>
The course, to be jointly run by the Vocational Training
Council and the Employees Retraining Board, will commence between
February and March next year and will last for about 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The course is specially designed with active input from the IT
industry. Emphasis will be put on practical knowledge and training
to meet the needs of the industry," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
A working group has been set up by the Education and Manpower
Bureau to devise the scheme.
</P>
<P>
"We will conduct a review upon the completion of the pilot
scheme in May 2000, and if the results are satisfactory, we will
consider expanding the training capacity to benefit more people,"
Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Assures People of Y2K-free Holidays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- There will be no millennium bug
in the Philippines to disrupt banking, communications and
government services during the holidays, National Security Adviser
Alexander Aguirre assured the people on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Aguirre, who also heads the national
contingency task force on Y2K, allayed fears of a millennium bug
that would cause vital computer systems to bog down in the New
Year.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say to them is just enjoy the holiday season with
respect to their normal activities," he said, adding that there is
nothing to worry about the Y2K problem as enough preparations have
been made for it in the seven mission-critical sectors.
</P>
<P>
These seven sectors are government services, health care,
finance, manufacturing, utilities, telecommunication, and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said banks are ready for Y2K and remain the safest
place to store money, while manufacturers have assured enough food
and supplies during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
Transportation firms are ready for the Y2K bug, and some
airlines' cancellation of flights on December 31, 1999 and January
1, 2000 is purely a business decision and not related to Y2K, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Telephone and telecommunication companies are likewise Y2K-
ready, although the public is advised against making "curiosity
calls" that can congest the phone networks.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre also noted the government has set up an action center
with links to media and the National Disaster Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
He said the center, which starts operating on a 24-hour basis
on December 28, will respond immediately to any emergency that may
arise from problems related to the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
"Government and the private sector are ready for the bug. We
are monitoring everything to give the public the right information
on the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems
preventing them from correctly recognizing dates from January 1,
2000 onwards.

Wang has been in his the current position for nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
"My understanding of the 'one country, two systems' concept
created by Deng Xiaoping has deepened over the years," he said,
stressing that "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two
systems" is the best and most practical way to achieve China's
goal of complete national reunification.
</P>
<P>
The history of China for thousands of years has been one of
unification, he said. Since the Qin Dynasty, in spite of periods
of separation, the country has been unified more than three-
fourths of the time.
</P>
<P>
"Unification has been the persistent pursuit of the Chinese
nation and the trend of history," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to the motherland in 1997 was the first step
of China's reunification process, Wang said. After two and a half
years, any doubt about the implementation of the "one country, two
systems" concept have been dispelled.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the successful implementation of the principles of "
one country two systems," "Hong Kong people administering Hong
Kong," and a high-degree of autonomy, Hong Kong has maintained
sustained economic growth and social stability in spite of the
Asian economic crisis, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return marks the second step of China's reunification
process, and further validates the correctness of the "one country,
two systems" theory, he maintained.
</P>
<P>
The 1978 Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration was reached under
the guidance of the "one country, two systems" concept, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although many difficulties and disputes between the two
countries emerged in the ensuing years, they have been resolved
under the guidance of this concept," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren noted that there is another and the final step in
China's reunification process, the resolution of the Taiwan
question.
</P>
<P>
Deng's "one country, two systems" theory was actually put
forward to resolve the Taiwan question, but was put into practice
first in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Macao were ruled by foreigners until China
resumed the exercise of sovereignty over them. "But the Taiwan
question is the internal affair of China, and no foreign meddling
shall be tolerated," Wang Qiren said, adding that China will, as
always, adhere to the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Macao maintains close relations with Taiwan in
the areas of the economy, trade, cultural, and personnel exchanges
and cooperation, and serves as a bridge between China's mainland
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao reflects the Chinese government's
determination and confidence in national reunification.
</P>
<P>
As for the development of Macao after the handover, Wang said
that despite its small size, Macao has great potential.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the reform and opening-up of China's inland areas
since the late 1970s, Macao's economy has been booming, and its
four pillar industries -- tourism and recreation, manufacturing
and exporting, finance and insurance, and real estate -- have
developed greatly.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the number of tourists visiting Macao has been
from seven to eight million annually, or 20 times the local
population.
</P>
<P>
This is a very rare ratio, and demonstrates the unique
potential for Macao's economic development, Wang Qiren concluded.

HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The value of total retail
sales in Hong Kong in October sank by 5 percent to about 15.1
billion HK dollars (1.9 billion U.S. dollars), compared with
October 1998, according to the provisional statistics released by
the Census and Statistics Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After discounting the effect of price changes over the period,
the volume of total retail sales increased on a year-on-year basis
by 3 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
For the first ten months of 1999 as a whole, total retail sales
decreased by 3 percent in volume compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the volume of total retail
sales in the three months ending October 1999 slipped back by 3
percent compared with that in the three months ending July 1999.
</P>
<P>
The volume of retail sales is derived from the value of retail

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Turkey Determined to Consolidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government's recent
takeover of five ailing banks is part of a package of painful
financial reforms and a confirmation to global markets of its
determination to cut down its chronic inflation in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the short-term, the move may further strengthen the already
positive market sentiment and spark an increased flow of foreign
investment into Turkey's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the timing of the move was carefully
settled in coordination with the International Monetary Fund, which
endorsed a 4 billion U.S. dollars stand-by loan to Turkey, to boost
investors' confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the long-term, some experts said, the action indicates that
the government will stick to the IMF-sponsored plan to reduce its
inflation and consolidate its vulnerable financial sector while
pursuing its bid for European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
Most of Turkey's small-to-medium-size lenders invested heavily
in the once-lucrative government securities. Thus, the would-be
steep fall in inflation will deal a severe blow to those banks that
have lived largely on short-term incomes through transactions in
the currency and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
The move could be considered as precautions taken by the
government to avoid public panic in case dropping inflation leads
to collapse of those banks in lines.
</P>
<P>
The banking reform is part of an ambitious program, pursued by
the cabinet under Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit since it took office
in May, which includes the provision of international arbitration
on commercial disputes, capital markets legislation, steps to
revive privatization and social security reform to ease expanding
public spending.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a set of amendments to Turkey's banking legislation
took effect.
</P>
<P>
Under the articles passed by the parliament, the Banking
Regulatory and Supervision Board, a powerful watchdog agency
scheduled to be in place by August 31, 2000, will be in charge of
selling off, suspending or transferring troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit has said fighting inflation will remain the chief task of
his government.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the latest takeover will be aimed at further
lowering deposit and bond rates in the banking system which the
government thought will clear the way for the goal of reducing
inflation.

<HEADLINE> Feature: First Working Day of Macao SAR Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The headquarters of the Macao SAR government sported a giant
national emblem of the People's Republic of China, as well as the
national and regional flags.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive of the Macao SAR, arrived on
time this morning and told journalists that the date "is of
unusual significance."
</P>
<P>
"The first working day marks a new beginning, the future
development of Macao will largely weigh on our work performance,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
As soon as he arrived at his office, Edmund Ho called together
the heads of five government departments for their first meeting
after the founding of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Florinda da Rosa Silva Chan, secretary for administration and
justice, asked journalists to convey her Christmas greetings to
fellow Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
"Excluding those on vacation, all the civil servants are on
duty today," she said. "Although they practically do the same job,
they feel different. They have a feeling of pride as they are now
masters of their own affairs."
</P>
<P>
Despite the chilly marine gale, "warmth" was the word Ho Chio
Meng, procurator-general of the Macao SAR procuratorate, described
his feeling about the first working day.
</P>
<P>
"When I see the national emblem above my head, I feel warmed in
my heart," he said. "Surely we are rather busy at the beginning of
our work, but we will achieve better efficiency as we are masters
of our own fate."
</P>
<P>
Telephones rang all the time in the offices of Macao SAR
government departments, and the staff members were busy but in an
orderly way.
</P>
<P>
"For most government employees, it is the first working day,
but for us, it is not," said staff Maggie Lou Kuai Lan. "We have
started work since December 20, and slep only a few hours each day.
We don't feel tired, but excited."
</P>
<P>
Across Macao, employees of some government organs were busy
hanging new signboards to replace the old ones with signs of
Portuguese rule. In fact, many plates had been changed over the
past several days.
</P>
<P>
Likely, local policemen began to wear new arm badges as soon as
China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Macao and the Macao
SAR was set up.
</P>
<P>
"The new badges with lotus flower look more beautiful and
comfortable," one policeman said, noting that "surely we will work
hard to improve the public security."
</P>
<P>
He added that Cheong Kuok Va, secretary for security of the SAR
government, assembled the first security conference Thursday
morning and asked police forces to "live up to the expectations of
Macao residents."
</P>
<P>
Inside the office building of the Macao Monetary and Foreign
Exchange Authority, work was going on in an orderly way and
employees seemed excited.
</P>
<P>
"We are house-keepers of our own government today," said
Stanley T.K. Tang, a senior manager with authority. The government
coffer of 30 billion patacas (3.75 billion U.S. dollars) today
will lay a solid foundation for the region's economic development
in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
In front of the office of Macao Identification Services, many
people queued in a long line to apply for the passport and travel
permit of the Macao SAR. And staff workers said they had been kept
on working busily for days.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the services began to receive applications for
Chinese nationality on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lim Fa-san, a businessman holding a Canadian passport, came
early to ask for an application sheet.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Macao to the motherland is a major event for all
the Chinese people. As a Chinese, I definitely want to obtain the
nationality of China," he said, adding that he was also applying
for a passport of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Banks in Macao were just as crowded as before and post offices
were packed with more customers. The first working day in Macao
SAR was busy, exciting and full of joy.

from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Moroccan Finance Minister Fathallah Oualalou said that
the growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) of Morocco in

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
killed and nearly 10 others were wounded in two separate incidents
in Mogadishu since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The most serious incident took place when heavily armed rival
militiamen have exchanged gunfire near the densely populated Bar
Ubah junction of South Mogadishu Thursday, killing four people and
wounding six others.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness, the shooting began after gunmen
have opened fire on a Toyota Landcruiser pickup passing by the
junction at about 11:00 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Hastened gunmen on board the pickup have reacted wildly by
opening indiscriminate fire in every direction.
</P>
<P>
The deceased included a street vendor selling bread on a
wheelbarrow while among the seriously wounded was a young lady who
later died of her wounds in a nearby treatment center.
</P>
<P>
Also another man was killed and three others were wounded when
a battle wagon opened fire upon a tanker truck at Galgalato area
of North Mogadishu on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this shooting is said to have related to a
revenge taking action carried out by militiamen from the Rer Matan
subclan against their rival Warsangeli clansmen, both subclansmen
belong to the main Abgal clan of faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed.

<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Leung Bowen, director of the
Office of the Government of China's Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) in Beijing, today explained the
HKSAR plan for introducing outstanding talent into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The official noted at a press conference here this afternoon
that the HKSAR government will not be involved in interviewing or
hiring inland professionals who want to work in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Those interested in working in Hong Kong must be employed by
HKSAR-registered firms before applying, in accordance with the
plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which went into effect on December 17, is aimed at
improving the HKSAR's competitive power in the world, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
So far, the office has handled 199 such applications, while the
firms themselves have the right to decide on the final disposition
of their employees.
</P>
<P>
The office offers related applications for those who have been
hired by HKSAR companies, but the office will not directly deal
with any job applications or pass them on to the enterprises.

<P>
The Muslim opposition parties want to share power with el-
Bashir's government while the SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for
greater autonomy for the mostly Christian and animist south. The
two sides have formed an opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
Regarding bilateral ties, the communique said the presidents
have decided to take necessary steps to normalize the relations and
that the Egyptian ambassador will soon return to Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and al-Bashir agreed to settle the border dispute at
Halayeb within an integrated and brotherly framework, it said.
</P>
<P>
They decided to set up a joint committee under the foreign
ministers to follow up the relations and the implementation of
measures agreed upon, it added.
</P>
<P>
The ties of the two Arab neighbors soured after Cairo accused
Khartoum of harboring Islamic militants attempting to topple the
secular Egyptian government and masterminding an assassination
attempt on Mubarak in 1995. Khartoum confiscated Egyptian
properties in Sudan, and Cairo recalled its ambassador. The two
sides later went into brief armed conflicts over claims to the
Halayeb border area.
</P>
<P>
The relations have been much improved in the recent two years
after the two countries reiterated readiness and willingness to
resolve their disputes through dialog and exchanged visits by
senior officials to seek rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
On December 12, al-Bashir declared a three-month state of
emergency and dissolved the parliament in an apparent effort to
foil attempts by the former parliament speaker, Hassan al-Turabi,
to shrink presidential powers. Egypt immediately expressed support
for al-Bashir's steps, which it said were aimed at securing Sudan's
national unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Cairo said the ouster of al-Turabi and Egypt's
supportive stance have created the suitable atmosphere for the
normalization of the Egyptian-Sudanese relations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Parliament Adjourns Indefinitely after 1st Sitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Dewan Rakyat (
House of Representatives) adjourned sine die Thursday after its
first four-day sitting following the general election held on
November 29.
</P>
<P>
During its first sitting, the House reelected Mohamed Zahir
Ismail as Speaker for the fifth term and elected MPs Mohammad
Abdullah and Lim Si Cheng, both from the ruling Barisan Nasional (
BN) (National Front), as deputy speakers, followed by the swearing-
in of all the 193 MPs except for two opposition members.
</P>
<P>
The country's 10th parliament comprises 148 BN members and 45
opposition MPs.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the Consolidated Fund (Expenditure on
Account) Bill 1999 to set aside allocations for the government's
operating expenditure for the first six months of 2000 as the 2000
Budget first tabled last October 29 by First Finance Minister Daim
Zainuddin was not passed by Parliament due to its dissolution on
November 11 to make way for the November 29 general election.
</P>
<P>
Daim, now Finance Minister, is scheduled to re-table the same
budget in February next year.
</P>
<P>
The first sitting of the new parliament also passed three other
re-tabled bills, namely the Supplementary Supply (1999) (No.2)
Bill 1999, the Income Tax (Amendment) (No.2) 1999 Bill and the
Sales Tax (Amendment) Bill 1999.
</P>
<P>
These bills needed re-tabling because although they were first
tabled and passed last October, they could not be passed by the
Upper House because of the dissolution of the Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Australia Issues Alert over Contaminated Aircraft Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia's aviation safety
authorities Thursday issued an urgent nationwide alert to light
aircraft operators over contaminated fuel.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority said the fuel had been
traced following a recent incident in the Victoria state when a
light aircraft suffered engine failure just before take-off.
</P>
<P>
"The take-off was aborted after the engine failed and the plane
was taken back and the engine stripped back to discover what went
wrong," spokesman Peter Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
"They tracked back from that and found that the fuel had
started corroding parts in the fuel system of the aircraft, the
carburetor and the fuel system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This was causing deposits in the engine which then caused the
engine to fail," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gibson said users of all light aircraft with piston engines
should have their engines checked for deposits before flying the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
He said it wasn't clear what the contamination was, but fuel
tampering was not suspected at this stage.

<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A recent report by China's
Ministry of Finance on 100 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) reveals
problems in their accounting reports.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jun, a ministry spokesman, said 81 of the SOEs were found
to have tampered with their books, with 3.76 billion yuan of
fictitious assets. False accounts of owner's equity in 83 of them
involved 2.61 billion yuan, while bogus profits in 89 enterprises
amounted to 2.75 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The audit also found sloppy management of accounts in some of
these enterprises. Fake and substandard vouchers were prevalent in
many of the SOEs, and uncertified accountants were employed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some non-governmental auditing firms were
found violating regulations and some with "serious irregularities.
"
</P>
<P>
The ministry is taking every possible measure to tackle these
problems, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Women's Bill Introduced in Indian Parliament </HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
Thursday introduced the controversial Women's Reservation Bill in
Lok Sabha (Lower House) amidst confusion and attempts to snatch it
from the hands of Law Minister Ram Jethmalani.
</P>
<P>
The Bill was introduced for the third time in a familiar scene
in the House -- first it was in 1996 and the second in 1998 -- as
its opponents tried to stall it by trying to grab anything that
was available in the law minister's hands.
</P>
<P>
The measure provides for one-third reservation of seats for
women in Lok Sabha and State Assemblies but members belonging to
the Muslim League and other Organizations that vociferously
opposed to its introduction in its present form as they want sub-
quotas for women belonging to backward classes, minorities and
others.
</P>
<P>
Law Minister Jethmalani, who introduced the bill, said that the
issue of empowerment of women had been raised in different fora in
the country from time to time.
</P>
<P>
"Political empowerment of women is rightly perceived as a
powerful and indispensable tool for upliftment of women and
eliminating gender inequality and discrimination," he said, adding
that re-introduction of the bill "is in fulfillment of the people'
s mandate."

The institute also predicted that the GDP growth rate will come
down to 7.8 percent as it estimated that the rate will slow up to
9.3 percent in the first half of next year and 6.5 percent in the
second.
</P>
<P>
Growth of exports will slow down to 11.7 percent and that of
imports to 18.1 percent next year from this year's 18 percent and

Meanwhile, the current-account surplus will shrink to 12.6
billion U.S. dollars next year from this year's 25.2 percent while
the consumer price will rise to 3.2 percent from 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the institute said top priority for the next year
should be placed on price stabilization by practicing currency and
fiscal policies in conservative manner as inflation will worsen
corporate profitability and lead to business jitters.
</P>
<P>
The government should help financial institutions to cope with
the adverse effect of massive capital inflow, to reduce maturity
extension for loans to insolvent companies and to minimize the
injection of public fund in connection with the restructuring of
the financially-troubled Daewoo Group and investment and trust
companies heavily exposed to Daewoo crisis, said the institute in

<HEADLINE> China's Qingdao Hires Former Red Star Coach Ostojic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, China, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Qingdao Hainiu
on Thursday signed a contract with former Red Star coach Miloljub
Ostojic of Yugoslavia for coaching the first-division club in the
next season.
</P>
<P>
Hainiu president Qin Ning said his club also hired Yugoslavians
Branislav Jovannov and Branko Vojinovic as assistant coaches on
the advice from Ostojic.
</P>
<P>
Ostojic, 50, resigned from the Red Star post last September
after the former Champions Cup winner produced a string of poor
results in the domestic and international competitions.
</P>
<P>
He was successful in a brief period with Obilic and guided the
club to the Yugoslavian championship title in 1996. Ostojic was
also named the country's Best Coach for the same year.
</P>
<P>
The goal for Qingdao next season is to finish among the top six
on the league standings while scoring a better result in the
Chinese Football Association Cup, the club said.
</P>
<P>
Qin said if Ostojic's performance is satisfactory, his contract
will be extended for one year.
</P>
<P>
Hainiu made a league record last season after it replaced its
coach for four times. It finished 10th on the final standings.

<HEADLINE> Approvals of Investment in Australia Jump, Value Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The approvals of foreign
investment in Australia in 1998-1999 jumped in number but
decreased in value, the annual report of the country's Foreign
Investment Review Board said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by federal Assistant Treasurer Rod Kemp,
showed there were 4,642 investment proposals approved in 1998-1999,
compared with 4,261 approved in 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
Approvals for 1998-1999 involved proposed investment of around
67 billion Australian dollars (44 billion U.S. dollars). That is a
16 percent decrease from 1997-1998 approvals of 79.5 billion
Australian dollars (52 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The sharpest decline in percentage terms was in the tourism
sector experiencing a 70 percent fall in the value of approvals
from 3.6 billion Australian dollars (2.4 billion U.S. dollars) to
1.1 billion Australian dollars (726 million U.S. dollars)," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"Approvals for manufacturing declined from 23.5 billion
Australian dollars (15.5 billion U.S. dollars) to 16.5 billion
Australian dollars (10.9 billion U.S. dollars) and for real estate
from 16.3 billion Australian dollars (10.8 billion U.S. dollars)
to 11.2 billion Australian dollars (7.4 billion U.S. dollars)," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that most proposed investment continued to come
from the Unite States, with U.S. investors contributing around 29.
3 billion Australian dollars (19.3 billion U.S. dollars) or 44
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the value of the investment, the United States was
followed by the United Kingdom with 12.7 billion Australian
dollars (8.4 billion U.S. dollars) and Germany with 3.2 billion
Australian dollars (2.1 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Uganda Release 6 Chadian POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government
Thursday released six Chadian prisoners of war (POWs) the Ugandan
troops had captured in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
last year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda handed over "the prisoners of war to those who represent
their interest here" in compliance with the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement, Ugandan State Minister Amama Mbabazi said at the
release ceremony in the Makindye military barracks in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we officially release POWs under a
directive of an agreement," Mbabazi said. "We will be releasing
some Sudanese POWs we captured in both northern Uganda and the
DRC."
</P>
<P>
The hand-over ceremony was witnessed by officials from the
Libyan Embassy to Uganda, a Chadian government delegation and
members of the Joint Military Commission who just arrived
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chadian POWs would temporarily be taken care of by the
Libyan Embassy, Mbabazi said, because Chad and Uganda talked and
decided on the matter in April in Sirte, Libya, where the
presidents of the two countries met with DRC President Laurent
Kabila with the mediation of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Chad had reportedly pulled back its troops in the DRC. Some
2,000 Chadian troops were sent to back Kabila in fighting against
rebels after the civil war broke out in the third largest African
country in early August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fighting to topple Kabila have been supported by
Uganda and Rwanda.

<P>
KAMPALA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni left here on Thursday morning for the State of Palestine
where he would join other leaders in celebrating Christmas and the
birth of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, accompanied by his wife Janet Museveni, was invited

Office said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations will take place at the Church of Nativity in
the Holy City of Bethlehem which is under the control of the
Palestine National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The church was built on the site of the manger where Jesus
Christ was born. Bethlehem is a small town with a population of
about 7,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations at the church are part of a bigger project,
the Bethlehem 2000 project, which was established in March 1997
with the aim of promoting Bethlehem's rich past and encouraging
tourists and pilgrims to visit the historic religious site.
</P>
<P>
The project will manage a whole range of events associated with
 millennium celebrations whose program will span 16 months
starting on Christmas day through to Easter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan delegation also includes First Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya, Chairman
of the ruling National Resistance Movement Caucus in Parliament
Gilbert Bukenya and other officials.

<P>
LAGOS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
ordered the immediate dismantling of all permanent check points on
high ways in the country to facilitate free movement of personnel
and goods, the Guardian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following Wednesday session of the Federal Executive Council,
Information Minister Dapo Sarumi said in Abuja that "the council
expressed deep concern on the establishment of road blocks on the
nation's major roads."
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the check points had continued to
inhibit movement of personnel including tourists as they are
subjected to all sorts of harassment including demand for
passports, visas, vehicle papers and other documents with a view
to extorting money from them.
</P>
<P>
He said that security agents like army, immigration, customs
and police should be restricted to the border and intensify
highway patrol throughout the country with a purpose to check the
smugglers.

<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Ruimin, president of
Haier Group, an internationally respected household appliances
maker based in Qingdao, Shandong Province, has been ranked among
the world's top 30 business executives by Britain's Financial
Times magazine recently.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a Chinese business executive has
received such an honor. Zhang and the heads of Japan's Sony and
Honda are the three from Asia in the Financial Times list.
</P>
<P>
Jack Welch, president of General Electric, Bill Gates, chairman
of Microsoft, and Louis V. Gerstner, chairman of IBM topped the
list.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was chosen because he has salvaged Haier from the brink
of bankruptcy and turned it into a modern enterprise engaged in
international operations. In the 1990s, Haier products first enter
the international market and Zhang was determined to make Haier an
internationally recognized brand name
</P>
<P>
Haier products are sold in more than 30,000 sales outlets in 87
countries and regions worldwide. Since 1996, Haier has built
overseas plants in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
From January to November, Haier exported products worth 120
million U.S. dollars, a massive 120 percent increase on a yearly
basis.
</P>
<P>
Domestic sales of Haier products such as refrigerators,
freezers, air conditioners, and wash machines have steadily
increased since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide dealers of Haier products extended their
congratulations to Zhang.

<HEADLINE> General: Chechnya to Be Liberated in 2-3 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces will
assume control of all the territory of the breakaway republic of
Chechnya in two to three weeks, a top commander in charge of the
military campaign said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel-General Viktor Kazantsev, commander of the Joint Group
of Federal Troops in the Northern Caucasus, said the military part
of the counter-terrorism operation in Chechnya could be concluded
by the end of next January, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kazantsev reiterated that the federal forces would not storm
Grozny, the Chechen capital, as "it is unnecessary from a military
point of view." He said that "special operations" would be used
instead to free Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The main responsibility for such operations rests with
Interior Ministry troops and fighters of pro-Russian Chechen
police, the general said.
</P>
<P>
The federal assaults were launched in September following
armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a series
of terrorist bombings, which were also blamed on the Chechen
militants, that killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other
Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Amid progress by the federal forces, Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin convened a cabinet meeting Thursday on restoration work in
Chechnya, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all the Chechen territory is now under control of
federal forces, where 90 percent of the republic's population live,
" Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Although federal forces are still confronting "pockets of
resistance," especially in Grozny, the government should now
perform a "double duty" of coping with both the military and
social problems in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people had fled Chechnya since September,
but some of them are returning to areas under Chechen control.
</P>
<P>
"Social problems of the region are now coming to the fore,"
Putin said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Extends Ban on Korean Air After Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A ban on Korean Air opening new
routes was extended by six months Thursday after a cargo plane of
the national flag carrier crashed in Britain, said the Ministry of
Construction and Transportation.
</P>
<P>
Korean Air is still under a ban imposed by the South Korean
government following a series of accidents in recent years. With
the latest extension, Korean Air is forbidden to open new routes
before June 2001.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the ban is intended to prevent similar
accidents and to recover public trust in Korea Air at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry has sent a fact-finding team to Britain
to probe into the crash.
</P>
<P>
The KE850 B-747 cargo plane crashed early Wednesday evening
local time shortly after it took off from Stansted Airport, some
40 kilometers from London. All four crewmen on board were killed.
</P>
<P>
Last April, a Korea Air MD-11 crashed and exploded shortly
after take-off from Shanghai, China, killing seven people.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Sell Gas to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- After six years of
negotiations, Egypt Wednesday agreed to sell natural gas to Israel
through a "pipeline of peace," local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny has informed Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Cairo's decision, Barak's office said
in a late night statement.
</P>
<P>
The gas will be provided through a pipeline through El-Arish in
northern Sinai into Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Cairo will supply gas to Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority at the first stage and extend the pipeline to Turkey,
Syria, and Lebanon later, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who discussed the sale recently with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, said in the statement that he welcomes the project
and hopes it will succeed.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is expected to reach Israel in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's decision ended six years of on-and-off talks over the
natural gas supply between the two sides. The stalemate in the
peace process in the last three years has prevented progress at an
earlier stage.
</P>
<P>
The official announcement by Cairo came several days after
Israel and Syria resumed peace talks, which broke off nearly four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Israeli market will need 2.2 billion cubic
meters of gas a year during the first years and the annual demand
will rise to 6 billion cubic meters in five to seven years. Israel
has looked to several countries to provide natural gas.

"Without us knowing the source of a particular concept, the
source of a particular understanding, political value and norm, it

<HEADLINE> Taliban Announces Readiness to Talk With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia has announced its readiness to talk with Iran to remove
any "misunderstandings" between the two sides, the local daily
Tehran Times reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Motawakil has sent a
letter in this respect to Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi,
an informed source told Tehran Times, but failing to reveal when
the letter reached Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
"We want cordial ties with Iran on the basis of mutual respect,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs and useful
cooperation," Motawakil said in his letter, "we are ready to hold
talks with Iran in any place and at any time Iran chooses."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the killings of Iranian diplomats in Mazari
Sharif on August 8, 1998 was in contravention with the Taliban
policies and that the Taliban leader Mulla Omar has expressed
regret and ordered to investigate the killings to identify the
culprits.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces stormed the Iranian Consulate General in
Mazari Sharif, killing eight Iranian diplomats and one reporter of
the Islamic Republic News Agency inside the building, when they
took over the city, a stronghold of the anti-Taliban United Front.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the massacre, Iran demanded that the Taliban punish
the killers and offer an official apology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the Taliban improved last month after
Tehran opened its eastern borders for the Islamic fundamentalist
militia to import badly-needed food.
</P>
<P>
Iran allowed convoys of food across its border into Afghanistan
after the United Nations imposed aviation and financial sanctions
on the Taliban last month and Pakistan tightened its restriction on
cross-border trade with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran have provided support to the United Front, formed by the
deposed Afghan government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, since
it was driven out of the Afghan capital of Kabul in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani recently paid a four-day visit to Iran, in which he also
held talks with anti-Taliban Afghan leaders in an attempt to form
new alliance to fight against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's spokesman said on Tuesday that Rabbani has asked
General Abdul Rashid Mostam to return to the fighting against the
Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Court Upholds Death Sentence on Iraqi Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Amman Criminal Court has
upheld its death sentence on a 20-year-old Iraqi man who was
convicted of robbing and murdering a Jordanian supermarket owner
and his son in 1998.
</P>
<P>
After a review of the case by order of the Court of Cassation on
Wednesday, the Criminal Court upheld its death sentence on the
defendant Saed Khayoun, who was found guilty of murdering Faeq
Ahamd, 46, and his son Khalid, 18, on October 18, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Court had checked with Iraqi authorities the two
identification cards carried by the defendant. One was found forged
and the other valid.
</P>
<P>
Court documents said the defendant entered the kingdom in 1997
illegally in July 1997, and was hired by the victims in August 1998
at their supermarket in the southern Madaba district.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of the incident, the defendant took a gun from
the supermarket owner's drawer, shot the owner and his son who were
sleeping at the supermarket and fled with 1,300 Jordanian dinars
(some 1,800 U.S. dollars). He was arrested two days later.
</P>
<P>
The new verdict by the Criminal Court must be reviewed for a
second time by the Court of Cassation, which will either ratify the
ruling or return it to the Criminal Court for a second review,
according to the legal procedures of the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Renovated UNITA Claims Savimbi's Deposits in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The renovated National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has put in a claim for
the funds raised by Jonas Savimbi, which are currently frozen by
foreign governments and banks in line with the sanctions imposed
by the United Nation Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The funds frozen by diverse governments and financial
institutions belong to the party instead of Jonas Savimbi," said a
communique issued by the National Political Commission of the
Renovated UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Eugenio Manuvakola, head of the organization composed by
repentant rebels who had deserted the bellicose UNITA led by
Savimbi, appealed to the international community to pay attention
to the critical humanitarian situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According the sanctions decreed by the U.N. Security Council,
the large- amount funds raised by Savimbi through diamond
transactions have been frozen by foreign governments and banks.
</P>
<P>
Manuvakola said that his party will intensify diplomatic
contacts with concerned subsidiary organizations of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the largest opposition party in Angola also
reaffirmed the internal cohesion and unity, as well as its ideal
for peace, renovation and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The communique called on the members of the Renovated UNITA in
the National Assembly and the government to assume a posture
suitable for the " profound internal transformation" occurred in
the party.
</P>
<P>
It also exhorted the government to completely fulfill the 1994
Lusaka Protocol, especially the nomination of the members of
Renovated UNITA to the positions in the state organs.
</P>
<P>
The Renovated UNITA is now considered by the Angolan government
as the only legitimate negotiator for the peace process in Angola,
as the substitution for the warlike UNITA led by Jonas Savimbi,
whose soldiers are presently hiding in forest areas after a 38-day
general offensive launched by the government in the central
highland in mid-September.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Prospects "Extremely Good": ADB President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Asia has accomplished
remarkable and rapid economic growth and its prospects in the 21
century are"extremely good," Asian Development Bank (ADB)
President Tadao Chino said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Chino said that the great
achievement of all Asians collectively has been the courage and
vigor with which they have transformed their own continent in the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
"Asia has accomplished remarkable and rapid economic growth and
has expanded its economic share in the world (in the 20th century),
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Simultaneously, the governments of Asian countries have made
efforts to promote social development and improved the living
standards of people significantly. In the 20 century Asia took its
destiny into its own hands. These are immense accomplishments and
great contributions to the mankind," Chino said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the prospects of Asia's economic and social
development in the 21 century, the ADB president' described them
as"extremely good."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 years ago, he said, the gross domestic product (GDP)
of Asia as a whole accounted for only 10 percent of the world's,
but now Asia's GDP accounts for one quarter of the world's.
</P>
<P>
"This clearly shows that Asia is a major player in the global
economy. Its role is likely to increase," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chino said that today Asia is coming out of the financial
crisis,which hobbled the region in 1997 and 1998, and once again
becoming the fastest growing region in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Asia's share of the world economy is expected to increase in
the new century," the ADB president said.
</P>
<P>
On potential challenges which Asia will face in the new century,
Chino said that the biggest challenge facing Asia in the new
millennium is to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty, though improved significantly, still persists widely
in the region. Two out of three of the world's poor live in Asia,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Without poverty reduction, the region's development cannot be
sustained, Chino said.
</P>
<P>
He said that closely related to this are several other
challenges such as promoting the status of women, protecting the
environment,developing human resources, and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Asians have the will power, the education, the
discipline and the courage to overcome them," the president said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Takes Over Korea Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 23 (Xinhua) -- United States Newbridge Capital
took over Korea First Bank Thursday after the South Korean
government signed an agreement selling the bank's 51 percent of
shares at the price of 441 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Newbridge promised to inject an additional
200 billion won (some 200 million U.S. dollars) over the next two
years into the largest commercial bank of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. private equity company will also take over the bank's
complete loan portfolio, including workout debts while leaving non-
performing debts to the Korea Asset Management Corp.
</P>
<P>
The sale of Korea First Bank, which was nationalized last year
after the financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and
bad loans of financial institutions in late 1997, was a condition
set by the International Monetary Fund which provided a rescue
loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars to South Korea in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Korea First Bank remains a major bank in South Korea after
massive layoffs. Now it has 4,800 staff and 336 branch offices.
</P>
<P>
Newbridge has appointed Wilfred Horie, executive vice
president of the Associates First Capital Corp. in Los Angels, as
the president of Korea First Bank.
</P>
<P>
Horie, a Japanese-American banker, has worked as a services
expert at the Associates First Capital Corp. for 30 years and is
well-experienced in the Asian Market.
</P>
<P>
Newbridge will announce a completely new management strategy
when new executive members take office on January 4.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the sale of Korea First Bank preludes a greater
foreign role and a second wave of restructuring in the domestic
banking sector of South Korea.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government has
pledged 42 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 52.5 million U.S.
dollars) to Tanzania in the next three years for poverty
reduction.
</P>

The objective of the strategic plan for aid development
cooperation is to assist Tanzania in its efforts to improve the

Isolde Moylan said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sectors that will benefit from the aid package include
health, education, productive sectors of agriculture, natural
resources, tourism and governance, media reports Thursday quoted
the Irish official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's aid package to Tanzania for the 2000-2002 period
represents an increase of 75 percent compared to 24 billion
Tanzanian shillings (about 30 million dollars) offered during the
1997-1999 period.
</P>

Moylan handed the strategic plan over to Acting Permanent
Secretary in the Tanzanian Ministry of Finance Gray Mgonja.

<HEADLINE> Arab Countries Urged to Reduce Military Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 23 (Xinhua) -- An organization affiliated to
the United Nations has called on Arab countries to improve their
economic performance by reducing huge military spending, the Daily
Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Military expenditure in the region is considered one of the
highest in the world. This fact should change once peace is
established in the Middle East," the paper quoted a U.N. report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The report on economic development in the region was issued by
the Beirut-based Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia
(ESCWA), which groups 11 Arab country members.
</P>
<P>
The report said Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states were the
biggest spenders on military hardware and many Gulf states raised
their military spending substantially in the aftermath of the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The share of military and defense expenditures in the gross
domestic products of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member
states ranged between 5 percent and 13 percent in 1996, according
to ESCWA.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
"Total defense spending for the ESCWA members increased by 8.5
percent, from 35.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 to 38.7 billion
dollars in 1998," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that Arab governments must pay more
attention to social and economic needs of their people and improve
the widely slow economy.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- After years of
accumulated food shortages resulting from unfavorable weather
conditions, there is a glimmer of hope that Tanzania will not be
hit by an impending famine, according to meteorology authorities.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Orders to Shoot Cattle Rustlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has ordered security personnel to shoot on sight the cattle
rustlers who are terrorizing innocent people in western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
It is the only way to eradicate the escalation of cattle
rustling and other criminal activities in some regions of the east
African country, Moi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The security forces will not have any other alternative but to
shoot on sight anybody who will be found engaging in cattle
rustling activities," the East African Standard daily Thursday
quoted Moi as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that chiefs from communities involved in cattle
rustling would be sacked with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Those communities found condoning the retrogressive culture
would bear the responsibility to pay for the stolen animals, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged several ethnic communities to stop animosity and
livestock theft within their boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Cattle rustling, one of major crimes in Kenya, has become a
headache to the government. The army has joined local security
guards to fight the crime since last year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Liberalizes Opening of Internet Cafes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government has
liberalized the procedure for opening Internet cafes to enable a
larger segment of the society to get access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian businessmen who want to open Internet cafes are no
longer required to get special licenses from the Press and
Publications Department (PPD), the semiofficial Jordan Times
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
PPD head Abdullah Etmoum said anyone with an interest in opening
an Internet cafe will now only follow the usual procedures for
starting any other businesses, such as a grocery or book store.
</P>
<P>
It used to take a month or so to get a license from the PPD due
to the low efficiency of the bureaucratic procedures.
</P>
<P>
Internet cafes have mushroomed for the past few years in the
kingdom, though officials can not provide an exact number of
Internet cafes as new ones are opened every day.
</P>
<P>
Independent estimates put the number of computers linked to the
Internet in the country at more than 20,000, and authorities
received some 50 applications to open Internet cafes every month.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, with a 4.7 million population, is one of the few Arab
countries which have shown almost complete tolerance to the
Internet, and virtually all websites emerge uncensored to Internet
customers of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The government took the access to the Internet as a means of
getting the new generation acquainted with the information age and

<HEADLINE> Yearender: 1999, Another Hectic Year for Russian Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Sunday's parliamentary
elections culminated and epitomized Russia's political panorama in
1999, a year that skidded from relative tranquillity to a fierce
showdown.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary results released by the Central
Election Committee on Monday, the Communist Party, the Unity Party
backed by the Kremlin, and the Fatherland-All Russia movement won
the first three places in the balloting for the new State Duma, or
lower house.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Union of Right Forces, the liberal Yabloko
party and the bloc of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky also
cleared the 5 percent hurdle in their bid to enter the 450-seat
chamber.
</P>
<P>
Although the presidential election is in June, the Duma vote
is seen as a dress rehearsal for the race into the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the two elections have been the major factors
dominating the shift and alignment in Russia's political landscape
throughout the outgoing year.
</P>
<P>
Before April, the Russian political scene was relatively calm.
Yeltsin's sacking of Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov and the
reshuffle of the presidential administration produced only minor
impact. Most factions had opted to conceal their teeth in an
attempt to secure a better position in later elections.
</P>
<P>
That calm was shattered in April, when the various political
factions launched attacks against their opponents: the leftists
threw the impeachment motion against President Boris Yeltsin in
the State Duma; the Federation Council, or upper house of
parliament, kept blocking Yeltsin's removal of Skuratov; and with
the steep rising of Fatherland-All Russia, the rift between
Yeltsin and Yevgeny Primakov became all the more open.
</P>
<P>
To tide over his unfavorable standing, President Yeltsin twice
changed the government, dumping Primakov and Sergei Stepashin. The
political factions, concentrating on the elections as their
ultimate goal, just let Yeltsin have his way.
</P>
<P>
In September, the political movements started their "sprint"
toward the Duma elections, and their struggle gradually escalated.
</P>
<P>
To stunt the quick ascent of the center-left forces, the
Kremlin orchestrated the establishment of the Unity Party, a
movement headed by the popular Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the media outlets representing various political
factions intensified their offensives, resulting in a nasty "mud-
slinging" campaign unseen in years.
</P>
<P>
Most striking of all, it was the fierce showdown between the
Kremlin establishment and Fatherland-All Russia that pushed the
year's political confrontation to its culmination.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, observers believe, four characteristics were
behind the profound transformation of the Russian political
landscape.
</P>
<P>
First, the struggle between the Kremlin establishment and the
leftist forces, which had dominated Russian politics for years,
have shifted to a confrontation between the Kremlin and the center-
left Fatherland-All Russia, a movement widely considered anti-
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Fatherland-All Russia's perceived prospect of winning both the
parliamentary and presidential elections made it "top enemy" of
the Kremlin. This development marked a major shift in the Russian
political scene -- the emergence of a fresh, staunch foe against
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Second, as the leftist forces continued to hold a dominant
position, the right-wing forces witnessed some growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
With the failure of "liberal economic reforms," a tilt toward
the leftists and away from the rightists has persisted in Russian
politics in the past several years. As Fatherland-All Russia
finished third in the latest Duma elections, such a trend is
likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the quick rise of Unity and a rejuvenation of the
Union of Right Forces "from near death" indicated that the right-
wing forces' popularity has somewhat improved.
</P>
<P>
Third, despite his shaky position, President Yeltsin was still
capable of changing the situation to his advantage. Hospitalized
four times in the year, Yeltsin saw his standing, greatly weakened
in the wake of the government crisis of August 1998. It faltered
further under assaults from some media outlets, the uncooperative
upper and lower house of parliament, and attacks from center-left
movements.
</P>
<P>
However, throughout the year, Yeltsin reversed the
disadvantage through changes in cabinets, the establishment of pro-
Kremlin election blocs and the developments in Chechnya, once
again displaying his skill for political maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the events around Chechnya have greatly altered the
political situation that was once unfavorable to the Kremlin. The
federal troops' campaign against rebels in the breakaway republic,
following a series of terrorist bombings blamed on the Chechen
militants, have in effect transferred the public's preoccupation
and checked the falling of Yeltsin's prestige.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has also greatly boosted the popularity of
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and the pro-Kremlin Unity movement.
Chechen events played an extremely pivotal role in shaping Russia'
s political scenario in 1999.
</P>
<P>
For now, the conclusion of the Duma elections put an end to
the various forces' contest for dominance in the new lower house
of parliament, but it also marked the beginning of a more fierce
showdown in the presidential race next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- According to a poll which
appeared on the front page of "China Youth Daily" today, while
the Chinese people are "satisfied" with economic reform, they are
not content with the "general mood of society" and the widenening
gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,800 people were polled in 60 cities by the State
Commission for Economic Restructuring and the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent polled are satisfied with cultural life,
the international status of China, objective reporting in the
press and social development.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 80 percent were unsatisfied with "the
general mood of the society" and the widening gap between the rich
and the poor.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent said they were disappointed with employment,
the quality of consumption goods, environmental protection, public
security, social welfare and unlawful practices by government
organs. Falling sick, losing job, financial difficulties in the
family and price hikes were among the top concerns.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent, particularly workers and women, admitted
increasing pressure in their lives. However, about 70 percent
believed that things will turn better next year.
</P>
<P>
Many place high expectations on housing, education, scientific
research, the political system and caring for the elderely, while
others worry about medicare reforms, SOE reforms and employment.

<HEADLINE> EU to Offer Kenya $60M for Road, Biodiversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has
approved some 60 million U.S. dollars for the road and
biodiversity conservation projects in Kenya in the new year, the
Kenya Times newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lutz Salzmann, head of delegation of the European Commission in
Kenya, said in a statement that the road project, worth 55 million
dollars, will facilitate the rehabilitation of road between
Mai-Mahiu, Naivasha and Lanet in central Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, EU also approved the funding to the road
construction between Sultan Hamud and Mtito Andel, part of the
main Mombasa-Nairobi highway.
</P>
<P>
Salzmann noted the both projects are vital to improving Kenya's
trade network and form a major part of the commission's efforts to
rehabilitate the Northern Corridor between Mombasa and the
landlocked central and east African states.
</P>
<P>
EU will also finance a project worth around 5.5 million dollars
to enhance biodiversity conservation in Kenya, Salzmann said,

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Changes Chief of Main Spy Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korea President Kim Dae-
jung dismissed Chun Yong-taek, director of the National
Intelligence Service (NIS), said a presidential spokesman Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Former National Unification Minister Lim Dong-won was appointed
as the new director of the main government spy agency.
</P>
<P>
Chun Yong-taek was believed to have been fired due to his
controversial remarks on President Kim's acceptance of political
funds.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly told local journalists that President Kim Dae-
jung received political contributions from Samsung, a major
conglomerate, before the revision of the political fund law in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Lim Dong-won, who enjoys an extensive background and experience
in foreign and security affairs, once served as an army major-
general, ambassador to Nigeria, senior presidential secretary for
foreign affairs and national security before becoming the
Unification Minister.
</P>
<P>
"President Kim recognized Lim's sincere efforts to support the
government's engagement policy toward North Korea and his wide
range of knowledge on foreign and North Korean affairs," said
presidential spokesman Park Joon-young.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Park Jae-kyu, president of Kyung Nam University, was
named as the new Unification Minister to succeed Lim Dong-won.
Park was known as a "specialist in the affairs" of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Develop Solar Power to Brighten Rural area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia plans to develop
solar power to brighten one million rural families who still do
not have access to electricity.
</P>
<P>
Though solar energy projects have become quite popular in other
countries as the world tries to ease its dependence on fossil
fuels,such projects are almost non-existent in Cambodia, due to
the poverty and the lack of development. Most people here can
barely afford to feed their families, making a solar generator to
power lights or run a water pump a near impossibility.
</P>
<P>
But some successful pilot projects throughout the country has
encouraged the government to push ahead with the work.
</P>
<P>
According to government's plan, first is to install solar units
in schools, hospitals and orphanages, then to offer the units to
families for a low monthly fee. After that, a credit system would
be set up, in which a family would buy the whole solar system but
pay it off month by month.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM to Visit Turkey, Britain, Egypt, Ireland in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi is scheduled to visit Turkey, Britain, Ireland and Egypt
in January, the local daily Iran News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit to Turkey starting January 17,
Kharrazi will meet Turkish officials including President Suleyman
Demirel, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem, the daily quoted informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss bilateral, regional issues as well as Ankara's
pledge of compensation for the damages inflicted by Turkish raids
on Iranian border regions.
</P>
<P>
Repeated Turkish incursions into Iranian airspace and bombing
raids on these regions, proclaimedly to wipe out the rebel Kurdish
guerrillas taking shelter in Iranian territories, have inflicted
heavy damages in the area, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The last incident of its kind was reported on 18 July, 1999 when
an Iranian border outpost and several tribal tents in the Iranian
border town of Piranshahr were bombed. Five people were killed and
over 10 others injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's visit to Britain will be the first by an Iranian
foreign minister since the two countries downgraded their relations
in 1989 over the Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
The late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini
sentenced the British writer Salman Rushdie to death for his
controversial novel "the Satanic Verses," which was condemned by
Khomeini as blasphemous to Islam.
</P>
<P>
The two countries upgraded their diplomatic relations to the
ambassadorial level last May following an agreement to put aside
the Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's visit to Britain will be reciprocated by British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook later in 2000, Iran News said.
</P>
<P>
Iran-Egypt ties have gained momentum in recent months following
a series of exchange of visits and discussions. Both Tehran and
Cairo voiced their readiness to improve their relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Egypt severed diplomatic relations after the 1979
Islamic revolution as Tehran blamed Cairo for signing a peace
agreement with Israel, the first one by an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials have called on Iran to remove the hurdle for
the resumption of ties by changing the name of a main street in
Tehran, which was named after Khaled Islamboli, the assassin of
former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear so far if Kharrazi will discuss with Egyptian
officials on a possible resumption of diplomatic relations between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Britain Expected to Write off Zambia's Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is expected to be among
beneficiaries of Britain's 100 percent cancellation of debt owed
to it by the world's poorest countries, Zambia Daily Mail
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia currently owes Britain about 448 million U.S. dollars
and is expected to benefit from the British initiative within the
next year.
</P>
<P>
A statement released in Lusaka, Jubilee 2000 group, a
world-wide anti- debt campaign, welcomed the British initiative by
saying that it is an encouraging step forward.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Zambia is likely to get substantial benefit
within the year 2000 as the British concession takes effect.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor of the British Treasury, Gordon Brown, reportedly
announced the debt cancellation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Brown's announcement, Zambia will be among the 25
HIPC nations out of 41 that are expected to qualify into the
initiative by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Countries that will benefit from Brown's announcement were
those included in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
initiative, an international vehicle for debt rescheduling and
cancellation which was sponsored by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the British initiative will also push the IMF and
the World Bank toward quicker action to cancel multilateral debt,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The poor of Zambia and other heavily indebted countries can no
longer endure the injustice of depriving their children of basic
needs in order to service the debts owed to the rich," it added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Government Takes Over Five Ailing Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Shortly before the International
Monetary Fund was expected to endorse a 4 billion U.S. dollars
stand-by loan to Ankara, Turkey's economic officials took over
management of five troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Treasury Ministry announced in a statement that the
Central Bank's Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF) seized all
shares and managements of five small-to-medium-sized private
lenders, including Esbank, Yasarbank, Egebank, Yurtbank and
Sumerbank, the Anatolia News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "in a step parallel with changes in
banking legislation, measures are being taken to eliminate the
problems in the financial structures of these banks."
</P>
<P>
The government immediately appointed new managers and board
members for all five banks. In a separate decision, the government
cancelled the banking license to a small investment bank.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said the banks will
continue their operations without interruption and under
governmental management.
</P>
<P>
"No deposit-holder should worry. The decision was made to
rehabilitate the five banks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Ministry said the takeovers were made necessary due
to the weak financial conditions of the five banks, with total
assets worth 1.8 quadrillion Turkish liras (3.6 billion dollars).
All five banks had long been under scrutiny for failing to fulfill
financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish banking law, all savings deposits are covered
by full state guarantee against the collapse or insolvency of
banks. With the most recent takeovers, the number of banks under
the disposition of the SDIF rose to eight in the country.

<HEADLINE> China State Development Bank Opens New Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank of
China recently opened new branches in five major cities in north,
central, northwest and southwest China.
</P>
<P>
 The five cities are Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu, Taiyuan, the
capital of Shanxi, and Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has established 27 regional branches, including 14 in
the above-mentioned regions.
</P>
<P>
Established five years ago, the State Development Bank has been
playing a major role in funding large infrastructure projects such
as the Beijing--Kowloon Railway, the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plan
and the Three Gorges Hydropower Plant.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has a total assets worth 600 billion yuan and holds 40
percent of the state bank's medium and long-term loans.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said the establishment of these five branches is
a major move on the part of the Bank to implement the government's
strategy to development its western regions which are rich in
resources but economically backward compared to coastal regions in
the east.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's loans in the underdeveloped areas has reached 380
billion yuan, accounting for 56 percent of its total loans. The
establishment of the new branches would enable the Bank to manage
and monitor its projects there more efficiently, Bank officials
said.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Paul Henderson, an Olympian
at the Atlanta Olympic Games, has to face a drugs panel after his
appeal to have the doping case dropped was rejected.
</P>
<P>
Henderson tested positive for steroids but appealed to an
independent tribunal. He argued that the results should be
invalidated because he did not sign the consent form until several
hours after the samples were taken.
</P>
<P>
But Henderson, a member of the Australian relay team at Atlanta,
was rejected by the tribunal on Thursday, which means that he
would have to face an Athletics Australia doping panel.
</P>
<P>
Henderson faces a ban of up to two years if found guilty.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Bank Increasing Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) --China's largest state-owned
commercial bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)
, has increased its housing loans since the start of this year,
bank officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the Bank show that by the end of November,
housing deposits totaled 103.8 billion yuan, including 29.3
billion yuan in Public Housing Funds, while housing loans stood at
115.6 billion yuan, an increase of 32.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said increasing real estate loans will not only
improve the housing industry, but expand new business and improve
the Bank assets.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, housing development loans from the Bank
were 57.7 billion yuan, a 10.2 billion yuan increase from the
beginning of the year. In the same period, the Bank's individual
housing lending increased by 20.6 billion yuan, reaching 36.2
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
ICBC will continue to give priority to individual housing loans
and the development of ordinary commodity houses next year. The
Bank plans to spend 36 billion yuan on individual housing loans
and 14 billion yuan on housing development.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of housing loans against the total loans of the
Bank will increase annually by two percent in the next five years.
The percentage of individual housing loans will be 1.5 percent. In
five years, housing loans will account for 15 percent of the Bank'
s total loans while individual housing loans will account for 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, the Bank's loans in real estate is expected to reach
450 billion yuan, while total individual housing loans would be
300 billion, 10 times that of the current figure.
</P>
<P>
The Bank is also looking into the possibilities of new payment
packages and new interest schemes for individual housing loans. In
addition, applying for housing loans will become more simplified
in the future.

<P>
WELLINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand economic
activity increased in the third quarter of this year by 2.3
percent, said Government Statistician Len Cook when releasing the
latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest increase returns the economy to the pattern of
steady growth evident since mid-1998, which was interrupted by the
small 0.3 percent fall in the second quarter of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the year from October 1998 to September 1999, New Zealand's
economy grew by 1.9 percent, close to the annual rate which
prevailed before the Asian financial crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
A marked jump in export volumes, which were up 7.3 percent for
the third quarter, has mainly driven the recovery, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with exports, the rise in import volumes for the
quarter was much more modest, up by 2.1 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the year to September 1999, the total exports of the
country were up 5.2 percent, according to the statistician.

<HEADLINE> Two Confirmed Dead From Sinking Philippine Ferry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Two dead male passengers have
been plucked from the seawaters where passenger ferry MV Trans
Asia South Korea sank Thursday morning in the central Philippines
with more than 600 passengers on board, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard authorities in Cebu said in a report that Mb Martha
II,a fishing vessel, radioed that they have plucked two male dead
persons near Hilutungan island, the first two confirmed fatalities
in the sinking of the ferry boat.
</P>
<P>
The report said a cargo vessel with more than 200 survivors on
board is now heading for Anawayan in Panay island where the ship's
skipper is expecting calmer seas.
</P>
<P>
Survivors were supposed to be brought to Bantayan island but
rough seas prevented the cargo ship from docking near that island.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said rescuers including navy frogmen were
still searching for survivors at the site of the sinking, some 10
nautical miles from Bantayan island off the northernmost tip of
Cebu.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Presidential Palace said the ship, with 578
passengers and 52 crew members, left Cebu City at 22:00 (14:00 GMT)
Wednesday for Iloilo City and capsized at 5:00 Thursday (21:00 GMT,
Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
Angelo Reys, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines,said he has dispatched 3 Philippine Navy vessels and
Philippine Air Force helicopters to conduct search and rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that strong wind and overloading might have
caused the incident.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Challenges Poll Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican National
Resistance (Renamo), main opposition party of the country, has
challenged the officially announced results of the December 3-5
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama, who lost the presidential
election to incumbent President Joaquim Chissano, claimed
Wednesday that the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party
(Frelimo) had "stolen" its victory.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in his Maputo residence, Dhlakama
claimed that the results announced by Jamisse Taimo, chairman of
the National Elections Commission on Wednesday morning had been
"forged" by the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that Chissano beat Dhlakama by 52.29 percent
to 47.71 percent, and in the parliamentary election Frelimo took
133 seats and Renamo 117.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama insisted that in reality Renamo had won, saying that
Renamo lawyers are drawing up a brief on election irregularities
as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
Demanding a recount, Dhlakama said that Renamo is taking this
to the Supreme Court which has the final say in electoral
disputes.
</P>
<P>
"We shall challenge these elections by all legal means. We
shall never accept these results," the Mozambique News Agency
quoted Dhlakama as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If Chissano puts pressure on the Supreme Court to validate
these elections, then Mozambique will become ungovernable," the
opposition leader threatened.
</P>
<P>
However, Dhlakama did not specify what the Renamo would do if
the Supreme Court throws its appeal out.
</P>
<P>
He would not even state whether newly elected Renamo members of
 parliament will take their seats in the new legislature or will
stage a boycott.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama claimed that Renamo technical staff had been denied
access to the computerization of data, both in the provinces and
at the Maputo headquarters of the executive Electoral
Administration Technical Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama also claimed that international observers had only
witnessed the voting itself and not the count.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the elections commission announced his
re-election for another five-year term, Chissano said that his
victory has confirmed the justice of his policies and the people's
will to fight for a better future.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry into WTO to Bring Huge Foreign Investment in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's huge agricultural
market will create unprecedented opportunities for foreign
investment in the sector after the country becomes a (WTO) member,
said a official with the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
When China enters the WTO, it will dramatically reduce import
tariffs for farm produce and change its trade and foreign currency
management systems further to attract foreign investment, said
Tang Zhengping, director of the ministry's International
Cooperation Department.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of China's agriculture and rural economy calls
for more foreign investment and technology, he told a recent news
briefing to announce the Agro-Foodtech Exposition next April in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China's grain output is expected to reach 540 million to 560
million tons by 2010. Meat output should increase by 15 million
tons, milk 14.4 million tons, and irrigated farmland 56.7 million
hectares.
</P>
<P>
To attain these targets, China needs to introduce advanced
agricultural technology, agricultural production material and high-
quality seeds.
</P>
<P>
The improving living standards of the Chinese people has placed
higher demands for the quality and packaging of farm produce, Tang
said.
</P>
<P>
The Agro-Foodtech Exposition, to be held on April 11 to 14 2000,
is jointly sponsored by the Specialized Sub-Council of Agriculture
under the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade
and a French Expo Company.
</P>
<P>
Tang believed the Expo will provide excellent opportunities for
exchanges and cooperation between Chinese and foreign business
people in agricultural and food processing sectors.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Exciting Place to Do Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- "If you have to work for a
living, Hong Kong is the best place in the world to be," said
Jason Felton, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong
Kong (AmCham), in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Felton, who has been resident of Hong Kong since 1985,
described Hong Kong, with its good financial, legal and consultant
services as well as unique cultural fascination, as "an exciting
place to do business."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the handover of Hong Kong has had any influence
on his life or business, Felton, a partner with the international
accountancy firm of Ernst &AMP; Young in Hong Kong, said the event
made little change to his life or business.
</P>
<P>
"I have much personal and social freedom as I had before. My
company experienced downturn, but that has nothing to do with the
handover. It is a result of the overall regional economic decline,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman believed "the prospect for Hong Kong is quite good.
"
</P>
<P>
China's imminent entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO)
is expected to attract more investment of U.S. companies,
especially those middle-sized companies. Hong Kong, with a great
deal of expertise and the advantage of language, is an ideal place
for these companies to launch their investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The investment environment of Hong Kong is becoming much
better these days. Property price has dropped significantly," said
Felton.
</P>
<P>
According to AmCham's 1999 Business Outlook Survey, 84 percent
of AmCham member companies foresee a "good" or "satisfactory"
outlook in Hong Kong for the year 2000, compared with 54 percent
forecast for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Felton said that AmCham will continue to work with the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
to promote trade between the HKSAR and the United States.
</P>
<P>
AmCham, a non-profit organization established in 1969, has set
its mission as fostering the development of commerce between the U.
S., Hong Kong and the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing we can do to help promote trade between Hong
Kong and the United States is to help China get the normal trade
relations (NTR) status in the U.S. Congress. As China continues to
grow, so will Hong Kong grow. As American investment in China
grows, Hong Kong will benefit," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past nine years, AmCham has tried to lobby the Congress
on this issue ever year.
</P>
<P>
"AmCham plans to send a delegation to Washington D.C. in Spring
2000 to lobby the U.S. legislators on the merits of the landmark
WTO accord and permanent NTR status for China," Felton said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that China will get the NTR status because it is not
only in the interest of China but also that of the U.S.," he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Expected to Exceed 5 Percent in 2000: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 2000 can exceed the projected 5 percent growth
because of the economy is expected to have better performance in
comparison to this year, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Based on a combination of positive economic indicators,
including increasing exports, a better show by the other sectors
of the economy and encouraging oil price, "next year's GDP growth
should be better than this year's projected growth of 4.3 percent,
" he said at a press conference after launching Bank Negara (State
Bank) Malaysia's commemorative millennium gold coin.
</P>
<P>
On whether the GDP might return to pre-1997 economic crisis
levels, he said: "Maybe, (but) we are always conservative, we only
projected five percent for next year, like for this year, we
projected one percent but we are able to achieve 4.3 percent."
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether local industries could expect more
help from the government, he said there would not be much since
the government had done everything possible like lowering interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The government had also made a lot of credit available,
provided initiatives for the home ownership campaign, retail sales
and even allocating 150 million ringgit (39.473 million U.S.
dollars) for promoting tourism, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment rate in Slovakia
reached a record high of 19.31 percent at the end of November, an
official report from Bratislava said.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics of the National Labor Bureau said the
jobless rate in November increased by 3.9 percent compared with
the same month of last year, and the number of the unemployed
registered nationwide rose to 514,000.
</P>
<P>
The bureau expects the unemployment rate to go over 21 percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the average monthly rate was 15.4 percent, or 383,000
people.
</P>
<P>
The increase was caused mostly by the decline of the national
economy. The gross domestic product (GDP) in the first nine months
of this year rose by only 1.8 percent compared with the same
period of 1998, or 4 percentage points lower than the year-ago
level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inflation rate in November reached 13.9 percent
while its foreign exchange reserves stood at 4.15 billion U.S.
dollars, down 74 percent from the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it would be impossible for the country to fulfill
the 3 percent growth target for this year.

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Invest More on Sewage Liquids Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province in east China
is expected to allocate 5.2 billion yuan (627 million US dollars
to build 42 new sewage treatment projects by 2003, in a bid to
control growing environment pollution in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, Shandong, one of the economic giants in
China, had only built 18 plants for disposal of urban sewage
liquids, a major factor curbing local economic growth. These urban
sewage treatment plants have currently a combined handling
capacity of 950,000 cubic meters per day.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the province has set a goal to have half of its
urban sewage liquids treated annually by the year 2010, as against
30 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
Major lakes and rivers in Shandong and its near sea areas have
been polluted to varying extent, posing a threat to water sources
and environment locally.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Environment-aware management
personnel in a state-level high-tech industrial development zone
in east China have helped it draw increasing numbers of investors
from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that investors from dozens of
countries, including the Republic of Korea, the United States,
Singapore and Japan, have opened more than 1,000 businesses in the
Weihai High-Tech Industrial Development Zone in the city of Weihai,
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
These businesses, with combined investment of 13 billion yuan (
1.6 billion US dollars), are mostly engaged in the areas of
information technology, new materials, bio-engineering, and
mechanical and electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Many investors say the clean environment is conducive to
ensuring product quality.
</P>
<P>
Since it was established in 1991, the zone has given top
priority to environmental protection and used 620 million yuan for
pollution control and the improvement of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The zone has rejected investment projects worth two billion
yuan that may be potential polluters.

<HEADLINE> Italian New Government Wins Confidence Vote in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy's new center-left
government led by Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema comfortably won a
vote of confidence in the Senate early Thursday, successfully
passing the first hurdle before its approval by parliament.
</P>
<P>
The voting on the new government in the Senate started
Wednesday night, with 177 in favor and 100 against. There were
four abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The new government, the 57th since World War Two, sworn in
before President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi early Wednesday, will face a
tougher test in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, Thursday,
where the center-left majority is expected to be slimmer.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's first center-left government was brought down
Saturday by three smallest parties in the 14-month-old coalition,
collectively called the Clover Leaf parties -- the Democratic
Socialists, the Republicans and a group of centralists.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Socialist leader Enrico Boselli has indicated
several times that his party will not vote against the new
government.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans party, the other member of the Clover Leaf, has
no representatives in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
If the three Clover Leaf parties take the same line in the
lower house Thursday, D'Alema's second government will get 318
votes, just two above the number needed for a majority.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema and his center-left allies spent much of the time in
negotiations with the Clover Leaf, trying to persuade the parties
to support the new government.
</P>
<P>
But their absence from the list of new ministers announced
Wednesday morning showed that most of the rebel parties' demands
for concessions on electoral reform and a range of judicial issues
were in the end rejected.
</P>
<P>
In fact, in his speech to the Senate Wednesday night, D'Alema
made it clear he intended to push ahead with electoral reform in a
direction that goes against the interests of small parties such as
those in the Clover Leaf.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema was asked to form a new government by President Ciampi
Monday after his resignation Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Calendars Unpopular As Chinese Have More Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Wall calendars are falling out
of favor with the public in China as the people no longer buy them
for home decoration or New Year gifts.
</P>
<P>
Large wall calendars featuring beautiful women, luxury cars and
landscapes were enormously popular throughout the country when
they first appeared in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Delicately-printed monthly calendars became best sellers even
though they were more expensive than the single-page calendars.
</P>
<P>
However, as people's living standards gradually improved, some
urban residents no longer want to decorate their houses with wall
calendars, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Publishers which used to make huge profits from calendar sales
also have an apathy to wall calendars. Shanghai Culture Publishing
Co. nearly canceled its wall calendar publishing plans for next
year, and the Shanghai People's art Publishing House also cut
production from the usual 4.5 million copies to less than 400,000
this year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, calendars with special features are still welcomed,
such as desk calendars and one type, on which buyers can have
their own photos printed.
</P>
<P>
Parents can make calendars with their babies on them; young
people can dress up like pop stars for their calendars; and newly-
weds can make calendars to commemorate their union, the newspaper
said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: S.Lankan President Reelected for Peace Pledges      By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga was reelected on Wednesday with a simple majority of
51.12 percent following a record voter turnout on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said Kumaratunga of the ruling People's Alliance
(PA) had won the reelection due to her pledges to bring peace back
to the Indian Ocean island country which has been plagued by
ethnic conflicts since 1983.
</P>
<P>
However, Kumaratunga's performance this time was a far cry from
her landslide victory in the 1994 presidential election when she
was voted to power on a similar peace plank by an overwhelming
majority of 62 percent of the war-weary people.
</P>
<P>
Many Tamil minority voters, who had supported Kumaratunga in
1994, felt disappointed to Kumaratunga's inability to bring peace
and turned to her major rival Ranil Wickremesinghe, leader of the
main opposition United National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected a neck and neck race between Kumaratunga
and Wickremesinghe until last Saturday when twin bombings occurred
in and near Colombo at the two rallies of the PA and the UNP.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, who sustained facial injuries in a suicidal
bombing at her last campaign rally in central Colombo, was
believed to have obtained more sympathy votes due to the incident.
</P>
<P>
The bombing and another one at the election rally of the UNP
had killed 35 people and injured 129 others including the
president herself and three cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Although the bombings were still under investigation,
Kumaratunga and the authorities have blamed the separatist
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels for the incidents.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga, 54, raised the hopes of many millions
when she started talks with the LTTE soon after she assumed office
in late 1994. But her efforts came to naught when the LTTE
guerrillas broke a cease-fire by blowing up two navy ships in the
northeastern port city of Trincomalee.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Mrs. Kumaratunga followed a war-for-peace solution
to pressure the LTTE rebels back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
By October 1999, government troops have succeeded in reducing
the amount of rebel territory from 9,100 square kilometers in 1994
to 3,200 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The biggest military victory was the recapture of the northern
Jaffna peninsula in 1996 where the LTTE had established their de
facto state for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
With superiority in strength, weaponry and funding, the
military has made steady progress in their war against the LTTE
rebels until November this year.
</P>
<P>
A string of military defeats in the northern Wanni region early
last month stripped the government of a vast area which had taken
the army more than two years to capture, weakening Kumaratunga's
chance of winning the election.
</P>
<P>
Despite the military setbacks, Kumaratunga intensified her
campaigning for peace. She had promised to push through a new
constitution that would devolve powers to the regions, including
one run by minority Tamils, to partly meet LTTE's demand for a
separate homeland.
</P>
<P>
It was under the aegis of seeking a fresh mandate to resolve
the 16-year-old ethnic conflicts that President Kumaratunga on
October 20 this year called the election about a year ahead of
previously scheduled November next year.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga made a lengthy statement on Wednesday afternoon
after the inauguration ceremony conducted at her tightly-guarded
Temple Trees residence in downtown Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Kumaratunga vowed to bring peace to the country which has
been plagued by the seemingly unending ethnic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"The days of terror in this land are numbered, and the number
is small," she said while her right eye still bandaged from
injuries sustained in Saturday's assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga stressed, "there is no individual on this earth
more determined than I am to end this country's wretched and
mindless bloodshed and destruction."
</P>
<P>
She called on Wickremesinghe and his UNP to join her in
building a consensus to solve the long-running ethnic conflicts in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga also made a special appeal to the minority Tamil
community to break all links with the LTTE rebels. "I urge you to
persuade, with every conceivable argument, anyone who is a member
or a supporter of the LTTE to renounce violence in establishing
peace," she said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Holds National Workshop on Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A national workshop, sponsored
by the Myanmar National Committee for Women's Affairs (MNCWA), is
being held here to discuss priority issues affecting women's
health and development which include that of violence against
women.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, which began Wednesday, is a follow-up
of a Southeast Asia regional consultation meeting on violence
against women and the role of health sector held in Yangon in
January this year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein said at the
opening session of the workshop that violence against women is a
great problem facing the world today, adding that "though it is
not a big problem in Myanmar, violence is the hindrance to peace
and development of women's life."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the important role of judicial sector, police force
and social and health care services in the country in reduction of
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
Violence against women is among the six priority areas of
concern for Myanmar women identified by the government. The other
priority areas are education, health, economy, culture and girl-
child.
</P>
<P>
Activities on all these priority areas are reportedly under
successful implementation throughout the country since the MNCWA
was formed in July 1996 with a sub-committee handling prevention
of violence against women.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is also implementing the Beijing Declaration
and the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference
on Women held in Beijing in 1995. The country acceded in July 1997
to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's women population accounts for 50.34 percent of the 48-
million total population, according to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Price Index Plunges to 13-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's 1999 price index
increased marginally by 0.1 percent, indicating further downturns
in the economy in 2000, local English daily Vietnam News (VNS)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate of the country was far below the estimate of
10 percent earlier this year, VNS quoted a report of Vietnam's
General Statistics Office (GSO) as saying, adding that this year
the price index plunged to 13-year low since the economic reform
began in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here predicted that this year's low inflation
signaled unpredictable economic growth in the next year. The
Economic growth in 2000 may be even lower than this year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Gross Domestic Products (GDP) of this year rose by 4.
7-5 percent over 1998, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
said last month when he was making a government working report at
the sixth session of Vietnam's 10th National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The 0.5 percent increase in December's price index helped raise
the overall index, ending 11 months of consecutive deflation, the
GSO said.
</P>
<P>
The index is tied to the price of 10 key commodities. The price
of food and foodstuffs declined by 7.8 percent, while the other
nine commodities posted only slight increases.
</P>
<P>
This month's gold price increased by one percent, but this
increase was not enough to counteract the year's overall gold
deflation of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The price of U.S. dollar showed modest gains of 0.1 percent in
the month of December, improving the year's index by 1.1 percent,
according to GSO.

<HEADLINE> Number of Shuttlers at Indonesian Training Center Halved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association
ofIndonesia (PBSI) plans to more than halve the number of
shuttlers at the Indonesian Badminton Center in East Jakarta,
starting in January next year.
</P>
<P>
PBSI chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo said the number of players
would be slashed from 66 to 32 as the association concentrated on
three major events.
</P>
<P>
"Only 32 world-class players will train in the center in an
effortto focus their attention on retaining the Thomas Cup,
bringing home the Uber Cup and grab as many gold medals as
possible in the Olympics," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Those shuttlers will only be allowed to compete in
international tournaments as a preparation to qualify for the
Olympics and to decide their International Badminton Federation (
IBF) rankings for their Olympics drawing. They are not allowed to
compete for their provincein the 15th National Games in Surabaya
in June," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia women's shuttlers will compete in the Uber Cup
qualifying round in New Delhi in February. If they reach the final
round, they will compete along with national men's shuttlers in
the Thomas and Uber Cups, the sport's major team championships, in
Kuala Lumpur in May.
</P>
<P>
PBSI is targeting winning gold in the men's singles and men's
doubles at the Olympics in Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
Subagyo said the other 34 shuttlers would be trained at PBSI
chapters in Jakarta, West Java, Central Java and East Java.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully our new system will be able to boost local shuttlers
' spirit to challenge the national players and create a
competitive atmosphere in those chapters," he said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI will continue to fund the shuttlers' training.
</P>
<P>
"But PBSI chapters must pay for their local shuttlers who
qualify to join our national players in the training system.
Besides, PBSI will also have to provide financial help to
potential shuttlers from other provinces, including Aceh, Irian
Jaya and Maluku," Subagyo said.
</P>
<P>
Subagyo said that some coaches in the center would be assigned
to observe the shuttlers in the respective chapter centers.
</P>
<P>
PBSI training director Christian Hadinata declined to name the
32 shuttlers, saying the appointment would be based on the IBF
rankings.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rejects Int'l Court to try its Military Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid said Indonesia would not allow its military (TNI)
generals to be tried in an international tribunal, saying that was
a matter of a national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We don't allow an international tribunal to judge Gen. Wiranto
and other military officials ( allegedly involved in human right
abuses in East Timor). It's a matter of the national sovereignty,"
Wahid was quoted by the Indonesian Observer daily as saying at
media briefing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He disagreed with any kind of interference from external sides,
saying the country's court must be respected (by other countries).
</P>
<P>
However, he dismissed to be considered as protecting military
officials with refusing international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"I am not trying to protect anybody," Wahid said, citing he
would not sacrifice whole nation just to protect TNI generals.
</P>
<P>
"The whole nation could not be sacrificed just for one or two
persons, and I am ready to face the consequences," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
At that moment, Wahid also dismissed over speculation that his
relation with Wiranto, whose now have been posted as Coordinating
Minister for Politics and Security Affairs, have been turning sour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TNI Chief Adm. Widodo AS said his side would give a
full support to TNI members in the process of investigation into
human right abuses allegedly took place in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The investigation have been launched by the Commission of
Inquiry for Human Right Violation in East Timor (KPP HAM).
</P>
<P>
The commission has put at least six of high-rank TNI officials
in the list of those were allegedly involved in human right abuses
in the territory, including Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
The commission had questioned seven former heads of regencies
in East Timor. But it failed on Wednesday to questioned Wiranto as
the latter has not yet prepared.
</P>
<P>
The commission was expected to complete its report by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The report then would be submitted to the Attorney General and
the United Nation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Portugal to Resume Full Diplomatic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Portugal will
restore full diplomatic relations by the end of this year,
according to Foreign Affairs Minister Alwi Shihab.
</P>
<P>
"We are now ready to resume diplomatic relations. We will
resume full diplomatic ties next January, but maybe it (an
agreement) will be signed by the end of this year," he was quoted
by the Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shihab said he expected the agreement on the resumption of
diplomatic relations to be signed in New York.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries were severed after Indonesia
entered East Timor in 1975. The United Nations refused to
recognize the occupation, which became a major diplomatic irritant
for Jakarta in its relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
On August 30 this year, more than 400,000 East Timorese took
part in a U.N.-sponsored ballot which resulted in an overwhelming
vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
Shihab said since East Timor is no longer part of Indonesia,
the two countries would now reestablish normal ties.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Portugal took the initiative to resume ties.
</P>
<P>
"It wants to normalize things as soon as possible," he said,
adding that ambassador level contacts should resume in January.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Develop Pollution Control Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
which ranks third in the country in terms of GDP, has set the goal
of making the environmental protection industry a major economic
growth area.
</P>
<P>
Wang Renyuan, director of the provincial economic committee,
said that 870 million yuan (105 million US dollars) will be spent
on the development of products for treating waste water, waste
industrial gas, and waste residue as well as auto exhaust over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technology will be introduced from abroad to
accelerate the effort, Wang said.

<P>
It is estimated that China's annual output in the environmental
protection industry has maintained a 30 percent growth in recent
years, higher than that of most other industries.

<HEADLINE> Over 80 Journalists Killed in Conflicts in 1999: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 journalists and
media staff were killed or murdered in 1999, making the last year
of the century one of the worst on record, the Brussels-based
International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In a century of unremitting slaughter, 1999 has been an
infamous year," Aidan White, general secretary of the IFJ, said in
a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"Once again it is journalists and those who work with them who
are among the victims of murder, crime and conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to an IFJ list, 69 deaths have been confirmed and 17
are still under investigation. And most of the victims "were cut
down in waves of violence in the Balkans, Russia and Sierra Leone.
"
</P>
<P>
A 1999 report jointly worked out by the IFJ and the
International Press Institute reveals that 25 journalists and
media workers died in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, most of
them victims of the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that journalists and media workers have
been targeted everywhere, such as Kashmir, Chechnya and East Timor.
In Africa, the civil war in Sierra Leone killed 10 among the local
community of journalists and an undeclared civil war in Colombia
has claimed six victims, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Governments and media employers must put the safety of
journalists and media staff to the top of the agenda. Too often,
however, we see that working conditions are getting worse not
better, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and insecurity
within journalism," said White while reaffirming the IFJ's call
for an international code of practice for media workers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Businessmen Expects Flat Economy Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' influential
Makati Business Club (MBC) expected the country's gross national
product (GNP) to expand by 3.5 percent next year, which is almost
flat from this year's projection of 3.1 percent, Today reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the MBC forecast the gross domestic
product (GDP) to grow by 3.2 percent in 2000 from 2.7 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
MBC's projection is lower than the government projection of 4.5
percent to 5.5 percent GNP next year and is way below the 5.7
percent to 6.1 percent projection under the country's Medium Term
Development Plan.
</P>
<P>
The association of businessmen pointed out that it made the
projection based on some underlying weaknesses of the economy,
including the slowdown in agriculture, increase in interest rates
and the slowdown in manufacturing activities.
</P>
<P>
The MBC said in a report that the agriculture sector, which
helped pull the economy through this year, is expected to expand
by only 3.5 percent next year from 5.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The MBC noted that industrial activities remain weak as
reflected by the import performance which is expected to only grow
below 10 percent for the first time in several decades.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, almost half of the country's factories were still
operating below the 70-percent capacity utilization as of
September this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said the industrial sector will grow by two percent
from a contraction of 0.5 percent this year with imports growing
to 35 billion dollars from this year's 30.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The MBC also predicted that interest rates will increase next
year after the country's budget deficit reached 110 billion pesos
(2.275 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Earthquake in West Java, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were
killed and 91 others injured in a strong earthquake which shook
West Java, Indonesia, on Tuesday night, according to national
newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of houses were damaged in several villages in the
province.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that all the victims were residents of the
Panimbang district in the Pandeglang regency of West Java. The
district is located some 100 kilometers away from the quake's
epicenter in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Other neighboring districts heavily jolted by the quake were
Sumyur, Cibaliung and Pagelaran districts. All are located in the
Pandeglang regency.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake was recorded at 6.0 on the open-ended Richter
scale. According to the Geophysics Agency, the quake was centered
beneath the Indian Ocean, near Panaitan Island, about 230
kilometers southwest of Jakarta. The epicenter of the quake was 33
kilometers under sea level.
</P>
<P>
The quake was felt in Jakarta, but there were no reports of
damage in the city.
</P>
<P>
"The agency recorded a string of 54 aftershocks for about 12
hours after the first strong one," the agency spokesman Waan
Tarmin said.
</P>
<P>
The string of aftershocks could not be sensed by people, only
by a seismograph, he added.

<HEADLINE> Preparation Key to Defending Yugoslavia Against NATO, Commander Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Thorough and careful
preparations by Yugoslavia's air force and air defense force have
played a key role in defending the country and preserving the
strength of its armed forces against NATO's air strikes, an air
force commander said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spasoje Smiljanich, an air force and air defense commander in
Yugoslavia, told reporters here prior to "Air Force Day" that the
Yugoslavia air force and air defense force were well prepared for
NATO's air strikes.
</P>
<P>
All Yugoslav armed forces had been withdrawn from their
original fronts and a total of 50,000 tons of military materials
had also been transferred to safe places before NATO air strikes
started on the night of March 24, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken based on the fact that NATO was much
stronger than Yugoslav forces and the targets of the air strikes
would be Yugoslavia's air force and ground air defense
installations, the general said.
</P>
<P>
During the 78-day air strike, NATO launched a total of 512 air
strikes and dropped 6,000 tons of bombs targeting Yugoslavia's air
force and air defense installations, one third of the total bombs
NATO had dropped in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
However, only 39 soldiers were killed and 46 injured in the
Yugoslav air force and air defense force, Smiljanich said. What's
more, they shot down one of NATO's F-117 at the beginning of the
air strike, he added.
</P>
<P>
The successful resistance against NATO's aggression by the
Yugoslav forces showed that in a defensive war, no matter how
strong the enemy is, a small country can protect itself, while
reducing casualties to the minimum as long as it is well prepared,
Smiljanich said.

<HEADLINE> Moon Biggest, Brightest in 69 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- People will have to wait
another 50 years to view, like they did Wednesday, a big and shiny
full moon which radiated against a clear night sky, according to
astronomers.
</P>
<P>
Countless astronomy buffs in China enjoyed the "biggest and
brightest moon ever appearing in the past 69 years" last night
because the moon was at the closest point to the earth.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Daily and Wenhui Daily of Shanghai, the leading
newspapers in the two metropolises, today both front-paged similar
photos featuring the uniquely shiny moon over luminous skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 stargazers climbed on a 390-meter-tall television
tower, the tallest building in Beijing, to make themselves closer
to the moon.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular scene was caused by the moon passing its
perigee, or its closest point to the earth, at the time of the
full moon, explained Zhao Fuyuan, an associate research fellow at
the Beijing Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
And as the earth and the moon will move to the closest point to
the sun two weeks later, the moon reflecting much more sunlight
may become brighter. Such a coincidence would not occur until the
year 2052, the astronomers predicted.
</P>
<P>
The moon orbits the earth every 28 days along an elliptical
path, with its closest and farthest points from the earth at 363,
000 kilometers and 405,000 km respectively, Zhao Fuyuan was quoted
by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the Shanghai Observatory said that the moon last
night was more than 10,000 km closer to the earth than the usual
time.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people hold a thousand-year-long tradition to view
the full moon at the night of the 15th day of lunar August.

<HEADLINE> Feature Industries Accelerate China's Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that output
value for feature industries in northeast China's Jilin Province
has increased by almost 10 times to 11.8 billion yuan (about 1.42
billion U.S. dollars) since 1978, accounting for 20 percent of the
rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The province, a main commercial grain producer in China, has
been leading the way in grain yield per capita volume and exports.
However, economic returns have not been fairing well due to high
productive costs and excessive grain yields across China.
</P>
<P>
Yang Qingcai, the provincial vice-governor, said that besides
grain production, Jilin is also plentiful in oil plants, potatoes,
vegetables, fruits and flowers and deer raising. All this has
provided a favorable condition for developing feature industries.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 hectares of wild land and slopes and 1.2 million
hectares of forest areas have been cultivated for fruit planting.
</P>
<P>
Yang predicted that output value of gardening and feature
industries will reach 18 billion yuan (2.2 billion US dollars) by
the year of 2005, and per capita income from that will be 600 yuan.
Gardening and feature industries are expected to account for 30
percent of the total value of rural economy by 2010.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Government Announces New Sports Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
Wednesday announced funding for two major areas of support for New
Zealand's preparation for the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, New Zealand Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister
Trevor Mallard said the Cabinet has approved an additional one
million NZ dollars (510,000 U.S. dollars) to help New Zealand
athletes and teams prepare for the Games and an additional 140,000
NZ dollars (71,400 U.S. dollars) for drug testing programs.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics are a major focus. The Sydney 2000 Olympics will
be the closest to New Zealand in our lifetime. We want to provide
direct support to help our athletes prepare," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a shortfall of about 4.2 million NZ dollars (2.14
million U.S. dollars) faced by the New Zealand sports circles, the
minister said that there is a major sponsorship opportunity and
room for individuals and companies to give support as they have in
the past.
</P>
<P>
Part of the funding will be allocated to the High Performance
Unit athletes for their final preparations. There are 23 athletes
and three teams which have been identified as having a good chance
of winning medals, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"The funding for drug testing is another important aspect of
Olympic Games preparation," Mallard said, adding: "It is important
for preserving New Zealand's good reputation in this area."

<HEADLINE> More Philippine Women Are Into Birth Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Half of all married Philippine
women practice birth control and the number using contraceptives
is rising despite church opposition, Malaya reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a survey conducted by the National
Statistics Office as saying that 49.3 percent of married women
aged 15 to 49 years practiced birth control this year against 46.5
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The surveyed showed the use of contraceptives, including the
pill and condoms, increased to 32.4 percent this year from the
previous 28.2 percent while the use of abstinence and the rhythm
method fell to 16.9 percent from 18.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's church frowns on the use of contraceptives and
has advocated abstinence to control population growth.
</P>
<P>
The population of the Philippines is currently estimated at 74
million and has one of the highest growth rates in the world at 2.
3 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the increase in the population largely negates
the country's economic growth, which is estimated at about 3
percent in gross domestic product terms this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soccer Players to Boycott Australia Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Angered by stalled contract
negotiations with the United States Soccer Federation (USSF),
players on the U.S. Women's World Cup champions Wednesday said
they will boycott the Australia Cup soccer tournament next month.
</P>
<P>
The contract the players signed in 1996 expired six months ago
and the USSF said it will not make a new proposal in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the federation proposed the players work under terms
of the expired agreement.
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine the frustration and disappointment we feel as
a team," U.S. co-captain Julie Foudy said. "It was important to
all of us to meet right after the World Cup to reach a new
agreement in order that we could focus exclusively on our Olympic
training beginning in January 2000. U.S. Soccer refused to listen
and have now asked us to accept their last-minute proposal."
</P>
<P>
Co-captain Carla Overbeck said: "They have essentially ignored
our successes over the past three years - including a World Cup
win and Olympic gold medal - and are now asking us to do the same.
"
</P>
<P>
The U.S. women's team had been scheduled to travel to Australia
on January 2 to play in the Australia Cup tournament against the
Czech Republic, Sweden and Australia. Also in jeopardy are two
games scheduled for February in Florida.

<HEADLINE> China Reshapes Its West With Trees to Replace Crops (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING,December 23 (Xinhua) -- In Yan'an City in the central
part on China's Loess Plateau, more than 300,000 farmers are
busying themselves by digging pits for seedlings on their terrace
fields.
</P>
<P>
The farmers have decided to give up crop raising and shift to
planting trees on the plateau. Meanwhile, airplanes are used to
drop seeds for a massive afforestation program on barren mountains
in other places in west China.
</P>
<P>
The tree planting campaign marks a surge of strategic
development in west China, which covers nine interior provinces
and autonomous regions and one municipality spanning from Shaanxi
in the northwest to Yunnan in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
It is an important move launched by the Chinese government to
check the increasingly threatened ecological environment in the
west and to achieve its sustained development strategy in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, noted that enhancing ecological construction
and environmental protection is vital for the strategic
development in west China.
</P>
<P>
The central government encourages farmers in the west to turn
their low-yield farmland to grassland or woodland. Farmers who
give up one hectare of the farmland will get 1,500 kg grain in
compensation along with some additional funds for purchasing
seedlings and grass seeds.
</P>
<P>
Tuo Haiming, a farmer in Wangjiagou Village of Zichang County
in Yan'an, has planted hundreds of pear and apricots trees. "It's
a wise policy that the government aids us with food and funds only
to make our hills green by planting trees. Why not go ahead with
it?" he said.
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years later, our wild hills will be turned into
hills with fruit and flowers, then they will become our treasure
chests."
</P>
<P>
West China covers 56 percent of the country's land area and its
population accounts for 23 percent of the national total. Back to
the period between Han and Tang dynasties (206 B.C.-907 A.D.), it
was home to dense forests and luxuriant vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, increasing ecological deterioration in the region
in the past centuries, especially the past few decades, has
resulted in rapid expansion of deserts at an annual rate of more
than 2,000 sq km.
</P>
<P>
More years than not, the Yellow River dries up at its 700-km
low reaches to the estuary, which poses a serious threat to social
and economic development in both western and eastern regions of
China.

<TEXT>
<P>
The western region on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River
and Yellow River serves as a protective screen for the ecological
environment in China. Soil erosion in the region has become the
most serious issue in the country's environmental protection
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
China now has started ecological conservation projects in the
west including virgin forests protection programs, soil erosion
control programs, water conservancy and irrigation projects,
ecological farming projects and desertification control projects.
Tree felling has been banned in the upper valleys of the Yangtze
and Yellow rivers.
</P>
<P>
In the coming decade, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and four
other provinces and autonomous regions will jointly invest 120
billion yuan (14.5 billion U.S. dollars) to conserve the forests
in the upper valley of the Yangtze; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region is to spend five billion yuan to harness the Tarim River;
in Shaanxi Province, the state will invest 20 billion yuan to
replant trees and grass on low-yield farmland.
</P>
<P>
Hu Angang, an ecologist and economist with the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, is confident of the future in west China, According
to him, actual state investment in ecological protection programs
in the next ten years might exceed the planned figure of 200
billion yuan (24 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
From now on, he said, the dearth of ecological projects in west
China must change, and a new era will be ushered in for China to
tackle its ecological deterioration.
</P>
<P>
In fact, in the past two decades, China has had rich
experiences in eliminating ecological problems in the western
region. Taking advantage of state-of-the-art technology, China has
curbed soil erosion on the Loess Plateau from deteriorating with
many man-made oases in desert regions.
</P>
<P>
Especially in the past two years, major breakthroughs have been
made in water resources exploration in arid areas in the west.
According to experts' predictions, the underground water storage
for annual exploitation has reached 16.3 billion cu m. The rich
water resources will benefit the green projects in west China.
</P>
<P>
It is the government's goal that by 2020, the forest coverage
rates on the upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers will
be increased to 45 and 27 percent from the current 22 and 10
percent respectively. And by the middle of the next century, west
China will boast a beautiful landscape.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the
Communist Party which managed to keep its No. One status in the
Duma, emphasized that the election outcome confirmed his bloc's
leading role.
</P>
<P>
"The main conclusion is that our party has played a key role in
the country's public and political life and must continue doing so,
" Zyuganov said at a press conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Boris Berezovsky, a well-known Russian entrepreneur and the
deputy in the new Duma, said that the recent parliamentary
elections marked the completion of the new revolution in Russia.
</P>
<P>
This revolution had two stages, Berezovsky said at a press
conference Wednesday. At the first stage Russia "declared what it
wants" and at the second stage "the Russian public said how its
choice (presidential elections), made in 1996, should be
implemented." "After December 19 Russia entered a new and
creative stage of development, departing from the old and
destructive stage," Berezovsky said.
</P>
<P>
He does not think that Putin, whose political position has been
consolidated by the poll results, will have any serious rival in
the upcoming presidential elections in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Putin will not have serious rivals if, of course, he does not
make mistakes, or if a new intellectual force, unknown to us yet,
does not emerge," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The current objective is to create a consolidated power"
structure which would pave the way for Russia's creative
development, said Berezovsky, adding that the December 19 polls
made it possible "to create not only a constructive but also a non-
opposition Duma."
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that neither Putin's supporters, nor his
opponents will wield a majority in the future lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Livshits, Russian president's envoy to the G-8 (Group
of Russia and seven Western industrialized countries), said the
Duma election returns are "encouraging."
</P>
<P>
"The political landscape in the country looks much better after
the December 19 elections than it did before," he said.
</P>
<P>
First of all, Unity and the Union of Right-Wing Forces in the
Duma may well provide strong support for the cabinet, Livshits
said. "Furthermore, there are quite a few constructively minded
people in the Fatherland-All Russia bloc. With a large group of
skilled economists coming in, the parliament's creative potential
seems quite credible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the new Duma will send "a positive signal to
our G-8 partners and international financial institutions,"
Livshits said.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the State Duma elections will also have a
positive impact on talks about new IMF (the International Monetary
Fund) loans to Russia, said Andrei Neschadin, executive director
of the Russian Expert Institute.

and Paraguay striker Roque Santa Cruz sealed victory seven minutes
later before a meagre crowd in Munich's Olympic stadium.
</P>
<P>
Stuttgart Kickers made sure the second division would be
represented in the last four thanks to Tomislav Maric of Croatia,
who hit the winner from close range in the 39th minute after
Freiburg goalkeeper Richard Golz failed to catch a high ball.
</P>
<P>
Two first-half goals from Swedish striker Magnus Arvidsson
helped Hansa Rostock to a 2-1 win over VfB Stuttgart in the only
quarter-final clash between first division clubs.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- In a statement circulated in
Moscow Monday evening, the international mission for monitoring
the parliamentary elections in Russia stated that the elections
were competitive and based on the principle of plurality.
</P>
<P>
It said the constitutional and legislative base of the
elections corresponds to internationally recognized democratic
principles.
</P>
<P>
"The State Duma elections showed significant progress on the
path towards the strengthening of democracy in the Russian
Federation," the statement says.
</P>
<P>
The document also states that the votes were counted and the
election returns summed up openly and in compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
"The high voter turnout for the elections testified to
confidence in the democratic process" and "the presence of a large
number of local observers undoubtedly increased that level of
confidence," it said.
</P>
<P>
The observers "do not have a shade of doubt that the elections
were valid and fair and that their results are legitimate," said
Teimuraz Ramishvili, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry' working
group on contacts with foreign observers, cited by the Interfax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
However, the observers stressed that the conflict in Chechnya
had undoubtedly and significantly influenced the elections.
</P>
<P>
Public support for the military operation in Chechnya during
the election campaign actually saved the government from serious
criticism of the essential aspects of its domestic policy which
had earlier been in the center of political debates, they said.
</P>
<P>
The international observers also stated that violations were
revealed in the financing of the election campaign and instances
of the executive authorities' interference in the election process
were established.
</P>
<P>
Besides that, the Russian media failed to present unbiased and
objective information about the range of political choices
available to voters, said the observers.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has postponed a
planned January trip by the chairman of the United Nations
Security Council sanctions Committee, U.N. sources said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions committee oversees the sanctions against Iraq
which has been in place since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Iraq's Ambassador to the United
Nations Saeed Hasan gave no reason for postponing the planned trip
that should take place from 11 to 18 of January, 2000 by Peter van
walsum, the Netherlands's Ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was calling off the January trip in a letter received by
van Walsum on Tuesday, U.N. diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi side suggested to postpone the visit to a more
convenient date to be agreed upon later, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions committee approves shipments of humanitarian
goods as well as contracts for oil sales under the U.N. oil-for-
food program which began to be implemented in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution last Friday which
would establish a new U.N. weapons inspection regime for Iraq and
ease U.N. sanctions if it cooperates with the arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has refused to accept the resolution, saying it was a
trick by some members of the Security Council.

LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Arsenal French star Emmanuel Petit has launched another
scathing attack on English football.
</P>
<P>
Petit claimed that foreign players in the Premiership are being

But Petit hit back by claiming its the Premiership's foreign
legion that are the victims.

"The spirit of football created by the English is no longer
seen at Premier League grounds," he told the Daily Star.
</P>
<P>
"The notion of fair play has little in common with the
behaviour of certain professionals or the actions taken by some
referees.
</P>
<P>
"Far too many players confuse aggressiveness with violence.
English referees lack the courage and the personality to intervene
when faced with these excesses.
</P>
<P>
"Players' safety is no longer guaranteed - especially the
foreigners who are often singled out.
</P>
<P>
"We hit back in self-defence when we are attacked. I am taking
a stand against these violent actions, which can put careers at
risk.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon the referees to face up to their responsibilities.
I cannot put up with the injustices that take place on the pitch.
Some people say that nothing can be done and that you should let
things be. The people who say that get on my nerves," he added.

<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Paolo Di Canio has accused his
West Ham team-mates of playing "like a Conference side" against
Manchester United and being scared of the Premiership's top clubs,
according to local reports on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian striker was also unhappy with the club's
Worthington Cup clanger which led to them being ordered to replay
their quarter-final against Aston Villa.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio, 31, infamous for pushing over referee Paul Alcock
while playing for Sheffield Wednesday, told The Sun: "It is all
very well shouting and jumping around in the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
"But when we go out on the pitch, we are frightened. We need to
work much harder in training. That is where you get your great
games from. If you don't work hard, you can maybe win four or five
matches. But there are 38 games in the Premiership season.
</P>
<P>
"I have told them this, and I am as much to blame. I am not a
whinger, but we need more quality and fight."
</P>
<P>
Di Canio also had some harsh words for West Ham over the fiasco
against Villa.
</P>
<P>
The Hammers fielded striker Manny Omoyimni who was cup-tied
after playing for Gillingham in an earlier round while on loan.
</P>
<P>
He said: "West Ham should have checked on the player. It is no
good taking his word for it."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The new Wembley stadium will
not host athletics, Culture Secretary Chris Smith announced on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Plans to build an athletics track around the pitch have been
scrapped and the rebuilt venue will no longer be part of the bid
for the World Championships or the 2012 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Controversy erupted last month when Britain's Sports minister
Kate Hoey criticised the new Wembley layout, saying the 90,000-
seat stadium was unsuitable for track and field.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the new plans, a total of 20 million pounds of
lottery money that was invested in the new design will be given
back to athletics.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Expels Colombian Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan
government expelled Wednesday a Colombian consul and two military
attaches, Colombian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The three Colombian diplomats, expelled in the middle of the
tension created by a maritime limits dispute that confronts
Nicaragua against Colombia and Honduras, were consul Gustavo
Elieser Hooker, Colonel Humberto Plato and Captain Rodolfo
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
Colombia and Honduras ratified recently a maritime limits
treaty that ignores, according to Managua, Nicaraguan jurisdiction
over 130,000 square kilometers of maritime platform in the
Caribbean and the sovereignty over the San Andres archipelago, now
under Colombian dominion.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua had requested Colombia not long ago in a diplomatic
note to withdraw the military attaches and the Colombian consul in
the Bluefields island, near the San Andres archipelago.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana said recently that the
ratification of the maritime limits treaty with Honduras
reaffirmed the sovereignty of Colombia over the San Andres
archipelago, and that any reclamation was useless.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nicaraguan ambassador in Colombia Domingo Salinas
was summoned Wednesday at 15:00 to the Colombian foreign ministry
to give an explanation about the incident.

<HEADLINE> Plane Accident in Guatemala Kills 26 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The DC-10 aircraft crashed in
Guatemala City killed at least 26 persons and injured 20, said
Cuban authorities on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dead were nine passengers, eight crew members and nine
neighbors of a community, said the Cuban Civil Aeronautics
Institute (IACC).
</P>
<P>
The dead include the third secretary of the Guatemalan embassy
in Cuba, Daniel Alarcon, and Guatemalan students who were studying
medicine in the island under scholarships, added the communique.
</P>
<P>
The Cubana de Aviacion DC-10 airliner collided Tuesday morning
against a dozen homes after it skidded off the landing strip in
the La Aurora airport in Guatemala City, where it had landed after
a flight from Havana.
</P>
<P>
The IACC said that 270 of the 296 people aboard the plane were
passengers, most of them Guatemalan students who returned home
from the island to spend the yearend festivities with their
relatives. Most of them were unhurt or suffered at most some
bruises.
</P>
<P>
The IACC added that Cuban and Guatemalan experts are
investigating the causes of the disaster of the Havana-Guatemala
City chartered flight.

<HEADLINE> Scotland May Help England's Bid for 2006 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Scottish Football
Association will make their top stadiums available for England's
2006 World Cup bid if required, according to local reports on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Celtic chief executive Allan MacDonald has urged the English FA
to include the 50,000 plus capacity stadiums at Parkhead, Ibrox
and Hampden Park to ensure success in their campaign.
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said that Glasgow should become "a temporary
extension of England" for the duration of the tournament. World
governing body FIFA will make their final decision next summer,
with South Africa and Germany the strongest challengers.
</P>
<P>
Scottish FA president Jack McGinn has already declared his
support for England but previously accepted that there are enough
suitable stadiums south of the border for the entire competition
to be held there.
</P>
<P>
SFA spokesman Andy Mitchell has admitted the chances of
Scotland hosting World Cup matches were slim but said there would
be spin-offs if England did win the battle - and that Scotland
could yet pitch in for other competitions.
</P>
<P>
"There is no realistic likelihood of Scotland's stadia being
part of England's bid at this advanced stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They have invested very heavily in a large number of World Cup
qualifying stadia of their own.
</P>
<P>
"England quite clearly feel confident in bidding with their own
stadia and see no need to extend into Scotland. If they needed to
use our grounds we would be delighted to make them available but I
do not think it will be necessary."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russian Politicians, International Observers Highly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- With the preliminary outcome of
Sunday's parliamentary elections announced, Russian politicians
and foreign observers set a high value on the successful
completion of the long-awaited and intensively-contended polls.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections in Russia, the largest political
event in 1999, culminated in a victory, said Russian President
Boris Yeltsin at a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin in the Kremlin Wednesday, telecast by the ORT television
station.
</P>
<P>
The elections were won by the people, Yeltsin said. The turnout
was very high and "we should be proud of the people and of Russia,
" he said, congratulating Putin on the success.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin regards the Duma election results as the people's
choice and calls for respecting this choice, said his press
secretary Dmitri Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin was satisfied with the high turnout in the
Sunday poll and hoped that the new Duma would be less politicized
and more determined to engage in concrete law-making.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expects the new Duma, lower house of the parliament, to
settle all its organizational procedures fast and get down to
practical work, Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
Igor Shabdurasulov, a senior Kremlin aide, said Monday that
Duma election results indicate "a peaceful revolution has
virtually taken place in Russia."
</P>
<P>
"It is an enormous breakthrough in the advancement of the
country. The Russian people by their voting confirmed that their
civil responsibility has grown impressively," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first election returns give hope for a more
constructive relationship between the executive and legislative
branches of power.
</P>
<P>
The poll outcome suggests that Russians want change, Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin told an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
"They (the voters) want new results, new ideas and new
solutions as well as new faces," Putin said, calling the elections
on the whole "normal".
</P>
<P>
The cabinet must do its best to work successfully with the new
Duma "not only on economic bills, but also on other decisions
important to the country," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Task Force Urges Ticket Pricing Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Clubs will have to offer
cheaper tickets and change their strips less often under radical
plans drawn up by the Government's Football Task Force.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force, headed by former Tory minister and pundit David
Mellor, lays out its vision of a fan-friendly sport in a report
published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends the establishment of a Football Audit
Commission (FAC) to oversee a detailed Code of Practice setting
minimum standards to be met by clubs in their treatment of fans.
</P>
<P>
On tickets, the Code would require all clubs to stretch the
range of prices on offer, so that fans paying the highest prices
would effectively cross-subsidise those paying new, lower prices.
</P>
<P>
For the lower priced tickets, prices would be increased
annually by no more than the Retail Price Index.
</P>
<P>
For under-16s and those in full-time education, clubs should
offer half-price tickets covering at least 10% of the ground
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The number of season tickets would be limited to encourage home
support from those who cannot afford to buy a season ticket.
</P>
<P>
And clubs should not charge away fans higher prices than home
fans for the same facilities.
</P>
<P>
On merchandising, the report recommends that clubs and the FA,
in respect of the England kits, should ensure that every new strip
has a minimum life span of two full seasons.
</P>
<P>
And every replica shirt should carry a "sell-by" date on the
collar, to warn customers when it will be replaced.

<HEADLINE> US Embassy in Ecuador Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embassy in Quito
resumed its services to the public Wednesday at midday, as
announced in an official communique published by the U.S.
diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
The decision to resume the attention to the public was taken
after the security of the diplomatic installations and its
employees were considerably increased with the assistance of the
Ecuadorian government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. General Consulate in Guayaquil, the main Ecuadorian
port, located 455 kilometers southwest of Quito, will be reopened
as soon as the measures of security for that diplomatic delegation
are increased by the Ecuadorian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy in Quito and the consulate in Guayaquil have
been closed since December 17 on instructions of the U.S. State
Department in prevention of eventual terrorist attacks which are
frequent at this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomatic legations have been deserted for the last
five days.
</P>
<P>
Only a few employees ands security personnel remained for some
hours, while police surveillance increased and the streets around
the embassy and the consulate were closed to boost security.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Gwen Clare said as an explanation for the
closing of the diplomatic legation that Ecuador is the most
vulnerable country in Latin America to terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
She said that the closing of the diplomatic installations is to
give security to the employees and Ecuadorian visitors who go
there to request visas and to carry out other procedures.
</P>
<P>
Although the attention to the public was resumed in the U.S.
embassy in Quito, strict security measures are implemented and the
circulation of vehicles near the embassy is restricted.

<HEADLINE> Security Council "Deeply Concerned" About Fighting in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greenstock, speaking to journalists here after the council's
closed-door consultations on the worsening situation in the
central African country, said that the council members are also
concerned about the "continuing disregard of the Lusaka agreement,
" which was signed in the Zambian capital by the concerned parties
to end the war in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The 15-member council called on all the parties to "exercise
utmost restraint and to stop immediately any further violations of
the cease-fire under (the) Lusaka" accord, Greenstock said.
</P>
<P>
The council urged parties to convene an early meeting of both
the political committee set up under the Lusaka accord and the
Joint Military Commission, which was established to discuss
disputes, and to facilitate the deployment of local military
commissions and U.N. liaison officers.
</P>
<P>
Council members reiterated the willingness of the United
Nations and the international community to work with the parties
to the Lusaka accord in order to implement the peace accord and
bring peace and stability to the region, Greenstock said.
</P>
<P>
However, Greenstock said the Security Council pointed out that
in order to play its role in the peacekeeping operations in Congo
(K), the United Nations must be confident that the parties
themselves are determined to respect the cease-fire and to refrain
from any hostile acts and propaganda.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday meeting follows a Tuesday briefing by the U.N.
assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations, Hedi
Annabi, who cited reports reaching the United Nations from South
Kivu Province, Congo (K), as saying that "the slightest incident"
could trigger large-scale organized attacks against civilians,
especially ethnic Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Annabi told the 15-member Security Council Tuesday that there
was also equal concern that, given the threat to the Congolese
Tutsi community, they themselves could trigger an anti-Tutsi
offensive through violent actions against their neighbors, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Annabi urged the council to call on all warring parties to
observe the cease-fire in the central African nation, formerly
Zaire, stop new offensive, "and to do everything possible to
prevent outbreak of violence, especially in South Kivu" province,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Greenstock said Tuesday that the reports of fighting had "
raised council concern."
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Tutsis were first endangered when Hutu fighters,
fleeing Tutsi rule in neighboring Rwanda after an orgy of genocide
in 1994, fled to what was then eastern Zaire. After President
Laurent Kabila took office in 1997, with Rwandan help, his
government accused Rwanda of fighting with rebels who took up arms
against him in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, together with his allies, and Rwanda and Uganda signed
a peace accord in Lusaka, capital of Zambia, in July this year.
Each side has since accused the other of violating the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka agreement calls for deployment of U.N. peacekeepers,
the withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo, and a national
dialogue to set a timetable for democratic elections in Africa's
third largest country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been unable to deploy peacekeepers
because the Congo (K) government and rebel forces have not
guaranteed full security and freedom of movement for U.N. liaison
officers surveying security conditions. Only 62 of 90 U.N. liaison
officers have been deployed so far.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dismisses Taliban assurances on bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"These statements that continue to come out of the Taliban are
laughable on their face. The Taliban is willing to say anything
that sounds positive or reassuring," State Department spokesman
James Foley told his daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
"They are unwilling to do anything which actually gets to the
heart of the matter, which is that this man .... is enjoying their
hospitality, enjoying their protection, is living in territory
that they control," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States had credible evidence that his group
may be planning more attacks on Americans over the next three
weeks, during Christmas or New Year festivities.

<HEADLINE> Smaller U.S. Companies Lag Behind Big Counterparts in E-Commerce Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A new survey released
Wednesday found that 23 percent of "middle market" companies in
the United States have an e-commerce Web site.
</P>
<P>
This is in contrast to large companies, 38 percent of which
have an e-commerce Web site, according to the survey conducted by
the Yankee Group, a global information services company that
collects, integrates and delivers financial, economic and market
research information.
</P>
<P>
The Yankee Group defines the "middle market" as companies with
more than 500 employees and revenues between 100 million and one
billion U.S. dollars, and it estimates there are 12,000 to 15,000
such companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
While some of these e-commerce implementations have been
successful, according to the survey, 45 percent smaller companies
surveyed reported that their e-commerce efforts have been
unsuccessful and they need third-party help.
</P>
<P>
The penetration of basic technologies such as local and wide-
area data network among middle market companies is high, with 80
percent of them reporting close to full penetration; but their
adoption of advanced technology is not as enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
The Yankee Group surveyed 300 middle market companies for
adoption, trends perceptions, budgets and buying behavior in e-
business, voice/data convergence and data network/e-commerce
outsourcing. These technology areas are regarded as cornerstones
for future business growth and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
These companies have been slow to adopt advanced technologies
that leverage the Internet and voice/data convergence, according
to the Yankee Group. They are using the Internet as a "getting
connected"tool. The vast majority of companies reported that
giving employees Internet access and using the Internet to connect
remote workers to the corporate network as their top technology
projects for 2000.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports Attacks Against Ethnic Minorities in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KFOR observed no change in the security situation since the
last report, but reported that attacks against ethnic minorities
continue to give cause for concern and flagged the potential for
tension to escalate in areas of confrontation between the Albanian
and Serb communities such as Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. Mission in Kosovo, called UNMIK, reported
an earthquake earlier Wednesday in Prizren. Two sets of tremors
were felt and U.N. personnel reported that tiles fell off the
walls during the quake. No further information was available.
</P>
<P>
KFOR said it continued its deployment into the theater and by
the end of November, there were some 48,000 troops in place. UNMIK
also reported that as of December 20, there were 1,938 police in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK and KFOR began the presence in Kosovo under the June 10
Security Council resolution, but the Yugoslav Government
repeatedly accused both UNMIK and KFOR for the violation of its
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the Security Council
resolution 1244, which demands all the Member States to fully
respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Withdraw More Troops From N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Wednesday it
would pull more troops out of Northern Ireland as part of moves
agreed in the 1998 "Good Friday" peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Security barriers and checkpoints in some 20 towns and cities
will also be removed, with protective fencing surrounding public
buildings and police offices gradually scaled back, the Northern
Ireland office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The moves are part of a planned "return to normality" in
response to a reduced threat of violence now that a peace deal has
all but ended 30 years of violence between Protestant and Roman
Catholic communities in the British-ruled province.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland earlier this month gained home rule for the
first time in 25 years as powers were handed over from London to a
new coalition government of Protestant and Catholics.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Election Results Confirm People's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Wednesday said his victory in the country's general
elections from December 3 to 5 has confirmed the justice of his
policies and the people's will to fight for a better future.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while addressing the nation shortly after
the National Elections Commission (CNE) announced his re-election
for another five-year term of office at the helm of Mozambique's
destinies.
</P>
<P>
"The unequivocal expression of the popular will redoubles our
responsibility and determination to carry out with great
dedication and zeal the principles spelt out in our program for
government, and the commitments we assumed for the next five years
in the dialogue we held with the people during the election
campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ruling Frelimo (Mozambique Liberation Front),
which also turned out to be the winner in the elections, would try
to form a government of experienced and competent people, ready
for a constant dialogue with society and prepared to make
sacrifices to solve the people's problems.
</P>
<P>
Chissano urged the 250 deputies of the newly-elected parliament
to work for the progress of the country and people, calling on all
the extra- parliamentary parties to try and constructively carry
out their duties.
</P>
<P>
The new government would also work with civil society,
including trade unions, religious bodies and the media, he said.
"In this way, we want to continue governing in a climate of peace,
dialogue and tolerance with all the vital forces of Mozambican
society."
</P>
<P>
According to Chissano, the elections corresponded to a
fundamental stage in the consolidation of Mozambican democracy.
The country could now face new economic, social, cultural and
political challenges, he said. It was reported that Frelimo
members and supporters began to plunge into a series of
celebrations nationwide soon after the announcement of the
election results.
</P>
<P>
The governments of South Africa and Swaziland have sent
congratulations to Chissano and his party on their victories.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Intelligence Warns of Doomsday Cults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Security
Intelligence Service (CSIS) is warning of increasing threats by "
doomsday cults".
</P>
<P>
In its study Doomsday Religious Movements, which was made
public here Wednesday, CSIS said that irrational groups foresee
catastrophe "on or around the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
"One estimation indicates that there are 1,200 active cults
throughout the world, and that roughly 400 subscribe to doomsday
philosophies which foresee catastrophe on or around the year 2000,
" the study said.
</P>
<P>
"While it is not known which cults have the potential violence,
this does not imply that possible threats posed by doomsday
religious movements should be ignored," said the study, adding "
there clearly is a continuing threat potential."
</P>
<P>
The study came in the wake of arrests in Vermont and Washington
of suspects trying to enter the U.S. with bomb making material.
