<P>
MADRID, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Michael Doohan, who
has won a fourth consecutive 500cc world title, wants to beat a
25-year-old record in Sunday's Catalunya Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
So far this season Doohan has equalled Italian Giacomo
Agostini's 1972 feat of 11 wins.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, he will either break it or suffer his worst result
of the season -- no great drama since he has finished first in
every race bar one second place.
</P>
<P>
Strangely, Doohan has never won at the Barcelona circuit
although he did clinch his third world title there last season
with a second place.

JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today it would be in the interest of
nation-building to invite F. W. De Klerk, who recently retired as
National Party leader, to continue playing public role.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am concerned, and if he agrees, I will use him,"
Mandela told reporters in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk should be given "something where he can use his
talent, not as a leader of a political party, but as one of the
most eminent South Africans", Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela did not elaborate on his plan for De Klerk.

A spokesman for De Klerk said if the former leader of the
National Party received specific requests, including from the
government, he would definitely respond favorably should he find
it practical and possible.

active politics completely.

all opportunities that were presented to continue playing a
constructive role in the solution of the country's problems and

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Sets Guidelines for New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has issued a memorandum to various executive departments
of the government, outlining the priorities in compiling next
year's budget, The Persian daily Hamshahri reported today.
</P>
<P>
Khatami highlighted social justice and eradication of poverty
as major considerations in compiling the new budget which will
start from March 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening the national currency, increasing the country's
share in world markets, working toward non-reliance on oil
revenues, elimination of monopolies and preparing grounds for
healthy competitions in the economic scene of the country are
mentioned as some of the major goals of the new government.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also highlighted his government's commitment to
subsidize the basic necessities of the public as well as
providing financial support for cultural organizations which aim
to promote culture and arts in the society.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the new government stresses
continuation and completion of the already started development
programs and in general bans on start of new projects.
</P>
<P>
Strict discipline in using foreign exchange revenues and
limiting the country's imports also figure prominently in the
new government's agenda, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami stressed that the agenda presented during the
presidential campaign and the subsequent sessions of the
Parliament should be given due attention in compiling next
year's budget.
</P>
<P>
The memo touches on the previous government's economic
successes after the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, before
moving to what it calls "imbalances and shortcomings" facing the
new government.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate has been down to 17 percent this year from
49.4 percent two years ago. A 37 percent annual growth in
government's tax revenues was among the major accomplishments
of the government during the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
Among the major problems facing Khatami's government is
non-realization of the forecast revenues for the current year,
the memo said. But it did not elaborate on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Albright, Arafat Agree on Need to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, PALESTINE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, currently on a rescue
mission to save the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, obtained a
promise from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to fight terrorism
here today.
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour extended meeting held in this West Bank
city, Albright said she and Arafat focused today's discussions on
the issue of fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Telling a press conference, she stressed the importance of
resuming Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and demanded
the Palestinian Authority (PNA) to take "unilateral actions" to
fight terrorism effectively.
</P>
<P>
She said Arafat reiterated his pledge to U.S. President Bill
Clinton on honoring the commitments to fighting terrorism and also
outlined some steps taken by the PNA to crack down on Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that terror threatens peace, terror threatens
the Palestinian Authority, and terror threatens the Palestinian
people. Pursuing peace as partners also means fighting terror as
partners," she said.
</P>
<P>
She requested that the PNA must launch a "comprehensive,
relentless and sustained" fight against terrorism so to save the
peace process, whose continuation is in the interests of both
sides.
</P>
<P>
To balance her demands on the PNA to fight terror, Albright
also expressed understanding to the frustration and anger caused
by Israeli sanctions imposed since the recent suicide bombings in
Jerusalem. She indirectly criticized Israel for taking some steps
to preempt the issues that are reserved for the negotiations in
the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
She urged the Palestinian people not to abandon their hopes
for the peace process, from which she said they would gain
benefit.
</P>
<P>
"I urged the Palestinian people not to lose the hope, not to
give the logics of the Oslo (peace accords), not to abandon the
principles of peace," Albright said, promising that the U.S. would
do its utmost to help solve the current crisis in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same conference, Arafat attacked the Israeli
hardline policies and the sanctions against the Palestinian side,
including the closure, settlement activities, land confiscation,
withholding funds and refusing to release Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader pledged that the PNA is committed to
and would honor the obligations to the Oslo agreements signed
under the U.S. auspices four years ago, saying he would "continue
confronting enemies of peace on both sides." But he called on
Israel to lift all the sanctions and unilateral steps in order to
put an end to violence and achieve a just and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Arafat handed her a list of demands on the
Israeli side not to take unilateral steps so to rescue the peace
process, saying she would study it.
</P>
<P>
She made it clear that the U.S. would continue working to
ahcieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians based on the
United Nations resolutions 242 and 338, and the principle of
"land for peace."
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the huge gap between Israel and the PNA, Albright
acknowledged that there was still "a long way to go" to rebuild
the mutual respect and confidence between the two sides, only with
which the peace process can proceed forward.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here Wednesday for her first Middle East
trip since taking office, has already held talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior Israeli
officials on the current crisis. The Israeli side has conditioned
the continuation of peace process on the PNA's efforts to launch a
war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing her talks in the first two days of the three-day
visit, Albright conceded that little progress had been made so
far. "We have not yet been able to see what is the best method to
get the peace process back on track ... I think I still have a
great deal of more work to do," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright would hold the second round of talks with Netanyahu
later today and with Arafat in Ramallah Friday before heading to
Syria, the second leg of her current Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit here is aimed at reviving the deeply-troubled
Israeli-Palestinian peace process which has been deadlocked since
March when Israel began building the Har Homa settlement in East
Jerusalem. And the tensions between the sides were worsened by
the recent two suicide bombing attacks by Islamic militants in
central Jerusalem that killed 25 people and wounded over 350
others.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Rejects EU Claim on Pistachios </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Agricultural Minister
Issa Kalantari today rejected European Union's (EU) claim on
Iranian pistachios, saying that the pistachios is exported to
Europe after thorough examination.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural minister said "Iranian pistachios exported to
Europe gets permission for distribution and consumption after
receiving standard license and undergoing thorough examinations
in Europe," the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a temporary ban imposed by the European Union
Commission on import of Iranian pistachios, Kalantari said that
last year 5,000 containers of pistachios weighing 90,000 tonnes
arrived in the European market, one of which was contaminated
for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
The EU said Tuesday that it had banned imports of pistachios
from Iran because of fears of contamination by aflatoxin b1, a
carcinogenic substance produced by molds.
</P>
<P>
Kalantari said EU officials take 240 kilograms of pistachios
out of each 20-tonne pistachio container for quality control and
sampling tests before they issue clearance permit for their
export.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran's exported pistachios are systematically
dried within 16 hours of their harvest in order to keep them
free from any toxin.
</P>
<P>
Kalantari said that in October an EU delegation comprising
health care, quality control and laboratory experts would arrive
in Iran to inspect production, harvest, testing and export of
Iranian pistachios.
</P>
<P>
Kalantari said that 400,000 hectares of lands in Iran are
under cultivation of pistachios and that Iran's pistachio
production is expected to double to 400,000 tonnes a year in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
He said that each tonne of Iranian pistachios is now sold for
about 5,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran earned nearly 400 million dollars from export of 130,000
tonnes of pistachios last year.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei: Loyalty, Cooperation Needed in Armed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today stressed the need of loyalty and cooperation in the
country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"The country needs army men who are devout, effective,
committed and equipped with advanced resources," he said in a
ceremony to promote the military rank of Islamic Revolution Guards
Corps' (IRGC) new commander Seyed-Yahya Rahim Safavi to major
general.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio quoted Khamenei as stressing the importance of the
close cooperation between the IRGC and the army to bring the ranks
up to the standards.
</P>
<P>
Military observers here said the Iranian army is regarded as
less ideological, and more hierarchical than the IRGC.
</P>
<P>
Iran's army, especially its senior commanders were mainly
trained by the Americans, but the IRGC and the commanders obtained
combat effectiveness and became an important military force of
Iran through fightings against the Iraqis from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Praising the loyalty of the IRGC, Khamenei said it was only
after the (Iran-Iraq) war that the IRGC got the chance to
reorganize and accord ranks to its fighters who had been too busy
fighting to think about their military ranks.
</P>
<P>
General Safavi, a former Brigadier General, was appointed by
Khamenei as IRGC commander Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi today termed recent statements by German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel amazing, according to the official news
agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the German Parliament Wednesday, Kinkel was
reported to have termed the trial of liberal Iranian editor
Faraj Sarkuhi as an obstacle to the return of the European
ambassadors and to Tehran-Bonn relations.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that it is very surprising for the German
foreign minister who well knows the international regulations to
make such statements "because the trial of a citizen in a
country is an affair within the jurisdiction of that country."
</P>
<P>
"The trial of Faraj Sarkuhi is not an exception to this
rule," Kharrazi said, adding "even I as the foreign minister of
the Islamic Republic cannot interfere in the affair (Sarkuhi's
trial) let alone the German foreign minister who is a
foreigner."
</P>
<P>
He said that Sarkuhi is being tried fairly and the trial
procedure is being closely watched by the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Iran has protested against German intervention in the arrest
of the chief editor of Iranian Persian weekly Adineh, who seeks
political asylum in Sweden and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian editor was arrested along with his brother and
two other smugglers while attempting to make an illegal exit in
Bushehr, a port city in southern Iran, in February.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Greece, all the EU countries recalled
their ambassadors home from Tehran after the Berlin court last
April implicated top Iranian leaders in the killing of three
Kurdish dissidents and their translator in Berlin in 1992.

<HEADLINE> World Parliamentarian Conference Opens in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The 98th Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU) Conference opened here today, highlighting the topics
of democracy and employment.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,600 parliamentarians from 138 member states
together with representatives of 20 international organizations
take part in the biannual conference which will last till
September 16.
</P>
<P>
The two main topics for discussion at the conference this year
are "ensuring lasting democracy by forging close links between
parliament and the people" and "employment in a globalizing
world."
</P>
<P>
In parallel to these debates, IPU's governing bodies will
consider a Declaration on Democracy, prepared over the last year
by the IPU and international experts.
</P>
<P>
Sub-committees will discuss issues including the human rights
of parliamentarians, security and cooperation in the
Mediterranean, the situation in Cyprus, Middle East peace and
International Humanitarian Law.
</P>
<P>
In a message addressed to the inauguration, U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan stressed that he attaches importance to
building close ties between the IPU and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Annan's massage was delivered on his behalf by
U.N. Undersecretary General and Director General of the
U.N. Office at Geneva Vladimir Petrovsky.
</P>
<P>
A few cooperation agreements between the IPU and
U.N. organizations last year marked a beginning of the
IPU-U.N. cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
This cooperation "reflects a most welcome and promising
development: the emergence of new actors on the world stage, and
their growing influence in shaping the international agenda,"
Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the IPU agenda, as usual, includes some of the
urgent concerns of the present day, which coincide with U.N.'s
endeavors around the globe.
</P>
<P>
IPU Secretary General Pierre Corino, in a report delivered at
the conference, said the IPU has been edging closer to the
U.N. and is studying an agreement to make it a U.N. executive
agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the IPU's plan to open an office at the U.N. would be a
fundamental step crowning the union's efforts to consolidate its
relationship with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The 138-member IPU was formed in 1889 to promote personal
contact of MPs to the end of developing democratic representation
and promoting cooperation between the institutions.

<HEADLINE> China to Vigorously Explore Hydropower Resources of Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The China Yangtze River Three
Gorges Project Development Corporation has been making preliminary
preparations for two big hydropower stations on the upper
reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Early feasibility designs for construction of Xiangjiaba and
Xiluodu hydropower stations have passed appraisal, and the
corporation will oversee construction while watching over its
building of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The Xiluodu hydropower station will have a combined generating
capacity of 14.4 million kw and will take 14 years to complete.
It will become China's second largest after the Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
Xiajiaba hydropower station will have a generating capacity of
six million kw and will be able to generate 30.4 billion kwh
of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the construction of the two hydropower stations
will greatly improve China's energy structure, alleviate power
shortages in east China, improve navigation conditions on the
Yangtze during the dry season and advance economic development of
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Construction will start on one of the two projects in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower resources of the Yangtze is
estimated at 200 million kw, accounting for more than half of the
country's total, most of which are discovered on the upper
and middle reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
To fully explore the rich hydropower resources on the Yangtze,
China has planned to construct 20 tiered hydropower stations, with
Gezhouba hydropower station as the first, followed by the Three
Gorges Dam now under construction at the middle reaches of the
Yangtze.
</P>

<HEADLINE> SADC Universities Urged to Cooperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean geologist today
challenged universities in the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) member countries to work together and coordinate
their teaching in the face of declining higher education budgets.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Geological Society of Zimbabwe Paul Dirks said
declining budgets in SADC colleges and universities were the
major problem constraining the training of geologists, hence the
need for the universities to source their own funding.
</P>
<P>
He said most universities were being forced to cut their
spending without compromising their set standards and
qualifications, a task which he said was very difficult but
required concerted efforts from the various administrations.
</P>
<P>
''We have to organize ourselves to make sure that we
coordinate our teaching so that it becomes relevant to our
environment and all this has to be done despite this major
financial problem that our universities are suffering from,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Dirks, a lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe's Geology
Department which is co-hosting a 15-day conference on geological
evolution in southern Africa, said universities should also have
links with local industries to ensure their teaching was in line
with market requirements.
</P>
<P>
''Another problem that faces the region and Africa as a whole
is that textbooks that we use are from Europe, and this is a
major constraint as they teach about Europe and not African
geology,'' said Dirks, who urged African governments to provide
budgets for new geology books to be written in Africa.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 delegates from all over the world are attending
the conference which is focusing on the importance of intra-plate
magnetic processes during the evolution of the southern African
crater from the early Archean to recent times.

"The next five years will have a great bearing on whether we
can achieve goals set for this century, and proceed to realize the
long-term goals for the year 2010," according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
These years will be a period of both opportunities and
challenges. China's performance over the next five years will
determine whether it can march victoriously towards the fulfilment
of the glorious mission by the middle of next century. It will be
the period in which the CPC and the Chinese people make greater
strides in reform, opening, and socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, chief architect for China's reform,
opening-up and modernization program, once exhibited his broad and
long-term vision by noting, "China will have great hope in the
next century".
</P>
<P>
"The prediction reflects the deep love of a great patriot for
his motherland and exhibited the confidence a great Marxist places
on the socialist course. It also revealed a great man's trust and
expectations concerning Chinese Communists."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people have full
confidence in the success of their own future based on the fact
that our nation is constantly striving to become stronger and more
enterprising, and our people are wise, courageous, and dare to
overcome difficulties so as to fulfil their missions.

<HEADLINE> Youth Given 10 Years in Jail for Marseille Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A 16-year-old youth was
sentenced to 10 years in prison by a Marseille court for murdering
a 14-year-old boy, Nicolas Bourgat, in the southern French
metropolis one year ago to a day, reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
The murder caused a sensation in France because the murderer
was reportedly a North African immigrant who said that he killed
Nicolas Bourgat simply because he felt inferior to him.
</P>
<P>
The far-right National Front (FN) party of Jean-Marie Le Pen
took advantage of the murder to fan racist prejudice against
immigrants, and organized a huge protest in Marseille last
September.
</P>
<P>
The accused young man, whose name was not published by the
court, admitted being guilty of willing manslaughter by stabbing
to death Nicolas with a knife, when the latter was eating a
sandwich with his friends in downtown Marseille.
</P>
<P>
The French law allows a court to give a maximum sentence of 16
years in jail for a crime like this committed by a minor of 16.
</P>
<P>
The father of Nicolas, Michel Bourgat, said after the verdict
that this sentence had not relieved him of his pain caused by the
death of his son.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Botswana Improve Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Botswana have
taken bold steps to raise the level of economic ties between the
two southern African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
A statement released here today said the two countries'
ministers responsible for industry and commerce met here
Wednesday to consult on issues relating to a 1995 trade agreement
which seeks to bolster the movement of goods and services between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the consultative meeting, Zimbabwe's Industry and Commerce
Minister Nathan Shamuyarira and his Botswana counterpart George
Kgoroba acknowledged the improved relations and increased volume
of trade between the two countries, noting, however, that a lot
still needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
''The ministers agreed to amend the trade agreement
expeditiously to accommodate these and any other changes that may
arise to facilitate trade between the two countries,'' said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
They resolved to meet regularly to consult on matters
affecting trade between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Agreement was also reached on the need to include the
cumulative principle in the trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The principle allows for the inclusion of raw materials
originating from either country in the calculation of the local
content of the products of the exporting country, a move likely
to encourage the use of raw materials from either country.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has been growing steadily over
the past few years as both countries adopted aggressive
investment promotion initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe exported 739 million Zimbabwe Dollars worth of goods
last year and imported goods amounting to more than 526 million
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Currently one U.S. Dollar equals to 11.5 Zimbabwe Dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of members of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) today
inspected Baigou, a north China town renowned for its business
savvy.
</P>
<P>
Located 100 km south of Beijing, Baigou was once famous for
selling inexpensive, but well-made goods. However, the town lost
its reputation years ago when defective goods and
pirated items infiltrated the market.
</P>
<P>
To revive its image, the local government has worked out a
series of regulations to return its markets to their glory days.
</P>
<P>
During today's inspection, CPPCC members expressed their
satisfactions for the tidy streets and orderly marketplaces, and
gave high marks to the local government for the overall
improvement of residents' quaility of life.
</P>
<P>
"Fake goods or low-quality items have been wiped out of our
markets through two years of hard work," said the town head,
adding they are trying to build Baigou into a shopping center,
as well as a new tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the sales volume in the town hit four billion yuan,
with more than 80,000 visitors coming and going per day, and the
per capita monthly income exceeded 3,600 yuan.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC inspectors offered some suggestions for the town's future
development, and promised to promote Baigou to more investors both
at home and abroad.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the
Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) hosted a reception for
Chinese and foreign resident correspondents here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The event was designed to give the press a chance of getting to
know each other and exchange, said Wu Hongbo, chief of the
Information Department of the office.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also the office's spokesman, told the guests that there are
 two main tasks for his department: to explain the position of the
 Chinese Government on foreign affairs related to the Hong Kong
SAR and major international matters, and to handle applications
of resident or temporary foreign reporters in HKSAR for coverage
in China's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that HKSAR residents enjoy freedom of
the press and publication, the spokesman said, noting that two
months' facts after the return of Hong Kong showed that it was
unnecessary for some people to worry about the matter.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the office would not intervene in proper and
lawful news coverage by both the HKSAR and foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
Present at the reception were Commissioner of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong SAR Ma Yuzhen and his deputies Zhao
Jihua and Liu Hongxiao.

LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's central bank the
Bank of England announced today that interest rates are to stay at
7 percent for the time being.
</P>
<P>
After two days of its monthly monetary meeting, the bank
decided to leave interest rates unchanged, the first time it has
decided against a rate rise since it was given the power to set
them after the May 1 general election.
</P>
<P>
The move had been widely expected by economists who believe
that the country's economic growth is slowing down. The central
bank also indicated last month that after four rate rises in a row
in as many months it would pause for thought before moving again.
</P>
<P>
The bank's decision was vindicated by recent economic figures
showing that Britain's economic recovery is starting to ease,
which means that inflation fears are lessened.

HARARE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's High Commissioner
to Zimbabwe Lamine Metteden has dismissed the reported serious
illness of Nigerian military ruler Sani Abacha as pure

General Abacha (53), who has ruled Africa's most populous

Quoting a privately-owned weekly, the agencies said Abacha's
health had seriously deteriorated in recent months and the man
has been suffering from liver problems for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Metteden said here today the report that Abacha was seriously
sick could not be true.
</P>
<P>
''Yesterday, he presided over a conference of chartered
accountants and he looked very well and was laughing quite
heartily,'' said Metteden.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges to Protect Third World Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said here today the interests of the developing countries
should be well protected and double standards be abolished in
pursuit of a new world order.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration of the 98th Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU) Conference, Mubarak said the new world order has to be
just and stable, and to maintain its credibility, double standards
should be shoved aside and the same principles be applied to all
nations.
</P>
<P>
"To find a new world order in the true sense, the North has to
set forth a comprehensive program that would help the Third World
countries surge and grow, in addition to offering technical and
in-kind assistance to these countries," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
The president blamed industrialized nations of the North for
the damage to the environment, saying that the Third World nations
contribute, but marginally, to the damage.
</P>
<P>
"It is thus unfair to have those nations just taking first
steps on the road to development bear the high costs for the
conservation of the environment," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no choice but to seek together to achieve
conformity among both parts of the world to set up a new system of
international relations, which are based on just and comprehensive
peace, balanced and sustained development and real democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The peace we speak of is peace for all the people in the
world, with no differentiation between countries being rich or
poor, large or small, advanced or on the road to progress," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said it is appropriate that parliamentarians at the
conference discuss such "urgent" issues of labor and
globalization, but he stressed that the interests of the Third
World have to be taken into account when drafting international
economic relations in the future.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,600 parliamentarians from 138 member states
together with representatives of 20 international organizations
are taking part in the biannual conference on September 11-16.
</P>
<P>
The 138-member IPU was formed in 1889 to promote democratic
representation through personal contact of MPs and promote
international peace and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Gives Top Priority to Coal-Mining Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Coal Industry
today announced that all coal mines are required to install
underground gas-fueled warning lamps in the coming three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister Wang Xianzheng made the announcement today in a
national tele-conference on safety in coal-mining. He also said
that miners have the rights to refuse working under unsafe
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts see this as a major step taken by the Chinese
government to step up mining safety and eliminate hidden troubles,
so as to ultimately ensure the safety of the miners.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the ministry, the government has
attached great importance to safe production in coal mines. Huge
amounts of funding have been invested in the development of
related technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a series of substantial measures have been
adopted to administrate coal mines according to law in reinforcing
safe mining. Moreover, the ministry carries out nationwide
regulation checks.
</P>
<P>
This year, the ministry has made gas-control a key task for the
safety campaign. Coal mines with poor air circulation have been
forced to reduce their output and to improve and renovate the
ventilation systems.
</P>
<P>
Many mines have invested heavily in installing and upgrading
their gas-run equipment.
</P>
<P>
To reinforce safety supervision, the ministry has asked local
coal-mining administrations to allow supervisors to oversee the
work on behalf of the administration.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, nationwide training courses have been held this
year to improve the miners' technical quality and their knowledge
on safety and law.
</P>
<P>
And the efforts have paid off.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, the ratio of casualties
to occur during the production of every one million tons of coal
by coal mines directly under the ministry had plunged by 53.8
percent, compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on safe mining has boosted China's coal production
remarkably. Official statistics show that the country turned out
1.35 billion tons of raw coal in 1996.

Energy Corporation (AEC) has never been involved in business
transactions with Iran, nor is any being considered at present,
Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs Penuell Maduma said today.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to parliament, the minister said AEC chief
Woldo Stumpf never held a meeting with Iranian Deputy Minister of
Atomic Affairs Reza Amrollahi, as claimed by local and foreign
media.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Stumpf had confirmed that the only meeting he, or any
other AEC officials had ever had with any Iranian government
officials, had taken place in March 1995 in a public restaurant
in Cape Town, with Iranian Petroleum Minister Gholamreza
Aghazadeh, said Maduna.
</P>
<P>
Stumpf had been asked to attend the courtesy dinner by former
Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha during Aghazadeh's
visit to South Africa in connection with a possible oil storage
deal at Saldanha military base in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Some "general matters of interest in the nuclear area" had
been discussed at he dinner, Maduna admitted.
</P>
<P>
These included South Africa's termination of its nuclear
weapons program and its accession to the United Nations
non-proliferation treaty, the uncompleted German busher power
reactor in Iran, and South Africa's policy toward uranium
exports.
</P>
<P>
Stumpf therefore denied press reports that he had received
instructions by President Nelson Mandela's office to meet
secretly in Cape Town with Amrollahi in connection with an
Iranian bid to purchase items for manufacturing nuclear weapons,
Maduna said.
</P>
<P>
"No further contact had been undertaken since then," Maduna
stressed, adding or even before then, with any Iranian government
officials and that the AEC had had no business or other dealings
with Iran in the past, nor were any being considered at present.
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign media reported recently that South Africa
has reached some kind of agreement with Iran to help the country
upgrade its nuclear capacity.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Regulations on Nuclear Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
signed a decree on Wednesday to issue and implement the
regulations on control of nuclear exports from China.
</P>
<P>
The regulations were adopted at the 61st regular meeting of the
State Council on August 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, China exercises control over
nuclear exports and strictly carries out its international
obligations on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
All nuclear exports should abide by the relevant state laws and
administrative rules, and must not harm the state security and
public interest.
</P>
<P>
Foreign governments, which are the recipients of nuclear
exports, are to pledge that they will not use for other purposes
the Chinese-supplied nuclear materials and nuclear equipment or
non-nuclear materials used for reactors.
</P>
<P>
The foreign governments must sign a supervision agreement with
the International Atomic Energy Agency and must accept the body's
supervision over Chinese nuclear supplies, it stresses.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the recipients must pledge that they will not
transfer the Chinese nuclear supplies to any third party, and
those involved in a third party-transfer agreed to by the Chinese
suppliers bear the responsibilities set for those who have
directly imported from China, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear exports are conducted by the monopoly exporters
authorized by the State Council, and other institutions and
individuals are not allowed to export, the decree said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Army Fires at Ecomog Jet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean armed
forces today fired at the jet fighter of the west African
peacekeeping force known as Ecomog in Freetown to enforce
economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
Military junta spokesman Aliu Koroma said a Nigeria plane
belonging to Ecomog attacked the port twice today and dropped a
bomb but only to miss the target.
</P>
<P>
No one has been hurt, he confirmed in an interview with the
British Broadcasting Corporation monitored here.
</P>
<P>
"We are firing at them heavily for them to know that we are
alert. We are not going to take chance at all," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"As a responsible government, we have to establish ourselves,
let these people understand that this is our territorial
integrity. We are a sovereign state," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Ecomog plane flying over the
port regularly is "to intimate our people, to provoke us, making
life uneasy for our people".
</P>
<P>
"It is very much acceptable," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the junta accused the Ecomog plane
of bombing the port in Freetown since Ecomog announced last
Friday that it would attack any violators of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the junta claimed that some 20 civilians were
killed in an Ecomog air raid.
</P>
<P>
But Ecomog force commander Major-General Victor Malu rejected
the accusation, saying that Ecomog was attacking a vessel trying
to unloading arms and ammunition, among other goods, and no
civilian was killed in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
A contingent of the Sierra Leone army equipped with
anti-aircraft guns was stationed at the port to ward off air
attack on ships there.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was approved by west African leaders at a summit
last month to force the junta, which seized power in a coup in
May, to step down.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is
negotiating merchant shipping agreements with 37 countries, the
Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
Four such accords had already been signed, while two more were
at an advanced stage, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The agreements allow for vessels from the countries concerned
to sail freely between each other's ports. They also provide for
the setting up of bilateral committees to promote merchant
shipping between the countries.
</P>
<P>
Treaties had been concluded with Madagascar, the Netherlands,
Mozambique and Malaysia. Accords with Algeria and Egypt were
yesterday initialed by officials of the respective countries,
and would be soon formalized by the governments concerned, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Other countries showing an interest in similar agreement with
South Africa included Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, France, Cuba,
the United Kingdom, Kenya, Mexico and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Formalized cooperation in merchant shipping between South
Africa and other seafaring nations had until recently been
virtually non-existent, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Bans Chiefs From Importing Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has ordered chiefs in the diamond region of Kono not to
drink imported mineral water until they fix local water works
used by the rest of the people there.
</P>
<P>
While paramount chiefs resort to drinking imported mineral
water, poor subjects drink from dirty and contaminated pools,
exposing them to all types of illness and disease," said Corporal
Tamba Gborie.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs are "selfish and greedy", said Gborie, who led a
section of junior officers and soldiers in the coup on May 25
that overthrew the country's legitimate government of President
Ahemd Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
"Now to pay for your wrong-doing and to bring instant equality
between the poor and the rich, I am putting a ban on the sale of
mineral water in Kono," he declared, quoted by a report reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
Gborie also said electricity generators would be ordered
switched off in a month so as to encourage the renovation of a
local power plant.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say when Gborie ordered the ban, and his
position in the military government remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
Gborie's voice was first heard over the radio on the day of
the coup.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Parliament Pays Tribute to Black </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
parliament today agreed to a motion paying tribute to Steve Biko,
the black consciousness leader who died from cruel torture by
white police on September 12, 1977.
</P>
<P>
The motion, moved by ruling African National Congress on the
20th anniversary of Biko's death, said parliament recognized
Biko's contribution to the struggle for freedom and the fight
against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Pan Africanist Congress leader Stanley Magoba said Biko's
death had been a shame to South Africa -- not only the way he had
died, but the extent to which he had been harassed.
</P>
<P>
Jacko Maree, National Party member, said his party
"emotionally shared" the feelings of others at the anniversary of
Biko's death, and agreed that the black activist's death had been
an event which should never have occurred.
</P>
<P>
Nhlahla Zulu, member of Inkatha Freedom Party, called on all
those responsible for Biko's death to apologize to the whole
South African nation, and not just to his relatives and members
of the black consciousness movement.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Gibson, Democratic Party member, said the anniversary
was an opportunity for parliament to dedicate itself to ensuring
that human rights were never again trampled on in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's National Association of Democratic Lawyers
today also issued a statement in memory of Biko.
</P>
<P>
The association said it regarded September 12 as a special day
of remembrance of Biko's life and contribution to the liberation
of South Africa from the yoke of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
"As a non-sexist, non-racialist, sofetly-spoken human being,
Steve would not have objected to being called the 'mother' of
black consciousness in South Africa," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Upbeat About German Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, September 11 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl today expressed optimism about Germany's economic outlook,
predicting that the country's gross domestic product (GDP) would
grow by nearly 3 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the opening ceremony of the Frankfurt
international car show today, Kohl criticized the widespread
scepticism among the German public about the economy, saying that
although the current growth was mainly driven by exports, there
was reason for Germans to be optimistic instead of just
complaining about the weak domestic growth.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that the export boom would also
stimulate a revival of domestic business in many sectors.
</P>
<P>
Kohl made the remarks after the German Federal Statistics
Office said Wednesday that the German economy was accelerating by
growing 2.9 percent in the second quarter and 2.0 percent in the
first six months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Profits Soar for French Automaker in 1st Half of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The French automaker Renault
gained 1.672 billion francs (280 million U.S. dollars) of profits
in the first half of 1997, compared with 158 million francs (31.6
million U.S. dollars) in the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The soaring of profits partly resulted from the transfer of 419
million francs (69 million U.S. dollars) of stocks of the
Elf-Aquitaine oil group previously held by Renault, said Agence
France-Presse (AFP) quoting Renault sources.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of the results from the automobile making
branch of the group also contributed to the increase of profits.
</P>
<P>
The auto making branch of Renault reported a loss of 162
million francs (27 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of this
year, compared with 911 million francs (182 million U.S. dollars)
in the first half of last year, reported AFP.
</P>
<P>
The president of Renault, Louis Schweitzer, is carrying out a
fundamental restructuring of the auto group which is half private
and half public in terms of its stock holders.
</P>
<P>
Renault's decision in February to close its assembly plant in
Vilvoorde, Belgium, had aroused strong protests from unions and
the Belgian government.

LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all ended today sharply down, undermined by a softer dollar and
Wall Street's continuing decline.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index remained sharply lower as the Dow
followed on from Wednesday's weakness and ended 50.4 points down
at 4,854.8.
</P>
<P>
As expected the Bank of England left base interest rates
unchanged at 7 percent following its latest monetary committee

A raft of first-half results from several leading FTSE 100
stocks provided the other main focus of news.

German shares in Frankfurt ended 1.9 percent lower, hurt by
overnight Wall Street losses and a softer dollar. The DAX-30 index
fell by 77.59 points below the 4,000-point level to stand at
3,972.55 by the close of the session.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, shares also closed lower, with fresh
selling on Wall Street and the dollar's weaker tone continuing to

KUWAIT CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan has said his country's call for holding a
U.N.-sponsored conference on Afghanistan has lined up support from
a number of countries.
</P>
<P>
Khan, who is on a visit to Saudi Arabia, said in Saudi capital
Riyadh that the U.S., Russia and neighboring countries are now in
favor of such a conference, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his country's call to end the fighting in
Afghanistan, adding that he discussed the matter with Saudi
officials during his current visit to the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Khan arrived in Riyadh Tuesday as a part of a Saudi initiative
launched this week on finding ways to solve the fighting in the
war-torn Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The initiative came as fierce battles are continuing between
students' group Taliban forces and the opposition troops led by
Ahmad Shah Masoud for taking over power in the country.
</P>
<P>
The President of the Islamic Afghanistan movement of Taliban
and Prime Minister of the Taliban authority Mohammad Rabbani and
the U.N. envoy to Afghanistan Lakhdar Al-Ibrahimi have visited the
country earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Khan yesterday handed two letters from Pakistani President
Farooq Legari and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Saudi King Fahd
Ibn Abdul Aziz, but the contents of the letters were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He also met with Saudi King Fahd, Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn

<HEADLINE> Boeing's Stretched Version Aimed at Asian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Boeing's stretched
version of 777, whose first flight is scheduled for next month, is
aimed at high-density routes such as those in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
A product to compete with Airbus for the Asian market, the
first Boeing 777-300 airliner was rolled out at Boeing's plant in
Seattle earlier this week. Its first delivery to Cathay Pacific of
Hong Kong is scheduled for May 1988.
</P>
<P>
Capable of carrying some 20 percent more passengers, the new
model has been designed for regions, where crowed airports do not
have room for more planes, according to Larry Dickenson, Boeing
vice-president for international sales in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the stretched 777 would become the "flagship
airplane for most of the Asia airplane fleets." Most of the 52
orders for the new model came for Asian airlines.
</P>
<P>
At 73.8 meters, the new aircraft is three meters long than
Boeing jumbo 747-400. The stretched fuselage allows "a typical
three-class" configuration to increase from 328 to 384 passengers.
In a two-class configuration it can carry up to 479 people, while
in an all-economy layout the capacity could reach 550 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Its larger fuel tanks enable the aircraft to keep its nonstop
range at 10,370 k. A typical route would be Tokyo to Singapore,
Honolulu to Seoul or San Francisco to Tokyo.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine today launched what was the strongest attack ever made by
the French government against the policy of the Israeli government
under Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu toward the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"This is a catastrophic policy, in the present and for the
future, for the Palestinians, for Israel and for the whole
region," said Vedrine in a speech at a conference of the Socialist
Party held in Montpellier, southern France.
</P>
<P>
He said that the policy of Netanyahu has forced the
Palestinians to "the level of exasperation and despair without
precedent."
</P>
<P>
"There is no more peace process, no more dynamic (of peace) and
no more perspective," said Vedrine while trying to contain his
anger.
</P>
<P>
The attack by the French foreign minister was launched when
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is on a peace
mission in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse said that today's attack by Vedrine, who
was the secretary general of President Francois Mitterrand, was
unusual because the French Socialists are traditionally more
sympathetic with Israel than the French rightwing parties.
</P>
<P>
When President Jacques Chirac visited Jerusalem last October,
he clashed with Israeli security agents who tried to separate him
from Palestinians who came to welcome him.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Security, Oslo Process Important to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madelein Albright today demanded both Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to further cooperate on security and
honor Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright was addressing the students and teachers of the High
School of Arts and Sciences of Jerusalem on the U.S. basic
principles for moving the negotiation process forward.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. believes that security cooperation between Israel and
the PNA is vital for moving the peace process forward, and both
sides should take concrete steps in this direction, she said.
</P>
<P>
Security cooperation requires the leadership of both Israel and
the PNA, particularly the PNA side, to show red lights to
terrorism, she said.
</P>
<P>
The second basic principle is that the Oslo process must be
honored by both sides, she said.
</P>
<P>
In this aspect, both Israel and the PNA must renew and
reinforce their commitments and responsibilities to the Oslo
accords reached four years ago and there can be no back-off from
the Oslo commitment, she said.
</P>
<P>
This means that Israel should refrain from unilateral acts,
including the implementation of the provocative policies of
expansion of settlements, home demolition, withholding of taxes
and the confiscation of IDs of the Palestinians because such acts
might undermine the confidence of the Palestinians, she said.
</P>
<P>
The United States believes that the halt of such unilateral
acts by Israel could create an atmosphere which will be conducive
to the acceleration of achieving a final peace agreement, she
added.
</P>
<P>
Israel should do all it can to avoid harming the Palestinian
economy and the welfare of its people, she said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, she said, both Israel and the PNA must understand the
real meaning of peace and strengthen the partnership between the
two sides so that the final peace can be realized, she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here Wednesday for a three-day visit in a
bid to help restore the Middle East peace process.

</P>
<P>
During the meeting in Museveni's home village, Rwakitura,

Uganda has been liberalized and it is now that 71 companies have
already been privatized in the country.

all its businesses so that the government will only be concerned
with powers of regulation and quality control with the end of the
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is working to expertise the
privatization process so that ground is created to enable
investors participating in the development of telecommunication
sector.
</P>
<P>
Museveni advised them to get involved either by buying the
existing telecommunication facilities or by establishing a second
operator's license for a new telecommunication company.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Russia's Statement on Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government today
welcomed a Russian statement that the S-300 anti-aircraft
missile system will not be deployed in Cyprus once the Turkish
troops are withdrawn from the island, a government spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Manolis Christofides described a statement Wednesday by the
Russian president's spokesman, Serguel Yastrjembsky, as "a right
approach and in line with the substance of the Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
The Russian official's statement, Christofides said,
"introduces the correct approach toward promoting a Cyprus
solution."
</P>
<P>
Yastrjembsky said Wednesday that "only if Turkish troops were
withdrawn from Cyprus there would be no delivery of the S-300 to
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The Russian spokesman also defended the legitimate right of
the government of Cyprus to purchase and deploy the S-300
missiles, which he described as pure defensive character.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian ambassador to Cyprus Georgi Muratov told
reporters here today that the missiles would be in Cyprus in a
year's time, noting that the only development that could prevent
their deployment would be the demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkish threats that the surface-to-air missiles
should not be deployed on the island run contrary to every rule
of international law.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador said that the contract signed early
this year between the Cypriot government and the Russian
manufacturers of the S-300 system would be fully honored.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Turkey's search of merchant ships passing
through the Bosporus Straits, in an effort to prevent the
deployment of the missiles in Cyprus, Muratov stressed that
those tactics should be terminated as they violate free
navigation.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia was protesting against the Turkish acts and
called on other countries affected to protest as well.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' decision to purchase the Russian-made S-300 missile
system early this year has triggered Turkey's threats that it
will launch pre-emptive strike against Cyprus if they are
deployed.
</P>
<P>
But the Cypriot government has repeatedly said that the deal
could be canceled if Turkey and Turkish Cypriots agree to
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides' proposal for demilitarization
of the island, or if there is substantial progress on the Cyprus
problem.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: Albright's Mideast Visit Could Be Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today reiterated its
reserved optimism about United States' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's maiden trip to the Middle East after taking
office.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affair Samir
Mutawe said that the Middle East peace process might see a better
turn if there is a good coordination between the Arab states and
Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright's mission would succeed in salvaging the stalled peace
process if she can help curb the Jewish settlements in Arab land
and bring about the implementation of the signed agreements
between the Israelis and Palestinians, Radio Jordan quoted Mutawe
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mutawe said that Israeli withdrawal from all the
occupied Arab land and its commitments to the peace agreements
would guarantee a comprehensive and just peace.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the coordination between the United
States represented by Albright's current trip and those of the
Arab states could release the peace process from the present
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived in Israel Wednesday, has stressed that
the Palestinians should act in response to the Israeli demands and
make more efforts to combat terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem today, she also asked the Israeli side to stop
building Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, an issuing leading
the peace process to a crisis since March.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian minister of state made these remarks amid
Palestinian complaints about Albright's trip. Palestinian Minister
of Higher Education Hanan Ashrawi Wednesday criticized that
Albright began her visit in "one-sided approach."
</P>
<P>
Albright will later visit Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia
and possibly Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been playing a major role in the peace process
and its Middle East special Envoy Dennis Ross had made several
rounds of shuttle diplomacy between Washington and the region in
preparation for Albright's visit.

UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today urged the United States to fulfill its
commitments and pay fully its dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Annan said there had been some progress

dues to the United Nations, and the bill before the U.S. congress
now was to release the dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the U.S. congress set conditions for paying
the dues, which would not be welcomed by most of the member
states.
</P>
<P>
Annan hoped that in the final discussions of the U.S. congress,
some of the conditions could be dropped and the problem could be
worked out so that the work of the United Nations would not be
disrupted and the tension among the member states would not be
increased.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia Makes Apology to British High Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government here
today officially apologized to the British government and its
diplomatic representative for "reckless remarks" made by a senior
official, reported Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held in the capital, finance minister
Ronald Penza said it would be foolish to risk the investment flow
by making "reckless" remarks about Patrick Nixon, British high
commissioner to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Penza told reporters that he has made an apology to Nixon on
behalf of the Zambian government, while describing him as a
"tremendous asset" in rebuilding Zambia's relationship with
Britian.
</P>
<P>
This apology was offered after Zambian foreign minister
Lawrence Shimba accused Wednesday Nixon of sending the British
government false reports about the democratization in Zambia,
which greatly affected aid flow to the country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with a six-member parliamentary delegation from
Britian, who arrived in Lusaka Tuesday on an 8-day visit to study
Zambia's legal system and review the programmes under British
aid, Shimba charged that Nixon refused to cooperate with the
Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to Britian to ignore Nixon's "negative" reports on
grounds that his country is going ahead with its democratization
process which began in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, a member of the Commonwealth and with an average GDP
of 370 U.S. dollars per capita, receives hundreds of millions of
dollars from the Western donor countries every year.

<HEADLINE> Car Fuel Prices Rise Again in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A stronger dollar caused car
fuel prices in Belgium to rise once more to a new high since 1985,
local television reported today.
</P>
<P>
The RTBF television said that the price rise was just a month
away from the previous hikes that shot local car fuel prices to as
high as 40.1 Belgian francs (1.02 U.S. dollars) for a liter of
unleaded petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Today's increase added another 0.3 franc to the price tag.
</P>
<P>
Local economists fear that car fuel prices may rise further due
to the rising dollar and the rising price on international
petroleum markets.
</P>
<P>
A liter of unleaded petroleum sold for 28.1 francs per liter in
July 1989 when the exchange rate was at around 38 francs for a
dollar. The dollar fetched 37 francs today.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian franc has been losing ground against the dollar
ever since the Mexican peso crisis in late 1994 and early 1995.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit in Current Account Declines in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S trade deficit in
the current account decreased slightly to 39 billion U.S. dollars
in the second quarter of this year as the growth of exports
outpaced the increase in imports.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance in the U.S. current account slipped 2.4 percent
from a first-quarter deficit of 40 billion dollars, the Commerce
Department said in a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The decrease reflected a 5.5 percent increase in merchandise
exports to 171.5 billion dollars while merchandise imports climbed
up by 2.9 percent to 218.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account is the broadest measure of foreign trade,
including not only sales of goods but also services, investment
flows and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the deficit helped slow down the overall
economic growth in the second quarter. The gross domestic product
grew at a healthy 3.6 percent pace following a strong advance at a
4.9 percent rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
As usual, this country had a surplus in services. It was 20.5
billion dollars in the second quarter, the same as in the first.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slight improvement in the overall current account,
the deficit during the first half of 1997 was running at an annual
rate of 158 billion dollars, which is higher than the 148.2
billion dollar deficit in 1996.

LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has urged its member countries to set up
a national economic policy implementation committee to ensure
that they comply with its economic integration program through
harmonized policies.
</P>
<P>
This was indicated in a document drawn up by the ECOWAS
Secretariat, "harmonization of economic and financial policies of
ECOWAS", the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The committee is necessary to align national economic policies
with the regional macro-economic convergence objective for the
benefit of the integration process, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the committee would comprise
members from government ministries, banking and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS's major convergence objectives include a budget
deficit/GDP (Gross Domestic Product) ratio of five percent by
1998 year and a maximum of three percent subsequently for member
states.
</P>
<P>
Others include unification of exchange rates and the removal
of over-valuation by 1998, removal of payment restrictions on
current account transactions between 1998 to the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Member countries are also expected to progressively reduce
their borrowing from their central banks to a ceiling of 10
percent of fiscal revenue by 1998.
</P>
<P>
The document noted, however, most member countries could not
sustain the success attained in the program because of structural
weakness.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Ambassador to
Saudi Arabia Ridha Nouri met today with the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan to discuss ways
of improving and strengthening relations between Iran and GCC
countries, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the GCC said Nouri and Hujailan also
exchanged views on the latest developments of the Middle East and
international situations. But no details were given in the report.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is as a part of the latest drive by Iran and the
GCC countries to improve their long-strained relations, especially
after Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric, was sworn in as Iran's
new president in August.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made a declaration on Wednesday that "peace and
stability in the region is tied on the level of cooperation
between Iran and the Gulf Arab states," expressing a willingness
to strengthen ties with GCC countries and establish solid eternal
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hujailan said recently that the GCC, grouping Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and
Qatar, welcomes any Iranian initiative and that "one of the
contents of the GCC policy is to establish a strong relation with
a large neighboring country like Iran."
</P>
<P>
Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Alawi
Bin Abdullah visited Iran Tuesday and Qatari Foreign Minister
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al-Thani is also expected to
visit Tehran Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, observers do not expect major changes in the GCC-Iran
relations in the near future, with many issues, particularly the
dispute over the sovereignty of three gulf islands between Iran
and the UAE hindering in the way.
</P>
<P>
The islands of Abu Mousa, Greater and Lesser Tunb are occupied
by Iran, but also claimed by the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Insecurity Growing in Eastern Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The security situation is
worsening in the east part of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) with sporadic exchanges of gunfire heard at night in the
towns of Goma and Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
A release issued by the U.N. Integrated Regional Information
Network quoted an aid worker as saying that Bunyakiri, about 80
kilometers north of Bukavu, was occupied by rebels at the end of
last week.
</P>
<P>
The release reaching here today noted that some anti-Tutsi
groups were forming loose alliances directed at the
Tutsi-dominated forces of President Laurent Kabila and his
Rwandan allies.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that a new rebel group Democratic
Resistance Alliance (DRA) was set up last month with the stated
aim of "liberating" eastern DRC.
</P>
<P>
One of the DRA leaders is Celestin Bembe who held the post of
"First Vice-President" in Mobutu's last government and is
allegedly well-known for his anti-Tutsi sentiments.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group reportedly based in Tanzania groups opposition
forces from the DRC, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, according to a
DRC newspaper "La Reference Plus" report.
</P>
<P>
Some rebel groups based in Fizi and Masisi regions are made of
local people who are resentful at the dominance of the Bayarwanda
Tutsis within Kabila's army.
</P>
<P>
The release said that President Kabila warned on Monday that
he would not tolerate the reorganization of anti-government
forces and would quickly take action to crush them.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland's Economy in Strong Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELFAST, Northern Ireland, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Northern
Ireland's economy is healthier than it has been for decades and
will continue to develop until the end of the century, a local
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Its industrial production increased by over 13 percent during
the past five years compared with 5.9 percent for the UK as a
whole and 3.6 percent for the EU economies in aggregate.
</P>
<P>
The number of people in employment in Northern Ireland --
currently running at record levels -- has grown by 6.9 percent
over the last five years compared with 1.7 percent in the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has fallen steadily from a peak of 17.2 percent in
October 1986 to a 17-year low of 7.9 percent in July 1997.
Overall, unemployment has fallen by some 30 percent since July
1996.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering here with London-based foreign
correspondents, John McGuckian, chairman of the Industrial
Development Board for Northern Ireland, said, "All of these
developments have contributed to the very real feeling of hope,
optimism and determination which the people of Northern Ireland
have about their future."
</P>
<P>
With the resumption of talks on a political settlement for
Northern Ireland which Sinn Fein will take part in for the first
time, the chairman said, "It will have very positive impacts on
Northern Ireland's economy."
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland Economic Research Center expects this
favorable performance to continue through into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Its GDP is expected to increase by 3-4 percent per annum until
the end of the century -- a level of around 1.5 percent per annum
faster than that forecast for the UK as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Too Early to Judge Arafat's Pledge to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Commenting on Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's pledge to fight terrorism, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today that it was too early to
judge Arafat's real actions.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks at a news conference after the
second round of talks with visiting United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who is here on a rescue mission to
save the deeply-troubled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite Arafat's promise, it was still too early
to judge whether there would be any real movements on the
Palestinian side to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Albright went directly into the meeting with Netanyahu late
in the afternoon at the Prime Minister's office right after
returning from Ramallah, West Bank, where she held a marathon
meeting with Arafat to discuss ways to break the deadlock in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
While Arafat reiterated to Albright his promise to fight
Islamic militants, he also demanded Israel stop violating its
commitments to the signed peace accords by lifting the closure on
Palestinian-held areas, releasing the frozen funds and stopping
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same conference, Albright said she discussed
with Netanyahu the issue of Israel's withholding of about 30
million U.S. dollars remaining tax revenues owed to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), saying that she regarded it
as an inappropriate measure unrelated to the security issue.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed to Netanyahu the principle of reciprocity
on avoiding taking unilateral steps to preempt the final-status
talks. It remained unclear whether she proposed a halt to
Israeli settlement activities which have become the major
obstacle in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In earlier remarks, Albright has urged Israel to create a
favorable environment to rebuild mutual trust and confidence
with the PNA in order to get the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu confirmed that he and Albright talked about a wide
range of reciprocity issues, including Israeli obligations which
he promised to fulfill if the PNA acts to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Albright's visit would bring about
"concrete and tangible changes" to the current crisis. But he
warned that Israel is still in "a state of danger" because of
concrete intelligence warnings about more terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the issues on resuming the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, the two leaders also discussed the threats of
Iran's nuclear weapon program and long-range missile development
and the possibility of reviving the suspended talks between
Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Albright and Netanyahu are to hold private dinner meeting
tonight to continue discussions. On Friday, Albright is expected
to return to Ramallah to hold the second round of talks with
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
She will leave for Damascus to visit Syria late Friday, at
the second leg of her first Middle East tour that will also take
her to Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Most of Kenyan MPs Agree on IPPG Reform Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Kenyan
lawmakers agreed on a package of political reforms submitted by
the Inter-Party Parliamental Group (IPPG) at the third plenary
session starting today, IPPG Secretary George Anyona told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The IPPG suggested that the Electoral Commission be more
broad-based, transparency in the casting of votes be ensured, the
winning president be permitted to form a coalition government,
and the election timetable be prepared in consultation with all
parties involved.
</P>
<P>
A total of 132 parliamentary members, more than 40 of them
from the opposition, attended the session and reached a consensus
on the package, said Anyona, adding the figure meets the
two-third majority demand for the 200-seat house to enact any
bill.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi, 74 and in power for 19 years,
expressed his support to the IPPG package when meeting with the
IPPG Coordinating Committee today.
</P>
<P>
The group, formed by the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU) and the Opposition, also proposed to have 12 laws repealed
or amended partly in a bid to ensure freedom of expression and
equitable access of all political parties to public media.
</P>
<P>
Political prisoners should be released, all political parties
be permitted to register, and the law allowing detention without
trial be repealed, the IPPG recommended.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition lawmakers appeared to have given up during
the coming general elections one of their key demands that the
future president should obtain a 50 percent majority of the total
votes in addition to the 25 percent votes in five of the eight
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the opposition umbrella body, the National Convention
Executive Council (NCEC), dismissed the IPPG's work and planned
to call national strikes and protests on September 17-18 and
October 8-9 to press for total constitutional reforms before the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC, which fails to register, also organized a rally on
Sunday in Kisumu, the third-largest city of Kenya. But the rally
flopped after nine opposition leaders were detained at Kisumu
airport.
</P>
<P>
As many as 17 foreign embassies, mainly from western
countries, announced Saturday they back the current parliamentary
inter-party talks. The diplomatic community here were also
invited to attend the parliament's third plenary session as
observers.
</P>
<P>
KANU, which has firmly rejected talks with the NCEC, will open
its National Delegate Conference on September 16 over reform
talks and the election. At such a conference before the first
multi-party election in 1992, Moi was elected as KANU's sole
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Moi has recently claimed that he would announce the poll date
soon.
</P>
<P>
Political atmosphere has been tightening in the country
following several rounds of violent clashes between the
government and the opposition since May, the key loan cut by the
International Monetary Fund and continuous killings on the Coast.

<HEADLINE> Four-Party Peace Talks to Be Held Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The second four-party
peace talks on the Korean Peninsula will be held late next week
after Senior officials from the United States and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) made an agreement in their
two-day Beijing consultations, the State Department announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Next week's preparatory meeting, scheduled for September 18-19
in New York, "is to decide arrangements for the four-party plenary
session," spokesman James Foley said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the DPRK, South Korea, the United States and
China will attend the preparatory meeting at Columbia University's
School of International and Public Affairs, Foley added.
</P>
<P>
Foley declined to say whether the U.S. and DPRK officials had
reached any agreement in their Beijing talks for the DPRK to
participate in next week's meeting. He said he had nothing to
comment "on that issue from the briefing podium."
</P>
<P>
He would neither disclose the discussions between the U.S. and
DPRK officials on the defection of two DPRK diplomats, Chang
Sung-gil and Chang Sung-ho, whom had been granted asylum by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"There is no linkage between the Chang case and the four-party
peace process or indeed any other issue," Foley told reporters.
"We believe that all sides are participating in the process
because it is in their interests to do so and because it's
important for advancing and ensuring peace across the Korean
Peninsula, whatever bilateral concerns may exist."
</P>
<P>
Foley also said that before the preparatory meeting, there will
be bilateral meetings between the participants.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Urges for Saving of Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye today urged people to exercise prudence
in the use of cereals and legumes to meet the imminent food
shortage in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye told reporters here that Tanzania will face a
900,000-ton shortage in the next nine months, a consignment which
the government will have to import.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a measure to curb the food shortage, the
government has formed special committees from the ward to
district level to monitor the food situation in their respective
areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is need for all people to take
precautionary measures against the shortage, including a stop to
making local brews.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also called upon the public to mobilize
resources, including cropping their animals to raise money to buy
food during the hard period.
</P>
<P>
On food smuggling, Sumaye said that stern action should be
taken against the smugglers and the intercepted consignments
should be auctioned.
</P>
<P>
The imminent food shortage resulted from grave drought in the
past year.

<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- A company of United Arab Emirates (UAE) and a
U.S. company signed a 1-billion-U.S. dollar contract here today,
under which the U.S. company will take on the construction and
operation of the Middle East first satellite project.
</P>
<P>
The deal, the biggest ever of the kind in the Middle East
region, was inked this afternoon by Mohammad Hassan Omran,
chairman of the UAE's Thuraya Satellite Telecommunications
Company, and Michael J. Houterman, president of U.S. Hughes Space
and Communications International, Inc..
</P>
<P>
The satellite project, namely Thuraya, including two
satellites, is the fifth of the type for mobile telephones in the
world. The service of the satellite will include voice, data, fax
and messaging.
</P>
<P>
The first satellite will be put into orbit in the year 2000 and
it will have a coverage area encompassing nearly 1.8 million
people in the Middle East, North Africa, Eastern Europe including
Turkey, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
The bid for the satellite contract was opened nearly two years
ago. Hughes was chosen as the final successful bidder after
beating its three other competitors known as Alcatel, Aerospatial
of France and Lockheed Telecommunications company of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- A Jordanian delegation led by Industry and Trade
Secretary General Mohammad Halaiqa is in Washington for seeking
help from some U.S. organizations on issues related to Jordan's
entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Newspapers here today quoted Tamam Al Ghoul, head of the WTO
unit at the ministry of industry, Trade and Supply, as saying that
the delegation would enlist the help from the U.S. organizations
in preparing for the negotiations on Jordan's joining the world
trade body.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also aimed to benefit from the experiences of
the organizations in participating such negotiations, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the talks would cover the prospect of arranging for
Jordanian personnel to be trained by these organizations on
following up issues pertaining to the upcoming negotiations, she
added.
</P>
<P>
Along with Jordan, other Arab countries like Saudi Arabia,
Algeria, Oman and Sudan are negotiating with the WTO while Syria
and Lebanon are studying the prospect of applying to join the
organization.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon signed Wednesday with the European Investment
Bank (EIB) three financial agreements totalling 164 million
U.S. dollars, a Lebanese Central News Agency report said.
</P>
<P>
The electricity sector, the state of road networks and the
treatment of undrinkable water are the subjects agreed upon, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The deals have made the total loans granted by EIB since 1993
reach 540 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These loans are mainly used in the construction of Beirut
Airport, Beirut Port, water and electric projects.

<HEADLINE> All Senate Democrats Support McCain-Feingold Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Democratic leaders said
Thursday that all 45 Senate Democrats are ready to vote for the
McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan bill would prohibit parties from collecting
unlimited "soft money" contributions, the donations that can't be
used for direct candidate support and is supposed to pay for
generic election activities. It would also authorize voluntary
spending limits for candidates in exchange for reduced
broadcast-advertising costs.
</P>
<P>
The 45 democrats, in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, a Republican of Mississippi, asked that Lott schedule a vote
soon on the legislation. Democrats noted that with three
Republican senators already co-sponsoring the bill, only two
Republican votes are needed to move it through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"Your willingness to schedule... an up-or-down vote, coupled
with the support of only two additional Republican senators, could
break 10 years of gridlock on this matter," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Lott still believes that ongoing Senate hearings into
questionable money raising during the 1996 campaign should be
finished before laws that oversee the process are revamped, said
Susan Irby, Lott's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Senator John McCain, a Republican of Arizona, one of the bill's
sponsors, said his talks with Lott to bring the issue to the floor
this year "have shown progress."
</P>
<P>
However, Irby said Lott has not promised a vote on the issue in
1997. Congressional leaders hope to adjourn for the year in
October or November.
</P>
<P>
The bill's other chief sponsor, Senator Russell Feingold,
Democrat of Wisconsin, joining Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
at a news conference to announce the Democratic letter.
</P>
<P>
With the long resistance to overhauling the current
campaign-finance laws from incumbents of both parties, who find
the current system comfortable, the prospects for an early vote
remain questionable.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has endorsed the bill for months and
earlier this year called for its passage by July 4.
</P>
<P>
In the House in recent weeks, Democrats have been forcing
frequent procedural votes to delay the chamber's work in an effort
to pressure Republican leaders there to schedule a vote on the
legislation.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A plan to restructure
and retrain Mozambique's police force has not yet begun, with
fingers of blame pointing to bureaucratic procedures of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today from Maputo quoted government
officials as saying that the Spanish police officers who are
supposed to be in charge of retraining the Mozambicans are
already in the country.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign police officers are angry and demoralized at
the constant delays that prevent them from starting their work.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Spain have donated about 17 million U.S.
Dollars to the project.
</P>
<P>
Other donors, such as Italy, have indicated they will join at
a later stage, after clear evidence the performance of the police
is improving.
</P>
<P>
Under agreements signed between the donors and the Mozambican
government, the funds are handled by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Four advisors from the Spanish civil guards arrived in
Mozambique in July, expecting to begin their work at once.
</P>
<P>
But they found the UNDP is not releasing the money required to
begin the program properly, the reports said.

JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The government of
Swaziland has been urged to create political stability and not to
rely entirely on foreign donors.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made today by British high commissioner to
Swaziland, John Doble, at a joint meeting to discuss British aid
to the kingdom held in Mbabane, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Doble told government officials of the two sides that it is

</P>
<P>
He also advised the Swazi government to revise its
constitution, which he said will "help the country to boost its
economy".
</P>
<P>
The British diplomat said his government's aid to Swaziland

<HEADLINE> WWF to Develop Environmental Education in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF) Cameroun Program Office is planning to reorientate
activities in environmental education, according to "Cameroun
Tribune" here today.
</P>
<P>
The reorientation of environmental education will involve
local communities through the promotion of conservation and
sustainable development practices.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, the WWF has been active only in school systems
in the country. The new orientation reflects the WWF's policy to
make conservation practices more useful in terms of sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
The orientations will have two objectives: consolidating
on-going activities in formal educational systems and the new
initiatives at the community level.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility studies in this vein have already been carried out
by the WWF officials. It seeks to define the goal of the
orientation, and identify potential partners.
</P>
<P>
The report recalled that the environmental education was
introduced in Cameroun schools in 1995 by the WWF.
</P>
<P>
The Cameroun Environmental Education Network created in March
this year makes information on environmental education available
to all partners.
</P>
<P>
In April, a new environmental education initiative known as
the Cameroun environmental education support project was
introduced in the country to develop and promote environmental
education in schools and local communities.

<HEADLINE> Tung: HK People Confident of HK Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee-hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
expressed here today confidence that Hong Kong will become an even
better place for its children and grandchildren as it is now
reunited with China.
</P>
<P>
"July 1, 1997 was a day to which we in Hong Kong had looked
forward with enormous pride and confidence," said Tung in a speech
at a luncheon hosted by the Asia Society in cooperation with the
Hong Kong Economic &AMP; Trade Office in New York, The Hong Kong
Association of New York, and the National committee on U.S.- China
Relations.
</P>
<P>
Tung, who is on a four-day visit to the United States, arrived
in New York last night to meet with representatives of the Chinese
society as well as economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that there had been no change in the life style to
which Hong Kong people had been accustomed since the resumption of
China's sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy continues to expand," he noted, adding that recent
surveys have shown 78 percent of the Hong Kong people are
confident of Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Responding to doubts of some Americans about the actual
implementation of the Basic Law, the Chief Executive said that the
doubts are "misguided."
</P>
<P>
"Clearly it is in China's basic national interest to ensure the
successful implementation of 'one country, two systems'," Tung
stressed. "If Hong Kong succeeds in our effort, we can contribute
towards continuing modernization of China."
</P>
<P>
He said that China's leadership is fully committed to making
"one country, two systems" a successful reality.
</P>
<P>
"They have complete faith in the ability of Hong Kong people
administering Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung, who met some U.S. Congressmen in Washington earlier this
week, is scheduled to returned to the U.S. capital early Friday
morning before leaving home later on the day.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- the State Department, on

<HEADLINE> Executives of Large State Firms Optimistic About Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Executives of five state
large groups in China today said that exploration for effective
forms to materialize public ownership for developing productive
forces and promote the shareholding system will be one of the new
breakthroughs in the reform of the country's state businesses.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kuangyu, chairman of the board of directors of Shanghai
Textile Holdings Group, said that people used to think the state
and collective sectors were the only forms to materialize public
ownership.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, however, broadened the concept of public ownership
by including the state and collective sectors of the mixed
ownership of the economy in his report he delivered at the opening
session of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, nine of the 240 joint ventures in Shanghai's
textile industry have introduced the shareholding system.
</P>
<P>
"I used to think that once an enterprise drawns in overseas
fund and is listed on the stock market, it is no longer of public
ownership," said Zhu. "Jiang's report today has strengthened my
confidence in the prospect of state businesses," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, together with executives of four other influential
companies in China, were invited to give a press conference this
afternoon on the hot topic of reforms in state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Geng Zhaojie, general manager of the China First Automobile
Works, said the shareholding system has enabled his group
to operate more effectively.
</P>
<P>
Through fund-raising, this largest automobile producer of China
now has a total of 2.8 billion yuan at its own disposal as against
750 million yuan before, increasing the value of its state assets.
</P>
<P>
"The shareholding system does mot have any impact on the nature
of the public ownership of the works because the works controls
majority of the stocks of its three listed affiliations, which has
introduced a shareholding system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the worker's security and unemployment following
the introduction of the shareholding system, Liu Jie, chairman and
president of the Anshan Iron and Steel Group, told the reporters
that China is introducing a social old-age system. A steel
rolling mill of the Group, which was set up not long ago, has
decided to take out some money from its annual profits, which is
equivalent to 10 percent of its total payroll, for the medical
security fund.
</P>
<P>
In response to the role of Party organizations in shareholding
enterprises, Wang Guoxing, vice-president of the Handan Iron and
Steel Corporation Ltd, said that the major role of the grass-roots
Party organizations is to help the business executives to mobilize
the enthusiasm of the workers and improve the business management.
</P>
<P>
The ideas of the Party organizations will only become policy
decisions through legal procedures and the company law.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, introducing the shareholding system and the
bringing into full play the role of the Party organizations are
not contradictary," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Issue High on Pak-Indian Talks Agenda: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The issue of Jammu and
Kashmir will be high on the agenda of the next round of foreign
secretary level talks starting next Monday between Pakistan and
India, a Foreign Office spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Having received "partially satisfactory" response about India's
conflicting statements, Pakistan agreed to take part in the third
round of foreign secretary level talks between the two countries
in the Indian capital New Delhi from September 15 to 18, the
spokesman announced at a news conference late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad will proceed to New
Delhi next Monday for talks with his Indian counterpart, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming talks will "focus on the primacy of issues of
Jammu and Kashmir and peace and security", he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our main task at this round of talks is to operationalize the
mechanism as agreed in the Islamabad round of talks in June and
there is no need to repeat the most important issues on the agenda
are the Jammu and Kashmir and peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no question of these issues not being on
the talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also emphasized the importance of continuing the
dialogue process with India, saying it is in the interest of
people in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue always help in solving problems, in removing the
mistrust and in seeking clarification. We need to do this in the
interest of people of this region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we want economic development, progress and prosperity in
this region, we must try to continue the dialogue in seeking just
and fair solution of the issues between us," he added.
</P>
<P>
"If we just remain stuck on these issues, how are we going to
seek progress, how are we going to reduce hostility?" the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart I.K. Gujral, both of whom will go to New York for the
U.N. General Assembly meeting on September 22, will "very
hopefully" meet each other there.
</P>
<P>
The last round of foreign secretary level talks between the two
countries was held here in June. During the talks, the two sides
agreed to set up working groups to resolve their outstanding
issues including the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their foreign secretary level talks
in March this year after a suspension of more than three years
amid signs of improved relations between the two arch rivals in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have fought three wars since their
independence in 1947, two of which were over Kashmir that remains
to be a core issue in their bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> US Agriculture Department Issues Harvest Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. corn harvest
forecast was virtually no big change from last month at 9.27
billion bushels, the Agriculture Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The corn acreage to be harvested remained nearly the same at 74
million acres. Corn yields were predicted at 125.2 bushels per
acre, slightly less than last month's estimate and down 1.9
bushels from 1996. The September corn prediction was about 8.2
million bushels lower than the August figure. Price projections
from this year's corn crop were expected at between 2.45 dollars
and 2.85 dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
The corn crop was progressing ahead of normal nationwide,
despite persistent dry weather in early August that stretched from
Missouri to New York. Later in the month, widespread rain brought
relief to the dry fields.
</P>
<P>
The department predicted that exports would be down 25 million
bushels this year because of increased competition from China.
</P>
<P>
Soybean production was forecast at 2.75 billion bushels, a bit
higher than last month's estimate but 15 percent more than 1996.
If realized, the soybean crop would be a new record.
</P>
<P>
Yields for soybeans were estimated at 39.3 bushels per acre,
1.7 bushels more than 1996. Soybeans are expected to bring between
5.60 and 6.70 dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
Production for all types of wheat was forecast at 2.51 billion
bushels, a 1 percent drop from the August estimate but 10 percent
over last year. The projected yield of 39.5 bushels per acre would
equal the all-time record.
</P>
<P>
Durum wheat and other kinds of spring-planted wheat both will
have lower yields this year, but the winter wheat crop was 225.4
million bushels ahead of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for durum wheat, used in making pasta, was 90.1
million bushels -- down from 115.8 million bushels last year --
while other spring wheat was down almost 19 percent at 561.5
million bushels.
</P>
<P>
U.S. cotton crop estimates of 18.4 million bales would be the
fourth highest harvest on record but still down 3 percent from
1996. Yields are expected to average 658 pounds per acre, down 49
pounds from last year. The cotton forecast was 4 percent above the
August prediction, largely because of rain that raised production
forecasts in Texas by an estimated 400,000 bales, as well as by
110,000 bales in Arkansas and 80,000 bales in Mississippi. One
bale of cotton is some 480 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Air-raid Opposition Stronghold </HEADLINE>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Taliban militia's
warplanes today bombed the opposition stronghold of
Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 kilometers north of Kabul, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's warplanes bombed Afghanistan's second largest city in
the morning but there have been no reports of casualties in the
air raid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, who was deposed
by his right-hand man Abdul Malik in late May, has reportedly
returned to Afghanistan after four months of exile in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Malik, who ousted Dostum in a surprise mutiny in May 19,
briefly sided with the Taliban, allowing them to enter northern
Afghanistan unopposed. However a few days later, in a row over
power sharing, Malik staged another about-face and drove the
student militia out again.
</P>
<P>
In the past four days, fighting has been continuing around
Mazar-e-Sharif between the Taliban and Malik's allied forces for
the control of the city.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Ramos Agree on More Cooperation in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin held talks here today with visiting Philippines
President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on a wide range of issues in
the political, economic, cultural and military technology fields
and pledged to enhance cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, they signed a joint declaration on
cooperation, the official Russian Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the signing ceremony, Yeltsin said,
"Russia should not fix its eyes on Europe and the West only, but
also need to develop relations with Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
The Asian-Pacific region is "extremely important" to Russia not
only because two thirds of the Russian territory is in Asia but
also because Russia hopes to engage itself more in Asian-Pacific
affairs, including those of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and Ramos held identical views on all bilateral
and international issues which they discussed in their talks.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that it is very important for the Philippines to
develop relations with Russia in economy, technology and regional
security.
</P>
<P>
This is because a large portion of the Russian territory is in
Asia and the Russian economy is growing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said Russia's role is important in a new multi-polar
world which has no place for any dominating power.
</P>
<P>
A new world should be based on uniform equality among all
countries, Ramos added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the two countries also signed two
inter-governmental agreements on cooperation today.
</P>
<P>
Ramos arrived here on September 11 for a two-day official visit
to Russia, the first by a head of an ASEAN member country.

<HEADLINE> US Producer Prices Up 0.3 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Prices paid to U.S.
factories and other producers rose by a moderate 0.3 percent in
August, breaking an unprecedented string of seven monthly
declines, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the seasonally adjusted increase in the U.S.
Producer Price Index (PPI) for finished goods, prices paid by
wholesalers, was both the first and worst since a 0.5 percent rise
last December.
</P>
<P>
But even with the increase, the index still was falling at an
annual rate of 2.2 percent this year. It had posted declines
ranging from 0.1 percent to 0.5 percent from January through July,
the most consecutive drops since the government began compiling
the index in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Core prices, which excludes the volatile food and energy
sectors and is considered a better measure of price index in
wholesale level, increased just 0.1 percent in August after a
decline of the same amount in July.
</P>
<P>
The department said the increase of the PPI in August resulted
primarily from a 1.4 percent jump in energy prices and a 0.3
percent rise in foods.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs were led higher by a 5.9 percent jump in gasoline
prices, the largest in 16 months. Fuel oil rose 1.8 percent and
residential natural gas was up 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase of food prices resulted mainly from a 3.3 percent
gain in beef and veal prices and a 17.5 percent jump in fresh and
dry vegetables, the worst in 17 months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) and the U.S. stock market have
been watching the PPI and other price measures closely for signs
that growing economy and low unemployment are pressuring business
to raise their prices faster than before.
</P>
<P>
But so far that hasn't happened. It permitted the U.S. Fed to
hold short-term interest rates steady since late March.

KATHMANDU, September 12 (Xinhua) -- It is the basic position of
the Japanese government to support Nepal's efforts for political
and economic reforms, a Japanese official said.
</P>
<P>
Masahiko Horie, director of Aid Policy Division of the Japanese
Foreign Ministry, made the remarks at the two-day policy
consultation and program designing meeting on economic cooperation
between Japan and Nepal, which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Horie said Japan has recently cut its overseas development
assistance fund by 10 percent, but it will continue its assistance
to Nepal, the official news agency RSS reported today.
</P>
<P>
Japan will also continuously support Nepal's self-reliant
efforts in alleviating poverty as well as in achieving sustainable
economic growth, Horie said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of efforts by Nepal in formulating,
implementing and managing the official development assistance
projects.
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged Nepal's efforts in such sectors as primary
health care, education and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Finance Secretary Ram Binod Bhattarai, who led the
Nepali side at the meeting, said Japan's cooperation is expected
for the successful implementation of Nepal's ninth five-year plan
(1997-2002).

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Urges Hungary to Proceed With Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Javier Solana has called
on Hungary to proceed with its planned referendum in order to
expedite its membership negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
A NATO press release today quoted Solana as saying the
referendum problem should be solved in the near future so that
"finalization of the (negotiation) process may take place before
the end of 1997."
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian parliament decided Tuesday to postpone
indefinitely the referendum on NATO membership, which had been
scheduled for November 16.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, however, NATO and Hungary began membership talks
in the alliance headquarters. In the first session of talks, NATO
explained to Hungarian officials the rights and obligations
resulting from accession to the bloc as well as the need to accept
the principles of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe and U.N. charters.
</P>
<P>
A NATO legal adviser also briefed the Hungarians on the status
of forces agreements, the agreement on the status of international
military headquarters in member countries and the status of staff
and delegations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, which will close late next month, NATO and
Hungarian officials are also expected to discuss military issues
and financial resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NATO is scheduled to start membership talks with
Poland next Tuesday and with the Czech Republic on September 23
respectively. Accession protocols are expected to be signed in
December this year.
</P>
<P>
The membership process will then go through ratification by the
legislative bodies of the three central and eastern European
countries as well as all the NATO member countries next year.
</P>
<P>
The three countries were invited to join the alliance at the
NATO Madrid summit held in early July.
</P>
<P>
The last accession protocol signed at NATO was that of Spain in
1982.

BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) which opened today in Beijing's
Great Hall of the People has become the focus of the Chinese
people's attention and a festival atmosphere has pervaded the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
Tian'anmen Square at the heart of the city has been turned into
a garden overflowing with flowers. A large fountain at the
square's center spurts 15 columns of water into the sky. Two huge
lighted billboards proclaiming "Celebrating 15th CPC National
Congress" and "Celebrating 48th National Day," stand just north
of the Monument to the People's Heroes.
</P>
<P>
As the clock struck nine this morning, more than 100
televisions in the downtown Xidan Department Store aired the live
telecast of the congress's opening ceremony, bringing in a flood
of customers.
</P>
<P>
In his home near the Great Hall, the 85-year-old An Dewang was
listening to Jiang Zemin's opening speech on the radio.
</P>
<P>
"I've experienced the bulk of the three historical changes
taking place within the century," said An, who belongs to the Hui
ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
"The changes are great, and my sons and grandsons are living in
a good time," he noted, adding that he believes the life will
continue to improve.
</P>
<P>
Huang Maozhou, manager of a lamp and lantern store near the
square, was gazing fixedly at the TV screen while at the same time
answering phones.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays in China, you must be aware of the government
policies if you want to do business," said Huang, who hoped that
the Party will work harder still to fight corruption and improve
the legal system.
</P>
<P>
"Business would flourish only when the market activities are
standardized," he said, whose business has expanded rapidly over
the past three years.

In the waiting room at Beijing Railway Station, travelers were
flocked around more than 30 Television sets to watch the opening
of the congress.
</P>
<P>
"What the folks from the northeast care most about is whether
the congress can help the state-owned enterprises to make
profits," said He Shoucai, who lives in the old industrial base of
Shenyang. He came to the station four hours ahead of his departure
time just to watch the telecast of the congress.
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m., a stock trading agency in the East District was
crowded with stock investors heatedly discussing the reform of the
stock system as referred to today by Jiang Zemin in his work
report.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the shares issued by the state-owned enterprises
are promising," said Liu Wei. Calling himself "a professional
stock investor," Liu believed that these factories will be
extricated from their difficulties after the congress.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaolin, a taxi driver, listened to the broadcast while
on the road.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the customers have discussed the Party Congress with
me recently. They care about it," he said, hoping that the policy
of reform and opening-up will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Wang bought a car and joined the taxi business several years
ago when he was laid off. Now he earns 5,000 yuan (600 US dollars)
a month.
</P>
<P>
Yi Baoyun, deputy-director of the Marxism Institute of Beijing
University, expressed his satisfaction with Jiang's report. He said
that "Jiang has called on the country to hold high the great banner
of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and carry forward in an all-round way the
great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to
the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
This fully shows that the third generation of leaders with
Jiang Zemin at the core has the spirit to carry forward the cause
and forge ahead into the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yin said, "after hearing the report, I feel very
encouraged, and am confident in my country's revitalization in the
next century."

Party of China (CPC)."
</P>
<P>
Local residents in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous
Region are celebrating the opening of the 15th CPC Congress today.
</P>
<P>
Inside the Johkang Monastery, lamas are reciting scriptures
eulogizing the big event. One of them told a Xinhua reporter that

the past few days, wishing for the strong leadership of the
Chinese Communist Party, which can bring about further improvement
for the Tibetans' lives.

temple to watch the live broadcast of the opening of the Party
Congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel is to pay a one-day visit to Egypt next Tuesday, the
Turkish Foreign Ministry announced in a written statement today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Demirel will exchange views with his
Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak on bilateral, regional and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Turkey's increasingly close military
cooperation with Israel is expected to be discussed by the two
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Recent media reports about the Israeli-Turkish-U.S. joint
naval war games, scheduled for November in the eastern
Mediterranean, triggered strong criticism from Egypt and other
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Demirel called off a planned visit to Egypt in May due to
alleged technical reasons. At that time, Turkey was accused by
some Arab nations, including Egypt, of violating Iraq's
sovereignty when launching a massive cross-border military strike
against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in northern
Iraq.

CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak will meet U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
Saturday in Alexandria, a port city overlooking the Mediterranean
Sea, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will deal with all issues relating to the Middle
East peace process, the agency quoted Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit to the region came at a time when violence is
escalating and the Palestinians are suffering from Israeli
intensified pressures, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
All this called for a U.S. effective intervention and
cooperation among all parties concerned, he added.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to hold talks with Moussa to discuss the
ways of reviving the peace process before her meeting with
Mubarak.
</P>

The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations came to a halt
since Israel began construction of a controversial Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will be the fourth leg of Albright's Middle East tour
that has taken her to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas and
will take her to Syria later today.

this selection after giving it repeated thought," Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's cabinet reshuffle, Sato was appointed as chief of
the Management and Coordination Agency, which is responsible for
administrative reform. This nomination received strong criticism
from opposition parties and LDP's non-cabinet allies.

<P>
Shigeru Lto, secretary-general of the SDP, told a party meeting
today that the public will lose its trust in administrative reform
because of Sato's appointment.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets with United Nations FAO Official  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The current food and
agricultural situation in the world, and China's cooperation with
the United Nations on these issues were the themes of talks
between Chinese Premier Li Peng and Dr. Jacques Diouf,
director-general of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) here today.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the
central government, Premier Li said that the global food and
agricultural situation has been greatly improved in recent
years. However, he added, the situation still remains grim as long
as 800 million people in the world are starving or malnourished.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the World Food Summit, held by FAO last November,
adopted a Rome declaration on world food security and a plan of
action, saying that this has been of great importance for
increasing the international community's concern and support for
the food issue, promoting international cooperation in the food
and agricultural field, and raising world food production.
</P>
<P>
The premier briefed Dr. Diouf on the food and agriculture
issues in China. He said that since China is a huge agricultural
country, a stable agricultural sector plays a vital role in the
country's economic growth and social stability.
</P>
<P>
He said China will rely on three things to develop its
agriculture: good policy, science and technology, and input, and
that China will modernize its agriculture in the future. "China's
agriculture has a bright future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China supports 22 percent of the world population
with just seven percent of the arable land in the world, he
stressed that China has made the greatest contribution to global
food security.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people are not only able to be self-sufficient,
but are also an important force to secure world food security," he
said.

development of its agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Diouf warmly congratulated the 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
China's great achievements in obtaining a secure food situation
have drawn worldwide attention, he said, adding that the country's
experience is worth learning from for other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese people have not only been
self-supporting, but also provided food-related aid to other
developing countries and contributed to food security in the world.
</P>
<P>
He recalled with delight his meeting with Li in Rome last
November. He also thanked the Chinese Government for its support
for FAO.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Diouf and his party arrived here for a visit to China at
the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Australia Supports Ban on Commercial Whaling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Environment
Minister Robert Hill today said Australia would oppose efforts by
Japan and Norway to encourage a resumption of whaling.
</P>
<P>
"We seek to put to them (Japan) the argument that one of the
most powerful economies on earth now doesn't really need to
continue whaling for scientific or any other purpose," Hill told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are very strongly of the view that commercial whaling is
now internationally unnecessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when commenting on the National Task Force
report on whaling, which was published ahead of the annual meeting
of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) scheduled from
October 20-24 in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to protect the decreasing whale population, the
international community have been pushing for a ban on whaling,
while a few countries such as Japan want to resume whaling "for
scientific purpose".
</P>
<P>
The report recommends, among other things, efforts to push for
a global whale sanctuary and a permanent international ban on
commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government also supported the report's
recommendation to use existing bodies, particularly the IWC, to
develop a global sanctuary, the minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- France today hailed the gesture
for peace made by Leah Rabin, the widow of former Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Leah Rabin and Arafat jointly signed a communique expressing
the will for peace during a ceremony Thursday in the Palestinian
autonomous city of Ramallah in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was organized to mark the fourth anniversary of
the Oslo peace agreements between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
"We have the greatest respect for the fight for peace of Madam
Rabin," French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said.
</P>
<P>
"It is touching that this high figure has chosen to appeal with
Yasser Arafat, the two peoples to pursue the road of peace."
</P>
<P>
The Oslo peace agreements, under which Israel and the PLO
recognized each other, were signed by Yitzhak Rabin and Arafat at
the White House on September 14, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli extreme right wing
activist in November 1995 in Tel Aviv. His widow, Leah Rabin, has
since served as a moral pillar for the Israeli left wing Labor

CANBERRA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
finished steady against the U.S. dollar as market consolidated
after volatility Thursday.

<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 72.18 U.S. cents, almost level
with Thursday's close of 72.17, after trading in a range of 71.95

</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar had seen a very quiet day's trading
after the volatility of the market yesterday," said Macquarie

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 12 (Xinhua) -- the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea today handed over the remains of a U.S. soldier killed in the
1950-53 Korean War through the truce village Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
The remains were recovered less than one kilometers from the
Unsan village in North Pyongan Province by a joint U.S.-DPRK team.
</P>
<P>
Unsan was the scene of fierce fighting between Chinese
Volunteers' forces and the U.S. Army's 8th Cavalry in the fall of
1950, a spokesman of the U.S. Army Forces in Seoul said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, in a search at a different site, four sets of
remains were found. They are undergoing forensic analysis at the
U.S. Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
The United States and DPRK have agreed to excavate the remains
of U.S. soldiers on three occasions this year. DPRK delivered the
remains of 210 U.S. soldiers to the United States between 1990 and
1996.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Raps Israeli Settlement Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian parliamentary
body at the International Parliamentary Union (IPU) today
strongly criticized the Israeli settlement policies in the
occupied Arab territories, particularly in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This criticism was made by Kamal el-Shazli, Egyptian Minister
of State for Parliamentary and Shura Council, in his statement at
today's meeting of the IPU 98th session, which opened here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shazli underlined the necessity of ending these settlement
activities which had led to the stalling of the peace process
along the Palestinian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. General Assembly had called for the immediate
and complete cessation of Israeli settlements. Instead, he said,
Israel chose to challenge the will of the international community
by beginning the construction of a new settlement at Har Homa in
East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Israeli settlement policies, he added, were not restricted to
East Jerusalem, but covered other occupied Arab territories,
including the Syrian Golan Heighs.
</P>
<P>
Shazli reiterated that the acts of aggression on the part of
Israel cannot be tolerated by such justifications as security or
combat of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Violence," he said, "will only beget violence, besides the
fact that the Palestinian leadership has expressed complete
readiness to security coordination with Israel."
</P>
<P>
The IPU is holding its 98th session in Cairo to discuss issues
related to security and cooperation in the Mediterranean region,
peace in the Middle East and other affairs.

officials to exchange views on development in emerging economies,

World: Capital, Competitiveness and Community.
</P>
<P>
Starting from September 20, the four-day program of seminars
will present a wide range of perspectives in areas such as finance
and capital markets, infrastructure development, regional and
country opportunities and sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
A special seminar on "Asia and the IMF" will be held on
September 19, focusing on themes relevant to the region's economic
performance and outlook, as well as the macroeconomic surveillance
role the IMF has played.
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the Annual Meetings, the World Bank has released a
number of reports, including Poverty in Asia, Finance in Asia, and
Global Economic Prospects. Tim Cullen, senior advisor of the World
Bank, said that more will come out, including reports on
infrastructure development, South Asia, and China. IMF will

17.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Philippine Economy Slides Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
scaled down its gross national product (GNP) growth target for the
year to above 5.6 percent amid prolonged volatility in Southeast
Asian currency markets.
</P>
<P>
Economic Development Secretary Cielito Habito said the
adjustment was made after his office computed how much the
financial turmoil had adversely affected the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Amid the currency woes sweeping the region, the peso has fallen
by 22 percent in the past two months, fluctuating around one U.S.
dollar to 32.3 pesos at present. The local stock market was also
trapped in the turmoil, breaking the record low of 2,000 points
late last month.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the new GNP growth target was down from the target
of 7-8 percent the government set earlier, but he added that the
country does not have to downscale its domestic growth as
dramatically as Thailand, whose gross domestic product (GDP) is
expected to grow between 1 and 2 percent only.
</P>
<P>
GDP is the sum of goods and services produced in a country
while GNP is the country's total value of goods and services and
foreign income.
</P>
<P>
Although the government said the Philippines' economic
fundamentals were sound, economists believed that the economic
situation could get worse, taking into account the weakening of
the peso and the harm of high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the economy has already signaled
a slowdown for the whole year. The GNP and GDP grew 5.9 percent
and 5.3 percent respectively, down from 7.5 percent and 5.7
percent in the same period last year. Poor industrial and
agricultural growth and a sharp decline in overseas workers'
remittance were attributed to the poor economic performance.
</P>
<P>
It was at this time that the financial turbulence spilled over
to the country from Thailand. Economists were convinced that the
unrest would accelerate the slowdown of the Philippine economy.
</P>
<P>
To stabilize the peso, the Central Bank sold U.S. dollars and
hiked banks' liquidity reserve rate among other measures. However,
the efforts did not arrest the peso from falling. Instead, it
triggered a crisis of confidence. Foreign investors pulled their
funds out of the country amid fears that economic growth and
political situation are becoming unstable in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The situation worsened as President Fidel Ramos failed to
clarify that he would not seek a second term. The businessmen
community had complained that Ramos has talked too much about
changing the charter to extend his term rather than focusing on
developing the economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, interest rates in the country soared to five-year
highs. The benchmark 91-day Treasury bill rate and banks' prime
lending rates reached 19 percent and 30 percent respectively
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The monetary authorities later stopped intervening in the
foreign exchange trading and reduced the liquidity reserve rate
from 8 to 6 percent, but the economy had already felt the pinch.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates made it harder for companies to get the
cash they needed to do business or to expand production.
Economists believed that the manufacturing industry, which has
already been in recession, was afflicted the most by the high
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The weakening of peso also pushed up the prices of basic goods
and oil products and power rates, eroding consumers' spending
power while making the country's foreign debt bigger. All these
factors may spell a disaster for the economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the agricultural sector, which accounts for 20
percent of the GDP, would not garner a bumper harvest as it did
last year. The sector grew by 4 percent in 1996 after bad weather
sent its growth to almost zero level at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, economists predicted that the Philippine economy
would slide further in the second half of the year. They estimated
that the country's GDP would grow by 5 percent this year, lower
than the 5.5 percent registered last year and the 6.3 to 7 percent
planned by the government.
</P>
<P>
To revive the economic growth, the government has outlined
urgent measures to cut down cost of production, minimize price
hikes of consumer goods, enhance the efficiency of key economic
sectors such as agriculture, power and finance, and improve the
government's revenue base.
</P>
<P>
But economists still believed that the economy would remain
weak until 1998, even the first half of 1999, as the financial
unrest in the region would continue for three to six months.

<HEADLINE> France Says It Does Not Want Cold Relations With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- France does not want a "cold"
relationship with Israel, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said just
one day after Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine made an
unprecedented attack on the Israeli policy toward the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no coldness between France and Israel. Nothing
should harm the traditional friendship and cooperation that France
has with Israel," said the spokesman, Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said it is out of friendship that France expresses its
worries about the situation in the Middle East, adding that "to
talk about these things should not be considered negative."
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt said, "the degradation of the peace process should
not justify the least tolerance or indulgence in respect of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said Thursday at a Socialist Party conference that the
policy of the Israeli government toward the Palestinians is
"catastrophic" as it has driven Palestinians "to the level of
exasperation and despair without precedent."
</P>
<P>
The accusation was rejected by both Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister David Levy, who blamed
Vedrine for mentioning nothing about the terrorism that has struck
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Future Visists Depend on Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright said today that she would return to
the region only if both Israeli and Palestinian leaders
"have made hard decisions" to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks in the West Bank city of Ramallah
after her second meeting with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat. Both leaders described today's meeting
as "good" and "constructive," but they still fell short of
announcing any major breakthrough in resuming the stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright admitted that she was unable to make great progress
toward a resumption of the peace talks between the Israelis and
Palestinians. "I will not come back to tread the water," she said
at a press conference after the meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The only concrete result was Albright's announcement that
senior aides to Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu would travel to Washington late this month to continue
talks on advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
This announcement appeared to be aimed at avoiding the
impression that Albright's first visit here has been a total
failure, an assessment that could threaten to increase the
tensions between Israel and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Albright and Arafat held their first meeting Thursday to
discuss ways of breaking the prolonged deadlock in the peace
process caused by Israel's building of the Har Homa settlement
and aggravated by the recent wave of suicide bombings in
Jerusalem launched by the Palestinian militant group the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas).
</P>
<P>
Israel has conditioned the resumption of the peace process on
the PNA's actions to launch an all-out war against Islamic
militant groups and their infrastructure. The PNA, for its part,
demanded Israel lift the total closure of its territories,
releasing the frozen funds and other sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In a direct public appeal to the Palestinians broadcasted by
the Voice of Palestine today, Albright urged the PNA to crack
down on Hamas and another militant anti-Israeli group the
Islamic Jihad. She also called for the Palestinian public
support in the fight against terrorism, because "the average
Palestinian has no greater enemy than Islamic Jihad and Hamas."
</P>
<P>
"That is why fighting terrorism is the responsibility of both
the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, and that
is why all must understand that the battle against terrorism is
in the interests of the Arabs, Palestinians and Israelis," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is striving to narrow the huge gap between the
parties, has already held two rounds of talks with Netanyahu in
the first two days of her three-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
So far there was no sign that she has made any major progress
in getting the peace process back on track. She said there was
still a long way to go to rebuild the mutual trust and
confidence in order to revive and advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has been critical of Albright's
one-sided attitude even since the beginning of her mission
here. In an arriving statement made after meeting with Israeli
President Ezer Weizman Wednesday, she stressed the U.S.
unequivocal support to Israel's insistence on the PNA's promise
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Only in a speech at an Israeli school Thursday evening,
Albright criticized Israel for taking unilateral steps to
preempt the final-status talks with Palestine, including building
settlements, confiscating Palestinian land and demolishing
Palestinian houses.
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism, Israeli officials did not interpret
it as Albright's presure on Israel to lift its demands on the
Israel to stop the sanctions and freeze the settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
Late today, Albright is to travel to Syria at the second leg
of her first Middle East trip which will also take her to Egypt,
Jordan and Saudi Arabia. In Damascus, she is to explore with
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad ways to resume the suspended peace
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel's TV reported that she would carry a written message
from Israeli officials, but gave no details.

FREEOTWN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has appointed Ugandan diplomat Francis Okelo as special
envoy to Sierra Leone to monitor development in the country, U.N.
officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
No date for the arrival of Okelo has been set. The United
Nations diplomat is currently deputy head of the U.N. special
mission to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He replaces Humaru Dimko who was U.N. envoy to Sierra Leone
and supervises the Abidjan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military government said today it has lodged a
strong protest to ECOWAS over the bombing on Thursday afternoon
by a Nigerian Alpha jet of a state-owned petroleum vessel in a
jetty in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Shrapnels from the three bombs killed Chief Engineer Leonard
Martin and Supervisor Edward Gibbs who were repairing the vessel
which has been out of service for the past six months. Two other
workers were critically injured.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Alieu Kamara told xinhua, ''this is the
latest example of Nigerian terrorism in Sierra Leone. the
international community should react to halt the barbarism.''
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has
authorized the Nigerian-led west African peace-keeping force to
impose sanctions against Sierra Leone to compel the military
junta which toppled the civilian government on May 25 to give up
and return the rule to the legitimate regime.

<HEADLINE> Australia To Hold Constitutional Convention In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Australians will decide
whether Australia should become a republic during a two-week
constitutional convention in February.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard told reporters in Sydney today the
convention would be held at the old parliament house in Canberra
on February 2-6 and February 9-13, Australian Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 152 delegates at the convention will decide if the
Australian constitution should be changed to create a republic,
which model would be the best, and a timetable for change.
</P>
<P>
Half of the delegates are to be elected while the another half
appointed.
</P>
<P>
A formal notice for the election of the 76 elective convention
delegates by non-compulsory secret postal ballot will be issued on
September 29 with nominations closing on October 8 and ballot
papers distributed between November 3 and 14.
</P>
<P>
The poll will close on December 9, according to a timetable
released today by the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll published early this week showed that a little
more than 50 percent among Australians support a republic,
however, the prime minister said he believed there would still be
many issues to resolve before the change could happen.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a long way to go and certain issues to
resolve, but at the end of the day the people will determine this
and not on opinion polls," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They will determine it through their election of delegates,
through the attitudes taken at the convention and ultimately
through a vote, he added.

<HEADLINE> Scots Strongly Favor U.K. Devolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Scotland, backed by an
overwhelming majority of its voters, is to have its own parliament
for the first time in nearly 300 years.
</P>
<P>
Official ballot results released early today showed that 74.3
percent of Scottish voters support home rule, a figure that far
exceeded expectations of pro-devolution campaigners.
</P>
<P>
Voters in only two councils opposed giving the legislative
assembly, which will control a 14-billion-pound (22.4 billion
U.S. dollars) budget, powers to decide on taxation.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's vote is seen as the climax of a century-long
campaign for home rule and is expected to be the most far-reaching
change in Scotland's relations with the rest of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Legislation establishing the Scottish parliament still has yet
to go through the U.K. parliament next year.
</P>
<P>
But the decisive vote means that elections for a 129-member
parliament, under a system of proportional representation, will
take place in 1998 and it will get down to work the following year.
</P>
<P>
The proposals for a Scottish parliament and a less powerful
assembly in Wales are central to the British Labor government's
plans for reform of the U.K. constitution.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after hearing the early result, Prime Minister
Tony Blair said he was "absolutely delighted that the Scottish
people have backed our plans."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Refuses to Scrap Trade Pacts with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has
strongly defended the string of trade arrangements with its
neighbors, saying these accords will remain until an effective
multilateral deal is in place in the region.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Mfundo Nkuhlu, Director of African
Trade Relations at the Ministry of Trade and Industry, local
media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Scrapping existing pacts before a multinational dealis in
place is meant to ask South Africa's neighbors to give up a bird
in hand for one in the bush, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, signed during the apartheid years, came under
fire recently when Kaire Mbuende, Executive Secretary of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), urged the body's
members to scrap them as they perpetuated inequities.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende's call marked a shift in the SADC's official line
which has so far tolerated the deals.
</P>
<P>
It came amid internal criticism in South Africa of
government's bid to negotiate a preferential trade deal with its
partners in the Southern African Customs Union on the one hand,
and Zambia on the other.
</P>
<P>
The union was formed during apartheid era and all of its
members are now belonging to the SADC.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, which admitted two new members -- Seychelles and the
Democratic Republic of Congo this week, is planning to free all
trade exchanges by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Nkuhlu said if the SADC free trade protocol is comprehensive
enough by 2004, there will be no need for bilateral agreements.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, talks to grant improved market
access for Zimbabwean farm and certain manufacturing items are
under way. The clothing and textile preferential access
arrangement with Harare is being implemented.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and customs union signatories Botswana, Lesotho,
Namibia and Swaziland, will soon hold talks with Zambia to
respond to the latter's request for concessionary market access
on a range of products, Nkuhlu said.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria will offer its SADC partners duty-free access within
five years, according to Nkuhlu.
</P>
<P>
But he said South Africa's customs union partners, who share
the same external tariffs systems, will be allowed to seek
reciprocity from other SADC partners.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement will benefit South Africa's relatively weaker
partners in the union, who could then guarantee potential
investors duty-free access to the rest of the SADC.

<HEADLINE> India Wanted to Test Hydrogen Bomb in 1970s: Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian nuclear scientists
wanted to test a hydrogen bomb shortly after they exploded a
plutonium device in 1974 but were stopped by the government, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Padmanabha Krishnagopala Iyengar, former
chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission and one of the
prominent scientists involved in the design of the country's first
nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
"There was so much euphoria after the first successful nuclear
test, it would have been the best time for testing the hydrogen
device," Iyengar told newsmen here in an informal chat early this
week at the conference on "The Role of Nuclear Energy in
Sustainable Development", the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Some government advisers warned the then prime minister, Indira
Gandhi, of adverse international reactions. One of them said that
Air India would not be able to fly its planes because it would be
denied spare parts, the PTI quoted Iyengar as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Iyengar, the hydrogen test could have pushed India
closer to being declared a weapon power instead of being placed in
the current situation where it is neither here nor there.

<HEADLINE> Idea of Housing prisoners in Ships Being </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
Correctional Service Department has put the idea of mine shaft
jails on hold, but is still keen on introducing prison ships,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The idea of using disused mine shafts for the country's most
dangerous prisoners has been shelved for the time being because
the investigation takes too long, Minister of the Correctional
Service Department Sipo Mzimela was quoted as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Referring to prison ships which has been proved highly
successful in the United States and Britain, Mzimela said the
investigation of prison ships is still at the preliminary stage.
</P>
<P>
Correctional Service Department sources said that if private
enterprise can house prisoners in ships at cost that compared
with the Prisons Departemnt's 70 Rand (14 U.S. Dollars) a day a
prisoner, prison ships will be considered.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela held taht prison ships can be anchored in small
harbors off South Africa's eastern coastline.
</P>
<P>
"On the Indian ocean side, there are lots of sharks. They will
serve as our front line defense against escapes, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to corruption among prision officials, the number of
prison escapes in South Africa remained fairly constant at about
100 a month for a number of years. A campaign is under way to cut
by at least 50 percent with a year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, facing high level of violent crimes, has been
troubled with rapid growing prison population. Compared with
125,000 prisoners at the end of December last year, the prison
population is more than 135,000 at present, Mzimela said.

<HEADLINE> Port Of Entry On Sino-Russian Border Becomes National Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Reform measures have improved
the inefficiency of the Dongning Port of Entry on the Sino-Russian
border and have even made it a national model.
</P>
<P>
It used to be plagued by bad management, but it managed to turn
itself around so well that it was called a "civilized advanced
port of entry" by central government authorities recently, and
handled a record 130,000 tons of cargo and 70,000 passengers in
the January-August period.
</P>
<P>
Because of bad management it previously suffered from slow
business and poor customs declaration and processing methods, but
with new practices, vehicles leaving China can be checked in
warehouses before passing through the port. And vehicles entering
China can pass the outlet first before going to warehouses for
inspection.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate fruit and vegetable exports, a unified
examination has been designed for the warehouses, helping reduce
waiting time and avoiding spoilage.
</P>
<P>
The use of computers has also helped eliminate paper work and
improve efficiency. The port has also introduced 24-hour service
to cater to the clients' needs.

<HEADLINE> River Quality in Malaysia Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The river quality in
Malaysia deteriorated last year due to soil erosion and organic
pollutant from partially treated sewage and animal wastes,
according to the 1996 Environmental Quality Report released today.
</P>
<P>
During the year, 57 major rivers in the country were found to
be heavily polluted by suspended solids from earthworks and land
clearing, of which 38 had deteriorated, the report released by the
Department of Environment (DOE) said.
</P>
<P>
The DOE report said that other sources of river pollution were
agro-based, manufacturing, livestock farming and domestic waste
and added 15 river catchments were heavily polluted from these
sources, with eight of them having deteriorated further than
previous years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 34 percent of organic loading into the river were
contributed by livestock farming and domestic waste and the number
of river catchments which were highly polluted by these sources
were 38, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the marine environmental quality in
the country last year improved compared to 1995.
</P>
<P>
It said that as in previous years, the main contaminants of the
coastal waters in all states of the country were oil and grease,
total suspended solids (TSS) and "Escherichia coli".
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 597 samples were collected from 202
marine monitoring stations, compared to 557 samples from 186
monitoring stations in 1995, the report said, adding that almost
72 percent of the total number of monitoring stations were
polluted by oil and grease, 54 percent by TSS and 30 percent by
Escherichia coli.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Department also established the
Ground water Monitoring Reporting Network in peninsular Malaysia
last year to evaluate the status and extent of ground water
contamination throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The network is also aimed at identifying sites with high risk
of ground water contamination caused by human activities and
designing a network of monitoring wells.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the DOE places great priority on
complaints received from the public, through the mass-media, from
relevant agencies, non-governmental bodies as well as individuals
on pollution.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 3,177 complaints were received by the DOE where 75
percent or 2,382 were complaints on air pollution, 347 or 11
percent on water.
</P>
<P>
In respect of water pollution complaints, analysis showed that
non-industrial sources, palm oil mills, feed mills, food and
beverage industries and sewage were major contributors to water
pollution, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that from 256 cases prosecuted last year under the
Environmental Quality Act (EQA) passed in 1974, 1.18 million
ringgit (about 0.4 million U.S. dollars) was collected as fines,
an increase of 132 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the DOE is considering setting up a
multipurpose airborne surveillance program to monitor the
pollution of air, water and marine.
</P>
<P>
The existing joint airborne surveillance program between the
DOE and the Police Air Wing had shown success in providing useful
and speedy surveillance information on activities violating the
EQA.
</P>
<P>
The report said airborne surveillance on pollution activities
were carried out in the states of Selangor, Negeri Sembilan,
Melaka, Johor, Pahang and in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur to
detect excessive smoke emission from industries, open burning such
as at dumping grounds and forest fires.
</P>
<P>
The report said the aerial surveillance helped to strengthen
ground enforcement on open burning and stack emissions from
industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of agriculture and
forestry from nine ASEAN nations signed here today a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) on the conservation and protection of sea
turtles.
</P>
<P>
The document is aimed at indicating ASEAN's concern on this
environment-related issue and expressing its "firm stand and
integrated effort to protect and conserve sea turtles vis-a-vis
its endeavors to expand the region's shrimp export to the global
market," a press release of the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
The MOU was signed at the end of the two-day 19th meeting of
the ministers of agriculture and forestry of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
In the light of the current global challenges to make the
agriculture and forestry sectors more competitive while
maintaining the sustainability of the region's natural resources,
the ministers agreed to strengthen future regional cooperation in
food, agriculture and forestry in line with the ASEAN vision for
the next century.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the ministers approved the establishment of
an ASEAN shrimp industry task force to draw up a regional policy
aimed at maximizing shrimp production at the lowest costs and in
the most environmentally-friendly manner.
</P>
<P>
The meeting endorsed a "manual on good shrimp farm management
practices" for distribution among ASEAN nations.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to increase cooperation on the
establishment of information networks and development of regional
strategy and policy options on environment and conservation issues
related to trade in agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed some other issues such as animal
vaccines, promotion and falling prices of natural rubber and
reduction of pesticide use.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Accuses S. Africa of Meddling Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The one-party Swaziland
parliament has bitterly blamed South African President Nelson
Mandela for allegedly "meddling in Swaziland's internal affairs".
</P>
<P>
The attack on Mandela by angry parliament members in both the
House of Assembly and the Senate Thursday night was in support of
King Mswati III, who rejected Mandela's accusations in his speech
made at the summit of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) held in Blantyre, Malawi on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, chairman of the regional body, at the summit called
on countries in the region to promote democratic process.
</P>
<P>
The king said on his return from the summit that the SADC is
being mis-informed by certain organisations in his country that
want to impose their own brand of democracy on the Swazi people.
</P>
<P>
Leading Thursday's attack on Mandela, staunch traditionalist
parliament member Mgabhi Dlamini said, the South African
President appeared to have "undeclared interest in Swaziland".
</P>
<P>
Mandela "should not think that Swaziland was part of South
Africa", Dlamini claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela's attack on traditionalist leaders who "deny
real democracy to their countries", widely interpreted to be a
reference to Swaziland's authoritarian monarchy, were also
praised in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Joshua Mzizi, secretary of the Human Rights Association based
in Mbabane, praised Mandela's criticism of restrictive
traditional political system.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had shown that the SADC did not consist only of
"buddies", he said, but "serious leaders whose vision is the
vision for all humanity".

<HEADLINE> Former Seoul Mayor Facing Hard Work in Pursuing Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Nominated Thursday as candidate
of the small opposition Democratic Party (DP), former Seoul Mayor
Cho Soon joined the presidential race with many difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The first task facing Cho, now as the DP's president, seems to
be to inject fresh life into the party which has been sidelined
from the center of the country's political stage, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Cho is planning to reshape the party and bring
political outsiders in to support him, party sources said.
</P>
<P>
The latest opinion poll put Cho behind Kim Dae-jung of the main
opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and Lee
Hoi-chang of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP).
</P>
<P>
Aware of his disadvantage, Cho said he would join hands with
other political groups opposing the two leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
There has been media reports that Cho may seek an alliance with
the NKP's Rhee In-je, who resigned from Governor of Kyonggi
Province Monday and is considering running in the election.
</P>
<P>
However, the expected negotiations between Cho and Rhee over
one ticket may face the problem that neither will give up their
presidential ambitions, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Along with his efforts to join hands with certain political
groups, Cho is expected to go all-out to recruit prominent figures
from various walks of life to reinforce the party.
</P>
<P>
Aides to Cho said he has already received promises from some
100 people, including scholars and lawyers, to join the party.
</P>
<P>
Another task facing Cho is to unite his own party members.
</P>
<P>
Cho is planning a major reshuffle of top party officeholders to
facilitate the admission of the Council for National Unification
(CNU) into his party.
</P>
<P>
He is reportedly considering allocating some key posts to CNU
members, who left the party after feuding with former DP leader
Lee Ki-taek last year but support Cho's presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
But observers say such efforts will be rewarded only when
followers of Lee Ki-taek support Cho.
</P>
<P>
Cho's aides remain concerned that the faction led by Lee
Ki-taek may challenge the candidate as they fear losing their
posts in the party's new line-up.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls for More Sanctions on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain called for wider
sanctions on Nigeria Thursday at the opening of the Commonwealth
Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) in London, local media reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Britain appealed to the eight-member CMAG to
continue Nigeria's suspension from the the 53-nation group, but
stopped short of asking for its expulsion, as is the speculation
by some people.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is now sanctioned by Britain, the European Union,
Canada and Jamaica for the annulment of the June 12, 1993
election. It was suspended from the commonwealth in late 1995 for
executing author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists.
</P>
<P>
Britain Thursday voiced its anger that a significant number of
Commonwealth countries primarily from Africa have failed to adopt
stringent measures against Nigeria, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day CMAG meeting will make a recommendation to the
summit of Commonwealth leaders in Edinburgh, Scotland, in
October.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that continued suspension is the most likely
choice for the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
The same fate is likely to fall to Sierra Leone, which was
suspended from the Commonwealth following the May 25 coup that
overthrew elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

network and power plants with a combined generating capacity of
80,000 kw.
</P>

figure, just before the prefecture was founded.

<P>
-- For a second time in a month, the Minister of National
Education Claude Allegre provoked protest from the unions by
criticizing the condition of continued education for teachers.
Allegre, who wants to carry out in-depth reform of the education
system by placing the children at the center of the enterprise, has
asked education departments to work with ``zero fault''.
</P>
<P>
-- While the United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
continued her tour in the Middle East, French Foreign Minister

for the total impasse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The policy of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to regularize
paperless immigrants has so far drawn 90,000 applications for

regularizations originally prepared by the Socialist government.
</P>
<P>

Princess Diana, is improving slowly, he still cannot speak. He can
communicate only by fluttering his eyelashes. Doctors have also
warned police that this last witness of the accident could suffer

<HEADLINE> Reform Proposals in Kenya Praised by Opposition Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- "History is Made" and
"History in the Making" are the front page titles of today's
Kenya Time and East African Standard in praise of the
just-adopted wide-ranging reform proposals.
</P>
<P>
The proposals made by three technical committees were
unanimously adopted here Thursday at the third plenary session of
the Inter-Party Parliamentary Group (IPPG).
</P>
<P>
The IPPG resolved that the proposed changes in the
Constitution, legal and administrative reforms, the Electoral
Code and peace and security should be immediately translated into
Bills and brought to Parliament for enactment.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, 132 Members of Parliament from the ruling
Kenya African National Union (KANU) and Opposition agreed to
amend or repeal 12 colonial-era laws within a month.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that President Daniel arap Moi should appoint
10 more commissioners to the Electoral Commission to make it
"independent and impartial".
</P>
<P>
Before the plenary session, Moi said the IPPG had reached a
consensus in the true African style and spirit when he met the
IPPG Co-ordinated Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that if all Kenyans put the wider interests of
their country first, then all institutions will function
effectively.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the proposed changes, Vice-President George
Saitoti said IPPG proposals are the greatest achievement made by
the Seventh Parliament.
</P>
<P>
When the history of the country will finally be written, the
IPPG initiative and the efforts of the three technical committees
will be recognized, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Biwott, who is believed to be a hardliner on
constitutional reforms, said in a statement that the IPPG
meetings between the KANU and opposition parties are an
indication that Kenyans can solve teething constitutional
problems in an atmosphere of peace and justice.
</P>
<P>
Michael Wamalwa, leader of the official opposition in
parliament, described the reform talks as "historic", saying that
the IPPG had helped "to write Kenya's history in golden letters".
</P>
<P>
Speaker Francis Ole Kaparo noted at the meeting that yesterday
is the happiest day of his life as his dream of bringing
Opposition and the ruling KANU MPs into talks had been realized.
</P>
<P>
The excited Speaker noted that he felt his mission to bring
both sides of the house together had ultimately succeeded
following the outcome of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes are also praised by opposition leaders
such as Mwai Kibaki, Chairman of Democratic Party, and Martin
Shikuku, Ford-Asili Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki pointed out that the MPs being present at the meeting
confounded sceptics by the success they had achieved, adding that
the success is the first step towards the formulation of a good
constitution for the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition Ford-Asili Chairman Kenneth Matiba
dismissed IPPG recommendations Thursday night, saying that its
views can not represent the majority of Kenyan people.

JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The South African
cabinet should be in a position to take decisions on the proposed
armaments package deals by early next year, local daily The

<P>
Several countries are "queuing up" with proposals to suppy

The packages being looked at are not simply the acquisition of
arms, but involved favorable counter-trade,long-term-low-interest
loans, investments, joint manufacturing projects, technology
exchange and other partnership proposals, Kasril said.
</P>
<P>
Urgent negotiations with various countries are well under way
and South Africa can not afford to drag its feet, he said, adding
that his country has to show its seriousnes to potential
partners, or they may lose interest.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Warns S. Leone Junta Against Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG Thursday warned Sierra Leone's military
junta not to launch new attacks or to face the consequences of
its action.
</P>
<P>
The warning came after new attacks on ECOMOG positions by the
junta, the Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Anti-aircraft troops the junta deployed at the port opened
fire at an ECOMOG jet fighter, which junta spokesman Aliu Kamara
said dropped a bomb and killed two persons.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denied that the junta had launched aggression on
ECOMOG troops based in the capital Freetown, adding that "We are
firing at them heavily for them to know that we are alert. We are
not going to take chance at all."
</P>
<P>
"As a responsible government, we have to establish ourselves,
let these people understand that this is our territorial
integrity. We are a sovereign state," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman described the regular petrols of ECOMOG planes
to enforce economic embargo as actions "to intimidate our people,
to provoke us, making life uneasy for our people".
</P>
<P>
However, in a strongly worded statement, ECOMOG force
Commander Major-General Victor Malu warned the junta that
aircraft under his command would return fire if attack breaks out
over Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the junta has deployed anti-aircraft guns in
civilian populated areas, Malu advised the civilians to "move out
of the areas if the junta fails to remove the weapons from their
midst".
</P>
<P>
Malu also expressed concern that the junta had virtually
turned the Freetown seaport into a military base, using the port
facilities as weapons and ammunition storage.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the junta accused of ECOMOG planes
bombing the port in Freetown since ECOMOG announced that it would
attack any violators of the embargo a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was approved by west African leaders at a summit
last month to try to force the junta, which seized power in a
coup in May, to step down.

him on economic prospects in the region, including the latest

bond.

<HEADLINE> HK Press Publish Commentaries Hailing Opening of CPC Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A host of Hong Kong
newspapers published commentaries today hailing the opening of the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Entitled "An Important Meeting Convened at An Important Time",
a commentary carried by Wen Wei Po said that the meeting has the
significance of inheriting the past and ushering in the future,
carrying the cause forward and forging ahead into the future.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will hold high the banner of the late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, review the history of the Chinese people's
struggles in the past century and look forward to China's
development in the first half of next century, and work out
overall arrangements for the cross-century construction and
development of China, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the congress will elect the new central leading
bodies to lead the nation into the 21st century, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that the five years closely following the
14th CPC congress were the five years which saw the most rapid
increase in China's comprehensive national power, the most stable
society and the most obvious improvement in people's livelihood in
this century.
</P>
<P>
The tremendous achievements scored during the five years
demonstrated that major decisions made at the 14th congress were
correct and that the third generation of CPC's leadership with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin at its core was leading effectively
the Chinese people in their striding forward along the path of
building Socialism with Chinese characteristics, the commentary
continued.
</P>
<P>
The five years following the current congress are of critical
importance to China's cross-century development. Within the five
years, centering on the economic construction, the economic
structure reforms, political structure reforms and the
ideological and ethical construction will be further promoted,
laying sound foundation for realizing the objectives set for the
end of the century and the long-term objectives set for the year
2010, the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
A commentary published by Hong Kong Commercial Daily said that,
With Hong Kong's return to its motherland, Hong Kong people are
paying closer than ever attention to the 15th CPC congress, which
concerns the nation's future and destiny.
</P>
<P>
People can believe that the congress will be a new landmark in
China's modernization drive and that the CPC is capable of leading
the people to build a better China, it said.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao's commentary noted that the congress is the first
major issue in the Chinese people's political life following Hong
Kong's handover on July 1, and of course it attracts great
attention from Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a recent poll of Hong Kong residents as saying that
Hong Kong people have cast a vote of confidence toward the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, around 65 percent of the respondents
said the meeting is important to Hong Kong's development, close to
60 percent expected politics to be more open in the inland areas
after the meeting while close to 70 percent people predicted a
better economic development in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Other major Chinese newspapers such as Ming Pao Daily News,
Sing Tao Daily and Express News also published commentaries on the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
News about the congress has recently been the focus of the
local media, with a large number of Hong Kong reporters sent to
Beijing to cover the week-long meeting.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Threatens to Quit SADC Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela had threatened to quit being head of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) due to sharp differences
with his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe over security
issues, local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tensions stem from difference between Mandela and Mugabe
on the status of the SADC's potentially powerful subcommittee on
defense, politics and security, which is chaired by the latter.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources who declined to be named, said the
subcommittee's activities were suspended last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who chairs the SADC, believed that the subcommittee
is an integral part of the organization instead of a paralleled
organization, and that the SADC chairman should also head the
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, however, insisted that more independent role should be
granted to the institution, which should have right to hold a
separate summit from the main SADC summit in much the same way as
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization operates, said the report
quoting the sources.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Financial Gazette reported Thursday that Mandela
had made "his bullying threat" to resign at the weekend. On
Wednesday, Herald, Zimgbabwe's government-controlled newspaper,
claimed that a "power struggle" had been erupted between
Mandela and Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
But Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana denied allegations
that South Africa would withdraw its membership from the SADC.

<HEADLINE> Multinational To Go Looking for Gold in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Western Mining
Corp. Holdings Ltd. is expected to spend 29 million US dollars
prospecting for gold in Yili Prefecture, in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"We have been considering this project for nearly three years,"
said Dr. John Parry, the company's deputy general manager, "Our
experts have done on-the-spot investigations in Yili many times,
and made sure that the prefecture has good prospects of gold
reserves, and expect to find gold mines in 3-5 years for
large-scale mining."
</P>
<P>
This will be one of the company's four major projects in the
world. It is the world's eighth largest mining company, with
nearly 10 billion US dollars worth of assets.
</P>
<P>
"My company has shown great concern to the local investment
climate, and invited Dr. Stephen Fitzgerald, the first Australian
ambassador to China, to serve as an advisor for this effort. So we
think Yili's social order, natural environment, and communications
are all suitable for investment," Parry said.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke well of his Chinese counterparts' work and said
the project had the most rapid co-operation of any outside
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Parry signed a contract with the No. 305 Project Office, which
is responsible for state verification of distribution of mineral
resources in Xinjiang. The agreement calls for prospecting in
Yili's Tulasu Basin, where the company will spend four million US
dollars on the first phase, and another 25 million on the second
phase.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, nearly 30 groups have visited Xinjiang
and talked with their counterparts about prospecting. The US's
Barrick Power Co. began prospecting last year in the region.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has six mineral areas and is especially rich in gold,
nickel, and copper reserves. The Tianshan Mountains in Yili are
one of the best areas for prospecting, according to Wang Futong,
chief engineer of the region's Geology and Mineral Resources
Department.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Increases Tea Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's tea exports by the
major exporting companies have risen from one million kilograms
in March to 1.6 million kg in June this year, reported the local
daily The New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
This is caused by an increase in the average international tea
price from 1.5 U.S. Dollars per kg in January to 1.8 Dollars in
June, due to the crop's failure in neighbouring Kenya, one of the
world's major tea producers, which produced over 250 million
kgs last year.
</P>
<P>
An increased overall production as a result of additional
acreage by especially those estates recently repossessed and
rehabilitated by Asians also accounts for the growth.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's tea output had increased from 12 million kg in 1993
to 70 million kg last year due to a series of economic reform
measures such as the liberalization in tea industry and the
handing over of tea estates to the Asians who controlled more
than 70 percent the industry before 1973 and were expelled by
Uganda's former administration in 1972.

<HEADLINE> India to Take Steps to Promote Energy and Road  Construction Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- India is to take steps to
speed up the development of the country's power, petroleum and
roads, which are playing more important role in economic
development, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Union cabinet has decided to issue an ordinance to enable
companies in the power, petroleum and road sectors to adopt the
straight-line method to calculate depreciation under the
Income-Tax Act. The adoption of the straight-line method is
expected to provide an incentive to the upcoming power plants, the
refineries in the petroleum sector as well as road construction
projects, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will ensure an average depreciation rate thereby
increasing profits for the companies in the initial years. Since
the infrastructure sectors are allowed a five-year tax relief in
the initial years, higher profits with no tax liability would come
as an incentive for the companies involved. The return rate on
investment is thus likely to appreciate significantly in the
initial years, he further said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Rebels to Continue Attacks on Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels who
have so far attacked three foreign vessels since July have
threatened to continue attacks on foreign ships sailing in Sri
Lankan territorial waters, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have informed Colombo-based foreign missions and
other sources that they will attack vessels on shipping lines
found in "Tamil territorial waters."
</P>
<P>
They cautioned that any vessels, foreign-owned or otherwise,
which were engaged in activities associated with the Sri Lankan
military will be considered legitimate targets.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued from the rebel's international
headquarters in London on Wednesday, one day after the Tamil
rebels attacked the vessel "Cordiality" which was registered in
Panama and owned by a Chinese company based in Hong Kong. The
vessel was on a mission to transport 30,000 tons of illuminate
sands for an American buyer.
</P>
<P>
On July 15 they threatened to attack ships transporting
supplies to security forces in the North. A few days later the
rebels' navy, the sea tigers, seized the North Korean ship MO Rang
Bong off the Northern coast.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Head Sees Asia as The Economic Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- As Asia becomes increasingly
important in the international scene, the United States and Asia
must work together, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Tung Chee-Hwa said here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner hosted by the Economic Club of New York,
Tung said Asia's economic and political impact on the world in the
decades to come cannot be overlooked and "must be seen in a
favorable manner by the United States."
</P>
<P>
Asia may well emerge as the world's largest producer, capital
lender and capital borrower, as well as the world`s largest
consumer market, he said. "The growth of Asia's economy is good
for everyone."
</P>
<P>
Tung forecast that Asia could have an economy larger than the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) countries or the
European Union (EU) in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"The region, already well known for its high savings rate,
could produce 1200 billion to 1300 billion U.S. dollars in
additional annual savings than it does today, thereby becoming one
of the largest capital markets in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung is here on his first U.S. trip since he took the top post
in Hong Kong since China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over
the region on July 1. He arrived in Washington Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tung reiterated his confidence in Hong Kong's future -- because
of the Chinese government's commitments to make the "one country,
two systems" policy a successful reality.
</P>
<P>
Touching on close U.S.-Hong Kong business links, Tung said the
U.S. stood as Hong Kong's second largest trade partner in 1996
while Hong Kong was the 11th largest export market for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The United States put nearly 14 billion dollars of investment
into Hong Kong, its third largest investment destination in Asia
and Pacific after Japan and Australia, Tung said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Set Up Wood-Based Industrial Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to
establish two international-level wood-based industrial zones in
the capital Yangon to boost the manufacture of value-added
finished wood products in an effort to stop the exports of teak
and other wood logs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister for Forestry Lt. Gen. Chit Swe on Thursday
urged local manufacturers to make good use of teak, hardwood and
other lesser-used species in penetrating the world market, the
official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said more and more foreign entrepreneurs have turned towards
Myanmar for raw wood and production of value-added finished wood
products is being carried out with foreign investments and
technical know-how.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar will also undertake, in cooperation with the
International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), the project for
introducing Myanmar's lesser-used timber species to the world
market and the project for upgrading production efficiency in
furniture manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's hardwood export in the 1996-97 fiscal year ending
March was valued at 147,800 cubic tons, while the export of teak
at 138,700 cubic tons.
</P>
<P>
The country's export of forest products amounted to 218 million
U.S. dollars in the 1996-97, accounting for 24.4 percent of the
total export, second only to the export of agricultural products,
according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar restricts export of logs and bans the private sector
from exporting teak logs after the enactment of the country's
Forest Law in 1992. However, export of value-added wood products
is encouraged.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Delivers Report at 15th Party Congress (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang Zemin stressed and further expounded the issue of the
primary stage of socialism, saying that China is currently in the
primary stage of socialism and will remain in this stage for a
long time to come.
</P>
<P>
The primary stage of socialism is a historical stage in which
we shall gradually put an end to underdevelopment and realize
socialist modernization by and large, he said. It will take at
least a century to complete this historical process. It will take
a much longer period of time to consolidate and develop the
socialist system, and it will require persistent struggle by many
generations, a dozen or even several dozens, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"To advance our cause to the 21st century in an all-round way
requires us to seize opportunities without fail, and blaze new
trails instead of following the beaten tracks. Taking economic
development as our central task, we should make new breakthroughs
in economic restructuring, deepen political restructuring and
develop socialist culture and ethics in real earnest. These
aspects of work should be handled in tandem with a view to
bringing about economic development and all-round social
progress," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is China's basic economic system for the primary stage of
socialism to retain a dominant position for public ownership and
to develop diverse forms of ownership side by side. The public
sector includes not only the state- and collectively-owned
sectors, but also the state- and collectively-owned elements in
the sector of mixed ownership," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Public ownership can and should take diversified forms. All
management methods and organizational forms that mirror the laws
governing socialized production may be utilized boldly," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The joint stock system is a form of capital organization of
modern enterprises, which is favorable for separating ownership
from management and raising the efficiency of the operation of
enterprises and capital. It can be used both under capitalism and
under socialism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang outlined a series of measures for accelerating the reform
of state-owned enterprises, improving the structure and mode of
distribution, giving full play to the role of the market mechanism
and improving the macroeconomic control system, strengthening
agriculture as the foundation of the economy, and readjusting and
optimizing the economic structure, implement the strategies of
developing the country by relying on science and education and of
achieving sustainable development, striving to do better in
opening to the outside world and continuing to improve the
standard of living of the people.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of a modern enterprise system is the
orientation of the reform of state-owned enterprises," he said.
"We shall convert large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises
into standard corporations according to the requirements of
"clearly established ownership, well defined power and
responsibility, separation of enterprise from administration, and
scientific management" so that they will become corporate entities
and competitors adaptable to the market."

technologies and key equipment. we shall protect the rights and
interests of foreign-funded enterprises, grant them the same
treatment as their Chinese counterparts."
</P>

"In building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must
redouble our efforts to raise the ideological and ethical
standards and scientific and educational levels of the whole
nation and provide a powerful ideological driving force and strong
intellectual support for economic development and all-round social
progress. We must nurture citizens one generation after another
who have high ideals, moral integrity, a good education and a
strong sense of discipline, meeting the requirements of the
socialist modernization drive. This is a long-term arduous task in
our cultural advancement," he said.
</P>
<P>
On national defense and army building, Jiang said that the army
must consistently uphold the absolute leadership by the Party and
take the road of fewer but better troops with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China will reduce the armed forces by another
500,000 in the next three years, in addition to the army reduction
by one million men in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the peaceful reunification of the motherland,
Jiang said the concept of "one country, two systems" is an
important component of Deng Xiaoping Theory. The smooth return of
Hong Kong and the maintenance of its long-term prosperity and
stability will undoubtedly create favorable conditions for the
settlement of the Taiwan question, he said.
</P>
<P>
He renewed the solemn appeal: As the first step, the two sides
of the Straits can hold negotiations and reach an agreement on
"officially ending the state of hostility between the two sides in
accordance with the principle that there is only one China." On
this basis, the two sides can undertake jointly to safeguard
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and map out plans
for the future development of their relations.
</P>
<P>
On international situation and China's foreign policy, Jiang
said, China is a staunch force for safeguarding world peace and
regional stability. China's development will not pose a threat to
any other country. In the closing part of his report, Jiang said
"the entire Party should strengthen its building in ideology,
organization, style of work and all other aspects, always try to
improve its leading and governing ability, and guard against
corruption and degeneration so as to show a new look and greater
militancy in leading the people in accomplishing the new
historical tasks."

<HEADLINE> South Korea, Japan Fail to Agree in Fishery Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan failed to
narrow their differences over rewriting a 1965 bilateral fisheries
accord at a two-day meeting here Thursday, local media said today.
</P>
<P>
During the fifth round of fishery talks this year, the two
sides put forward their respective proposals and made no major
differences in their positions, according to Shin Jung-seung,
South Korea's chief delegate to the talks.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean delegation reaffirmed that it will consider a
provisional settlement only on condition its sovereign claim to
the Tokto islets (Takeshima islets in Japanese) not be affected
and existing rights for its fishermen be fully guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side repeated a demand that Tokyo and Seoul work
out a temporary fisheries agreement before they draw the
boundaries of their 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese version of a revised accord, which proposes joint
management of the seas around the Tokto islets, was unacceptable
to South Korea, the chief delegate said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the two countries will continue to discuss
the issue at the United Nations in late September, he added.

<HEADLINE> Jiang on Political Restructuing, Legal System and Democracy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Party General Secretary Jiang
Zemin today urged efforts to continue the reform of the political
structure, and improve socialist democracy and the legal system.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, which opened here today, Jiang said: "The
deepening of the reform of the economic structure and the
cross-century development of the socialist modernization drive
require that, under the precondition of adhering to the Four
Cardinal Principles, we should continue to press ahead with the
reform of the political structure, further extend the scope of
socialist democracy and improve the socialist legal system,
governing the country according to law and making it a socialist
country ruled by law."
</P>
<P>
"It is our Party's persistent goal to develop socialist
democracy," he said. "Without democracy there would be no
socialism or socialist modernization. The essence of socialist
democracy is that the people are the masters of the country. All
powers of the state belong to the people." He stressed that
China's state system featuring people's democratic dictatorship
and its system of government featuring people's congresses are the
result of the struggles waged by the people and the choice of
history. "It is imperative that we should uphold and improve this
fundamental political system, instead of copying any western
models. This is of decisive importance in upholding leadership by
the Party and the socialist system and realizing people's
democracy."
</P>
<P>
Developing democracy must go hand in hand with the efforts to
improve the legal system so that the country is ruled by law,
Jiang said. Ruling the country by law, he noted, means that the
broad masses of the people, under the leadership of the Party and
in accordance with the Constitution and other laws, participate in
one way or another and through all possible channels in managing
state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings and social
affairs, and see to it that all work of the state proceed in
keeping with law, and that socialist democracy is gradually
institutionalized and codified so that such institutions and laws
will not change with changes in the leadership or changes in the
views or focus of attention of any leader.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that political restructuring must help
enhance the vitality of the Party and the state, demonstrate the
features and advantages of the socialist system, safeguard
national unification, ethnic unity and social stability, give full
scope to the initiative of the people, and stimulate the
development of the productive forces and social progress.
</P>
<P>
He said that the main tasks of political restructuring for the
present and a period of time to come are to develop democracy,
strengthen the legal system, separate government functions from
enterprise management, streamline government organs, improve the
democratic supervision system, and maintain stability and unity.
</P>
<P>
On improving the system of democracy, Jiang Zemin said, as a
ruling party, the Communist Party leads and supports the people in
exercising the power of running the state, holding democratic
elections, making policy decisions in a democratic manner,
instituting democratic management and supervision, ensuring that
the people enjoy extensive rights and freedom endowed by law, and
respecting and guaranteeing human rights.

Myanmar's five industrial zones in the capital Yangon.
</P>
<P>
According to today's official newspaper the New Light of
Myanmar, the factories produce garments, purified water, footwear,

"We shall continue and further improve the system of people's
congresses, ensuring that the people's congresses and their
standing committees exercise the functions of the organs of state
power according to law, strengthen their legislative and
supervisory work, and establish closer ties between deputies and
the people they represent," he said. "While making major policy
decisions concerning reform and development, we must enact
corresponding laws. We shall gradually establish a mechanism that
will help the decision-makers to go deep among the people to see
their condition, adequately reflect their will and pool their
wisdom so that decision-making will be more scientific, democratic
and efficient and will reach a higher level."
</P>
<P>
The Party general secretary promised to continue and improve
the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation
led by the Communist Party, uphold and improve regional autonomy
for minority nationalities, and implement in real earnest the
Party's policies concerning religions and overseas Chinese
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the grassroots organs of power and self-governing
mass organizations in both urban and rural areas to improve the
system of democratic elections so as to enable the people to take
a direct part in the discussion and decision-making concerning
local public affairs and welfare undertakings, and exercise
supervision over the cadres. He also urged efforts to uphold and
improve the democratic management system of enterprises and
institutions with workers' conferences as its basic form.
</P>
<P>
On legal construction, Jiang Zemin said, "We shall strengthen
legislation, improve its quality and form a socialist legal system
with Chinese characteristics by the year 2010." He stressed the
necessity to safeguard the dignity of the Constitution and other
laws. "We must see to it that all people are equal before the law
and no individuals or organizations shall have the privilege to
overstep it," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On streamlining government organs, Jiang Zemin pointed out that
it is necessary to alter the functions of the government and
separate them from those of enterprises so that enterprises will
be truly given the power with regard to production, operation and
management in accordance with the requirements of a socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Following the principle of simplification, uniformity and
efficiency, he noted, "we shall establish a highly efficient,
well-coordinated and standardized administrative system, with a
view to improving their service for the people. The departments in
charge of comprehensive economic management should shift their
functions to macroeconomic control, and specialized economic
departments should be reorganized or reduced. We shall improve the
work of departments supervising law enforcement and cultivate and
expand social intermediary organizations. We shall deepen the
reform of the administrative system, statutorily delimiting the
structures, functions, sizes and working procedures of the state
organs and ensuring that their sizes are kept within authorized
limits and their redundant personnel are reduced. We shall also
deepen the reform of the personnel system by introducing a
competitive and incentive mechanism and improving the system of
public servants to build up a contingent of administrators who are
highly competent and professionally specialized."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin stressed the necessity of establishing and
improving a mechanism that will ensure all cadres exercise their
authority within the framework of law. He urged departments
handling affairs of immediate concern to the people to carry out
an open administrative system to make sure what they do is fair,
just and open.
</P>
<P>
He also urged integration of the supervision by Party members
with that by the law and the masses and the role of supervision by
public opinion. Building socialist democracy is a gradual
historical process, so it should be advanced under the leadership
of the Party, in light of China's conditions, step by step, and in
an orderly way, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The more developed socialism is, the more developed democracy
will be. We should continue to promote a Chinese-style socialist
democracy by exploring the law of its development in practice, and
enable it to display greater vitality in the 21st century," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang on Developing Socialist Culture With Chinese Characteristics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general
secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
stressed the importance of developing socialist culture with
Chinese characteristics at the opening session of the 15th
National Party Congress today.
</P>
<P>
Only when economic development and political and cultural
advances are well coordinated and only if there are both material
progress and cultural and ideological progress can there be
socialism with Chinese characteristics, Jiang said in a report
made today.
</P>
<P>
Socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, as far as its
substance is concerned, is identical to socialist ideological and
ethical progress China has been promoting since the country
introduced the reform and opening up, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Fostering common ideals and aspirations in the whole society
is the basic objective of our cultural advancement with Chinese
characteristics. We should make unremitting efforts to educate
cadres and the masses in Deng Xiaoping Theory. We should
persistently conduct education in socialist ethics with emphasis
on serving the people and on the principle of collectivism and
strengthen education in democracy, legality and discipline so as
to guide our people to foster correct outlooks on the world and
life and correct values," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the progress of education and science is the
foundation of cultural advancement. Training hundreds of millions
of qualified laborers and tens of millions of professional
personnel to meet the needs of the modernization drive and
exploiting the advantage of the country's vast human resources
have a direct bearing on the cause of socialism in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"We must see to it that education is given a strategic
priority," he said.
</P>
<P>
The development of the cultural undertakings, including
literature and art, the press and publishing, radio, film and
television, is an important aspect of cultural advancement, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We should deepen reform of the system for managing cultural
undertakings, and implement and improve related economic policies.
We must adhere to the principles of serving the people and the
cause of socialism and of 'letting a hundred flowers blossom and a
hundred schools of thought contend', giving full scope to the
theme of our times while advocating diversity so as to create more
excellent works which integrate ideological content with artistry,
"he said.
</P>
<P>
A healthy cultural environment is an important condition for
promoting cultural and ideological progress of society and
advancing the reform, opening up and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"We should conduct mass activities to promote ideological and
ethical progress in depth and in a protracted way, and make
efforts to advocate social, occupational and family ethics," he
said. "China cannot develop its culture in isolation of the common
achievements of human civilization. Following the principle of
keeping our own culture as the base and making use of that of
others, we should conduct various exchanges with other countries,
drawing on their strong points while introducing our own
achievements to the world," he added.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Declares Cut of Armed Forces by Another 500,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to reduce its armed
forces by another 500,000 in the next three years, Party General
Secretary Jiang Zemin announced at the 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
China cut the armed forces by one million during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin said that, to strengthen national defense and army
building is the basic guarantee for national security and
modernization drive. Deng Xiaoping's concept of army building in
the new period is the continuation and development of Mao Zedong's
thinking on military affairs and the scientific guide to building
the army and national defense.
</P>
<P>
In line with the general requirements of being qualified
politically and competent militarily and having a fine style of
work, strict discipline and adequate logistical support, we should
press ahead with the army building and reform so as to make the
People's Liberation Army a more revolutionary, modernized and
standardized army, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new historical conditions, Jiang said, the army must
consistently uphold the absolute leadership by the Party, be in
agreement with the Party Central Committee ideologically and
politically, obey orders of the Party Central Committee in all
actions and never forget its nature and purposes as the people's
army. It should adhere to the strategy of active defense, improve
its quality and take the road of fewer but better troops with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of strengthening the army by relying
on science and technology. He said China should make greater
efforts in the research in defense-related science and technology,
establish and improve an operation mechanism so that the defense
industries are adapted to the socialist market economy, and
gradually upgrade weapons and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
The army, he stressed, should subordinate itself to and serve
the overall interests of national economic development,
strengthening itself through thrift and hard work and actively
supporting and participating in the economic development of the
country. Party organizations and governments at all levels and the
masses should be concerned about and support the development of
national defense and army building, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Promoting China's Peaceful Reunification (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Communist Party
General Secretary Jiang Zemin renewed the appeal here today that
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits can hold negotiations and
reach an agreement on "officially ending the state of hostility
between the two sides in accordance with the principle that there
is only one China" to promote the peaceful reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
In a report delivered at the opening session of the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Jiang
said that complete reunification of the motherland is the common
aspiration of all Chinese at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Taking the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the
motherland as their historical task, the Chinese Communists have
made unremitting efforts to that end. Deng Xiaoping's scientific
concept of "one country, two systems" has vigorously pushed
forward the process of the peaceful reunification of the
motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Jiang renewed the solemn appeal: as the first
step, the two sides of the Straits can hold negotiations and reach
an agreement on "officially ending the state of hostility between
the two sides in accordance with the principle that there is only
one China". On this basis, the two sides can undertake jointly to
safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and map
out plans for the future development of their relations.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities will earnestly respond to
our suggestions and proposals and enter into political
negotiations with us at an early date. On the premise that there
is only one China, we are prepared to talk about any matter," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"All opinions and proposals can be put forward as long as they
are in the interest of the reunification. The question of the
reunification of the motherland should be solved by us Chinese on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits, " he added.
</P>
<P>
"We shall adhere to the basic principles of 'peaceful
reunification' and 'one country, two systems' and the eight-point
proposal on developing relations between the two sides and
promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland. We shall
stick to the principle of 'one China' and oppose splitting, the
'independence of Taiwan', the attempt to create 'two Chinas' or
'one China, one Taiwan' and any interference by foreign forces. We
shall not allow any forces whatsoever to change Taiwan's status as
part of China in any way," Jiang said.

<P>
"We shall work for peaceful reunification, but we shall not
undertake to renounce the use of force," Jiang said, adding that
this is not directed against the compatriots in Taiwan, but
against the schemes of foreign forces to interfere with China's
reunification and to bring about the "independence of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"We shall spare no efforts in expanding economic exchanges and
cooperation between the two sides, speed up the establishment of
direct links of postal, air and shipping services and trade
between the two sides and continue to promote mutual visits of
people and exchanges in various fields such as science, technology
and culture.
</P>
<P>
" We place our hopes on our compatriots in Taiwan who are
endowed with the glorious tradition of patriotism. Except for a
handful of people who stubbornly cling to the position of
"independence of Taiwan", all parties and personages of all
circles in Taiwan are welcome to exchange views with us on
relations between the two sides and on peaceful reunification," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the motherland,
Jiang said that it is a hallmark of the great success of the
concept of "one country, two systems." Hong Kong's return to the
motherland constitutes a crucial step taken by the Chinese people
in the great cause of the reunification of the motherland, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong's return, the policies of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high
degree of autonomy have been implemented conscientiously, and Hong
Kong has maintained its prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Facts will prove, Jiang said, that the government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and our compatriots in
Hong Kong will surely be able to administer Hong Kong well in
accordance with the Basic Law of the HKSAR. He said Macao will
return to the embrace of the motherland in 1999, another great
event of the Chinese nation. All preparations for Macao's return
are being made in an energetic and orderly fashion. Macao's smooth
transition and smooth transfer of government can certainly be
secured and its long-term development and stability maintained,
Jiang noted.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on International Situation, China's Foreign Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Party General Secretary Jiang
Zemin reiterated here today that China is a staunch force for
safeguarding world peace and regional stability and its
development poses no threat to any other country.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China which opened here today, Jiang Zemin stressed that
China needs a long-term peaceful international environment, and
above all, good relations with the surrounding countries for
carrying out the socialist modernization program. "China will
never seek hegemony even when it becomes developed in future," he
stressed, adding that the Chinese people, for a long time
subjected to aggression, oppression and humiliation by foreign
powers, will never inflict these sufferings upon others.
</P>
<P>
He said that the present international situation as a whole is
becoming more relaxed and peace and development are the main
themes of the present era. "The trend toward multipolarity has
further developed globally or regionally in the political,
economic and other fields. World forces are experiencing a new
split and realignment," he noted, adding that the development of
the trend toward multipolarity contributes to world peace,
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
For a fairly long period of time to come, it will be possible
to avert a new world war and secure a favorable, peaceful
international environment and maintain good relations with the
surrounding countries, Jiang Zemin said.
</P>
<P>
However, the cold war mentality still exists, and hegemonism
and power politics continue to be the main source of threat to
world peace and stability, he pointed out. "The unjust and
irrational old international economic order is still infringing
upon the interests of developing countries, and the gap in wealth
is widening. It is still serious that human rights and other
issues are used to interfere in the internal affairs of other
countries. Local conflicts due to ethnic, religious and
territorial factors crop up from time to time. The world is not
yet tranquil."
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to adhere to the ideas of Deng Xiaoping about
diplomatic work and firmly pursue an independent foreign policy of
peace, Jiang said. In international affairs, he noted, "we should
determine our position and policies by proceeding from the
fundamental interests of the people of China and other countries
and judging each case on its own merits. We shall not yield to any
outside pressure or enter into alliance with any big power or
group of countries, nor shall we establish any military bloc, join
in the arms race or seek military expansion."

"We oppose hegemonism and safeguard world peace," Jiang Zemin
declared. "We do not impose our social system and ideology upon
others, nor will we allow other countries to force theirs upon
us."
</P>
<P>
He said that China will work to bring about a just and rational
new international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to respect the diversity of the world, Jiang
Zemin said. "All countries are entitled to choose the social
systems, development strategies and lifestyles that suit their own
conditions."
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed the continuity of the good-neighborly policy,
saying that "this has been our consistent stand and will never
change."
</P>
<P>
The Party general secretary promised to further strengthen
China's solidarity and cooperation with the Third World countries
and further improve and develop China's relations with developed
countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence. "All countries should respect each other and live
together in amity regardless of their differences in social
systems and ideologies," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin said that China will conduct extensive trade,
economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural
exchanges with all countries and regions to promote common
development by persisting in the principle of equality and mutual
benefit; China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic
activities and give full play to China's role in the United
Nations and other international organizations; and China will
develop new types of inter-party relations of exchange and
cooperation with all political parties of various countries which
are ready to have contacts with the Chinese Communist Party with a
view to promoting state relations on the basis of the principles
of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Reviews Past and Looks into New Century (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the new century is approaching, China is faced with grim
challenges and, more significantly, the country is confronted with
unprecedented favorable conditions and excellent opportunities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted China must be soberly aware that international
competition is becoming increasingly acute, that the economic,
scientific and technological gap between China and the developed
countries has brought great pressure to bear on China, and that
the country itself still has many difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in the meantime that China must be well aware of the
following factors:
</P>
<P>
-- First, peace and development have become the main themes of
the present era. The pattern of the world is moving in the
direction of multipolarization. It is, therefore, possible to
secure a peaceful international environment for a fairly long
period of time. The worldwide scientific and technological
revolution is forging ahead by leaps and bounds, and the economy
has continued to grow. This has provided favorable external
conditions for China.
</P>
<P>
-- Second, considerable overall national strength has been
built up in China since the founding of the People's Republic,
especially over the past 20 years. The reform and opening up have
brought about favorable structural conditions for the
modernization drive, created broad market demands and sources of
funds, and given fuller play to the new creativity of the people
in their hundreds of millions.
</P>
<P>
-- Third, what is more important is that the CPC has
established the basic theory and basic line of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics which have proved to be correct in
practice. These are conditions China enjoys today, but China
totally or partially lacked in the past.
</P>
<P>
"Whether we are able to seize opportunities has always been an
issue which has a vital bearing on the success of our revolution
and construction. We did seize important historical opportunities,
but we lost some as well. Now the whole Party must maintain a high
level of consciousness, firmly seize the historical opportunities
at the turn of the century and take new steps forward," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying, "Since we have the
necessary domestic conditions and a favorable international
environment, and since under the socialist system we have the
advantage of being able to concentrate our forces on a major task,
it is now both possible and necessary for us to bring about, in
the prolonged process of modernization, several periods of rapid
growth with good economic returns. We must have this ambition."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Achievements over Past Five Years (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New breakthroughs have been made in the reform and opening to
the outside world. In accordance with the requirements for
establishing a socialist market economy, we took big strides in
reforming the systems of finance, taxation, banking, foreign
trade, foreign exchange, planning, investment, pricing,
circulation, housing and social security. Market forces notably
served as the basic means of regulating the allocation of
resources, and the framework of a macroeconomic control system was
preliminarily established, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China pressed forward with the reform in state-owned
enterprises after making experiments in selected ones. The country
further developed the pattern with the public sector remaining
dominant and diverse sectors of the economy developing side by
side.
</P>
<P>
"We continued to expand economic and technological cooperation
and exchanges with other countries, effected big increases in
foreign trade and in the use of foreign funds and brought about a
marked rise in state foreign exchange reserves," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China has taken new steps in promoting cultural and ethical
progress. Gratifying achievements were scored in science,
technology, education, culture, public health, sports, family
planning and other social undertakings. Significant progress was
made in developing socialist democracy and improving the legal
system.
</P>
<P>
The great unity of all China's nationalities was further
consolidated and developed. Social and political unity and
stability provided an important guarantee for the reform and
development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Progress was made in modernizing national defense. The combat
effectiveness of the army was further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
He said that the living standards of the people rose notably.
The average annual per capita income for living expenses increased
by 7.2 percent for city dwellers in real terms, while the average
annual per capita net income went up by 5.7 percent for rural
residents in real terms, making the period one of those with the
biggest increases. The people's living conditions including food,
clothing, housing, articles for daily use and transportation
improved markedly. The rural poor population of the country
decreased by 32 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Jiang said, "we have done a great deal
of work with marked results in the peaceful reunification of the
motherland. The Chinese government has resumed the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, which has wiped out the century-old
humiliation of the Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
This is a great event which makes every Chinese elated and has
won universal acclaim from the international community, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Party general secretary said that China has stepped up
efforts to strengthen Party building. The whole Party studied more
and more deeply Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics. Progress was made in strengthening
leading bodies and the contingent of cadres, with a large number
of fine young cadres taking leading posts.
</P>
<P>
"We redoubled our efforts to improve the Party's work style,
build clean government and fight corruption and achieved successes
by stages," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the shortcomings and defects in the work of the past five
years, Jiang said, the quality and efficiency of the national
economy as a whole remain fairly low, the irrational economic
structure still poses a rather outstanding problem, and especially
part of the state-owned enterprises lack vitality.
</P>
<P>
The work style of the Party and the government, the current
social conduct and public security still fall short of the
expectations of the people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Uneven regional development is obvious, and part of the urban
and rural residents still live in straitened circumstances.
Population growth and economic development have caused great
strains on resources and the environment.
</P>
<P>
"We must pay great attention to these problems and solve them
in a down-to-earth way," he said.
</P>
<P>
The achievements scored in the five years are the outcome of
the united endeavor of the whole Party and the people throughout
the country, he said. They have provided valuable new experience
and will serve as a more solid foundation for our future
development. All this will greatly encourage us to win new
victories with greater confidence and enthusiasm," he added.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Party Building (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua ) -- Chinese Communist Party
leader Jiang Zemin called here today for upholding, strengthening
and improving the leadership of the Party and doing well in Party
building.
</P>
<P>
This is essential for holding high the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory, fulfilling the tasks defined at this congress and
advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese
Characteristics in an all-round way to the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, at the opening
session of the 15th National Party Congress, which opened in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The entire Party should strengthen its building in ideology,
organization, style of work and all other aspects, always try to
improve its leading and governing ability, and guard against
corruption and degeneration so as to show a new look and greater
militancy in leading the people in accomplishing the new
historical tasks, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen Party building ideologically, it is essential to
unswervingly arm the entire Party with Deng Xiaoping Theory and
give full play to the ideological and political strength of the
Party. The entire Party should attach great importance to study,
be adept at studying and usher in a new upsurge in studying
Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and particularly Deng
Xiaoping Theory, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leading cadres at all levels, and especially the several
hundred members of the Party Central Committee and the several
thousand cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels bear a
specially important responsibility in holding high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory. They should take the lead in
studying that theory and comprehensively and accurately master its
scientific system. They should grasp both the basic ideas and the
essence of the theory in an overall perspective and systematically
analyze and understand the relevant aspects of the theory in light
of the respective fields of their work, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen Party building organizationally, it is essential
to make the Party the core of strong leadership and give full play
to its organizational strength, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that under the conditions of reform, opening to the
outside world and developing a socialist market economy,
democratic centralism, instead of being weakened, must be improved
and developed.
</P>
<P>
It is a strategic task to train and select a large number of
excellent young cadres who can shoulder cross-century important
tasks, Jiang said, adding, "We must lose no time in fulfilling
this task. We should pay great attention to fostering and
promoting women cadres, cadres from among ethnic minorities and
non-Party cadres."

<HEADLINE> Leaders Praised for Smooth Economic Operation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Renowned economists have
spoken highly of the leadership of the third generation of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) for its capability in coping with
complicated economic phenomena.
</P>
<P>
"Third generation leaders with Jiang Zemin at the core have
exhibited great foresight and superb skills in governing economic
operations to improve the overall situation since the 14th CPC
National Congress in 1992," said Professor Xiao Zhuoji of Beijing
University in a recent interview with Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
China is now making efforts to build socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and is undergoing a shift from a planned to a
market economy, as well as from extensive to intensive operations
in terms of its mode of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
New problems have kept cropping up in economic operation, he
said, while superficial ones have been solved, others will emerge,
accompanied by deep-rooted contradictions.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, the collective leadership has taken up the
gauntlet at the turning point and has introduced a series of
far-reaching principles for economic construction and
restructuring, as well major policies to maintain rapid, sustained
and smooth economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP has maintained an annual average increase of 12.1
percent over the past five years, and in 1995 accomplished the
strategic target of quadrupling the 1980 GDP five years ahead of
schedule. The country's macroeconomic performance has entered the
best period since the 1990s with high growth rate and low
inflation.

The primary Party organizations are the focus of all the
Party's work and the base of its fighting capacity. The work of
consolidating and improving primary Party organizations should be
geared to the Party's basic line and serve its central task.They
should study new situations and problems in a spirit of reform and
improve their methods and style of work and their ways of
conducting activities, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
To improve the Party's style of work, Jiang said, it is
essential to stick to the aim of serving the people wholeheartedly
and give full play to the Party's strength in forging close links
with the masses.
</P>
<P>
To work for the people's interests wholeheartedly is the
starting point as well as the purpose of all the work for building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, said Jiang, who also urged
Party members to listen to the opinions of the masses, help
alleviate their hardships and do practical things in their
interest.
</P>
<P>
Party cadres, especially leading cadres, must correctly
exercise the powers entrusted to them by the people and must
never abuse them for personal gain, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the fight against corruption is a grave political
struggle vital to the very existence of the Party and the state."
</P>
<P>
"We should fight corruption and continuously give the warning
throughout the process of reform and opening to the outside
world.," he said, adding, "We should continue to make sure that
leading cadres are clean, honest and self-disciplined, investigate
and deal with major cases and rectify unsound practices in
departments and trades. Party committees at all levels must take a
clear-cut stand and firmly persevere in this work."
</P>
<P>
By deepening the reform, he said, "we should gradually
eradicate the hotbed for the breeding and spreading of
corruption." China should combine the fight against corruption
with the purification of Party organizations, never allowing
corruptionists to hide themselves within the Party, he stressed.
Tightening Party discipline is the guarantee for maintaining the
Party's advanced nature and purity and enhancing its cohesiveness
and fighting capacity, Jiang noted. Party committees at all levels
should adhere to the principle that "the Party should supervise
itself," carrying out the policy of tightening Party discipline in
all aspects of Party building, he said.

High-ranking leaders have managed to balance reform and

promoting domestic development and opening, reforming existing and
developing new systems, raising overall national strength and
living standards, expanding market-oriented economy and enhancing
macro-control, said Xiao.
</P>
<P>
Hu Angang, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, noted that third generation leaders have succeeded in
some areas in which the previous two generations of leaders failed
to do. Hu was referring to three major third generation
accomplishments since 1992: revenue sharing reform, macroeconomic
control, and narrowing the gap between eastern and western areas.
</P>
<P>
"The three accomplishments have been highly praised for
conforming with existing national conditions. The early success of
revenue sharing reform and the central government's strengthened
macro-control on finances led to the successful accomplishment of
an economic soft landing. Regional disparities aroused the serious
concern of third generation leaders, and efforts have been made to
accomplish common prosperity," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hu attributed the three accomplishments to the pragmatic
attitude of the leadership and their extensive research and
investigation efforts, as well as the wisdom of experts and
collective leadership both within and outside the Party.

BANGKOK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Thaksin Shinawatra said on Thursday that trade in agricultural
goods in Southeast Asia must be boosted to counteract trade
barriers enforced by some developed nations.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with ministers of agriculture and forestry of
ASEAN nations, Thaksin said that because the Southeast Asian
region faces stiff competition from more advanced countries with
processing industries, the ASEAN must share both raw materials and
the latest technologies.
</P>
<P>
He added that ASEAN nations must act quickly to benefit from
currently weak currencies that made agricultural products cheaper
and increased the competitiveness of exports.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN ministers are here to participate in a two-day
ministerial meeting to discuss ASEAN agricultural products'
standards, the establishment of an ASEAN agricultural information
network and cooperation with the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Economic Restructuring and Development Strategy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- To establish a more or less
ideal socialist market economy and maintain a sustained, rapid and
sound development of the national economy are the two major tasks
for China, said Jiang Zemin today.
</P>
<P>
In his report delivered at the 15th National Party Congress
which opened here today, Jiang, general secretary of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, said China must strive for new
breakthroughs in some major aspects of reform and make substantial
progress in optimizing the economic structure, developing science
and technology and raising the level of opening up to keep to the
orientation of building a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The move is to really find a way to coordinated development of
the economy featuring a fairly high speed, fairly good performance
and constant improvement of the quality of the economy as a whole,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Party congress, Jiang elaborated the
strategies for China's economic restructuring and economic
development from eight major aspects: to readjust and improve the
ownership structure; accelerate the reform of state-owned
enterprises; improve the structure and mode of distribution; give
full play to the role of the market mechanism and improve the
macroeconomic control system; strengthen agriculture as the
foundation of the economy, and readjust and optimize the economic
structure; implement the strategies of developing the country by
relying on science and education and of achieving sustainable
development; strive to do better in opening to the outside world;
and continue to improve the standard of living of the people.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of state-owned enterprises, Jiang said the
establishment of a modern enterprise system is the orientation of
the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He noted China will convert large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises into standard corporations according to the
requirements of "clearly established ownership, well defined power
and responsibility, separation of enterprise from administration,
and scientific management" so that they will become corporate
entities and competitors adaptable to the market.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will define more clearly the powers and
responsibilities of the state and enterprises. The state will
enjoy the owner's equity according to the amount of capital it has
put into the enterprises and bear limited responsibilities for the
debts of enterprises while enterprises will operate independently
according to law, responsible for their own profits and losses.
</P>
<P>
The government should not directly intervene in the operation
of enterprises, and enterprises have to be restrained by the owner
and should not harm the owner's equity, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will adopt all kinds of possible means, including direct
financing, to replenish the capital funds of enterprises, and the
country will cultivate and develop a diversity of investors in
order to push the separation of administrative functions from
enterprise management and change the way enterprises operate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China will also combine the reform of
state-owned enterprises with their reorganization, upgrading and
better management.

He said that "to advance our cause to the 21st century in an

should strengthen unity. Meanwhile, we should maintain close
cooperation between our Party and the democratic parties and
friends in various circles, cement close ties between our Party
and the masses and consolidate and develop the great unity of the
entire people," he said. This unity, he noted, is based on the
common interests of all-round rejuvenation of the Chinese nation
and on the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese

<HEADLINE> Italy Wants Speedup in Euro Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Italy, once viewed as one of the
countries having trouble meeting the single currency criteria, is
urging a speedup in the preliminaries leading to the move.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Dini wants the list of the first
wave of countries to join the union be drawn up earlier than
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
He said at the end of a two-day summit with his Spanish
counterpart, Jose Maria Aznar, that it would be better to decide
on the first wave "as soon as possible" to prevent uncertainty
unleasing market turbulence.
</P>
<P>
Which countries will be among the first wave to adopt the
single currency, known as "Euro", will be decided next May, when
all the countries' final fiscal figures for 1997 ared due.
</P>
<P>
"The final date for setting the list of participants in the
single currency is May. But the sooner we decide on it, the
better," Prodi told a news conference held with Aznar after their
meeting in the central northern Italian city of Bologna.
</P>
<P>
In the first day of their meeting, Prodi and Aznar renewed
their resolve to respect the criteria and timetables of the Euro,
to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Spain had been considered two countries which had
more difficulty in meeting the budget deficit and inflation
requirements necessary to qualify for the single currency.
</P>
<P>
To qualify, countries must lower their budget deficit to three
percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and their public debt to
60 percent of GDP. Their inflation rates have not to be more than
1.5 percentage points higher than the average figure of the three
best performing countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy has managed to bring down its deficit and
inflation through austerity policies and fiscal reforms.
</P>
<P>
Italy's deficit-GDP ratio, estimated to stand at 3.2 percent by
the end of 1997, is expected to drop to 3 percent in 1998, the
Internation Monetary Fund said earlier. Its inflation had lowered
to 1.5 percent in August, the lowest since the Spring of 1969,
said Italy's national statistics institute, Istat.
</P>
<P>
In Spain, Aznar's government has taken similar measures to cut
public spending. These included a 1.5 billion U.S. dollar cut in
spending, a reduction of government posts and a wage freeze for
all public servants in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Its inflation in March dropped to 2.2 percent, the lowest in 29
years. A European Union report expected its public deficit to
fall to three percent in 1997 from 4.4 percent in 1996 and 6.6
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Also topping the annual Italy-Spain summit was reform of the
the 15-member European Union's Council of Ministers and more say
for foreign ministers in decision-making in the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Italian diplomats said Italy was determined to make sure that
key reforms -- blocked at the EU summit in Amsterdam in June --
were implemented between the scheduled launch of the single
currency in 1999 and the end of enlargement talks early next
century.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Votes for Clinton's Tests Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today
overwhelmingly approved President Bill Clinton's plan for national
reading and math tests as a measure to upgrade U.S. school
learning.
</P>
<P>
But the Senate's approval followed an agreement on handing
control of testing to the National Assessment Governing Board, an
independent board created by the Congress to run existing tests
known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress.
</P>
<P>
The tests, to start in March 1999, would measure fourth-graders
for their reading ability and eighth-graders for their ability to
do math.
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute tests would be based on fixed standards of what
children should know and be able to do in those two core subjects.
Other achievement tests commonly measure students against a
shifting norm, or average.
</P>
<P>
"The measure they have embraced will help parents ensure their
children have mastered the basics of reading and math," Clinton
said today, hailing his victory in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"This is another example of what can happen when people of good
will of both parties... look to the future and not to the past,"
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the testing proposal
"took a major step forward today, and we believe it will prevail
in the end."
</P>
<P>
However, a House vote was put off until Tuesday because of slow
movement on a massive spending bill.
</P>
<P>
The tests plan will face House opposition by conservatives who
argued that the tests would threaten local control of what
children should learn. Liberals also were against the plan, saying
the tests would be used to further brand low-achieving students
from impoverished school districts as inferior.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Economic Growth Slowdown in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Czech Republic Prime Minister
Vaclav Klaus told a seminar of American entrepreneurs Thursday
that the growth of the country's gross domestic product in 1997 is
expected to be 1.5 to 2 percent, less than half the former target.
</P>
<P>
Economic authorities here said this will be the lowest growth
in the recent three years.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic has been faced with huge financial and
foreign trade deficits this year and more than one-third of
enterprises are now losing money. The government was forced to
institute tight credit policies twice, in April and May.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic difficulties worsened in July when
catastrophic floods hit eastern areas and caused losses of
hundreds of millions dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic's economic recovery began from 1994. After
consecutive decrease of 14.2, 6.4 and 0.9 percent from 1991 to
1993, the country's gross domestic product rose 4.8 and 4.4
percent in 1995 and 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Second Iberoamerican
Urban Development Forum opened in the Margarita Island, Venezuela,
today, attended by ministers from 21 countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera presided over the meeting
and said the family is the basis for the resolution of the social
problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the attention to the housing problem, especially
popular housing, is fundamental for a social policy based on moral
principles and also inspires to strengthen the democratic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The housing issue is very important from the economic point of
view because it is a source of employment and has a profound and
defined social orientation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iberoamerican forum "is giving all the importance it
deserves to this aspect, which is significant for the life of our
nations," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Italian Experts Predicts Lower Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian experts have predicted
that the country's inflation, measured by the consumer price
index, will fall to 1.4 percent in September from 1.5 percent in
August, with a chance of falling to as low as 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation remains under control and appears to have weathered
the super-dollar," the ANSA news agency quoted Paolo Casadio, a
macro-economist for the Credito Italiano bank, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Casadio said he did not believe this summer's hike in the value
of the U.S. will effect consumer prices in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Analyses show prices stable in all sectors, including fuels,
with prices for farm goods falling and no increases expected for
clothing, health care, entertainment, hotels and furniture.
</P>
<P>
This would indicate a monthly increase in the consumer price
index of 0.2 percent which would bring down the 12-month rate to
1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts from the Confindustria studies center also saw
inflation declining to 1.3-1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
ANSA quoted other Italian experts as saying that prices are
expected to remain stable for the rest of the year.

<HEADLINE> CPC Establishes Deng Xiaoping Theory as Its Guiding Ideology (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Party General Secretary Jiang
Zemin announed here today that the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee proposed to establish Deng Xiaoping Theory as
the guiding ideology of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 15th CPC national congress, Jiang Zemin
said the Central Committee proposes that the Party, at its
Fifteenth Congress, establish Deng Xiaoping Theory as its guiding
ideology by stipulating in its Constitution that the Chinese
Communist Party takes Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and
Deng Xiaoping Theory as its guide to action.
</P>
<P>
This historic decision has been made by our Party after nearly
20 years of successful practice of the reform, opening up and the
socialist modernization drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin said that Deng Xiaoping Theory is Marxism of
present-day China, representing a new stage of development of
Marxism in China.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
opened at the Great Hall of the People here this morning.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the congress, Jiang Zemin said that the soul
of the current congress is to hold high the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory and that this will be the hallmark of this
congress in the annals of history.
</P>
<P>
During the new period of the socialist reform, opening up and
modernization drive and the cross-century new journey ahead, he
said, "we must hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory
and apply it to our entire cause and all our undertakings. This is
an unshakable conclusion the Party has drawn from the past and
present realities."
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the Chinese Communist Party attaches great
importance to the guiding role of theory. Since the Chinese people
found Marxism-Leninism, he said, the Chinese revolution has taken
on an entirely new look. The integration of Marxism-Leninism with
China's reality has experienced two historic leaps, resulting in
two great theories.
</P>
<P>
The result of the first leap was the theoretical principles
concerning the revolution and construction in China and a summary
of experience therein, both of which have been proved correct by
practice. "Its principal founder being Mao Zedong, our Party has
called it Mao Zedong Thought," Jiand said.
</P>
<P>
The result of the second leap was the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics. "Its principal founder
being Deng Xiaoping, our Party has called it Deng Xiaoping
Theory," Jiang said. These two great theories so achieved are the
crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom
of the Party and the people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that Deng Xiaoping Theory, a continuation and
development of Mao Zedong Thought, is a correct theory guiding the
Chinese people in successfully accomplishing their socialist
modernization in the process of reform and opening to the outside
world.

<HEADLINE> CPC Establishes Deng Xiaoping Theory as Its Guiding Ideology (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He listed the reasons for Deng Xiaoping Theory to become a new
stage of development of Marxism in China:
</P>
<P>
First, Deng Xiaoping Theory, upholding the principles of
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, not only
inherits the achievements of predecessors but also breaks with
outmoded conventions on the basis of new practice, and explores a
new realm for Marxism.
</P>
<P>
Second, Deng Xiaoping Theory, upholding the basic achievements
of the theory and practice of scientific socialism, has grappled
with the fundamental question of what socialism is and how to
build it and incisively expounded the essence of socialism,
raising our understanding of socialism to a new scientific level.
To emancipate the mind in the new period, the key lies in doing it
on this question, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Third, Deng Xiaoping Theory, persisting in observing the world
in the broad perspective of Marxism, has made new, scientific
judgments on the basis of correctly analyzing the features of the
times and the overall international situation, the success or
failure of other socialist countries in the world, the gains or
losses of the developing countries in seeking development, and the
trend of development and the conflicts of the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, Deng Xiaoping Theory constitutes a new, scientific
system of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
For the first time it has given preliminary but systematic
answers to a series of basic questions concerning the road to
socialism in China, the stages of development, the fundamental
tasks, the motive force, the external conditions, the political
guarantee, the strategic steps, Party leadership, the forces to be
relied on, and the reunification of the motherland. It has guided
the Chinese Communist Party in formulating the basic line for the
primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping was a great Marxist, Jiang said. He performed
immortal deeds for the independence and liberation of the Chinese
nation, for the establishment of the socialist system in China and
for its reform, opening up and modernization drive. He dedicated
all his life to the Chinese people, with the interests of the
people as the starting point and objective in everything he did.
His greatest contribution to the Party, the people and Marxism, or
his valuable legacy to us, is Deng Xiaoping Theory. This theory is
embodied in the works of Deng Xiaoping and the important documents
of the Party and the state written since the Third Plenary Session
of the Eleventh Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Marxism is a science, which is firmly based on
objective facts. Marxism will necessarily advance along with the
development of the times, practice and science; it cannot remain
unchanged. In present-day China, Jiang noted, Marxism-Leninism,
Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory constitute a unified
scientific system imbued with the same spirit. Adhering to Deng
Xiaoping Theory means genuinely adhering to Marxism-Leninism and
Mao Zedong Thought; upholding the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory
means genuinely upholding the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao
Zedong Thought.

<HEADLINE> China Still in Primary Stage of Socialism, Says Jiang Zemin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China is currently in the
primary stage of socialism and will remain in this stage for a
long time to come, said Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, here today.
</P>
<P>
In his report delivered at the 15th National Party Congress,
Jiang said since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central
Committee, the Party has correctly analyzed China's conditions and
formulated the scientific thesis that China is still in the
primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
"The reason why we are laying further emphasis on this question
at the current congress is that, in the face of the arduous tasks
of tackling hard issues in the reform and creating a new
situation, the key to resolving various contradictions, dispelling
doubts and understanding why we must carry out the existing line
and policies and not any other line and policies lies in our
unified, correct understanding of the basic conditions in China
today in the primary stage of socialism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Socialism is the primary stage of communism and China is in
the primary stage of socialism, that is, the stage of
underdevelopment, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"That is to say, if we really want to build socialism in China,
we should proceed in everything we do only from the actual
situation of the primary stage of socialism, and not from our
subjective desire, nor from this or that kind of foreign models,
nor from the dogmatic interpretations of some theses in Marxist
works, nor from certain erroneous viewpoints imposed on Marxism,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The primary stage of socialism is a historical stage in which
China should gradually put an end to underdevelopment and realize
socialist modernization by and large, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted it will take at least a century to complete this
historical process. It will take a much longer period of time to
consolidate and develop the socialist system, and it will require
persistent struggle by many generations, a dozen or even several
dozens.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the fundamental reasons for China's failures in
building socialism prior to the convocation of the Third Plenary
Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is that some of its
tasks and policies overstepped the primary stage of socialism. One
of the basic reasons for the achievements in the reform, opening
up and the modernization drive over the past two decades is that
China corrected the erroneous concepts and policies transcending
the primary stage of socialism and rejected the erroneous
proposition that China should give up the basic system of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental task of socialism is to develop the productive
forces. During the primary stage, it is all the more necessary to
give first priority to concentrating on their development, said
Jiang.

<HEADLINE> China Still in Primary Stage of Socialism, Says Jiang Zemin (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said the principal contradiction in society in China is the
one between the growing material and cultural needs of the people
and the backwardness of production. This principal contradiction
will remain throughout the process of China's primary stage of
socialism and in all activities of society. Hence China is
destined to make economic development the central task of the
entire Party and the whole country and make sure that all other
work is subordinated to and serves this task.
</P>
<P>
In the primary stage of socialism, focusing on the fundamental
task of developing the productive forces, he said China should
take reform as the motive force for promoting all the work in
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In the primary stage of socialism, it is of the utmost
importance to balance reform, development and stability and to
maintain a stable political environment and public order. "Without
stability, nothing could be achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must uphold the leadership by the Party and the people's
democratic dictatorship. We should promote material progress and
cultural and ethical progress, attaching equal importance to both.
We must eliminate all factors jeopardizing stability, oppose
bourgeois liberalization and guard against the infiltrating,
subversive and splitist activities of the international and
domestic hostile forces," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current China as at a historical moment when the
country is advancing its cause to the 21st century in an all-round
way, Jiang Zemin urged the whole Party to firmly adhere to the
Party's basic line for the primary stage of socialism and, in the
great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
combine the central task of economic development with the two
basic points -- adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles (keeping
to the socialist road and upholding the people's democratic
dictatorship, leadership by the Communist Party, and
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought), and the reform and
opening up.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most valuable experience our Party has gained in
the past two decades and the most reliable guarantee for the
victorious advance of our cause," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin also elaborated three points in building socialist
economy, politics and culture with Chinese characteristics in the
primary stage of socialism:
</P>
<P>
-- Building a socialist economy with Chinese characteristics
means developing a market economy under socialism and constantly
emancipating and developing the productive forces.
</P>
<P>
-- Building socialist politics with Chinese characteristics
means managing state affairs according to law and developing
socialist democracy under the leadership of the Communist Party of
China and with the people as the masters of the country.
</P>
<P>
-- Building a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics
means taking Marxism as the guidance, aiming at training people so
that they have high ideals, moral integrity, a good education and
a strong sense of discipline, and developing a national,
scientific and popular socialist culture geared to the needs of
modernization, of the world and of the future. The aforementioned
basic targets of building a socialist economy, politics and
culture with Chinese characteristics and the basic policies are
well integrated and inseparable. They constitute the basic program
of the Party for the primary stage of socialism, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on China's Ownership Structure (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said
here today that the public sector includes not only the state- and
collectively-owned sectors, but also the state- and
collectively-owned elements in the sector of mixed ownership.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted in the 15th National Party Congress which opened
here today that public ownership can and should take diversified
forms. All management methods and organizational forms that mirror
the laws governing socialized production may be utilized boldly.
</P>
<P>
It is China's basic economic system for the primary stage of
socialism to retain a dominant position for public ownership and
to develop diverse forms of ownership side by side, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted the establishment of such a system is determined by
the socialist nature and the reality of China in the primary stage
of socialism:
</P>
<P>
First, being a socialist country, China must keep to public
ownership as the foundation of its socialist economic system;
second, being in the primary stage of socialism, China needs to
develop diverse forms of ownership with public ownership in the
dominant position; and third, any form of ownership that meets the
criterion of the "three favorables" (favorable to developing the
productive forces in the socialist society, to consolidating
China's comprehensive national strength and to raising people's
living standard) can and should be utilized to serve socialism.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Party congress, Jiang urged the entire
country to see the full meaning of the public sector of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the dominant position of public ownership should
manifest itself mainly as follows: Public assets dominate in the
total assets in society and the state-owned sector controls the
life-blood of the national economy and plays a leading role in
economic development. This is the case for the country as a whole.
There may be differences in some localities and industries.
Dominance of the public assets should feature in quantitative
terms, but more so in terms of improved quality. The leading role
of the state-owned sector should manifest itself mainly in its
control power. China should make a strategic readjustment of the
pattern of the state-owned sector of the economy. The state-owned
sector must be in a dominant position in major industries and key
areas that concern the life-blood of the national economy. But in
other areas, efforts should be made to rearrange assets and
readjust the structure so as to strengthen the focal points and
improve the quality of the state assets as a whole.
</P>
<P>
On the premise that China keeps public ownership in the
dominant position, that the state controls the life-blood of the
national economy and that the state-owned sector has stronger
control power and is more competitive, even if the state-owned
sector accounts for a smaller proportion of the economy, this will
not affect the socialist nature of our country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on China's Ownership Structure (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang noted that the collectively-owned sector is an important
component of the public sector of the economy. The collective
economy is able to reflect the principle of common prosperity,
extensively absorb funds that are scattered in society, ease
employment pressure and help increase public accumulation and
state tax receipts.
</P>
<P>
" We should support, encourage and help all forms of collective
economy in their development in the urban and rural areas, which
will be of great significance to the public sector of the economy
in playing its dominant role, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the country to strive to seek various forms for
materializing public ownership that can greatly promote the growth
of the productive forces.
</P>
<P>
The joint stock system, he said, is a form of capital
organization of modern enterprises, which is favorable for
separating ownership from management and raising the efficiency of
the operation of enterprises and capital. It can be used both
under capitalism and under socialism.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say in general terms that the joint stock system is
public or private, for the key lies in who holds the controlling
share. If the state or a collective holds the controlling share,
it obviously shows the characteristics of public ownership, which
is favorable to expanding the area of control by public capital
and enhancing the dominant role of public ownership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the congress that now there have appeared a large
number of diverse forms of joint stock partnerships in the urban
and rural areas. They are new things arising in the process of
reform.
</P>
<P>
"We should support them, give them guidance, constantly
sum up their experience and improve them. What should be specially
advocated and encouraged is the kind of collective economy that
features, in the main, the association of laborers in labor and
capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
The non-public sector is an important component part of China's
socialist market economy. "We should continue to encourage and
guide the non-public sector comprising self-employed and private
businesses to facilitate its sound development, " said Jiang,
adding that this is of great importance to satisfying the diverse
needs of the people and promoting the development of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said it is necessary to improve the legal system concerning
property and protect the legitimate rights and interests of and
fair competition among all types of enterprises and at the same
time exercise supervision and control over them according to law.

<TEXT>
<P>
Aiming at improving the state sector of the economy as a whole,
China will effectuate a strategic reorganization of state-owned
enterprises by managing well large enterprises while adopting a
flexible policy toward small ones.
</P>
<P>
By using capital as the bonds and relying on the market forces,
China will establish highly competitive large enterprise groups
with trans-regional, inter-trade, cross-ownership and
trans-national operations. China will also quicken the pace in
relaxing the control over small state-owned enterprises and
invigorating them by way of reorganization, association, merger,
leasing, contract operation, joint stock partnership or sell-off,
the top Party official said.
</P>
<P>
"We should encourage merger of enterprises, standardize
bankruptcy procedures, divert laid-off workers, increase
efficiency by downsizing staff and encourage reemployment projects
so as to form a competitive mechanism selecting the superior and
eliminating the inferior," he said.
</P>
<P>
On improving the structure and mode of distribution, Jiang said
China will combine remuneration according to work and remuneration
according to factors of production put in and by giving priority
to efficiency with due consideration to equity.
</P>
<P>
"We shall protect lawful incomes according to law, allowing and
encouraging part of the people to get wealthy first through honest
labor and lawful operations, and allowing and encouraging the use
of capital, technology and other factors of production to
participate in the distribution of gains," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that all illegal earnings shall be banned and
China will take stock of irrational incomes and regulate the
excessively high incomes, improve the individual income tax
system, introduce such new taxes as inheritance tax, and
standardize income distribution so as to make income gaps more
reasonable and prevent polarization.
</P>
<P>
On coordinated growth of the regional economies, Jiang said the
state will increase its support for the central and western parts
by giving them priority in planning infrastructure and resources
development projects, instituting step by step a standard payment
transfer system, and encouraging both Chinese and overseas
investors to invest in the regions. It is necessary to further
develop all forms of association and cooperation between the
eastern and the central and western parts. "We shall pay more
attention and give active support to areas inhabited by ethnic
minorities in their economic development. We must try all possible
ways to minimize the regional development disparities step by
step," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that opening to the outside world is a
long-term basic state policy.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the globalization trend in the economic,
scientific and technological development, China will take an even
more active stance in the world by improving the pattern of
opening up in all directions, at all levels and in a wide range,
developing an open economy, enhancing our international
competitiveness, optimizing our economic structure and improving
the quality of its national economy.
</P>
<P>
China will further lower the general level of tariffs and
encourage the import of advanced technologies and key equipment.
</P>
<P>
"We shall use foreign capital actively, rationally and
effectively. We shall open the service trade step by step. In
accordance with the law, we shall protect the rights and interests
of foreign-funded enterprises, grant them the same treatment as
their Chinese counterparts and improve guidance to and regulation
of these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We shall encourage Chinese investors to invest abroad in areas
that can bring China's comparative advantages into play so as to
make better use of both Chinese and foreign markets and resources.
We shall improve and enforce laws and statutes governing China's
trade and economic relations with foreign countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the congress that China will better operate the
special economic zones and the Pudong New Area in Shanghai,
encouraging them to continue to march in the forefront by playing
their demonstrative, diffusive and leading roles in making
institutional creations, upgrading industries and opening wider to
the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine: More Talk Than Action in Fighting Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Corruption is now widely viewed
as a real threat to the normal functioning of the Ukrainian
government although talk about graft and efforts to stop it have
been going the rounds of the East European country for some time.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe Ukraine must resort to harsher measures since
official corruption is not just a major disruption at home. The
world community directly ties credit allocations to how
effectively the government battles the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian law on state service provides law enforcement
agencies with more control over officials. The three-year-old law
calls for all officials to take an oath of loyalty to the state
before starting their service.
</P>
<P>
"Yet the law is hardly ever applied in practice," says Maxim
Shendryk, who heads the anti-corruption department of the Ministry
of Internal Affairs (MIA).
</P>
<P>
"Officials simply do everything they can to avoid taking this
oath," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to avoiding their oath of office, some officials
are often very reluctant to declare their incomes.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Lelikov, who chairs the main state services department,
says that only 92 percent of officials in national agencies
submitted income declarations.
</P>
<P>
The worst violators in this area appeared in the Defense and
Justice Ministries, Lelikov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the anti-corruption law stipulates that information on
incomes, securities, real estate and bank deposits of cabinet
members and their relatives must be published in the official
media. This rarely happens.
</P>
<P>
"By itself, declaring income is not the answer," says Valery
Ratsiuk, deputy head of the MIA Organized Crime Division. "Since
there's no developed mechanism for registering incomes and
expenses of individuals at present."
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has determined to improve the
image of his country through sweeping away corrupt officials. He
set up the National Bureau of Investigation in April to monitor
how officials comply with laws, but corruption cases are rarely
launched against top officials.
</P>
<P>
Local media cited the most telling example that involved former
Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zviagilsky, who fled to Europe and
then Israel after being charged with abuse of power and
graft. Zviagilsky returned to Kiev this March claiming innocence,
but authorities appeared to have done nothing to close the case.
</P>
<P>
There has not been a single high-profile case against a top
official in this former Soviet republic, though there are many
instances where officials use their power to take advantage of
business deals, Lelikov noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed pessimism over the present situation, and
said: "Corruption looms large in the Ukrainian society, everybody
talks about it but refuses to take any real action for fear of
confronting big bosses."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Reviews Past and Looks into New Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- In the first decade to come,
China will establish a more or less ideal socialist market
economy, and by the middle of the next century the modernization
program will have been accomplished by and large and China will
have become a prosperous, strong, democratic and culturally
advanced socialist country, said Jiang Zemin here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 15th National Party Congress which opened this
morning, Jiang, general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, said earth-shaking changes have taken
place in China over the past century from 1900 when the
Eight-Power Allied Forces occupied Beijing, subjecting the Chinese
nation to great humiliation and bringing the country to the verge
of subjugation, to the year 2000 when China will enjoy a fairly
comfortable life on the basis of socialism and take big strides
toward the goal of being prosperous and strong.
</P>
<P>
He said the past century has witnessed the Chinese people
undergoing three tremendous historic changes on their road of
advance and the birth of Sun Yat-sen, Mao Zedong and Deng
Xiaoping, three great men who stood at the forefront of the times.
</P>
<P>
The first change, he said, was represented by the Revolution of
1911, which overthrew the autocratic monarchy reigning in China
for thousands of years. Led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the revolution
pioneered the national and democratic revolution in the true sense
in modern times.
</P>
<P>
The second change, Jiang said, was marked by the founding of
the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the
socialist system. This was accomplished after the founding of the
Communist Party of China and under the direction of the first
generation of collective leadership with Mao Zedong at the core.
</P>
<P>
"This was a great victory of the people's revolution which had
never been recorded in Chinese history, a great victory of global
significance for socialism and national liberation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The third change, Jiang said, was featured by the reform,
opening up and the endeavor to achieve socialist modernization. It
was a new revolution initiated by the second generation of
collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping at the core.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion drawn from the great changes over the past
century is as follows: Only the Communist Party of China can lead
the Chinese people in achieving victories of national
independence, the people's liberation and socialism, pioneering
the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
rejuvenating the nation, making the country prosperous and strong
and improving the people's well-being, he said.
</P>
<P>
When the world is heading toward the end of the 20th century,
Jiang said the CPC realizes that "the Party shoulders a lofty
historical responsibility for the destiny of the Chinese nation."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Achievements over Past Five Years (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The five years since Deng
Xiaoping gave talks during his visit to the South and the Party
held its 14th National Congress in 1992 have been no ordinary
years, said Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin in his report to
the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which
opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in his report that over the past five years, the
work of the whole Party has been highlighted in the all-round
implementation of the Party's basic theory and basic line, the
conscientious enforcement of the important policy decisions of the
Fourteenth Congress, the formulation of and adherence to the basic
principle of "seizing the current opportunity to deepen the reform
and open China wider to the outside world, promoting development
and maintaining stability", and the fostering of both material
progress and cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Major advancement has been made again in developing China's
productive forces, increasing the overall national strength and
improving the people's living standards, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Fourteenth Congress made three policy decisions of
far-reaching significance, he said. One, seize opportunities to
speed up development; two, define the establishment of a socialist
market economy as the goal of economic restructuring in China; and
three, establish the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics in the whole
Party.
</P>
<P>
Practice of the five years shows, Jiang said, the policy
decisions made at the 14th National Congress are correct and that
the Party is capable of handling complex domestic and
international situations.
</P>
<P>
He said that marked successes were attained in economic
development over the past five years. From 1992 through 1996, the
gross domestic product rose by 12.1 percent a year on the average.
Rapid economic growth was registered while inflation was brought
under effective control, and thus drastic fluctuation was avoided.
</P>
<P>
Notable headway was made in economic restructuring. Greater
attention was paid to agriculture and the output of grain and
other farm produce increased steadily. Infrastructure including
water conservancy, transport and telecommunications and basic
industries such as iron and steel and energy industries expanded
swiftly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic growth was witnessed in the eastern part of the
country and the pace of economic development was speeded up in the
central and western parts as well.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth Five-Year Plan was crowned with success, and a good
beginning has been recorded in the implementation of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan, he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of teens
getting pregnant in the United States has dropped significantly
since 1991, said Federal health officials.
</P>
<P>
The 12 percent drop for all girls nationally, comes after a
sharp rise in teen pregnancies during the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Vermont, with a 26.9-percent dip, led the country in recent
declines. Alaska followed with a 23.3-percent drop, and then came
Maine with a 22.7-percent decline. Texas witnessed the smallest
drop of 3.6-percent.
</P>
<P>
The information was released by the Centers for Disease Control

</P>
<P>
"This is the result of a lot of effort and a lot of education,"
CDCP researcher Stephanie Ventura was quoted as saying by the
United Press International.
</P>
<P>
Ventura says teen pregnancies peaked in 1991 with 62.1 births
per 1,000, after a 24 percent rise that began in 1981. The 1996
rate is 54.7 per 1,000. In 1996, an estimated 505,514 women under
20 gave birth in the United States.

<P>
DOHA, Qatar, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China won its first Asian
title in 18 years after beating Japan 3-1 in the Asian Men's
Volleyball Championship here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team last won the Asian title in 1979. Since then,
the Chinese spikers had won several Asian Games titles but could
not match their Japanese and South Korean counterparts in the
Asian Championships.
</P>
<P>
In the last match of the single round-robin finals on Thursday,
the Chinese spikers played a high-spirited game by taking the
first set 15-12 after 40 minutes' fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team took advantage of tight blocking in the first
set and forced the Japanese team into a handful of errors.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese team suddenly lost their rhythm of attacking
and blocking in the second set and enabled the Japanese to come
back into the game and win the set 15-8.
</P>
<P>
The third set saw the Chinese team in total control again.
Enjoying an advantage in height and blocking, the Chinese team
surged ahead 2-1 with a 15-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth set, the Japanese team fought desperatly and once
led 9-6.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese spikers never gave up and staged a superb
come-back by taking 8 points in a row to take a 14-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
The usually steady Japanese team collapsed and though they
narrowed the gap to 10-14 they could not stop their Chinese
opponents from winning the match point and claiming the title
15-10.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team dropped only one set in their five outings at
the championship.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Australia beat Chinese Taipei 3-0 to take
the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Twice Asian champions South Korea finished only fifth. It is
the first time that South Korea failed to enter the top four in
the history of Asian Championships.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Croats Agree to Participate in Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The main Bosnian Croat party
agreed late today to participate in local elections in Bosnia
after two days of intense negotiations with international envoys
here.
</P>
<P>
The discussions, and mounting pressure on Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman, came after the Bosnian wing of the Croatian
Democratic Union (HDZ) threatened earlier this week to boycott the
first polls since the Bosnian war ended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ accused the rules for the elections, scheduled for this
weekend, of being unfair. They insisted that voter registration
had put Croat voters at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
which is organizing the voting, said it would make some "agreed
corrections."
</P>
<P>
OSCE envoys met Tudjman and Bosnian Croat representatives for
three hours and hammered out an agreement just before midnight.
</P>
<P>
Kresimir Zubak, the Croat member of Bosnia's three-man
collective presidency, said all the most important issues had been
solved.
</P>
<P>
Now that the Bosnian Serbs have also dropped their threat to
boycott the polls, all three main nationalist parties in Bosnia
will take part in the elections on Saturday and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Identify Previously Unknown Dinosaur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
identified a previously unknown dinosaur from fossils found in
northeast China's Liaoning province, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
The fossils, unearthed in late 1995 and show a row of
feather-like structures runing from the animals' head to its
tail. Some scientists thus thought that they belonged to an
ancient ancestor of modern birds, possibly pre-dating the
Archaeopteryx.
</P>
<P>
The find was initially named Sinosauropterys", meaning "China
lizard wing", the paper says.
</P>
<P>
However, a group of scientists from Nanjing and Beijing made a
conclusion that the fossils are of a new species of small
dinosaur, similar to the compsagnathus, a dinosaur whose remains
are found in America.
</P>
<P>
They found that the creature had ten cervical vertebrae, 13
back vertebrae and 50 tail vertebrae. Its tail was twice as long
as the body. And it was possibly a meat-eating dinosaur, the paper
says.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that further scientific study was needed to
clarify the feather-like structure and function, according to the
paper.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bank Profits Up 5.8 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Profits at U.S. commercial
banks increased to a record 14.6 billion dollars in the second
quarter despite hefty losses on credit-card loans, the U.S.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by the strong economy, the profits in the U.S. banking
industry jumped by 5.8 percent in the second quarter from 13.8
billion dollars in the same period of 1996,
</P>
<P>
FDIC Chairman Andrew Hove said the strong performance resulted
mainly from a surge in lending growth, especially for commercial
and industrial loans.
</P>
<P>
"We have enjoyed 18 consecutive quarters -- four-and-a-half
years -- where quarterly profits have exceeded 10 billion dollars,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the record rate of losses on credit cards in
the second quarter continued to parallel the high level of
personal bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
Losses on credit-card loans accounted for two-thirds of all
loan losses reported by commercial banks during the quarter,
according to the FDIC, which supervises savings and loans in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Banks declared as uncollectible an annualized 5.22 percent of
credit card balances in the second quarter, up from 4.48 percent a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
It is the highest quarterly rate for credit-card loans in the
14 years that banks have reported such data, the FDIC said.
</P>
<P>
The losses have been especially hard on banks that specialize
in credit-card lending. Of the 74 such institutions in the U.S.,
35 reported declining income in the second quarter, the FDIC said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Mali secured a quarter-final
seat at the Under-17 World Soccer Championship after crushing its
strong opponent Mexico 3-1 in a fierce fight here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two Group B teams, each with 4 points in stock, played a
game of life and death since the kickoff and staged ominous
attacks in front of the other's net.
</P>
<P>
Sega Diakite opened the account for Mali in the 39th minute,
slipping the ball into the net in a melee in the penalty area.
Five minutes into the second half, Seydou Keita added another
goal.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to reverse its misfortune, Mexico went all out on
counter-attacks. In the 63th minute, Luis Ernesto Perez Gomez
converted a short pass.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes before time, Keita, taking advantage of a 12-yard
kick, scored the second goal for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Spain, which has already qualified for the quarter-finals in
Group B, routed New Zealand 5-0 in Ismailia, the Egyptian Suez
Canal city.
</P>
<P>
Oman and Brazil, both had booked a seat in the last eight,
determined their placing in Group C in the last match played in
Alexandria. Brazil took the upper hand by defeating Oman 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Both out of the race for the championship, the U.S. embarassed
Austria 4-0 in a face-saving match in Port Said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the last four group matches played Thursday, Spain, Mali,
Brazil and Oman joined Germany, Egypt of Group A and Ghana and
Argentina of Group D to enter the last eight.
</P>

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champions and hosts
the Netherlands have lived up to their reputation by leading the
round-robin group preliminaries that ended Thursday at the
European men's volleyball championship.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch did not drop a single set en route to winning all
their outings in group B. They blanked Bulgaria in their fifth
and last outing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands will next meet world league titlists Italy in
Saturday's semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The Italians were squeezed into second place in group A as they
lost their second-round tie 3-0 to Yugoslavia that went on to lead
the group preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
Both Italy and Yugoslavia scored four wins against one defeat
with a similar tally of sets won and lost in the six-team group
preliminaries. Yugoslavia topped the team standing due to its
victory over Italy.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia play France in the other semi-final tie.
</P>
<P>
France stole the day's highlight in a dramatic qualifying match
with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The French spikers won the first two sets 15-13, 15-8 but
conceded the ensuing two sets 10-15, 3-15, setting up a
tiebreaking fifth set.
</P>
<P>
In the decisive set in which each winning play counted toward a
point no matter which team was serving, the Ukrainians led the
French up till 8-6 when they changed ends of court.
</P>
<P>
Two wild smashes betrayed Ukraine of its lead and the two sides
went from 9-9 to 16-16, tying the set six times before deadlocking
at 17-each.
</P>
<P>
An unforced error at serve cost the Ukrainians dearly again
while the French turned the odds of serving in the tiebreaker into
a killing smash to seal the set and the match away from their
opponents at 19-17. The match took three hours and a half to
finish.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Italy beat Russia 3-0; Slovakia
defeated Greece 3-1 while Yugoslavia downed Germany in straight
sets all in group A.
</P>
<P>
Group B actions saw the Czech Republic labor heavily before
defeating winless Finland three sets to two.
</P>
<P>
Like the semi-finals that dramatically paired off the reigning
Olympic champions with the world league titlists, the playoffs for
fifth through eighth places were to be full of drama as Slovakia
is due to play the Czech Republic while Ukraine duo with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia and the Czech Republic had been one country while
Ukraine and Russia had both been former republics of the Soviet
Union.

<HEADLINE> China Represents New Market of Next Millennium, Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China's economy offers
extraordinary opportunities for business and represents the "new
market of the next millennium," a Canadian banker said here today.
</P>
<P>
Matthew W. Barrett, chairman and chief executive officer of
Bank of Montreal, made the remarks in a speech to the Canada-China
Business Council and the Hong Kong-Canada Business Association
luncheon.
</P>
<P>
"China, the new market of the next millennium, engages us all
-- as individuals, as citizens of the international community, and
as corporate executives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, China amounted to "a little more than a vast
planned, subsistence economy". Deng Xiaoping's reforms has
transformed the country.
</P>
<P>
"Today, China is richer and freer than at any time in its
modern history," Barrett noted.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted China's tremendous economic growth:
</P>
<P>
-- China has seen an average real growth since 1980 of just
about 10 percent. In the past five years, it has been closer to an
average of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- In the past four years, inflation has fallen from 25 percent
to 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- China has become a trade giant, with trade 290 billion U.S.
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
-- China has absorbed nearly 200 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign investment, and is second only to the United States as a
destination for foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
-- And most important, millions of Chinese have shaken off
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Barrett said he has been to China on a regular basis during the
past few years. "Yet so great is the pace of change that I feel I
am arriving in a different place each time."
</P>
<P>
"During the last 20 years, China has generated more growth for
more people in a shorter time than any other period in history.
</P>
<P>
"Bank of Montreal, which is dedicated to serving the growing
international needs of its clients, refuses to be immune to such a
mega-trend in world history," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Bank of Montreal, the third largest
commercial bank of Canada, opened a new branch in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It became the first Canadian bank and the third North American
bank to open a full branch in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Barrett announced today that the bank's board of directors will
meet in Beijing on September 29.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first time, in 180 years, that our board has
met outside the North American continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The board meeting in Beijing represents the bank's strategic
interest in China, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Promote UN Reform at 52nd General Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Permanent
Representative of the United States to the United Nations, Bill
Richardson, pledged here today that the U.S. would promote a
comprehensive reform of the world body at the forthcoming U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Richardson told reporters at a press briefing that the
principal priorities and goals of the United States for the 52nd
U.N. General Assembly is to push forward the U.N. reform
momentum.
</P>
<P>
The 52nd U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to open on
September 16 at the U.N. headquarters in New York. Dozens of heads
of States and Governments as wells high representatives from 185
member states are expected to come here to express their opinions
about current world situations and development of the world body.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that he believed the U.N.'s core mission in the
years ahead should be focused on issues of peace and security,
sustainable development, humanitarian response and social
progress.
</P>
<P>
"Reform momentum is now part of UN culture," the U.S.
Representative said while voicing full support to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
Annan put forward a comprehensive U.N. reform plan in mid-July,
including a cut of U.N. regular budget and personnel in the
Secretariat as well as a new post of Deputy U.N.
Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that Annan's reform efforts starting earlier in
the year had already improved the U.N.'s financial and personnel
management, strengthened oversight and enhanced the Secretariat's
effectiveness and efficiency in carrying out intergovernmental
mandate.

<HEADLINE> Reno: Anti-Crime Legislation Help Reduce Crime Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Crime rates have kept
dropping since President Bill Clinton signed landmark anti-crime
legislation three years ago, Attorney General Janet Reno said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Federal, state and local authorities used the law to toughen
enforcement, strengthen punishment and fight violence against
women, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has handed out enough three-year grants
to pay for placing 65,000 more police officers on the nation's
streets, she added.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in Congress have said Americans owe more thanks to
changing demographics than to the anti-crime bill. They contend
crime remains much too high, and experts have said the
administration is reaping the benefit of a baby boomer generation
mellowed with age.
</P>
<P>
However, Reno said that more work needs to be done, especially
on ways to prevent and deal with youth violence.
</P>
<P>
"It is now important that we build on our progress though
continued cooperation with state and local enforcement and through
the development of prevention programs that can give our
youngsters a chance for a strong and positive future," she said.
</P>
<P>
Reno has urged Congress to alter juvenile justice bills being
debated in Congress. She said the bills focus too heavily on
getting tough with teen-agers, not enough on after-school programs
that keep potential offenders occupied.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the crime bill September 13, 1994, promising to
give local communities enough money to put more than 100,000
additional officers on the nation's streets by 2000.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The deadly epidemic of
AIDS is slowing down in the United States as it was no longer No.
one killer of the nation's young and middle-age adults, said a
desease control center today.
</P>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today that
a 26 percent drop overall in the rate of AIDS deaths between 1995
and 1996 placed the desease to the second leading cause of death
for people between 25 and 44 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Accidents, such as falls and car crashes, are the leading cause
of death for the group that accounts for more than half the
nation's workforce. Cancer is No. 3, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS death rate in 1996 fell to 11.6 deaths per 100,000
people, down 26 percent from a rate of 15.6 the previous year, the
CDC said. For adults between 25 and 44, the rate fell to 27.2
deaths from a rate of 36.9 in 1995. In 1994, the rate was 36.7 in
that age group.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chose 10 Rivers for Revitalization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton, declaring rivers "the lifeblood of our nations," launched
an effort today to designate 10 waterways as American Heritage
rivers that will get extra federal attention.
</P>
<P>
A designation under the program will allow communities, through
a liaison called a "river navigator," to tap existing federal
resources and expertise in protecting and restoring the waterway
beginning early next year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, created
by executive order, is "a big deal to millions of people" who care
about great cities built on riverbanks.
</P>
<P>
"Rivers have always been the lifeblood of our nations," Clinton
said. "They nourish our cities, they feed our soils, they allow us
to expand our territory in commerce. They permit us, millions upon
millions of us, to fish.... This is a big part of what we are."
</P>
<P>
Efforts to get an American Heritage designation already are
underway for at least five rivers, including the Upper Mississippi
River, which flows from northern Minnesota to St. Louis; the
Connecticut River in New England; the Yellowstone River in
Wyoming; the French Broad River in North Carolina and Tennessee;
and the Willamette River in Oregon.

<HEADLINE> Race Commission Chairman Calls Task "Daunting" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Historian John Hope
Franklin Thursday pledged to involve every segment of the American
people in a searching examination of the nation's racial
divisions.
</P>
<P>
Franklin, who was appointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton to
head the Commission on Race Relations, said, the effort will
"penetrate every area of American life that has been permeated by
race," Franklin said at a panel discussion on race and racism
sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to forge "a respectful relationship of one person to
another and one race to another so we can hold ourselves up as a
beacon light of equality, freedom and justice for all," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he described his task as the "most daunting and fearsome
task" he had even undertaken with trepidation.
</P>
<P>
Franklin was addressing the panel discussion attended by a
mostly black audience at the University of the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
"For more than 350 years this country has lived with, tolerated
and even accelerated racial injustice," Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
Another speaker, Professor Cornell West of African-American
studies at Harvard University, said that "white supremacy still
saturates and permeates every nook and cranny of American life."
</P>
<P>
Representative John Lewis, a Democrat of Georgia, said the time
has come for a return to nonviolent protest to curb what he said
are attempts to roll back civil rights gains, including
affirmative action to help minorities.
</P>
<P>
"There are powerful forces seeking to undo the progress we have
made," he said. "It is up to us to speak up and speak out, to
organize and to agitate for what is right."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Tung
Chee-hwa, said here today that Hong Kong has been developing
steadily since it returned to the embrace of motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Tung, who flew in New York last night, told a luncheon
participated by representatives of local economic, trade and
financial circles that Hong Kong has withstood recent turbulence
in other Southeast Asian financial markets, showing its finances
and fiscal policy are solid.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamentals in Hong Kong remain extremely strong for the
future," said Tung at the luncheon feted by the Asian Society in
cooperation with The Hong Kong Economic &AMP; Trade Office, The Hong
Kong Association of New York, and The National Committee of
U.S.-China Relations.
</P>
<P>
"We expect GDP growth this year to be around 5.5 percent.
Inflation continues to decline, albeit slowly," the chief
executive said.
</P>
<P>
Tung predicted that with Hong Kong's new airport opening next
year, SAR's quality as an aviation and service hub will "greatly"
improved.
</P>
<P>
"We are following it up with a massive program of rail and
other infrastructure development to further improve our
efficiency and productivity," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sexual Harassment Exists Throughout U.S. Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Sexual harassment exists
throughout the U.S. Army, crossing gender, rank and racial lines,
the service said in a report released today.
</P>
<P>
The report followed a 10-month study of sexual harassment in
the Army after last November's allegations of widespread sexual
misconduct at the U.S. Army Ordnance Center in Aberdeen, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The Army charged 12 staff members at the Aberdeen base with sex
crimes ranging from inappropriate sexual comments to rape.
</P>
<P>
"Sexual harassment exists throughout the Army, crossing gender,
rank and racial lines," the report declared.
</P>
<P>
"Inappropriate behaviors are commonplace... further, soldiers
seem to accept such behaviors as a normal part of Army life,"
added the study, which was conducted by retired, active duty and
senior Army officials.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that sexual discrimination "is more common
through the Army than is sexual harassment," and that the Army's
attempts to educate its trainees and leaders on the issues are
such a failure that many individuals have little understanding of
them, as well as how to report or combat them.
</P>
<P>
As part of its measures to end such harassment scandal, Army
Secretary Togo West and Chief of Staff General Dennis Reimer
announced steps to tighten control over male drill sergeants and
improve the treatment and promotion of female troops.
</P>
<P>
Service will extend "boot camp" recruit training from eight to
nine weeks to better instill values of respect for women, and
prospective drill sergeants will undergo tighter screening,
including psychological testing, to make sure they do not abuse
the absolute power they have over young recruits including women.
</P>
<P>
The measures also will include making women more aware of their
sexual harassment, including attacks on women recruits.
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said that President
Clinton believes the actions being taken by the Army will help
prevent future sexual misconduct.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee-hwa, Chief
Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), stressed here today that China's development poses no
threat to any other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of China's economy is good for everyone," Tung said
at a luncheon hosted by the Asian Society and other three
organizations including The Hong Kong Economic &AMP; Trade Office in
New York.
</P>
<P>
"Larger markets with a broader range of needs for goods and
services provide opportunities to the world at large," the Chief
Executive said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China needs social stability at home and
"China also needs stability and peace in Asia and around the
world."
</P>
<P>
"Like many other developing nations, the strengthening of the
military is not a tool for expansion but a declaration of
independence and a political statement to the international
audience, especially for China after 156 years of humiliation,"
said Tung who flew in here last night during a four-day visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive is scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton at the White House on Friday before leaving for home.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the China-U.S. economic relations, Tung said that
he believed the two nations "are not competitors."
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, there is much room for China and the U.S. to
become complementary economic systems, which could generate
enormous benefits to both parties," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung stressed that Sino-US relations based on mutual trust,
respect and understanding is an important element for Hong Kong's
success.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that there is much synergy between China and the US.
I hope that we will all one day recognize the potential of a
strong Sino-American partnership," he added.
