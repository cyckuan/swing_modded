U.S. Spent About $100B on Y2K Bug
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's Y2K chief defended the expenditure of
an estimated $100 billion to buy new computers and repair computer software code
as "a marvelous accomplishment" and crucial to keeping the nation's most
important computers healthy. The United States, easily the most
technology-dependent nation, spent roughly half the world's total repair costs,
an amount that equaled about $365 for each U.S. resident. But three days into
the new century, questions are being raised about whether the government and
corporate America threw too much at the problem, especially considering apparent
victories overseas where far less was spent.

Israeli-Syrian Talks Open in W. Va.

<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton brought Israeli and Syrian
negotiators to the West Virginia countryside Monday for a fresh round of peace
talks, but there were no face-to-face negotiations between the two antagonists.
Even before the planned three-way session with Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was canceled, officials
played down the possibility that an agreement would be reached. White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met separately
with Barak and al-Sharaa and those sessions "went longer than anticipated."

Putin Fires Yeltsin's Daughter
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin fired Boris Yeltsin's
daughter Monday, moving quickly to distance himself from Yeltsin's
scandal-tinged administration. The speedy removal of Tatyana Dyachenko from her
Kremlin post as "image adviser" sent a clear message to the Russian public that
Putin wants nothing to do with the widespread corruption that has plagued Russia
and may be the single biggest obstacle to the country's development. Dyachenko
had been accused of exercising undue influence over government policy, and has
recently been a focus of an investigation into allegations of Kremlin bribery.

McCain Would Threaten Russia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   AMHERST, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain said
Monday that acting Russian president Vladimir Putin should be urged to end the
conflict with Chechen militants under threat of sanctions. "I'd be talking about
Chechnya every day" were he president, McCain, R-Ariz., told reporters aboard
his campaign bus. "I'd state unequivocally that there would be no more (U.S.)
Export-Import (bank) loans, that the United States would not support any further
IMF funding until this thing is brought to some kind of reasonable conclusion."

Former Intern Appears on CNN
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Focusing on her new role as a weight-loss spokeswoman,
Monica Lewinsky says she hopes her involvement in the scandal that led to
President Clinton's impeachment trial becomes a shrinking historical footnote.
In an appearance Monday on CNN's "Larry King Live," the former White House
intern said she bears some responsibility for what happened to Clinton, but now
she wants to put that part of here life behind her. Ms. Lewinsky, 26, described
herself as "a young woman who had made some private mistakes and who is very
sorry for those mistakes, but was also part of some other forces that she
certainly couldn't control."

Tornado Tears Through Kentucky
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- A strong storm that spawned at least one tornado
ripped through this western Kentucky city on Monday, damaging hundreds of homes
and a college campus. At least 12 people were treated at hospitals, said Ray
Bowman, a state emergency official. Their conditions were not available. The
storm was part of a band of unstable weather that rolled across the nation's
midsection on Monday. Thunderstorms knocked out power in Arkansas and tornadoes
and thunderstorms moved through southeast Missouri. Twisters also touched down
in Mississippi, destroying homes and injuring about a half-dozen people.

	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Grant Hill scored a season-high 42 points as the
Detroit Pistons snapped a 13-game losing streak at Orlando with a 118-106
victory over the Magic on Monday night. Hill, whose previous high was 41 against
Miami in the season opener, made 17 of 30 field goal attempts as the Pistons won
their fourth straight. Orlando, which now holds a 13-7 edge at home against
Detroit, has lost five games in a row.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Hires Former Sega Executive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Mattel Inc. turned to a former Sega of America
executive to lead its troubled interactive toys and software division.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Stolar was named president of Mattel Interactive on Monday, the
division that includes The Learning Company and other software and high-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
	   Stolar engineered the launch of Sega's popular Dreamcast video game console
in the United States before leaving in a clash with the parent company.
</P>
<P>
	   At Mattel, he will try to solve problems at The Learning Company, whose
unexpected $105 million loss in the third quarter stunned investors and
undermined Mattel's 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mattel has some of the strongest brands in the world," Stolar said in a
statement. "I'm looking forward to helping shape Mattel's software and online
product lines."
</P>
<P>
	   Known for independent thinking and a strong relationship with retailers,
Stolar is the sort of leader analysts say Mattel needs to pull its interactive
division out of the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's been around this business for a long time, which is more than you can
say for almost anyone at Mattel, which hasn't been in the (interactive) business
for very long," said Sean McGowan of Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody expected Sega to be as successful in the Dreamcast launch as they
were, and I think he deserves a great deal of credit for that," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Dreamcast was launched in September, Sega has sold 2 million units,
making it the most successful launch of a game device in history, McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stolar, 53, left Sega several weeks before Dreamcast appeared in U.S. stores
after strategy disagreements with the Japanese parent, Sega Enterprises Ltd.
Stolar prevailed on the strategy for Dreamcast's U.S. debut, but lost his job in
the process, McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
	   At Mattel, he will play a key role in Mattel chairwoman and chief executive
Jill E. Barad's plan to reshape the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels toys into a
broader family products company with a strong focus on educational software and
high-tech, interactive toys.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of that strategy, Mattel acquired The Learning Company in May for
$3.6 billion. The company, which makes Carmen Sandiego and other software
titles, was expected to immediately add $50 million to Mattel's third quarter
revenues, but instead lost more than twice that amount.
</P>
<P>
	   Learning Company Chairman Michael Perik, 42, and President Kevin O'Leary,
45, left Mattel in November.
</P>
<P>
	   While Mattel is expected to benefit from Stolar's experience, his
appointment raises the prospect of clashes with Barad, who also is known as a
strong-willed leader.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bernie is certain to have clashes with Jill. It's just the kind of style he
has, but I think what the company needs is someone who can take the tough
steps," McGowan said. "It's no secret to him it's going to be an issue and it's
no secret to her. I'm sure it's something they have addressed, how to handle
these types of conflicts."
</P>
<P>
	   Before joining Sega in 1996, Stolar was executive vice president for Sony
Computer of America, where he helped launch Sony Playstation, another popular
video game console.
</P>
<P>
	   A strong point has been his ability to build enthusiasm among retailers for
the products he sells, said Jeremy Schwartz, an analyst with Forrester Research.
One task at Sega was to sell Dreamcast to retailers who had been burned by an
earlier Sega flop, the Saturn console.
</P>
<P>
	   "They really needed to convince retailers that this was a viable product.
They had a lot of negative impressions to overcome, and I think he was largely
responsible for winning over the retail chains about Dreamcast," Schwartz said.

<HEADLINE> Papa John's Ordered To Pay Damages  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Papa John's was ordered to remove its "Better Ingredients,
Better Pizza" slogan from storefronts and pizza boxes after a jury decided the
pitch was false advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge in the case also ordered Papa John's to pay $468,000 in damages to
Pizza Hut, which filed the lawsuit claiming the slogan and advertising campaign
unfairly maligned its product. The jury ruled in Pizza Hut's favor in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Magistrate William F. Sanderson Jr., ruling by fax Monday, ordered
Louisville-based Papa John's International Inc. to stop using its slogan in ads
by Jan. 24, to stop using pizza boxes and other printed material with the phrase
by March 3 and remove it from restaurant signs by April 3.
</P>
<P>
	   The magistrate further forbade Papa John's from ever using the word "better"
to describe its pizza, and he barred the company from even comparing its pizza
to that of Pizza Hut in future ads.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a landmark victory for consumers and Pizza Hut," said Jonathan
Blum, a vice president and spokesman for Dallas-based Pizza Hut's parent
company, Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. of Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
	   Papa John's will ask Sanderson to delay his order while it appeals the jury
verdict, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This isn't going to change anything we're about," said Papa John's
spokeswoman Karen Sherman. "People buy our pizza because of the pizza, not the
slogan."
</P>
<P>
	   Papa John's spent $300 million promoting the slogan since 1995. Ms. Sherman
said the company does not know how much it would cost to remove it.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial, Papa John's officials and attorneys argued that the
"Better Ingredients, Better Pizza" slogan was merely harmless boasting that
consumers expect to see in commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   Syl Sosnowski, Papa John's vice president of marketing, said the verdict and
Monday's ruling could stifle advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   "Can you imagine Chevy being required to prove that its trucks are really
'Like a Rock' ... or Pizza Hut proving it has the 'Best Pizzas Under One Roof,"'
he said, citing current advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Blum, the Pizza Hut spokesman, said the difference was that Papa John's used
ads to compare its product with others and claim superiority, which carries a
burden of proof. Pizza Hut's "Best Pizzas Under One Roof" ads, he said, make no
such comparisons.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Panic Money Shipped Back to Fed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Armored trucks around the country are carrying back to
the Federal Reserve some of the billions of extra dollars distributed to banks
in case of Y2K panic.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said Monday the temporary displacement should have no significant
impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on Treasury bonds, meanwhile, hit two-year highs as some investors
sold bonds they had been holding as insurance against Year 2000 disruptions. The
selling wave pushed down bond prices, which move inversely to yields.
</P>
<P>
	   "It appears to be money going back home," said David Wyss, chief financial
economist at Standard and Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, government bond prices were driven lower by what Allen Sinai,
chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics, called "the same old
concern: inflation and the Fed" and whether the central bank would raise
interest rates early next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve distributed some $80 billion to banks, thrifts and
credit unions during the fourth quarter of 1999, compared with $23 billion over
the same period a year ago. But some of the extra currency could have been
requested for reasons unrelated to Y2K, such as bank customers' holiday shopping
needs, Fed officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that 2000 has arrived without a run on banks, the banks and other
financial institutions started packing up the surplus currency and sending it
back to regional Federal Reserve banks, as previously planned. The process is
expected to take several days.
</P>
<P>
	   "The funds were just there temporarily," Wyss said. "(The Fed is) going to
take them right back."
</P>
<P>
	   Since most of the Y2K money stayed in bank vaults and didn't get into the
public's hands, there shouldn't be any inflationary effect on the economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Fed needed to provide the extra cushion of cash to reassure the
public, banks and the financial markets, Sinai said from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "No responsible central bank could have done otherwise," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the nation's banking system appeared to be operating largely free
of Y2K glitches on the first business day of 2000 -- when weekend transactions
were first accounted for in massive computer databases.
</P>
<P>
	   ATMs -- stuffed with extra cash -- continued to work, and bank balances and
loan information appeared accurate throughout the system, government and banking
industry officials reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been doing the 'health checks' of financial institutions," said Fed
spokeswoman Rose Pianalto, referring to the telephone calls to the nation's
banks made by Fed employees. "There have been no major problems reported."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Ms. Pianalto said, the central bank's check-clearing
operations, which process 68 million checks on a typical day, continued to
operate normally. "Everything went smoothly," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Banking industry officials say they're optimistic people won't experience
problems withdrawing cash from automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, banks will be watching closely to see how their computer systems
perform this week.

<TEXT>
    	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) - A computer malfunction at the Federal Aviation
Administration's Boston Center delayed flights at East Coast airports Monday
night.
<P>
	   Jim Peters, spokesman for FAA New England, said the main computer at the air
traffic control center went down around 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a result of the outage we incurred extensive delays throughout the
Northeast, both for flights arriving and departing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peters said FAA officials would not know until Tuesday what caused the
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Without knowing what has caused the problem, it would be premature to
speculate," he said. "It may turn out to be something other than Y2K."
</P>
<P>
	   The problem was corrected by about 10 p.m. The center switched to a backup
computer system during the outage, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the malfunctioning computer was installed in the Nashua office last
summer and similar systems are used at the FAA's 22 control centers around the
country. He said the other centers did not experience any problems Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Peters said he did not know how many flights were affected by the problem or
what the average delay was.
</P>
<P>
	   Departures and arrivals at Logan International Airport in Boston were
delayed by at least 30 minutes because of the malfunction, according to airport
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Center controls flights over more than 160,000 square miles of
air space from the Atlantic Ocean to western New York and from the Canadian
border to south of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Departing flights at both Kennedy International Airport in New York City and
Newark International Airport in New Jersey were delayed by up to 75 minutes,
said Sgt. Reinaldo Gonzalez of the Port Authority police. Shorter delays were
experienced at La Guardia Airport in New York, Gonzalez said. The Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey runs all three airports.

<HEADLINE> Church Group To Fight For Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- The representatives of an influential American church
organization met with the father of a 6-year-old boy rescued off Florida's coast
and promised to press the U.S. government to return the child to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to help our president see that the issue is a moral one, a
humanitarian one,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the outgoing general
secretary of the National Council of Churches. ``We need to be concerned for a
small boy rather than politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell spoke with reporters after meeting with Elian Gonzalez' father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and the child's four grandparents and great-grandmother in
this coastal town, a two-hour drive east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Accompanied by Cuban church representatives, Campbell, a Baptist minister,
was clearly affected by her hourlong visit inside Gonzalez' modest two-story
home, built of brick and cement on an unpaved street where horse-drawn carts are
as common as automobiles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very loving family,'' Campbell said, appearing to be on the
verge of tears. ``We are more convinced than ever that this child belongs with
this family. We will work very hard to make sure (Elian) comes back very soon.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the council is willing to play a mediation role in the dispute and
even to physically transport Elian back to Cuba and turn him over to the Cuban
Council of Churches to be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez, who has shunned publicity in recent weeks, said he was grateful
for the council's efforts. He said he understood his son was well, but that he
missed him very much. ``How could I not miss him?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said he met a second time with Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials on Friday, but declined to provide details for fear of harming
his case.
</P>
<P>
	   However, The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Cuba said it would take
``under advisement'' a U.S. request that it facilitate an exit visa for the
father, quoting a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Under preliminary plans discussed this weekend, the paper reported, Gonzalez
would be flown to Miami, where he would gain legal custody of Elian and be free
to leave the country with his son, although Elian's relatives in Miami could
seek a temporary restraining order against the action.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, a senior State Department official said late Monday he
doubted that the report was true. A telephone call to the INS was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The council is the United States' largest ecumenical organization,
representing 35 Protestant and Orthodox denominations comprising 52 million
congregants.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials gave temporary custody of Elian to his paternal great-uncle
in Miami in late November after the child was found clinging to an inner tube
off the Florida coast. Elian's mother died in the apparent attempt to illegally
immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has become a political tug-of-war, with Gonzalez demanding that his
son be returned to him in Cuba and the great-uncle fighting to keep the child in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   People on both sides of the Florida Straits have used the case to make their
own political points for or against Fidel Castro's communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the great things about this country, one of the blessings of
freedom that Elian will enjoy here is that everyone is free to speak their
mind,'' Spencer Eig, attorney for the boy's Miami relatives said Monday of the
council of churches campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   During an earlier meeting with INS officials in Cuba, Gonzalez provided them
with the boy's birth certificate, photographs and other documents aimed at
proving his paternity and assumption of parental responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The child's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was to present his own case to the
INS in Miami before Christmas, but that meeting was postponed until Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell said she had informed the White House about the group's trip and
efforts to reunite Elian with his father.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 88, Bulls 63  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- All the Chicago Bulls needed to remind them of their
glorious past and how far they have fallen was No. 33 in the red and black of
the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
	   Scottie Pippen returned Monday night to the United Center, his first
appearance against the team he once helped win six NBA titles, a run that now
seems light years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Pippen was received warmly by the fans and honored with a video tribute
showing highlights of 11 years with the Bulls, standout play that is now so
noticeably missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Pippen had 11 points and six assists as the Trail Blazers did what nearly
every team has done since he and Michael Jordan left -- they routed the
overmatched Bulls 88-63, holding Chicago to the fewest points in the NBA this
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Damon Stoudamire led Portland with 16 points and Bonzi Wells added 15. Elton
Brand paced the Bulls with 23 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   After missing his first two shots, Pippen made three of his next four and
also went high to block a layup attempt by former teammate Randy Brown, showing
the skill that has long made him one of the game's best defensive players.
</P>
<P>
	   The Trail Blazers had little trouble in this mismatch. They shot 52 percent
to 24 percent for the Bulls in the first quarter and raced to a 24-12 lead.
Portland led 47-28 at the half, the Bulls' lowest scoring half of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Pippen was cheered loudly as the lights were turned down and a video
highlight played on the overhead scoreboard for several minutes just before he
was introduced. After it was over, he went to center court and biting his lip to
hold his emotions, waved to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the game, Pippen remembered his days with the Bulls, when he teamed
with Jordan to make Chicago the dominant team of the 1990s and often feuded with
management. The winning was what made it so special, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those are memories I can take to my grave with me," said Pippen, who went
to Houston in a sign-and-trade deal after the NBA lockout ended last year. After
the one shortened season, he was traded to Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   "Winning here and playing with the greatest player to ever play the game and
in the greatest city in the NBA, you can't beat that," he said. "I miss playing
here, I miss the fans here, I miss how much fun I had when I played."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Bulls have a real challenge to rebuild and questioned why any
free agents could want to joint the current mix.
</P>
<P>
	   "From my standpoint I hate to see them lose," Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
	   "But it's kind of funny. It gives you a laugh to see how they (management)
destroyed something that was great for the city of Chicago and very entertaining
for a lot of people's lives. On the other hand, I'm in a great situation."

    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - No major computer glitches were reported by local

government," Gary Davis, the state's Y2K project director, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Oneida County consulted with the state and began an operational review of
its computer systems about nine months ago. The county then began a six-month
project to upgrade and replace older systems.
</P>
<P>
	   "For about half a million dollars we replaced older PCs and revised a number
of larger software programs," Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace said. "But
the projects was worth every cent and not just because of Y2K. Now we've got
faster computers that are better networked which means we can operate more
efficiently."
</P>
<P>
	   In the Delaware County town of Delhi, officials also reported no problems
following the rollover. The town spent about $8,000 on system upgrades in the
town clerk and assessors office.
</P>
<P>
	   Y2K problems stem from the inability of older computer systems to discern
between dates in the 20th and 21st centuries. It's a complicated problem to fix
because computers ranging from mainframes to laptops can be affected, as well as
the software they run with.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've just got to go through the pain," said Gary Manning, Delhi town
supervisor. "And when you think of the alternative, I'm glad we did what we
did."
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Hemminger, the director of information systems in Ontario County,
reported that big Y2K problems were avoided because many of the county's
computer systems had been replaced over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "For us Y2K was the right problems at the right time," he said. "It was the
normal and right time for us to have begun replacing our systems because they
were old anyway and would have naturally needed upgrading."
</P>
<P>
	   But according to Davis, the year 2000 may have arrived with few of the
feared computer disruptions but Feb. 29 could pose the next problem date. He
noted that this is a leap year, and the end of February is being mentioned as a
potential trouble date for computers.

<HEADLINE> Pataki says STAR tax rebates should go straight to taxpayers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A war of words has broken out between Gov. George
Pataki and the local school districts over where the state's School Tax Relief
rebate checks should go this year.
<P>
	   Pataki wants homeowners to get their rebate checks directly from the state
instead of through the school districts to make a point of how local officials
have been eating up the tax break.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Kremer, executive director of the New York School Board Association,
reacted angrily, saying Pataki was accusing school districts of skimming money
off the top of taxpayers' relief checks. "We believe the governor defamed 5,000
school board members," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The STAR checks currently go to school districts, who then pass the savings
on to taxpayers. But Pataki said some of those school districts are raising
their own spending and hiding it by capitalizing on the rebate checks, making
taxpayers' rebates less than they would otherwise be.
</P>
<P>
	   By sending the whole rebate check directly to homeowners, local officials
will not be able to hide their local increases, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are removing local school districts as 'middlemen' in the delivery
process and no longer permitting them to use growing STAR savings to mask
excessive spending increases," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While it makes no technical difference whether the check goes to the
taxpayer or the district, Kremer said Pataki's plan makes school board members
look like criminals for trying to keep up with the rising costs of New York
educational standards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that school districts or school boards, which I represent,
have done anything wrong or anything inappropriate," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor will try to convince the Legislature to divert the checks away
from the school districts in his State of the State speech on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would expect broad-based support," Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kremer said his organization would oppose Pataki's proposal. "It's his
method we oppose," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Patricia Lynch, spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any proposal that gets money back in taxpayers' pockets is a good thing,"
John McArdle, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   The STAR program lowers property taxes by dropping the assessed value of
owner-occupied homes. The program provides state money to school districts to
make up for local property tax revenues that are lost.
</P>
<P>
	   STAR makes senior citizens eligible for an eventual average 45 percent
reduction in their school property tax bills while other property owners are
eligible for a 27 percent average reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   When fully implemented in 2001-02, senior citizens with household incomes of
less than $60,000 a year will get a $50,000 tax exemption under the STAR plan
while all other homeowners will receive a $30,000 exemption.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Pataki's plan, schools would be required to bill the entire tax amount
to non-senior taxpayers, which would show any tax increase. He also wants a cap
on local school budget increases - which previously has been rejected by the
Legislature. The last prong of his plan would force school districts to tell
voters how their proposed school budgets would affect their STAR savings and how
the proposed budget compares with the maximum contingency budget should voters
reject the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not only preserving STAR benefits, we are taking important steps to
keep property taxes down for every homeowner in New York state," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The increases school districts got last year were going to be needed whether
STAR had been passed by the state Legislature or not, Kremer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki plans on trying to add an additional $800 million for STAR in his
budget for this year, which will bring the tax exemption up to more than $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Seniors making less than $60,000 already are getting their full $50,000 tax
exemption from the value of their homes. Non-senior homeowners will be eligible
for a $20,000 exemption this year, which will grow to $30,000 next year.

<HEADLINE> Torricelli: Hillary Clinton will have all the money she needs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The head of the national Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee is vowing to spend "whatever is required to win" to help
Hillary Rodham Clinton capture a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
<P>
	   "This race is not going to be lost for financial resources. Indeed, it is
not going to be lost at all," Sen. Robert Torricelli, a major booster of the
first lady's expected Senate campaign, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Between the DSCC and Hillary Clinton's own campaign efforts, spending will
reach the maximum levels that are effective," the senator from New Jersey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli refused to disclose how much the DSCC might spend in New York but
said the committee's report to the Federal Election Commission due at the end of
this month would show it has more than $9 million on hand going into the
election year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary Clinton is entitled to a portion of that money," Torricelli said.
The first lady has been aggressively raising money for the DSCC in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the national Senate campaign committee said Mrs. Clinton also is
raising record amounts of money on her own for her race but he refused to
provide specific figures. Mrs. Clinton's campaign staff has also refused to
divulge how much she has raised over the past six months, saying that
information will be made public at the end of this month when she files her
first campaign finance report with the FEC.
</P>
<P>
	   While both Mrs. Clinton and her expected Republican opponent, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, have refused to say how much they have raised in the
past six months, aides to both told The New York Times last week that they have
each topped the $6.6 million mark. That is how much former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
raised in 1997, the year before he lost his Senate seat from New York to
Democrat Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani campaign aide Bruce Teitelbaum said Monday that Torricelli's
comments came as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "We fully expect the Clinton campaign will raise more money than we will ...
We expect it, we're prepared for it and we will obviously raise sufficient funds
to run a competitive and winning campaign," the Giuliani adviser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's campaign finance team has vowed to raise at least $25 million
for the race while Giuliani has said he expects to raise about $20 million. That
could make it the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York and New Jersey must both be won to get the 51 Democratic United
States senators" the party needs to take back control of the Senate, Torricelli
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the New York Post, quoting unidentified sources, reported that
Giuliani was considering delivering a major speech on the need for campaign
finance reform in which he would call on the state and national GOP to refrain
from spending "soft money" to help his candidacy. Teitelbaum said Monday that he
could not confirm that and that the mayor has, thus far, not ruled out the use
of soft money. Mrs. Clinton has said she wouldn't mind seeing soft-money
spending kept out of the campaign but only if both sides agree.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady has already benefitted from unlimited soft-money donations to
the DSCC. It supplied several hundred thousand dollars of such funds late last
year to finance television ads in upstate New York promoting her. Giuliani has
run campaign ads in the region as well but paid for them out of his own campaign
coffers.

<HEADLINE> Workplace Rules Protect Home Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department has advised companies that they are
responsible for federal health and safety violations that occur at the home
workplaces of their telecommuting employees, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
	   An Occupational Safety and Health Administration advisory makes employers
responsible for ensuring an employee's home office has ergonomically correct
furniture, proper lighting, ventilation systems and emergency medical plans and
equipment, the newspaper said in its Tuesday editions.
</P>
<P>
	   The OSHA letter says that when an employee works at home ``the employer is
responsible for correcting hazards of which it is aware, or should be aware,''
the Post reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The advisory is not a new rule, but presents the agency's position that this
work-at-home policy is already in effect. The decision applies to the nearly 20
million adults who regularly telecommute, as well as to those who work at home
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
	   While OSHA officials said they will not be inspecting private homes,
employers are responsible for any illnesses or injuries that occur in the home
workplace, the Post reported. These injuries must be reported as if they had
occurred at the employer's work site.
</P>
<P>
	   The policy applies specifically to home work areas and not the entire home.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post quoted the advisory letter, which was sent in mid-November, as
saying, ``An employer is responsible for ensuring that its employees have a safe
and healthful workplace, not a safe and healthful home.''

U.S. Spent About $100B on Y2K Bug
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's Y2K chief defended the expenditure of
an estimated $100 billion to buy new computers and repair computer software code
as "a marvelous accomplishment" and crucial to keeping the nation's most

<HEADLINE> Jury selection begins for second Louima trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - It's a trial civil rights activists say will further
expose the so-called blue wall of silence - a supposed code among police
officers never to rat on each other.
<P>
	   It's also one defense attorneys hope will prove that former Officer Charles
Schwarz was wrongly convicted in one of the most notorious brutality cases in
city history.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection for the trial - the second prosecution stemming from the 1997
assault on a handcuffed prisoner, Abner Louima, in a police station bathroom -
began Monday in Brooklyn federal court. Opening statements are tentatively set
for Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   In a case that flamed tensions between police and minorities and sparked
social unrest, Schwarz, who is white, was convicted last year of violating
Louima's civil rights by holding him on the 70th Precinct bathroom floor while
another white officer, Justin Volpe, sodomized the black Haitian immigrant with
a broken broomstick. Volpe pleaded guilty and has since claimed that the other
officer in the bathroom was Thomas Wiese, not Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 35, Wiese, 37, and Officer Thomas Bruder, 34, now stand accused of
obstructing justice by concocting to shield Schwarz from federal investigators.
If convicted, they each would face a maximum five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining other activists outside the courthouse Monday, the Rev. Al Sharpton
told reporters, "What Justin Volpe did could not have been done without an
active cover-up in the 70th Precinct. ... So to us, this is just as important as
the first trial."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's wife, Andra Schwarz, said she expects the new trial to vindicate
her husband, who has been in federal custody since his conviction in June.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope the truth is going to come out," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first trial, all three defendants were cleared of charges they beat
Louima while taking him by patrol car to the stationhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruder and Schwarz "are looking forward to being acquitted a second time,"
Bruder's attorney, Stuart London, said following a brief pretrial hearing on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Both London and Wiese's attorney, Joseph Tacopina, said their clients still
contend Schwarz was never in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors declined comment to the media on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 500 people filled out 47-page questionnaires, the first phase of a
jury selection process designed to screen out candidates tainted by pretrial
publicity. U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson plans to begin questioning
finalists in his courtroom on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Potential jurors were asked whether they think police discriminate against
minorities, what "blue wall of silence" means, if it's wrong to second-guess
officers and whether they have heard or read any media accounts about Schwarz's
role in the attack on Louima.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Volpe was sentenced to 30 years in prison. The former patrolman
had admitted ramming the stick up Louima's rectum in a blind rage, thinking -
mistakenly - that his prisoner had sucker-punched him outside a Brooklyn
nightclub. Prosecutors said Louima's cousin actually punched the officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe and Louima are expected to testify at the second trial.

<HEADLINE> Bush and Forbes file petitions to get on New York primary ballot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Texas Gov. George W. Bush and millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes have filed petitions to secure spots on New York's March 7
presidential primary ballot.
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the head of Sen. John McCain's New York effort said Monday that
the Arizona Republican would probably qualify presidential delegate slates
through the petition process in a majority, but not all of the state's 31
congressional districts. McCain is simultaneously pursuing a federal lawsuit
aimed at getting his prospective convention delegates on the ballot throughout
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley said Monday
that their petitions would be filed later this week to secure spots on the March
7 Democratic presidential primary ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, Forbes met for more than an hour in New York City with leaders
of the state's tiny but politically influential Conservative Party, courting
their support.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections, said the Bush
camp filed 19 volumes worth of signatures Monday aimed at securing a New York
ballot spot for the Texas governor and GOP front-runner. Bush has the backing in
New York of Gov. George Pataki and most of the rest of the state's top
Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to state GOP Chairman William Powers, a major Bush backer, said the
Texas governor's New York petitions contained the signatures of almost 90,000
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   "Such overwhelming support proves that his vision for America has clearly
struck a chord with the families of New York," U.S. Rep. John Sweeney, a member
of Bush's Congressional Steering Committee and a former top aide to both Pataki
and Powers, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' campaign chief, Bill Dal Col, said Forbes' petitions contained about
50,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   The petitions are subject to challenge by rival candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Republicans need the signatures of 15,410 party members, properly
distributed across the state, to get their delegate slates on the ballot
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Only Bush, Forbes and McCain decided to contest New York's GOP primary given
that New York's ballot access rules are notoriously demanding, especially for
candidates without the backing of party bosses.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, with the state GOP behind Bob Dole, Forbes had to spend $1 million
and get help from the federal courts to get on the ballot all across the state.
In the end, Dole ended up winning all the convention delegates at stake in the
New York primary. This year, Forbes planned to spend about $750,000 on his
petition effort.
</P>
<P>
	   In effect, New York has 31 separate GOP presidential primaries, one in each
of the state's congressional districts. Candidates must collect the signatures
of 1,000 party members or 0.5 percent of enrolled party members in each district
where they want to field delegate slates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll get on in the majority of the districts ... I wouldn't be surprised
if we hit 20" of the 31, said Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, head
of McCain's New York campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said the McCain forces would also press ahead with their federal
court lawsuit seeking to further open the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's so much unfairness in the system," said Molinari, a former
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   The ballot access rules were eased somewhat by Pataki and the state
Legislature in the wake of the 1996 election, which drew heavy criticism of the
governor. Nonetheless, candidates must still collect thousands of signatures
statewide in about six weeks as part of what an editorial in The New York Times
on Monday called "a corrupt system that is a national embarrassment."
</P>
<P>
	   Monday was the first day that candidates could legally file their petitions
for ballot spots. The last day for filing the petitions is Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Bush camp was touting its ballot petition prowess and the McCain
forces were grumbling, Forbes met at a Manhattan hotel with leaders of the state
Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's clearly not backing out of the race," state Conservative party
Chairman Michael Long said after the meeting. "It was a good session."
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a lot of great give-and-take," Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
	   Long and top party leaders have also met with Bush and expect to meet with
McCain. The Conservative Party won't select its presidential candidate until
September. Unlike most other states, major party candidates in New York can run
with third-party backing. The votes on each ballot line are then combined.

<HEADLINE> Wasps Used To Fight Eucalyptus Pest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wasps the size of grains of pepper will be the
front-line soldiers in an attack against the menacing red gum lerp psyllids, a
pest that has been sucking the life out of California's eucalyptus trees since
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities plan to release the miniscule, non-stinging wasps this spring in
several invaded areas, including the Griffith Park, Woodland Hills and Valley
Village sections of Los Angeles and the city of Torrance.
</P>

	   "Spraying 60- to 150-foot-tall trees is not economical or safe," said Robert
Donley, chief of the environmental protection bureau in Los Angeles County's
Department of Agricultural Commissioner and Weights and Measures.
</P>
<P>
	   "Spraying insecticide that high can cause a hazard to surrounding people or
houses or cars," Donley said. "It's not really feasible, and it's very costly."
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, officials hope the tiny Australian wasps will lay eggs inside the
psyllids -- officially called Glycaspis brimblecombei. The larvae kill the pests
by growing inside them.
</P>
<P>
	   The gum-sucking psyllids invaded 30 California counties in June 1998, the
worst such tree infestation since the ash whitefly of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ... parasitic wasps did such a wonderful job with the whitefly, so
we'll try it again this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea to import them was that of Donald Dahlsten, a professor at the
Center for Biological Control in the College of Natural Resources at the
University of California, Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
	   Dahlsten returned from Australia in September with 200 of the wasps. He's
been studying them to ensure they won't sting humans and will only pick on the
pesky psyllids, leaving other insects alone. Biologists don't want the
introduction to upset nature's balance.

	   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Frustrated by the unrelenting U.S. ban on exports to
Cuba, wheat growers are exploring an exception in the law which allows food
sales to private buyers in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are just trying everywhere we can," said Dawn Forsythe, spokeswoman for
U.S. Wheat Associates in the Washington, D.C. "However remote the possibility
may be, we will give it a shot."
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. sanctions now prohibit sales to the government, but allow the sale
of food and medicine to the private sector. But all the Cuban mills are
government-owned, effectively preventing U.S. wheat sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat Associates has now identified three private organizations in Cuba
which might legally buy U.S. wheat, mill it outside the island, and then bring
it in as flour.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope all of this is unnecessary because Congress did say they would vote
on this (ban) when they came into session," Forsythe said.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake is who will sell Cuba the nearly 1 million tons of wheat it now
buys mostly from the European Union, Canada and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat growers are hoping they can duplicate the success made by a U.S.
pharmaceutical company in exporting medicine to Cuba by working through CARITAS,
a Catholic charity on the island. The other two possible wheat buyers are the
world food program of the United Nations and the National Council of Churches,
Forsythe said.

<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Alex Tanguay tied the game late in the third period Monday
night and Jon Klemm had his first goal in nearly two months as the Colorado
Avalanche earned a 2-2 draw with the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Weight and Roman Hamrlik scored for Edmonton, which remained a point
behind Colorado at the top of the Northwest Division.
</P>
<P>
	   With the game tied at 1, Avalanche defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh turned the
puck over deep in the Colorado zone. Pat Fallon pounced on it and fed Weight
with a cross-ice pass. Weight sent a low drive past the stick of Patrick Roy at
4:34 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Tanguay made it 2-2 at 13:40 when Joe Sakic, who had two assists, circled
the net and sent a pass in front of the crease to a waiting Tanguay. It was his
ninth goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oilers, 4-14-4 on the road, outshot Colorado 5-0 in overtime. Tommy Salo
stopped 30 shots for the Oilers, who finished a three-game road trip 1-1-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Scoring chances were at a premium in a scoreless first period. Fallon hit
the right post eight minutes in and Salo turned aside shots by Milan Hejduk and
Chris Drury on Colorado's best chances.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams exchanged goals in the second period. Colorado grabbed a 1-0 lead
when Peter Forsberg skated behind the Oilers net and fed Klemm in the slot.
Klemm sent a wrist shot past Salo at 5:33 for his first goal since Nov. 11th.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamrlik tied it at 8:40 with four seconds left on a power play. Bill Guerin
took the puck away in the corner from Adam Deadmarsh, who lost his stick, and
got it to Hamrlik for a right-point shot.

<HEADLINE> Carroll Dismissed as Patriots Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Pete Carroll was a nice guy who finished last. And
now, he's finished as coach of the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
	   The likable defensive whiz kid who inherited a Super Bowl team from Bill
Parcells was fired on Monday after three consecutive years of declining results.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll departs with a .549 winning percentage. But the defending AFC
champions went 10-6 in his first year, 9-7 in his second and 8-8 this year, good
for last place in the division.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm proud of being 27-21 (plus 1-2 in the postseason) and making the
playoffs the first two years I was here," Carroll said in the Foxboro Stadium
parking lot before driving off in his gold Jaguar. "I'll forever be disappointed
that we didn't win more."
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate word on the fate of the rest of the coaching staff,
or on a successor. The Patriots asked for permission to talk to Jets assistant
Bill Belichick but were denied when Parcells resigned and Belichick was elevated
to head coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Owner Robert Kraft said in a brief news conference that the entire
organization would be evaluated. Speculation focused on whether vice president
of player personnel Bobby Grier could also lose his job.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a business of accountability, and two years ago we won the
division. Last year we barely made the playoffs and this year we're 8-8," Kraft
said. "We need a momentum change."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 48, led the Patriots to the second round of the playoffs in 1997
and the first round in 1998. They seemed headed to postseason play again this
year, winning their first four games and going 6-2 in the first half of the
season.
</P>
<P>
	   But the offense sputtered after the midseason bye and the Patriots lost
three consecutive games to AFC East rivals. They scored just 108 points in the
last eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   "At 6-2, we were already packing for the Super Bowl. Maybe overconfidence
kicked in," offensive lineman Heath Irwin said. "It wasn't like we were
dominating everybody we played, we were just barely beating them and it just
came back and got us."
</P>
<P>
	   In their last two games, the Patriots had their two least productive days of
the season, gaining 225 yards against Buffalo and 151 against Baltimore. And
Drew Bledsoe threw for only 101 and 108 yards in those games.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ultimately, we as players didn't get the job done well enough for the staff
to stay in place," Bledsoe said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll's last week was marked by controversy as he suspended his top wide
receiver, Terry Glenn, for failing to report for medical checkups on three of
the previous four days. Carroll also was criticized by Grier, who said the
players he drafted would have played better had they been used more.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to point the finger at everybody," defensive back Ty Law said.
"Not just Pete Carroll, everybody."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll's only previous NFL head coaching experience was in 1994 with the
New York Jets. He was fired after one 6-10 season and was replaced by Rich
Kotite.
</P>
<P>
	   He was coordinator of San Francisco's outstanding defense the next two
seasons when the 49ers made the playoffs. They were 12-4 in 1996, the same
season Parcells and the Patriots lost the Super Bowl to Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   But Parcells, upset he didn't have enough power to choose his players, quit
after the season to become coach of the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   "You wonder (what would have happened if Parcells stayed)," Irwin said. "But
I think there were so many conflicts between him and other people around here
that it wouldn't have worked out."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll took over as coach of the Patriots and Grier handled player
acquisition. Only three of the 27 players drafted under Grier's leadership
started Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Patriots got little out of the three drafts Grier oversaw and allowed
free agent running backs Curtis Martin to leave for the Jets and Sam Gash for
the Bills.	   Rookie Robert Edwards helped the running game last season, but an
offseason knee injury forced him to miss this season and may end his career.
</P>
<P>
	   New England relied on Bledsoe's passing, but he has slumped badly while
being heavily pressured. In the last eight games, he was sacked 33 times and his
receivers had trouble getting open.
</P>
<P>
	   So after three seasons in which the Patriots started well but had midseason
lulls, Carroll is out but may be sought by other teams as a defensive coach.
</P>
<P>
	   He entered the NFL in 1984 as Buffalo's defensive backs coach then held the
same position with Minnesota from 1985 through 1989. His next stop was the Jets,
where he was defensive coordinator from 1990 through 1993 before succeeding
Bruce Coslet as coach.

<HEADLINE> Shulman still being prosecuted after murder-one conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - He's already got a cell on Death Row, but
prosecutors aren't letting up on Robert Shulman, who liked to take prostitutes
to his one-room apartment on Long Island and sometimes didn't let them out
alive.
<P>
	   Shulman, who was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death
last year for killing three women, went on trial Monday in Westchester, where
two other alleged victims were dumped in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Monday that the case in Westchester is
being prosecuted because Shulman is appealing his conviction and "There's no way
of knowing what's going to happen."
</P>
<P>
	   A conviction in Westchester, she said, would "give the victims' families the
ability to get justice and guarantee that he remains in prison the rest of his
life if he is not killed by lethal injection."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the victims found in Westchester was cut into pieces and has never
been identified. But DNA tests connected both women to bloodstains in Shulman's
apartment - including some on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
	   "The facts are the facts, the blood is the blood, and the blood is on the
hands of Robert Shulman," prosecutor Robert Neary told the jury in his opening
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, 45, shuffled through papers as Neary spoke, rarely looking up. He
is accused of second-degree murder in the killings of the unidentified woman and
of Lori Vasquez of Brooklyn, a 24-year-old prostitute Shulman allegedly picked
up in Manhattan and took to his Hicksville apartment in late August 1991. The
state had no death penalty law at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, a postal worker, was a virtual recluse except for "the occasional
walk on the wild side," Neary said, when he would take in prostitutes and share
crack cocaine with them at the apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most emerged unscathed," Neary said, but not all.
</P>
<P>
	   The back of Ms. Vasquez's head was bashed in with a blunt instrument. As she
lay dead and naked on Shulman's bed, he went to a Home Depot and bought a
plastic garbage can, then stuffed it with the body and the bedding, Neary said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman and his brother Barry Schulman drove to Yonkers and left the can by
the side of a road, the prosecutor said. Barry Shulman, who was sentenced to two
years in prison for helping his brother in Suffolk, faces similar charges in
Westchester.
</P>
<P>
	   The second body was found in 1992, also in Yonkers and in a trash can, but
with both arms and part of one leg severed. Shulman "took the extra precaution
of dismembering that body," Neary said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman's lawyer, William Keahon, told the jurors - seven men and five women
- that there were no witnesses to the killings and that no one saw Shulman with
the women or in Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
	   He also implied that incriminating statements attributed to Shulman had
actually been compiled by investigators, noting that there was no tape recording
of the statements. Police have said that Shulman admitted killing all five women
with a bat, a hammer or a barbell.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Suffolk District Attorney Georgia Tscheimber said in 1996, soon
after Shulman was arrested, that "Almost every item in his room appeared to be
splattered with blood."

<HEADLINE> Falcons 34, 49ers 29  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Tim Dwight provided a glimmer of hope for the Atlanta
Falcons as they completed their dismal run as NFC champions.
</P>
<P>
	   Dwight caught seven passes for 162 yards, including two touchdowns, and
returned a punt 70 yards for another score as the Falcons closed the NFL's
regular season with a 34-29 victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The 49ers (4-12) fell behind 31-7 but showed a bit of pride in their worst
season since 1979, scoring three second-half touchdowns to make it close. But
the Falcons recovered an onside kick with 2:45 remaining but had to bat down a
desperation pass in the end zone to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Chandler took advantage of the league's worst-rated pass defense to
throw for 306 yards and three touchdowns, helping Atlanta (5-11) snap a 10-game
losing streak on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Rice, in what may have been his final game with the 49ers, added
another highlight to his brilliant career with a 62-yard reception, setting up a
San Francisco touchdown and drawing applause from Falcons defensive back Ray
Buchanan. Rice finished with six receptions for 143 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta won its final two games -- the team's only winning streak of the
season -- but still equaled the 1990 Denver Broncos for the worst record in a
post-Super Bowl year. Both teams were coached by Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco a perennial powerhouse gone shockingly bad since the loss of
quarterback Steve Young, dropped 11 of its last 12 for the team's worst finish
since a 2-14 mark in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   One consolation for San Francisco: the No. 3 pick in the draft. The Falcons
didn't have to worry about draft ramifications, having traded their top pick in
2000 to Baltimore for a second-rounder in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta wound up with a reserve tight end, Reggie Kelly, who had only eight
catches for 146 yards this season. The Ravens, meanwhile, will gladly take a
prime No. 5 choice in the upcoming draft.
</P>
<P>
	   Dwight, a speedy, 5-foot-8 receiver, broke the game open in the final minute
of the first half with his dazzling skills as a returner.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta was leading just 10-7 when Dwight took a punt at his own 30, broke
free in front of the San Francisco bench, cut back toward the middle of the
field and outraced Randy Krik without being touched, reaching the end zone with
just 12 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Falcons increased the lead to 24-7 on their first possession of the
second half, as Terance Mathis hauled in the 50th touchdown reception of his
career on a 19-yard pass from Chandler. Mathis also assured his second straight
1,000-yard season with a 9-yard catch in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta blew it open when Dwight struck again, this time with a 60-yard
touchdown reception. Cornerback Darnell Walker grabbed the receiver at the line,
drawing a flag but failing to slow Dwight, who hauled in the pass between two
defenders at the San Francisco 35 and stiff-armed Lee Woodall on the way to the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Dwight scored Atlanta's first touchdown on a 5-yard reception. Chandler
hooked up with the speedy receiver on passes of 25 and 20 yards before going to
him again on third-and-goal at the 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Morten Andersen added field goals of 49 and 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The 49ers, showing an astonishing lack of discipline for a team that won at
least 10 games every year from 1983-98, were penalized 17 times for 148 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   But they got within striking distance on Travis Jervey's 1-yard touchdown
run late in the third period and quarterback Jeff Garcia's 5-yarder with 9 1/2
minutes remaining. Then, Garcia hooked up with J.J. Stokes for a 43-yard
touchdown with 2:46 left. Stokes caught five passes for 130 yards overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia completed 26 of 34 for 373 yards, hoping to show he is a worthy
successor if Young doesn't return next season. The CFL refugee also threw a
4-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   After Stokes' touchdown, Atlanta's O.J. Santiago recovered the onside kick
and the Falcons ran out most of the clock to win on Monday night for the first
time since 1981 and only the sixth time in 23 games.

<HEADLINE> Is This Rice's Goodbye to 49ers?  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Has Jerry Rice made his final catch for the San Francisco
49ers? Has Jessie Tuggle made his last tackle for the Atlanta Falcons?
</P>
<P>
	   Monday night's game at the Georgia Dome didn't have any ramifications as far
as the playoffs were concerned, but it might be remembered as the end of an era
for two of the generation's top players.
</P>
<P>
	   While Rice and Tuggle want to play another season, it's not known if their
teams -- both finishing near the bottom of the NFL -- will be able to afford two
aging warriors as they go into a rebuilding mode.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure what to think, because I do think he would like to come back,
and I do think the head coach here would like to have him back," 49ers coach
Steve Mariucci said before the game. "We'll see how that plays out. A lot of
that will be governed by his desire, and our ability to afford a Jerry Rice with
all our salary cap restraints. Don't rule him out for next year.
</P>
<P>
	   But San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh has hinted that Rice won't be
back for his 16th season with the 49ers, who are about $20 million over the
projected $62.2 million cap. The 37-year-old receiver has a cap figure of $5.5
million for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never thought I'd be in this predicament, but here I am," Rice said
recently. "I'm looking at it with a very positive attitude and I'm working hard
during practices and I'm just trying to make the team for next year."
</P>
<P>
	   Rice finished as the 49ers' leading receiver with 67 receptions and five
touchdowns. He had six catches for receptions for 143 yards in San Francisco's
34-29 loss to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't really had the opportunity to really think about it," Rice said
after the game. "I wanted to come in this game, play hard and help the team win.
I think everything else will take care of itself. If it happens to be my last
game here, I'll move on. That's the business of football. I had 15 great years
here. I have nothing to hold my head about."
</P>
<P>
	   After injuring both knees since 1997, Rice said he finally was healthy and
wanted to be around to help the team bounce back from its first losing season
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would like to finish my career with the 49ers," Rice said. "I started
with the Niners and would like to end here. It is something to discuss in the
offseason. It's not about money anymore."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Billionaire May Buy Dallas Mavericks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Broadcast.com co-founder Mark Cuban agreed to buy the Dallas
Mavericks from Ross Perot Jr. for about $280 million, according to media
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban, a billionaire since selling his company to Yahoo!, would be paying
more than double the estimated $125 million Perot's group paid less than four
years ago, according to The Dallas Morning News, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram
and WFAA-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale is expected to be completed in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Perot nor Cuban could immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   A source told the Star-Telegram that Perot was overwhelmed by Cuban's offer.
Another source suggested Perot is tired of the negative publicity surrounding
the team, from its subpar record to its latest troubles with top draft pick Leon
Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, receiving psychiatric care, signed a $1.4 million, three-year
contract in November last year but has yet to play for the team. Mavericks
officials have received criticism for not helping him make the adjustment from
high school to professional sports.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban, 41, often talked about his interest in sports teams and tried buying
the Pittsburgh Penguins last year. He's been a Mavericks season-ticket holder
for years with seats near the team's bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot said he pursued the team because he believed that it could be a
catalyst for real estate development.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his ownership, the Mavericks and the Dallas Stars hockey team got
voters to approve a new arena for the teams that will be opened in 2001. Perot
and Stars owner Tom Hicks are involved in developing much of the land around it.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban and fellow Indiana University graduate Todd Wagner started
Broadcast.com in 1995 in Cuban's spare bedroom as a way to hear Hoosiers
basketball games in Dallas. The company now operates out of a 28,000-square-foot
converted warehouse equipped with satellite dishes that pull in TV and radio
signals from around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   When the company went public in July 1998, its opening stock price was $18 a
share. It shot to $72 before closing its first day at $62.75.

<HEADLINE> Is This Rice's Goodbye to 49ers?  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Has Jerry Rice made his final catch for the San Francisco
49ers? Has Jessie Tuggle made his last tackle for the Atlanta Falcons?
</P>
<P>
	   Monday night's game at the Georgia Dome didn't have any ramifications as far
as the playoffs were concerned, but it might be remembered as the end of an era
for two of the generation's top players.
</P>
<P>
	   While Rice and Tuggle want to play another season, it's not known if their
teams -- both finishing near the bottom of the NFL -- will be able to afford two
aging warriors as they go into a rebuilding mode.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure what to think, because I do think he would like to come back,
and I do think the head coach here would like to have him back," 49ers coach
Steve Mariucci said before the game. "We'll see how that plays out. A lot of
that will be governed by his desire, and our ability to afford a Jerry Rice with
all our salary cap restraints. Don't rule him out for next year.
</P>
<P>
	   But San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh has hinted that Rice won't be
back for his 16th season with the 49ers, who are about $20 million over the
projected $62.2 million cap. The 37-year-old receiver has a cap figure of $5.5
million for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never thought I'd be in this predicament, but here I am," Rice said
recently. "I'm looking at it with a very positive attitude and I'm working hard
during practices and I'm just trying to make the team for next year."
</P>
<P>
	   Rice finished as the 49ers' leading receiver with 67 receptions and five
touchdowns. He had six catches for receptions for 143 yards in San Francisco's
34-29 loss to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't really had the opportunity to really think about it," Rice said
after the game. "I wanted to come in this game, play hard and help the team win.
I think everything else will take care of itself. If it happens to be my last
game here, I'll move on. That's the business of football. I had 15 great years
here. I have nothing to hold my head about."
</P>
<P>
	   After injuring both knees since 1997, Rice said he finally was healthy and
wanted to be around to help the team bounce back from its first losing season
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would like to finish my career with the 49ers," Rice said. "I started
with the Niners and would like to end here. It is something to discuss in the
offseason. It's not about money anymore."
</P>
<P>
	   Tuggle has similar aspirations in Atlanta. The Falcons reached the Super
Bowl for the first time in 1999, but they have fallen apart in the role of
defending NFC champions.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Dan Reeves isn't sure if the team can afford the NFL's active leader
in career tackles. Tuggle made $2.9 million this season and turns 35 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not about loyalty," said Tuggle, who has been with the Falcons since
1987 and a full-time starter at middle linebacker since '89. "This is about
which way the organization is headed. It's a business decision. If it's time to
move on, it's not going to affect me. I know this is a business."
</P>
<P>
	   Like Rice, Tuggle still believes he can contribute.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will be playing somewhere next year," he said. "That's for sure."
</P>
<P>
	   The Falcons are facing extensive turnover on defense. Safety Eugene Robinson
is expected to retire and ends Chuck Smith and Lester Archambeau will test free
agency after failing to reach long-term agreements in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The 49ers also must determine the status of quarterback Steve Young, who has
missed most of the season with another concussion. The 38-year-old has not said
whether he plans to play next season, though he has yet to be cleared medically.
</P>
<P>
	   Young's cap figure for next season is $8.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Defends Risky Cuban Mission  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba accused the United States on Monday of tolerating
illegal acts against the island, singling out the New Year's Day scattering of
political pamphlets by a Vietnamese-American pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   The communist government first acknowledged the Saturday flyover in an
editorial published Monday in the communist workers daily, Trabajadores.
</P>
<P>
	   The article, with the headline ``Madman, Unhinged, Drugged, or Vulgar
Mercenary,'' said the United States was ``a violator of international law,
tolerant of crime, a liar without morals that stimulates craziness and is
incapable of controlling it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ly Tong, a 51-year-old New Orleans resident with a history of anti-communist
actions involving airplanes, dropped 50,000 leaflets urging Cubans to overthrow
``the old dinosaur Fidel Castro'' by launching a general strike, seizing radio
and television stations and protesting outside military installations.
</P>
<P>
	   The pamphlets were signed ``Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary
Anti-Communist Forces of the World,'' followed by an illegible signature.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This crazy man could have dropped explosives on us, flammable material or
viruses or bacteria,'' the editorial said, and criticized Tong for dropping the
pamphlets on New Year's Day, which was the 41st anniversary of the Cuban
revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   But Cuban exiles in Miami Monday night honored Tong for the daring flight,
giving him plaques and pins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We salute this man of great courage. We admire him and what he did,'' said
Jose Basulto of the anti-Castro group Brothers to the Rescue. Basulto and his
Cessna escaped when Cuban military jets shot down two unarmed civilian planes in
1996, killing four men.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong in turn responded to the Cuban government's editorial, saying, ``Tell
him (Castro) this message: Only crazy people can change the world, and I want to
change Cuba's destiny.'' He said after the flight that he wanted to make similar
trips over China and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials questioned Tong after the flight into Cuban air space, but
released him without charges, U.S. Customs officials said. He surrendered his
two-week-old pilot's license to the Federal Aviation Administration before his
release.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department said Tong had engaged in a ``provocative and reckless
action.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tong is a former South Vietnamese air force fighter pilot who was shot down
by the North Vietnamese in 1975 and jailed for five years in a ``reeducation
camp.''
</P>
<P>
	   He escaped from the camp and made a 17-month trek through mountains and
jungles across five nations. He reached the United States in 1984, earned a
master's degree in political science from the University of New Orleans and
became a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   In September 1992, he hijacked a Vietnam Airlines jet from Thailand and
dropped 50,000 anti-government leaflets over Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon,
the old South Vietnamese capital.
</P>
<P>
	   He parachuted to the ground, apparently thinking he would lead a revolution,
but was arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was released in
September 1998 as part of a mass amnesty.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Panic Money Shipped Back to Fed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Armored trucks around the country are carrying back to
the Federal Reserve some of the billions of extra dollars distributed to banks
in case of Y2K panic.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said Monday the temporary displacement should have no significant
impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on Treasury bonds, meanwhile, hit two-year highs as some investors
sold bonds they had been holding as insurance against Year 2000 disruptions. The
selling wave pushed down bond prices, which move inversely to yields.
</P>
<P>
	   "It appears to be money going back home," said David Wyss, chief financial
economist at Standard and Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, government bond prices were driven lower by what Allen Sinai,
chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics, called "the same old
concern: inflation and the Fed" and whether the central bank would raise
interest rates early next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve distributed some $80 billion to banks, thrifts and
credit unions during the fourth quarter of 1999, compared with $23 billion over
the same period a year ago. But some of the extra currency could have been
requested for reasons unrelated to Y2K, such as bank customers' holiday shopping
needs, Fed officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that 2000 has arrived without a run on banks, the banks and other
financial institutions started packing up the surplus currency and sending it
back to regional Federal Reserve banks, as previously planned. The process is
expected to take several days.
</P>
<P>
	   "The funds were just there temporarily," Wyss said. "(The Fed is) going to
take them right back."
</P>
<P>
	   Since most of the Y2K money stayed in bank vaults and didn't get into the
public's hands, there shouldn't be any inflationary effect on the economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Fed needed to provide the extra cushion of cash to reassure the
public, banks and the financial markets, Sinai said from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "No responsible central bank could have done otherwise," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the nation's banking system appeared to be operating largely free
of Y2K glitches on the first business day of 2000 -- when weekend transactions
were first accounted for in massive computer databases.
</P>
<P>
	   ATMs -- stuffed with extra cash -- continued to work, and bank balances and
loan information appeared accurate throughout the system, government and banking
industry officials reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been doing the 'health checks' of financial institutions," said Fed
spokeswoman Rose Pianalto, referring to the telephone calls to the nation's
banks made by Fed employees. "There have been no major problems reported."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Ms. Pianalto said, the central bank's check-clearing
operations, which process 68 million checks on a typical day, continued to
operate normally. "Everything went smoothly," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Banking industry officials say they're optimistic people won't experience
problems withdrawing cash from automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, banks will be watching closely to see how their computer systems
perform this week.

<HEADLINE> Democrats take control of Nassau Legislature for first time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) - Taking power for the first time, Nassau County
Democrats are promising a bipartisan effort to solve the fiscal crisis that
swept them into office.
<P>
	   "Please don't do what has been done in Washington for the last decade,"
warned Sen. Charles Schumer, "where partisanship seems to rule and very little
gets done."
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 1,000 people, including the state's top Democratic elected officials
- Schumer, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Comptroller H. Carl McCall -
attended the swearing-in ceremony Monday for the 19-member county Legislature,
held at Nassau Community College.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, Democrats have never held power in either the county Legislature,
which was created in 1996, or its predecessor, the county Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
	   During her induction address, Judy Jacobs, the new presiding officer,
acknowledged that voters sent a message demanding change. Because of a county
budget deficit that McCall thinks could rise as high as $190 million this year,
Wall Street has reduced Nassau's bond rating to nearly junk level.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be going through an intensive examination of all spending areas,"
Jacobs said. "It took the county years and years of fiscally irresponsible
activity to find ourselves in the deep hole ... and it will require multifaceted
and multiyear strategic planning to bring us back to fiscal sanity."
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Democrats will have only a 10-9 advantage, the call for
bipartisan cooperation was a theme echoed by most speakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican County Executive Thomas Gulotta summoned Jacobs and Peter
Schmitt, the Republican minority leader, to the podium. The three joined hands
and embraced to rousing applause.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-Seaford, a former county comptroller, agreed that
cooperation is important, but he couldn't help noting that many in the audience
were there to celebrate the Democrats' unlikely victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to thank Peter Schmitt for the opportunity to speak at this
Democratic Convention," he quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   Judith Hope, the state Democratic Party chairwoman, said the upset in Nassau
County could help Hillary Rodham Clinton in her expected race against New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "It simply shows that suburban voters will vote Democratic under the right
circumstances," said Hope. "I think the suburbs are critical to both the
presidential election and the Senate race."

<HEADLINE> Campaign Endorsements Not the Same  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Going in, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
are landslide leaders in the endorsement preface to the 2000 presidential
campaign. Now they've got to start winning elections to keep all those allies
firmly committed.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the way it is with front-runners.
</P>
<P>
	   Challengers, in this case led by Democrat Bill Bradley and Republican Sen.
John McCain in the six-name Republican field, always are short on endorsements,
taking what they can get, but arguing that the verdict is for voters, not party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Endorsements are not what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, big name backing can boost a candidate in the presidential primaries,
especially when it comes from a popular state figure, a party leader who can put
a political organization to work for a candidate. That's especially so in Iowa,
in the party caucuses that will open the competition on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's endorsement advantage is an extra advantage because 799 Democratic
leaders and elected officials will be automatic ``super delegates'' to the
nominating convention. The Gore campaign figures about 600 of them are on his
side.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's nothing like the era of party bosses who could choose a candidate,
deliver nominating delegates with an endorsement, and make it stick. That was
before the Democratic reform movement that began in 1972, shifting the power to
the primary and caucus voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Endorsements come with no guarantees. Party leaders who sign on early with a
front-runner can vanish or switch at the drop of a candidate in the primaries.
The classic case was that of Democratic Sen. Edmund S. Muskie in 1972; few
candidates ever had so dominant a lineup of early endorsements, none ever saw
them disappear so quickly as when his campaign faltered and flopped.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is the endorsement champion this time. He has the support of 29 of the
55 Republican senators, including the newest, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island,
appointed to succeed his father -- who had endorsed Bush, and whose name had
earlier remained on his Web site list of backers with the notation that he'd
died.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-five of the 31 Republican governors have endorsed Bush. He has the
backing of 166 of the 222 GOP House members so far.
</P>
<P>
	   And now of Elizabeth Dole, the third vanquished rival to endorse the Texas
governor. Mrs. Dole, who quit the campaign three months ago blaming lack of
funds, endorsed Bush and campaigned with him in New Hampshire and Iowa, where
the 2000 voting begins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She is one of the few people who, when she makes an endorsement, it can
move people,'' said Ari Fleischer, her spokesman before he switched to a similar
role in the Bush campaign. Fleischer said Mrs. Dole's backing would help the
Republican ticket with women voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Endorsements from defeated candidates are of questionable impact, given the
fact that they couldn't line up enough backing for themselves to keep going.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, they draw attention, and the display of support helps.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, has a handful of congressional endorsements, four from senators,
seven from House members. One of the latter, Rep. Lindsey Graham, who came to
national attention in arguing the impeachment case against President Clinton, is
featured in the latest McCain television ads for the Feb. 19 South Carolina
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not just that they endorse and you never see them again,'' said
McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky. ``We've been able to use their help.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, McCain says his lack of endorsements is evidence of his
independence and his determination to change Washington. He says the GOP
establishment doesn't want him because ``things are going to be a lot
different'' if he wins.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has been endorsed by 122 Democratic House members, 24 senators and 10
of the party's 18 governors. And, of course, President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's congressional endorsement count is three senators and a half dozen
members of the House. One of his supporters, Rep. Pete Stark of California, said
other Democrats are waiting because they don't want to risk alienating some of
their own supporters by taking sides in an increasingly competitive presidential
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   That's only the top of the endorsement lists; there are hundreds more on all
the candidates' rosters from local and state political leaders, and from figures
outside government.
</P>
<P>
	   The endorsement that counts most for Gore is not from an individual, it is
from the AFL-CIO, a powerful force in any Democratic campaign. The Iowa United
Auto Workers are backing Gore, although their national union has not endorsed
him. Nor has the Teamsters Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is working for Teamsters backing, or at least neutrality. He walked
a Teamsters picket line in Moonachie, N.J., one day last week, saying that he is
a candidate for working families, whatever endorsements big labor bestows.

<HEADLINE> Manchester Planned Parenthood clinic closed after threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, Conn. (AP) - A Planned Parenthood clinic in Connecticut was
one of several to receive letters the author claimed were contaminated with
anthrax.
<P>
	   Similar threats were received Monday at Planned Parenthood clinics in
Birmingham, Ala., Providence, R.I., Naples, Fla., Fort Wayne, Ind., and a
government unemployment office in Immokalee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   A female worker at the Manchester clinic discovered the letter while opening
the mail Monday morning, police said. The FBI, environmental officials and a
police hazardous materials team were called in and workers were ordered out of
the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthrax is an acute infectious disease that can strike animals and people.
The woman who opened the letter was isolated at the scene. The road outside the
clinic was closed for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Tests found the letter was not contaminated, police said. The woman who
opened the letter was not harmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Char Wendel, the executive director of the Planned Parenthood office in
Naples, said the typewritten letter found there said: "You've been exposed to
anthrax. You're going to die in less than 24 hours. We need to get rid of you.
We're sorry."
</P>
<P>
	   Since the threats were sent through the mail, the FBI was investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   Sporadic threats of contamination with the potentially lethal anthrax
bacterium date back several years. The FBI said a spate of letters last year
contained a sticky substance or dark powder and the ominous warning: You've been
contaminated by anthrax.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters have been received in almost every region of the nation. They
often arrive in bunches, at 10 or 15 similar targets in a city. The targets have
been quite varied: Abortion clinics, Catholic schools, nightclubs, department
stores, hospitals, post offices, courthouses, news media offices, FBI offices
and even the Old Executive Office Building beside the White House.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Leads Croatia Election  </HEADLINE>
   By SNJEZANA VUKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- An opposition coalition that pledged to strengthen
democracy in Croatia appeared headed toward victory today in the country's first
parliamentary election after the death of President Franjo Tudjman, according to
partial returns.
</P>
<P>
	   With 61 percent of Monday's vote counted, Tudjman's Croatian Democratic
Union was trailing in eight of the 10 electoral districts, in some cases by a
margin of more than 2-to-1, Croatian state television said.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnout -- more than 78 percent of the nearly 4.2 million eligible
voters -- was a near record, indicating Croats' awareness that the first vote
after Tudjman's Dec. 10 death would be critical in determining the direction of
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Tudjman led the nation to independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 only to later
lose western support because of his authoritarianism and a nationalism that
often translated into anti-Serb sentiment and even persecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters were choosing about 150 seats in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Final results may not be known until Friday, said election commission head
Marijan Ramuscak. Some 400 foreign observers monitored the vote, and Ramuscak
said no serious irregularities were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Ramuscak confirmed that the opposition appeared to have the lead. He did not
give precise nationwide figures, but said the center-left coalition of the
Social Democrats and Social Liberals led with 40 to 50 percent of the votes in
most of the districts.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition has promised to introduce democratic reforms and radical
changes to erase corruption and mismanagement, and to cut government spending by
halving the salaries of legislators and some senior officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition also has pledged to shift power from the presidency to the
parliament. Tudjman enjoyed almost monarchial powers during his party's tenure.
The opposition has said it would make sure the next president has a smaller
role.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential elections have been scheduled for Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   In the capital, Zagreb, state television said the Social Democrat-Social
Liberal coalition won between 45 and 51 percent compared with 22 percent for
Tudjman's party, known by its Croatian initials HDZ. The ruling party was
trailing with 20 to 32 percent in other regions. Four smaller opposition parties
accounted for most of the rest of the votes.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Croatian television said Tudjman's party was ahead by 11 percent in
the region around the eastern town of Vukovar and was roughly tied with the
coalition in a rural region of central Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Mate Granic, expected to be the HDZ candidate in the
upcoming presidential election, said the ruling party ``clearly has lost'' the
elections and the results were ``far below our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate the winners,'' Granic said. ``We will be a tough
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the headquarters of the opposition coalition, the mood was one of
triumph. The two coalition leaders -- Ivica Racan and Drazen Budisa -- raised
their arms as their supporters cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   Racan, leader of the Social Democrats and the coalition's choice for prime
minister, said the results ``are realistic,'' adding, ``we were aware of the
citizens' feelings.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll do our best to justify their confidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Budisa, a leader of the Social Liberals, is the coalition's presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-five parties were competing in the election. The exact number of seats
will depend on the size of the expatriate turnout. Expatriates, many of them in
neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, began voting Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Bening Taking Break From Acting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Pregnant with her fourth child, Annette Bening has decided
to take a break from acting.
</P>
<P>
	   The star of "American Beauty" told More magazine that pregnancy suits her
well.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel exhilarated," she said in its February issue. "Kind of liberated."
</P>
<P>
	   Bening, who is married to Warren Beatty, said her decision to take at least
1 1/2 years off from acting comes on the heels of an intense year.
</P>
<P>
	   After finishing "American Beauty" she headed immediately to Los Angeles for
a month of stage work in "Ibsen's Hedda Gabler." The movie "What Planet Are You
From?" was next, and is due out this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just overacted," Bening said. "If I had to come up with one more
emotional moment, I was going to kill myself."
</P>
<P>
	   Bening, who was thrust into the limelight following her 1991 role in
"Bugsy," said she is glad fame came later in life.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had never considered myself glamorous," she said. "Thank God it didn't
happen to me until I was 30. By then I had some coping mechanisms."

<HEADLINE> Jack Klugman Faces Palimony Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jack Klugman's former girlfriend is seeking a new
palimony trial, contending jurors at her first one reached the wrong verdict
when they ruled in favor of the actor.
</P>
<P>
	   A Los Angeles Superior Court judge will hear a petition by lawyers
representing Barbara Neugass on Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Her attorneys contend Neugass should get a new trial because of
"irregularity in orders of the court and abuse of discretion" and "verdict and
decision contrary to the evidence."
</P>
<P>
	   On. Dec. 1, a jury rejected the 57-year-old woman's claim that Klugman, who
starred in television's "Quincy" and "The Odd Couple," had promised her lifetime
support. The jurors decided Klugman never had an express contract with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Kurt Lewin also ruled that Neugass had no claim to proceeds from the
sale of the 77-year-old actor's thoroughbred horse farm or personal property she
allegedly left there.
</P>
<P>
	   Klugman testified during the trial that although he had a 20-year
relationship with Neugass, he never loved her.
</P>
<P>
	   Their relationship ended in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   A message left with Neugass' attorney, William Glucksman, after business
hours on Monday was not returned.

<HEADLINE> Voter Eyes Bradley's Glasses  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Bill Bradley famously ignores fashion, but he does pay
attention to appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Eye doctor Norm Michaud, a Goffstown resident and helpful Republican,
stopped the Democratic presidential candidate as he was leaving a speech Monday
to advise him against using his reading glasses in public. ``Half-glasses are
why Ted Kennedy was never elected president,'' Michaud said. ``People don't like
to look at you peering over half-glasses. It doesn't make you look
trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley shook the doctor's hand and nodded. ``Thanks. I thought about
that,'' the candidate said. ``That's why I use a TelePrompTer.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   It's not ``Green Eggs and Ham'' -- but close.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign launched its January sprint on a Dr. Seuss theme, issuing
colorful press credentials that borrowed not only from the candidate -- ``Let
the joyous journey begin,'' the laminated cards read, mimicking Bradley's phrase
for the campaign -- but also from the children's poet in beckoning ``Oh, the
places you'll go!''
</P>
<P>
	   On the back of official press luggage tags, all properly copyrighted, the
Cat in the Hat is pictured smiling over this promise: ``Congratulations! Today
is your day. You're off to great places! You're off and away!''
</P>
<P>
	   A swirl of pastel colors did not hide the fact that Iowa and New Hampshire
-- drawn in outline on the cartoony credential -- are the only two ``great
places'' Bradley and his entourage are off to anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ------

<P>
	   BY THE NUMBERS:

president in the next 50 years. Pew Center, December 1999.

<P>
	   VOTER'S VOICE:
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe in the system. The vice president ought to be president. And
Bradley shouldn't even be challenging him.'' -- Gene Minnis, an Al Gore
supporter in Davenport, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO:
</P>
<P>
	   In Waterloo, Iowa, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander trotted out a
vintage auto to send ``a wake-up call to Republicans'' that front-running
presidential candidate Bob Dole's 35 years in Washington make him a certain
general-election loser. Posing with a 1960 Ford Thunderbird at a car museum,
Alexander said, ``That was the same year that Bob Dole arrived in Washington,
and he has been there ever since.'' He used his outsider pitch to point out
Dole's years in Congress and warn, ``35 years in Washington is a losing
message.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   MONDAY'S ROUNDUP:
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Gore contrast the themes of their competing Democratic
campaigns. Bradley promises ``a world of new possibilities,'' emphasizing
education and health care as top priorities. Gore counters that he is a tested
leader and America needs ``good decisions with good leadership.'' Elizabeth Dole
prepares to endorse George W. Bush's Republican candidacy. Sen. John McCain
focuses on New Hampshire, where he's in a dead heat with Bush, by courting
voters at a town meeting. Republican Steve Forbes, also in New Hampshire,
criticizes the current income tax system.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   TODAY'S TRAIL:
</P>
<P>
	   Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan signs copies of his book in Virginia.
Republicans Alan Keyes, Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch and Forbes campaign in
Iowa. McCain and Bush travel through New Hampshire. Gore meets with high school
students in New Hampshire, where Bradley proposes budget savings plans.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks Off to Slow Start  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Renewed peace talks between Syria and Israel are
off to a rocky start. While President Clinton has cleared his desk and signaled
he's available all week long, his next move is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton aims to seize an opportunity to make peace. His spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, says he will keep at it as long as his mediation is constructive.
</P>
<P>
	   But Israel and Syria stumbled over which hot issue to deal with first, and
Clinton flew back to Washington on Monday night with his plans up in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   On the first day of a new round of negotiations in an off-limits federal
conference center here, Clinton spent most of the day and until late at night
talking to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   He met with them separately throughout the day, as did Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. But a three-way meeting, which would have brought Barak and
al-Sharaa face-to-face, did not ``pan out,'' State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The feeling is that these are very hard issues, that you cannot have a
fully scripted procedure in a discussion that is complex,'' Rubin said. ``Today
has been serious and substantive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sources close to the talks said the problem was whether to deal first with
an Israeli withdrawal on the Golan Heights, as Syria prefers, or with the kind
of peace Syria would extend to Israel as well as security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The procedure and the substance are wrapped together at this stage in the
discussion,'' Rubin said. ``They have not agreed on a work plan yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Little in the way of news is seeping out. But Lockhart and Rubin said the
two sides were getting into the knotty issues.
</P>
<P>
	   That means how much land Barak is willing to relinquish, the nature of the
peace Syria would commit itself to in return and also the extent of U.S.
involvement in maintaining security along a new border between the two old foes.
</P>
<P>
	   The price tag could be high. Lockhart said informal soundings already were
being taken in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   New security arrangements would be needed to replace the Golan Heights, the
strategic buffer that has shielded Israel since Syria lost the high-ground in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 18,000 Jews who live there may have to be relocated, as their farms,
light industries and wineries are abandoned.
</P>
<P>
	   There also has been speculation U.S. troops would be used to help keep the
peace -- an option the administration has not confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No agreement of this magnitude has come without a price,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But first, there has to be an agreement, and already U.S. officials are
telling reporters not to expect a breakthrough right away.
</P>
<P>
	   And Lockhart said Monday ``it's quite unrealistically optimistic to think it
can be done in this round.''
</P>
<P>
	   But, he said, ``it's important to start.''
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between the two countries broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Talks reopened briefly last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said Clinton was prepared ``to invest as many days as are
appropriate and constructive'' to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin also sought to dampen expectations. But he did not underplay the
significance of the negotiations. ``This is an historic opportunity that may not
come again unless it is seized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before sitting down first with Barak and then al-Sharaa, the president
strolled with them across a 200-foot long pedestrian bridge that spanned a dry
creek.
</P>
<P>
	   A reporter called out, ``how is it going so far?''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton waved and said nothing.

Kremlin post as "image adviser" sent a clear message to the Russian public that
Putin wants nothing to do with the widespread corruption that has plagued Russia

<HEADLINE> Santana, Lead Prospects for Grammys  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Carlos Santana could be following in Bonnie
Raitt's footsteps as a comeback favorite for this year's Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Raitt's resurgence with "Nick of Time" in 1990, the 52-year-old Santana
is shaping up as the veteran rocker most likely to grab handfuls of nominations
when the Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences announces its picks today.
</P>
<P>
	   Overlooked by the Grammys for his albums in the 1960s and 1970s, Santana
could be a frontrunner this year for his album "Supernatural," which includes
collaborations with Dave Matthews, Lauryn Hill and Eric Clapton. The No. 1
single "Smooth," featuring Matchbox 20 singer Rob Thomas, is a likely
best-record nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana won the rock-instrumental Grammy in 1988 with "Blues for Salvador."
</P>
<P>
	   The best album and record fields look to be a mostly youthful bunch other
than Santana, with teen sensations potentially dominating. Possibilities include
Ricky Martin, Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin, whose performance on last year's Grammys helped put his career in
orbit, is likely to score with his hit single "Livin' La Vida Loca." Other
best-record prospects include Enrique Iglesias' "Bailamos," TLC's "No Scrubs"
and Cher's top-selling single "Believe."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dole Supporting Bush in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MERRIMACK, N.H. (AP) -- After spending 1999 piling up an unprecedented $67
million in donations, George W. Bush opens the final phase of his campaign for
the Republican presidential nomination with the goal of turning his financial
support into electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
	   First he was picking up the endorsement of Elizabeth Dole in New Hampshire
today, exactly four weeks before the state's voters go to the polls. Then the
Texas governor was taking Dole to Iowa to stump for votes in advance of the Jan.
24 presidential caucuses there.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Bush's chief rival for the 2000 GOP nomination, Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, maintained his focus on New Hampshire with a nonstop schedule of
town hall meetings. Today he was visiting Concord, Salem and Franklin.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown McCain leading Bush in the state, although Bush
maintains a sizable lead in national surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm excited to be here,'' Bush said Monday as he arrived at Manchester
Airport, despite being greeted by a steady rain. ``I thought I'd rather be
fishing, but now that I'm on the ground, I'd rather be campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
	   The governor pledged to focus on two issues: tax cuts and education reform,
areas where he feels McCain has laid out inferior plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The endorsement by Dole, who until October was also running for the
nomination, was aimed at strengthening ties with female voters. That group
traditionally has been a source of Democratic strength but has shown warmth
toward Bush in polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the things that Mrs. Dole worked hard to do was to recruit new
faces and new voices to the Republican Party, and that's exactly what I'm
attempting to do myself,'' Bush said in speaking of the former Red Cross
president and two-time Cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said the support of women in general and
Mrs. Dole in particular would show that the Republican Party no longer has a
so-called gender gap.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If George Bush is the nominee,'' Fleischer said, ``the gender gap becomes
a Democratic problem -- they will have a real problem with men.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proven his ability to draw female voters, getting 49 percent in his
first gubernatorial race -- against a woman, Democratic Gov. Ann Richards -- and
more than 60 percent in his 1998 re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   The stop in New Hampshire is part of a weeklong swing that also will take
Bush to Iowa, South Carolina and Michigan, all early primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   The Michigan stop -- to participate in a debate Monday -- was added only
hours before Bush left Texas for New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Opinsky, McCain's spokesman, noted that Bush's decision to
participate came on the same day the senator announced a $1 million campaign ad
buy in vote-rich Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's absence from some early debates in New Hampshire contributed to
McCain's strong gains in polls there, Opinsky said, and he speculated it may
have influenced the decision on the Michigan debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think clearly Senator McCain excelled and overtook Governor Bush because
he was able to hold town hall forums and participate in several debates in New
Hampshire,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had been scheduled to address the American Farm Bureau in Houston on
Monday, but aides said he decided to debate after organizers said he could speak
to the farmers by satellite.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said he changed his plans after hearing the organizers were
arranging ``a real debate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that there are debates Thursday in New Hampshire, Friday in South
Carolina and then Monday in Michigan, Bush quipped: ``It will be three debates
in five days, and I hope the American people can stand it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's debate participation also comes at a time when his campaign is trying
to counter criticism that he lacks substance.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the staff released a book that compiles the details of all his
policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   The 208-page paperback, titled ``A Fresh Start for America,'' contains
copies of Bush's seven major policy speeches, as well as position papers on
education, taxes, technology and agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Fraunces Tavern restaurant bites the dust - but historic part  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The tables were draped with linen, overflowing with food
and dozens of wine decanters. But it all lay untouched one night in 1783 at the
Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan.
<P>
	   George Washington was on his way, to bid adieu to his officers in the
Revolution. And many tearful kisses would pass among them before the feast.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, at the start of the 21st century, a notice went up at the
historic watering hole visited by the likes of Richard Nixon and Harry Truman:
The restaurant and bar were closed, indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line is money," said tavernkeeper Robert Norden.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of the American Revolution, the bottom line was victory.
</P>
<P>
	   And on that night in the Long Room, just above today's restaurant, Gen.
Washington told the officers who helped him win America's freedom from Britain:
"With a heart full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you."
</P>
<P>
	   Then each man, many suffused in tears, "marched up to, kissed and parted
with his General-in-Chief," wrote Lt. Col. Benjamin Tallmadge, one of the
officers with Washington in the last hours before he resigned his military
commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's reality is far more prosaic.
</P>
<P>
	   The restaurant's operators, Robert and Jacqueline Norden, are unable to
agree on terms of a new lease with the building's owner, the Sons of the
Revolution, a patriotic not-for-profit organization that owns the tavern and the
right to its name.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nordens said the restaurant is losing money, with the lease and
real-estate taxes totaling around $315,000 a year. Since Jan. 31, 1991, when the
previous lease expired, the Nordens have been month-to-month tenants while
negotiations continued unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expect they're going to leave," said Robert McKay, chairman of the real
estate committee of the Sons of the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee planned to meet Monday evening to discuss "the restaurant
situation," he said, but "it's improbable they'll stay beyond noon on Jan. 5.
They've agreed to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the oldest continuously operated restaurants in the country, the
tavern's clubby bar on Pearl Street - just down from Nasdaq headquarters - has
been a hot spot for Wall Street brokers and financiers. When a company went
public, they'd often celebrate here, watching the television in the bar for
stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
	   The fun was shattered in 1975, when an explosion at the tavern killed four
people and injured 60. A Puerto Rican nationalist group took responsibility for
the attack on a site they associated with America's identity.
</P>
<P>
	   The yellow brick colonial at the corner of Broad Street was opened in the
1760s by Washington's chief steward, a patriot named Samuel Fraunces. A meeting
place, it later housed the administrative offices of the new nation, when New
York was its capital.
</P>
<P>
	   "More than a place to drink!" says a sign.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past six decades, the tavern has been operated by the Norden family.
But apparently, they're not what the patriotic Sons want.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're seeking is three things: a reasonable rate of return, a quality
operation and a cooperative relationship with the tenants," McKay said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday in the Long Room, a fake turkey lay on a platter and clams on a
plate - not steaming. The historic room graced by a portrait of Washington is
part of a museum still open to the public and is separate from the Nordens'
business.
</P>
<P>
	   In the eatery below, tables were elegantly set for a dinner that was not to
be. And in the bar, huge wildlife trophies Norden purchased at auction loomed
over the wood-paneled space.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh no!" said one man as he was turned away at the front door.
</P>
<P>
	   But this is American history, and it dies hard.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sons of the Revolution say they're looking for a new tenant, and the
tavern could reopen later this year.

<HEADLINE> End To Corporate Tax Breaks Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley wants to end corporate tax
breaks worth an estimated $125 billion over 10 years, his presidential campaign
says.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, scheduled to detail the proposal today in a noontime speech to New
Hampshire business leaders, was known for his Senate work on tax reform but
before now has had little to say about tax policy in the race against Vice
President Al Gore for the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   By going after big-business tax breaks, Bradley hoped to strike a popular
chord among average voters, especially in New Hampshire, where anti-tax
sentiment is institutionalized: There is no state income tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also was campaigning today in the Granite State, which holds the
nation's first presidential primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign was vague Monday night about which corporate tax
shelters, special subsidies and ``handful'' of loopholes Bradley would
eliminate, but likely suspects included special tax-code treatment for the oil,
gas and mining industries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll specify a series of steps to effectively close corporate tax
shelters, which are ways corporations use existing tax code to avoid their
obligations, and to close a handful of tax loopholes that provide unfair
advantage to corporate interests, distort the tax code and require the American
taxpayer to pay more,'' campaign spokesman Eric Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Why close just a handful? ``This is a good start,'' Hauser said. ``Bill
Bradley's commitment to the concept of tax reform will be resolute throughout
his two terms, so this is not necessarily the end.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Gore on Monday launched what promised to be a frenetic month of
campaigning by trading potshots on their respective budget plans. Both
Democratic rivals put schools at the top of their agenda, but Gore was careful
to touch base with women as well on the subject of abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the ways we honor women is to honor the choices they make,'' Gore
told about 250 women activists Monday evening. ``I want you to know that I will
ensure that a woman's right to choose is preserved and protected.''
</P>
<P>
	   For months, Gore has tried, with some success, to paint Bradley -- and
particularly his $65-billion-a-year health insurance plan -- as a big-spending
budget buster.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's tax proposal, in which Bradley does not earmark prospective new
revenue for additional spending, could blunt the impact of Gore's criticism at
the same time it could leave Bradley open to charges of trying to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is relying on about $1.4 billion in loophole-closings over five years
-- the plan in the Clinton administration's fiscal 2000 budget -- to help pay
for his campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the Bradley campaign tried to paint Gore with his own
big-spending brush, contending that the programs he's proposed in this campaign
would run up $350 billion in red ink over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The subsequent back-and-forth was predictable, with Gore arguing that
Bradley's proposals are even larger and would run up more red ink in the budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He seems to have as much difficulty with our budget numbers as he does
adding up his own health care numbers,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said. ``We
practice what we preach. We've been doing it for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore himself faulted Bradley for focusing his campaign almost exclusively on
universal access to health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator Bradley seems to believe that America can address only one thing
at a time,'' Gore said as he campaigned in Iowa, which holds delegate caucuses
on Jan. 24. ``The vision of the American people should not be limited by those
who lead us.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Would Threaten Russia  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMHERST, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain says
that acting Russian president Vladimir Putin should be urged to end the conflict
with Chechen militants under threat of sanctions, an issue the Arizona senator
would talk about ``every day'' as president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd state unequivocally that there would be no more (U.S.) Export-Import
(bank) loans, that the United States would not support any further IMF funding
until this thing is brought to some kind of reasonable conclusion,'' McCain said
aboard his campaign bus Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   His return to the campaign trail following a tropical family vacation is
expected this week to feature McCain's appeal for better citizenship among
Americans and especially presidential candidates in an effort to reinstill pride
toward government and its officials - a not-subtle jab at President Clinton and
the scandals that have plagued his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain suggested that the president should be aggressive condemning
Chechnya, especially with the elevation of Putin after the surprise resignation
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin enjoys widespread public approval because of his no-nonsense style and
his tough handling of the Russian offensive in separatist Chechnya. Many
Russians support the war as the only way to protect the nation from terrorist
attacks such as the apartment bombings -- blamed on Chechen militants -- that
killed over 300 people in September.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You reach a point where you have to take a stand on certain issues and I
believe that a tacit acceptance of what the Russians are doing has worse long
term consequences than making it clear to them that there is a price to pay,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The acting president's test, McCain said, will be whether he aggressively
moves to stamp out his country's rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's going to be business as usual, then they have further to fall,''
McCain said. ``If he wants to control the country then he's got to take care of
the corruption.''
</P>
<P>
	   But it's Putin's role in Chechnya that prompts McCain's mistrust the most,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's terribly disturbing to see how Mr. Putin trod this path to power. It
was through Chechnya,'' McCain said. ``A year ago, nobody had heard of Putin.
Now he orchestrates this incredibly brutal offensive in Chechnya, and the
popularity of his government skyrockets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Touching down a few miles away in Manchester, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
voiced similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   It was McCain's first appearance back on the campaign trail since spending
the holiday with his family in Costa Rica. Polls showing he has a shot at
beating Bush here next month had McCain chanting from a cartoon he watched over
the break.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Happy, happy, joy, joy!'' he sang as he climbed on the bus.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's first campaign stop of the new year was a town hall meeting at
Amherst Middle School's cafeteria, which was packed with several hundred
residents. Former Sen. Warren Rudman was at his side.
</P>
<P>
	   Appealing to the season of holiday bill-paying, McCain told those present
that he would work hard to abolish Internet taxes. His aides said that during
the 1999 holiday season Americans paid about $600 million in Internet taxes on
$10 billion to $12 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also said he long had expected his former competitor, Elizabeth Dole,
to endorse Bush, the front-runner for the 2000 GOP nomination. Her support would
``probably ... be of some help to Governor Bush,'' McCain acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think endorsements are very helpful to a degree,'' he added.
``Especially in a state like New Hampshire, they judge you on you.''

<HEADLINE> Capitalizing on Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Local resident Lori Simmons lost no time in
capitalizing on the Israeli-Syrian peace talks in her hometown.
</P>
<P>
	   She began designing a T-shirt right after the talks were announced Dec. 21
and has been selling them through local businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I figured someone would do it. It might as well be someone local,'' the
National Park Service cartographer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her design includes a heart-shaped map of the world with Syria, Israel and
Shepherdstown highlighted, along with the legend, ``Mideast Peace Talks, 3
January 2000, Shepherdstown, W.Va.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin on the cell phone network in West
Virginia:
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think what you may find here in Shepherdstown, W.Va., is that the cell
zones might not be as active as they were in Maryland,'' he said. ``So you may
be in a situation where some of the people that you're trying to call may not be
in a place where cell phones work. I've found that happening to myself just 10
minutes ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin was responding to reporters' questions about whether participants in
the peace talks could be reached by cell phone, as they were during the
Israeli-Palestinian talks on Maryland's Eastern shore in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Cellular telephone calls sometimes fail in West Virginia because the
mountainous terrain blocks radio signals.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The glare of the international spotlight reminds some Shepherdstown
residents of a visit several years ago by a Russian film crew looking to
document a typical American small town.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Shepherdstonians reject the notion that their community, 70 miles
northwest of the nation's capital, is typical. They boast of the town's
diversity and intellectualism. Retired diplomats share the sidewalks with
artists, software engineers and federal workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Shepherdstown has a contemporary theater festival, premiering four new
American plays each summer. Former first lady Nancy Reagan liked the
restaurants, and former President Carter enjoyed the fishing in the nearby
Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
	   The town's official historian laureate, retired veterinarian James Price,
scoffs at the notion that Shepherdstown is ordinary in any way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a typical small town,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Aliens Detained in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Three Chinese men were ordered held Monday after 12 men were
apparently smuggled into the United States aboard a container ship from Hong
Kong that docked at Harbor Island over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Jan. 14 for Sheng Deng, Ju Shu Hwang
and Yu Zheng, who were taken into custody Sunday. They were waiting in a blue
van parked near the ship.
</P>
<P>
	   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials were alerted to the scheme
by the agency's Hong Kong office on Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 men arrived on Harbor Island on Sunday aboard the container ship OOCL
Faith -- owned by Orient Overseas Container Line of Hong Kong. They were found
inside a container, where they had been since Dec. 18, said INS spokeswoman
Irene Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
	   All were being detained at the INS center in Seattle, where they will be
interviewed and likely deported to China.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, in Long Beach, Calif., 18 suspected illegal immigrants were
detained after being found inside a cargo container aboard a ship that
reportedly left Hong Kong nearly three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Those Chinese immigrants, who were not injured, were found Sunday by crew
members of the Zim Shekou as it was coming into the Port of Long Beach, said
Coast Guard Petty Officer Billy Davidson. The ship had docked in British
Columbia before reaching Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vancouver, British Columbia late Monday, a Canadian immigration official
confirmed that more stowaways had been found hiding in a ship docked at the Port
of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship and its allegedly smuggled human cargo were believed linked to the
ship that docked in Seattle, but officials would not say where the ship was from
or how many people were aboard.

<HEADLINE> US Electric System Passing Y2K Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal officials say a Y2K-related computer malfunction
at the Oak Ridge nuclear weapons plant in Tennessee caused no operational
problems and was corrected within hours.
</P>
<P>
	   John Gilligan, the DOE's top computer expert, said Monday the problem
involved a computer that tracks nuclear material as to its weight and type. He
said the actual accounting of material was not affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory initially declined to provide
details of the malfunction, first reported Sunday, because it involved
classified activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilligan said the Oak Ridge incident was the only Y2K problem affecting
``mission critical'' systems at Energy Department facilities nationwide during
the New Year's rollover, although there were ``about a dozen'' minor glitches.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the failures ``tended to be minor and easily fixed,'' he told
reporters. He said there are about 200,000 computer systems at DOE facilities,
including the three weapons labs. The Oak Ridge facility has 260 systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge makes warhead components for the MX missile
system and is the primary uranium storage site for the nation's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Monday the $5 billion spent
on Y2K in the energy sector was well worth it and will pay dividends that will
reduce the likelihood of future power outages or oil disruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Energy Department spent about $235 million on Y2K including
computer fixes at its nuclear weapons facilities and research labs.

<HEADLINE> W. Hollywood Nixes Condom Giveaway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A proposal to order bars and nightclubs to
hand out condoms to high-risk customers has been soundly defeated before the
city council.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting 5-0 on Monday night in this tolerant Southern California enclave, the
council decided unanimously to continue instead with a voluntary giveaway
program and buy 50,000 additional condoms for distribution.
</P>
<P>
	   The mandatory program would have required condoms to be distributed at
places of business with liquor licenses, adult businesses, coffee houses and
nonprofit organizations serving those most at risk for HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   The city, which has an active nightlife, could have imposed fines for
noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than two hours of discussion, council members decided that making
gay bars give their customers condoms was not the best way to fight the spread
of disease.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mandatory condom distribution does not adequately address the issue of
safe sex,'' said Councilman Steve Martin. ``A fish bowl of condoms just doesn't
compare to aggressive street outreach and one-on-one education.''
</P>
<P>
	   Health advocates disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not an imposition to have a condom made available to you in a city
whose principal economy is nightlife-driven,'' said Ged Kensela, spokesman for
the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.

<P>
	   Some club and restaurant owners said they objected to forced distribution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To make it mandatory would be discriminating (against gay businesses),''
said John St. Jar, whose bar has been voluntarily distributing condoms for eight
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the city distributed 300,000 condoms to about 30 nightclubs, where
owners voluntarily placed them in containers at entrances.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Beat 49ers 34-29  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Tim Dwight gave the Atlanta Falcons hope for the future.
Jerry Rice showed the San Francisco 49ers why he's not ready to be part of their
past.
</P>
<P>
	   Dwight caught seven passes for 162 yards, including two touchdowns, and
returned a punt 70 yards for another score as the Falcons closed the NFL's
regular season with a 34-29 victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   "Things just started happening," said Dwight, whose 241 all-purpose yards
were the third-highest in Falcons history. "It was kind of crazy out there."
</P>
<P>
	   The 49ers (4-12) fell behind 31-7 but showed a bit of pride in their worst
season since 1979, scoring three second-half touchdowns to make it close.
Although the Falcons recovered an onside kick with 2:45 remaining, they still
had to bat down a desperation pass in the end zone to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice, in what might have been his final game with the 49ers, added another
highlight to his brilliant career with a 62-yard reception, setting up a San
Francisco touchdown and drawing applause from Falcons defensive back Ray
Buchanan. Rice finished with six receptions for 143 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The 49ers, projected to be some $20 million over the salary cap, must decide
if they can afford Rice and quarterback Steve Young, who missed most of the
season following another concussion.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still feel I can help this team out and I can make big plays," Rice said.
"I'm sure Steve -- he doesn't want to go out on this note also. We just want to
come back, turn this thing around and be the 49ers of old."
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Chandler took advantage of the league's worst-rated pass defense to
throw for 306 yards and three touchdowns, helping Atlanta (5-11) snap a 10-game
losing streak on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made it exciting, didn't we?" coach Dan Reeves said. "When you have
control of a game like that, you shouldn't let the other team back in it. We
did."
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta won its final two games -- the team's only winning streak of the
season -- but still equaled the 1990 Denver Broncos for the worst record in a
post-Super Bowl year. Both teams were coached by Reeves.
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco a perennial powerhouse gone shockingly bad since Young was
knocked out in Week 2, dropped 11 of its last 12 for the team's worst finish
since a 2-14 mark in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   One consolation for San Francisco: the No. 3 pick in the draft. The Falcons
didn't have to worry about draft ramifications, having traded their top pick in
2000 to Baltimore for a second-rounder in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta wound up with a reserve tight end, Reggie Kelly, who had only eight
catches for 146 yards this season. The Ravens, meanwhile, will gladly take a
prime No. 5 choice in the draft.
</P>
<P>
	   Dwight, a speedy, 5-foot-8 receiver, broke the game open in the final minute
of the first half with his dazzling skills as a returner.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta was leading just 10-7 when Dwight took a punt at his own 30, broke
free in front of the San Francisco bench, cut back toward the middle of the
field and outraced Randy Krik without being touched, reaching the end zone with
just 12 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Falcons increased the lead to 24-7 on their first possession of the
second half, as Terance Mathis hauled in the 50th touchdown reception of his
career on a 19-yard pass from Chandler. Mathis also assured his second straight
1,000-yard season with a 9-yard catch in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta blew it open when Dwight struck again, this time with a 60-yard
touchdown reception. Cornerback Darnell Walker grabbed the receiver at the line,
drawing a flag but failing to slow Dwight, who hauled in the pass between two
defenders at the San Francisco 35 and stiff-armed Lee Woodall on the way to the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Dwight scored Atlanta's first touchdown on a 5-yard reception. Chandler
hooked up with the speedy receiver on passes of 25 and 20 yards before going to
him again on third-and-goal at the 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Morten Andersen added field goals of 49 and 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The 49ers, showing an astonishing lack of discipline for a team that won at
least 10 games every year from 1983-98, were penalized 17 times for 148 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   But they got within striking distance on Travis Jervey's 1-yard touchdown
run late in the third period and quarterback Jeff Garcia's 5-yarder with 9 1/2
minutes remaining. Then, Garcia hooked up with J.J. Stokes for a 43-yard
touchdown with 2:46 left. Stokes caught five passes for 130 yards overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia completed 26 of 34 for 373 yards, hoping to show he is a worthy
successor if Young doesn't return next season. The CFL refugee also threw a
4-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   After Stokes' touchdown, Atlanta's O.J. Santiago recovered the onside kick
and the Falcons ran out most of the clock to win on Monday night for the first
time since 1981 and only the sixth time in 23 games.

<HEADLINE> State GOP chief, party pay $128,000 federal fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The New York State Republican Party was slapped with a
$128,000 federal fine to settle allegations that it handed out tens of thousands
of dollars illegally.
<P>
	   The hefty Federal Election Commission fine stems from party Chairman William
Powers' distribution of wads of cash during the 1994 and 1996 elections. State
party officials say the money paid scores of poll watchers monitoring the vote
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   FEC officials say there is no way to know exactly who it went to, since
Powers and other top party officials signed sworn affidavits stating they do not
recall specifically who received the cash.
</P>
<P>
	   The FEC alleges that Powers, GOP state party counsel Jeffrey Buley and New
York Federal Campaign Committee treasurer Michael Avella failed to report proper
purposes for disbursement, failed to report the names of recipients and made
cash payments over federal limits. The GOP officials paid the fine late last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "What appears to have happened is that the committee did not want to create
a paper trail whereby the people to whom it disbursed these funds could be
identified," according to a brief by FEC general counsel Lawrence Noble.
"Recipients of hundreds of thousands of dollars in committee funds appear
nowhere on the public record."
</P>
<P>
	   It is the first time the state Republican Party under Powers has been fined
by the FEC. The party has bragged about paying scrupulous attention to campaign
finance requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. attorney's office in Albany first reported the situation to the FEC
in September 1995 after receiving a tip from "a confidential source who has
long-standing ties to the Republican Party."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said they did not believe distributing money for
miscellaneous expenses was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Instead our concern is that the disbursements were structured to generate a
large amount of cash that was turned over to an individual or individuals in New
York City who did not wish to be identified publicly as working for the
Republican Party," said a letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney David Homer to the
FEC.
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP Party spokesman Dan Allen said party officials had become more
stringent in the way they distribute money since the FEC investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The FEC has determined we were in the wrong, and we've taken steps over the
last elections to correct that," Allen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FEC subpoenaed information from Powers, Buley, other GOP officials as
well as banks holding the state party's accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the FEC, on the day before the November 1994 election - in
which Republican George Pataki defeated then-Gov. Mario Cuomo - four checks were
cashed from the New York Republican Federal Campaign Committee by four state
party officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley and fellow Republican party lawyer David Dudley cashed checks of
$15,000 each, while GOP lawyer Gregory Serio and Mary Obwald, the receptionist
for the party's Albany office, cashed checks of $10,000 each.
</P>
<P>
	   They handed the $50,000 in cash over to Buley, who drove from Albany to New
York City and delivered it to Powers. Powers then distributed the money to
volunteers coming to GOP headquarters. The amount of the disbursements ranged
from a "couple of hundred to a couple of thousand dollars."
</P>
<P>
	   Any expenditure in excess of $200 must be reported by a political committee
under federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Republican campaign filing listed the expenditures "as election
day expenses," later amending that filing to describe them as "Travel Expense
Reimbursement and Catering Costs" after the FEC asked for more specific
information.
</P>
<P>
	   The state party used similar tactics in 1996, when New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani handily defeated Democrat Ruth Messinger.
</P>
<P>
	   In that election, eight individuals associated with the party cashed checks
totaling $22,500. Again, they handed the money over to Buley, who traveled to
New York City, where he delivered the cash to Powers, who again handed it out to
"dozens of people."
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Powers gave cash to people simply because they told him they were
supposed to get cash from him," the FEC brief said.

<HEADLINE> Packers, Pats, Jets Lose Coaches  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Bill Parcells stepped down on his own terms, Ray Rhodes and Pete Carroll
were pushed aside and Mike Ditka awaited his fate as the NFL's also-rans started
planning for next season.
</P>
<P>
	   Parcells resigned as coach of the New York Jets on Monday, while Rhodes was
fired after only one season in Green Bay, and Carroll after three years in New
England.
</P>
<P>
	   "This job has turned into a 365 day a year job and it's difficult, because
I've been doing it for 15 years in this league and I think it is time," Parcells
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I read a little message to the players and I told them you can't fool
yourself. ... I demanded a lot from the players in terms of commitment, and they
have a right to expect the same from me. And at this point in time, I just don't
feel like I could give it the way that I know it has to be given to be
successful."
</P>
<P>
	   Parcells, 58, who took the New York Giants to two Super Bowl crowns and the
Patriots to an AFC title before joining the Jets in 1997, stepped into the front
office. Bill Belichick, who was Parcells' defensive coordinator for 14 seasons
and was 37-45 in five seasons as Cleveland's coach, takes over.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill will be making the football decisions," said Parcells, whose career
record is 149-106-1.
</P>
<P>
	   The Patriots attempted to contact Belichick on Monday about replacing
Carroll. But because Parcells told Jets president Steve Gutman after Sunday's
19-9 victory over Seattle that he was resigning, Belichick already was the Jets'
head coach Monday, based on a contract signed in '97 and updated last January.
Belichick received a $1 million bonus at that time.
</P>
<P>
	   The injury-plagued Jets rallied from a 1-6 start to finish 8-8.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we hadn't finished the way we had, I think I probably would have
considered even more strongly staying on," Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think one of the things I have always tried to pride myself on is that if
I did go someplace, when I left there that it was a better operation. I feel
that way now."
</P>
<P>
	   Rhodes, hired by Green Bay when Mike Holmgren quit to become Seattle's coach
and general manager, was fired after an 8-8 season, with general manager Ron
Wolf saying Rhodes didn't live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is he a different coach than I thought he was?" Wolf said of Rhodes, fired
by Philadelphia after going 3-13 last season. "Yes."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf said he had no successor in mind. "This is going to take a while," he
said. "There's no one on the wall who's a slam dunk."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, Parcells' successor in New England, reportedly is headed for
Seattle, where he would become defensive coordinator, a job left open when the
late Fritz Shurmur became ill last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   With Belichick out of the picture, the front-runner in New England might be
former Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer.
</P>
<P>
	   Ditka is the only other coach believed to be in immediate jeopardy. The New
Orleans coach canceled his regular Monday briefing and will meet Thursday with
owner Tom Benson and general manager Bill Kuharich. Ditka, 3-13 this season and
15-33 in three years with the Saints, has said he would like to return.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo's Doug Flutie also was left to ponder his future Monday after coach
Wade Phillips benched the quarterback in favor of Rob Johnson for Saturday's AFC
wild-card game in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no choice but to accept it," Flutie said. "If I'm needed ...
whatever it is, I'll be ready to go."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite having gone a year without a start, Johnson turned in a strong
performance when the Bills closed the regular season with a 31-6 victory over
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   In the other AFC wild-card game, Miami is at Seattle on Sunday. In the NFC
wild-card games, Detroit is at Washington on Saturday, and Dallas is at
Minnesota on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The top two seeds in each conference -- Jacksonville and Indianapolis in the
AFC and St. Louis and Tampa Bay in the NFC -- have first-round byes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams and Colts, back in the playoffs after long absences, dominated the
final regular-season statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis' Marshall Faulk set an NFL record with 2,429 yards from scrimmage,
breaking Barry Sanders' mark of 2,358 set in 1997. Faulk rushed for 1,381 yards
and had 1,048 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
	   Rams teammate Kurt Warner had an NFL-best 109.2 quarterback rating,
completing 325 of 499 attempts for 4,353 yards and 41 touchdowns with 13
interceptions. He joined Dan Marino as the only quarterbacks to throw 40 TD
passes in a season.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis' Kevin Carter led the NFL with 17 sacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington's Stephen Davis led the NFC in rushing with 1,405 yards, 8 more
than Dallas' Emmitt Smith and 24 more than Faulk.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota's Randy Moss topped the NFC with 1,413 receiving yards, and
Carolina's Muhsin Muhammad had a conference-best 96 receptions.
</P>
<P>
	   Indianapolis' Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James and Marvin Smith topped the
AFC's individual statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   James, a rookie, led the NFL in rushing with 1,553 yards, and had 586
receiving yards for an AFC-best 2,139 yards from scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning had a conference-best 90.7 quarterback rating, passing for 4,135
yards and 26 TDs with 15 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison led the NFL with 1,663 receiving yards. Jacksonville's Jimmy Smith
led the league with 116 receptions, one more than Harrison.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee rookie Jerome Kearse led the AFC with 14.5 sacks.

<HEADLINE> Packers Fire Rhodes, Coaching Staff  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Ron Wolf spent three years as an Army intelligence
officer stationed in Europe. If there's anything he hates, it's a lack of
discipline.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the main reason the Green Bay Packers general manager abruptly fired
coach Ray Rhodes and his staff on Monday, hours after Green Bay (8-8) ended a
disappointing season by missing the playoffs for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is he a different coach than I thought he was? Yes," Wolf said. "What I
think we have to have here is a well-disciplined, tough, hard-nosed football
team. We don't have that here."
</P>
<P>
	   When Wolf hired Rhodes one year ago to replace Mike Holmgren, he thought
Rhodes would apply a firm hand to the Packers. Holmgren browbeat and prodded the
team through seven winning seasons, including two Super Bowls and one
championship, before leaving for the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Rhodes proved to be a lax disciplinarian who gave his players two
days off during the week before their final regular-season game, which they
needed to win to have a chance at a playoff berth. Green Bay beat Arizona 49-24,
but Dallas' win put the Cowboys in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Rhodes was tremendously popular in the locker room, Wolf said the
Packers obviously didn't respond to Rhodes' methods. He felt swift preventive
action was necessary to reverse the team's slide out of the league's upper
echelon.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Ron thought we were too friendly with Ray," safety LeRoy Butler
said. "And maybe some of us were. With as many young players as we had, you need
discipline. We didn't always have that."
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the Packers didn't agree with the move. As they cleaned out their
lockers before the start of a long offseason, several criticized Wolf's quick
trigger finger.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was shocked," said Dorsey Levens, who capped a strong season by scoring
four touchdowns Sunday. "I didn't think Ray deserved what he got. I don't think
he got a fair shake. I was a Ray Rhodes fan, and I thought he'd be around for a
little while."
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't really believe it," said defensive end Vaughn Booker, one of the
Packers who became free agents at season's end. "It's just sad to see such a
good person lose his job, especially when I can't see how it's directly his
fault."
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL's 1995 Coach of the Year has now been bucked off the coaching
carousel twice in just over 12 months. Philadelphia dismissed Rhodes one day
after the 1998 season ended, and the Packers hired him less than three weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, Rhodes was visibly shaken as he spoke about his firing from the
Eagles. On Monday, he was calm and collected as he gave a brief statement before
leaving without answering questions.
</P>
<P>
	   "First of all, it's not a funeral, people, OK?" he said. "Coming in here is
a big situation, a big job. We didn't get this thing done this year. I'll be the
last to make excuses. Business is business."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf said he has no timetable for replacing Rhodes, who signed a four-year
contract for $4 million last year, and that the coaching search will be "a
lengthy process."
</P>
<P>
	   He said his close friend Bill Parcells is not a candidate for the job.
Parcells resigned as the New York Jets coach on Monday, but will remain with the
team in a front-office position.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf said even a Cowboys loss on Sunday and a trip to the postseason
couldn't have saved Rhodes' job. Wolf apparently made the decision to fire
Rhodes after the Packers played listlessly in a Dec. 26 loss at Tampa Bay, their
third straight defeat, which essentially crushed their playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers have an additional incentive to field a winning team as quickly
as possible. The team is attempting to entice Wisconsin residents to approve
funding for extensive renovations to Lambeau Field or a new stadium entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you want to fill a stadium, you need a team that people want to see
play," Packers board member Rosemary Hinkfuss said. "It's no secret a lot of
fans weren't pleased with the way the team played this season."
</P>
<P>
	   Rhodes' firing also means the departure of offensive coordinator Sherman
Lewis, who worked with Holmgren for seven years before joining Rhodes' staff,
and defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas, who followed Rhodes from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   Green Bay's staff was the first in NFL history with blacks in all three top
positions. Longtime Packers players and assistants Harry Sydney and Johnny
Holland also were fired.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm affecting a lot of people's lives here," Wolf said. "I don't enjoy this
one iota."
</P>
<P>
	   Brett Favre had nothing but praise for Rhodes. Favre denied he was
dissatisfied with the team's offense under Lewis, or that he lobbied Wolf for
changes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We probably were not as disciplined as Ron would have liked," Favre said.
"But to make the excuse he wasn't hard enough on us is a lame excuse. Whether
Ray got a fair shot, that's not for me to say."

<HEADLINE> Parcells Resigns as Jets Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- As the same players who rallied around him sat in
stunned silence, Bill Parcells told them it was over. He was through coaching
because he no longer could make the total commitment to the job.
</P>
<P>
	   "I read a little message to the players and I told them you can't fool
yourself," Parcells said in resigning Monday as coach of the New York Jets.
"Could I coach 16 more games? Yeah, I could probably do it, or 32 or 48. But you
have to have the committed effort to do it and want to do it at the level I
would want to do it at.
</P>
<P>
	   "I demanded a lot from the players in terms of commitment, and they have a
right to expect the same from me. And at this point in time I just don't feel
like I could give it the way that I know it has to be given to be successful.
</P>
<P>
	   "This job has turned into a 365 day a year job and it's difficult, because
I've been doing it for 15 years in this league and I think it is time. In fact,
I know it is time."
</P>
<P>
	   With that, the man who turned around three franchises -- taking the Giants
to two Super Bowl crowns and the Patriots to an AFC title before joining the
Jets in 1997 -- stepped into the front office. Bill Belichick, Parcells'
defensive coordinator for 14 seasons and 37-45 in five seasons as head coach
with the Cleveland Browns, takes over.
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick was not available Monday, saying in a statement, "My intention was
to allow this to be coach Parcells' day exclusively."
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill will be making the football decisions," said Parcells, whose career
coaching record is 149-106-1. "We have a very long-standing business
relationship. He is extremely bright, well-organized and a tireless worker. He
gained a wealth of experience from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's been on the job and seen the evolution of this for three years. He's
been a part of it and has a good chance to succeed."
</P>
<P>
	   The Patriots, from whom Parcells departed in a bitter contract dispute in
'97, attempted to contact Belichick on Monday about replacing the fired Pete
Carroll. But because Parcells told Jets president Steve Gutman after Sunday's
19-9 victory over Seattle that he was resigning, Belichick already was the Jets'
head coach Monday, based on a contract signed in '97 and updated last January.
Belichick received a $1 million bonus at that time.
</P>
<P>
	   Parcells seemed energized by the way the Jets rallied from a 1-6 start
caused, partly, by major injuries. He was especially invigorated by the rapid
development of quarterback Ray Lucas, who replaced the ineffective Rick Mirer;
the team lost starter Vinny Testaverde in the opener with a torn Achilles'
tendon.
</P>
<P>
	   New York won seven of its last nine games and won five times against playoff
teams, including the last four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet he said that rally only firmed up his decision to stop coaching.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we hadn't finished the way we had, I think I probably would have
considered even more strongly staying on," he said. "But being the way we
finished, on a positive note and knowing that the team felt positive about it
...
</P>
<P>
	   "I think one of the things I have always tried to pride myself on is that if
I did go someplace, when I left there that it was a better operation," he said.
"I feel that way now."
</P>
<P>
	   The players generally were stunned by the announcement. While they all vowed
their support of Belichick, they believed the second-half turnaround had
convinced Parcells to keep going.
</P>
<P>
	   "At least I won't have to hear him tear me up every day," Lucas said,
laughing. "It's tough. When he finished talking, he walked out and we were all
sitting there like ...
</P>
<P>
	   "My opinion was I would be shocked, but it was heartfelt when he told us. I
know it hurts him a lot."
</P>
<P>
	   Lucas, a special-teamer for most of his first two-plus NFL seasons, not only
finished third in AFC passing statistics, but he erased concerns about the
position for next season if Testaverde has any setbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   He credits Parcells for allowing him to do that.
</P>
<P>
	   "He gets the most out of players," Lucas said. "Guys who nobody gives a
chance he gives a chance, and they always seem to come out on top. There are
guys people say not to waste your time on and he wastes his time and the guys
come through."
</P>
<P>
	   Now it is Parcells who is through. He left his team with a poem,
</P>
<P>
	   "The Man in the Glass," which opens:
</P>
<P>
	   "When you get what you want in your struggle for self
</P>
<P>
	   And the world makes you king for a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Just go to a mirror and look at yourself
</P>
<P>
	   And see what THAT man has to say."
</P>
<P>
	   THAT man said goodbye Monday.

<HEADLINE> Carroll Dismissed as Patriots Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Ten wins.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine wins.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight wins.
</P>
<P>
	   The countdown was too much to take for New England Patriots owner Robert
Kraft, who fired coach Pete Carroll on Monday after three years of diminishing
returns and a fear that he had lost control of the team.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's someone I have great respect for, and I think he's a great coach,"
Kraft said. "But this is a business of accountability, and two years ago we won
the division. Last year we barely made the playoffs and this year we're 8-8. We
need a momentum change."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll departs with a .549 winning percentage. But the defending AFC
champions he inherited went to the second round of the playoffs in 1997, the
first round in '98 and finished in last place in the division in '99, out of the
playoffs entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm proud of being 27-21 (plus 1-2 in the postseason) and making the
playoffs the first two years I was here," Carroll said in the Foxboro Stadium
parking lot before driving off in his gold Jaguar. "I'll forever be disappointed
that we didn't win more."
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate word on the fate of the rest of the coaching staff,
or on a successor. The Patriots asked for permission to talk to Jets assistant
Bill Belichick, but were denied when Parcells resigned and Belichick was
elevated to head coach.
</P>
<P>
	   It was just one more way that Parcells stole the spotlight from Carroll, who
was just 2-4 against the predecessor who rebuilt the Patriots before leaving
when he wasn't given total control of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
	   "You wonder (what would have happened if Parcells stayed)," offensive
lineman Heath Irwin said. "But I think there were so many conflicts between him
and other people around here that it wouldn't have worked out."
</P>
<P>
	   The Patriots won their first four games and started 6-2 this season, then
sputtered after the midseason bye and lost three consecutive games to AFC East
rivals. They scored just 108 points in the last eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   "At 6-2, we were already packing for the Super Bowl. Maybe overconfidence
kicked in," Irwin said. "It wasn't like we were dominating everybody we played.
We were just barely beating them, and it just came back and got us."
</P>
<P>
	   In their last two games, the Patriots had their two least productive days of
the season, gaining 225 yards against Buffalo and 151 against Baltimore. And
Drew Bledsoe threw for only 101 and 108 yards in those games.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ultimately, we as players didn't get the job done well enough for the staff
to stay in place," Bledsoe said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll's last week was marked by controversy as he suspended his top wide
receiver, Terry Glenn, for failing to report for medical checkups on three of
the previous four days. Carroll also was criticized by vice president of player
personnel Bobby Grier, who said the players he drafted would have played better
had they been used more.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to point the finger at everybody," defensive back Ty Law said.
"Not just Pete Carroll, everybody."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll's only previous NFL head coaching experience was in 1994 with the
New York Jets. He was fired after one 6-10 season and was replaced by Rich
Kotite.
</P>
<P>
	   "All he did was put his heart and soul into coaching," wide receiver Shawn
Jefferson said. "We can't blame him for that."

<HEADLINE> Flutie Out, Johnson in for Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Rob Johnson was supposed to be Buffalo's
quarterback of the future. Instead, he became the Bills' man of the moment when
coach Wade Phillips named him the starter for the playoffs and benched Doug
Flutie.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson will start against the Tennessee Titans in the wild-card round
Saturday, coming off a stellar performance against the AFC East champion
Indianapolis Colts on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson completed 24 of 32 passes for 287 yards and two touchdowns with no
interceptions in the 31-6 romp. He reminded fans of Jim Kelly as he threaded
crisp spirals to eight receivers.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a smart quarterback with a strong arm," said Eric Moulds, who caught
eight passes for 110 yards. "He can do a lot of things that a lot of
quarterbacks can't do, force the ball and get it in there before the defensive
back can break it up or intercept it."
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie said he had a funny feeling last week when the Bills told him to take
it easy for the last game of the regular season and sat him against the Colts.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't need any rest last week," he said. "You saw the way I was running
around against New England. My legs were fine, my arm was fine; I didn't need
rest."
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie completed his last 12 passes in the Bills' 13-10 overtime win over
New England on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   "I kind of was looking over my shoulder this week and wondering," Flutie
said. "I thought it was my own paranoia."
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie's declining statistics this season, combined with the poise and
leadership Johnson displayed Sunday, prompted Phillips to make the switch.
</P>
<P>
	   "My feeling is, with either one of them we can win," Phillips said. "It was
a tough decision. It wasn't a haphazard thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson was traded to Buffalo in 1998 from Jacksonville, where he spent
three seasons as the backup to Mark Brunell. He was signed to a $25 million
contract before last season after just one NFL start to his credit, and was
named the starter even before training camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson started the first five games last season and was prone to sacks and
injuries. He was sacked 23 times the first four games and was sidelined early in
the fifth game against the Colts when he fell on the ball and a Colts player
fell on him.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody was more surprised at the switch than Johnson, who before Sunday
hadn't started since the final game last season, when he completed 12 of 18
passes for 216 yards and three touchdowns in a 45-33 win over the New Orleans
Saints.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to have all 16 games, but that's not going to be an excuse," he
said. "I plan on playing a great game. Not playing in a year, you still think
you're good. But you wonder, 'Can I still do it?'
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie was bitterly disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no choice but to accept it," Flutie said. "I'm just still going to
be there. If I'm needed ... whatever it is, I'll be ready to go. You just have
to switch modes and be ready to go if you're needed."
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie had been the starter all year, and led Buffalo to 10 wins. But Flutie
faced criticism in Buffalo for inconsistent play.
</P>
<P>
	   "People have a short memory," Flutie said. "I played flawless football the
second half of that (Patriots) game and through the overtime; it doesn't
matter."
</P>
<P>
	   Titans coach Jeff Fisher now will have to adjust his game plan to a new
quarterback. "It does surprise me a little bit because Doug Flutie is the one
that's gotten them to this point," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Apparently, in Wade's estimation Rob's performance yesterday was worthy of
it. I never second-guess a coach's decision, but from the standpoint of being
surprised, yes I am a little surprised."
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie played his way to the Pro Bowl last year, was the league's Comeback
Player of the Year and signed a $22 million contract extension.
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie says there's a lesson in the Bills' switch: "That's why you don't
miss a game; that's why you play through injuries, that's why you keep going,"
Flutie said. "Because you give someone just a little window of opportunity and
they take advantage of it, and Rob did that."

<HEADLINE> Hurt Jag Boselli Will Miss Playoffs  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- From Day 1, Tom Coughlin felt he could build a
Super Bowl champion around Tony Boselli. Coughlin's plan might work, although
Boselli won't be playing if it reaches fruition this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The cornerstone of the Jacksonville Jaguars franchise was diagnosed with a
torn ligament in his right knee Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   It ended Boselli's season two games short of the Super Bowl and soured what
should have been a jubilant day for the Jaguars (14-2), who beat the Cincinnati
Bengals on Sunday to enter the playoffs as the top seed in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
	   "The start of a new season is here, and it's a great time to be excited,"
Coughlin said. "We're saddened by the loss of Tony, but we just have to keep
going forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Boselli is expected to spend about seven months rehabilitating the knee.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss of an offensive lineman wouldn't normally raise so many red flags,
but Boselli is not just another lineman.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-foot-7, 320-pound All-Pro out of Southern Cal was selected to his
fourth straight Pro Bowl this season. He's recognized by many as the best
lineman in the league.
</P>
<P>
	   In every way, he has lived up to the expectations that surfaced when
Coughlin decided to build his franchise around Boselli in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Boselli felt his way around the league through his rookie year, then
blossomed along with his entire team in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   He allowed only three sacks all season, and when he stonewalled Bruce Smith
in a playoff upset over the Bills -- holding him to three tackles and no sacks
-- his reputation began to form.
</P>
<P>
	   A well-respected team leader, Boselli will still be around for the playoffs,
teaching from the sidelines. But that's no substitute for having him on the
field.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had our share of injuries and this is another," Coughlin said.
"Obviously, it's a huge blow to our team."
</P>
<P>
	   Boselli's season ended on a running play in which he moved upfield, took a
small pop from one of the Bengals, then felt his knee buckle as he prepared to
plant and make a hit.
</P>
<P>
	   He clutched the leg, then fell to the ground. Some wondered if the condition
of the field -- torn up from the Gator Bowl game at Alltel Stadium on Saturday
-- was a factor.
</P>
<P>
	   Coughlin dismissed that.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that particular incident was the cause of it," Coughlin said.
"But I also don't think it was as good as it should have been for what was at
stake."
</P>
<P>
	   Boselli was not available for comment after the game and didn't grant
interviews Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's trying to deal with it as best he can," Coughlin said. "Today's a more
difficult day than yesterday. Reality is setting in and it's not a pleasant
thought."
</P>
<P>
	   Boselli's injury isn't the only problem the Jaguars face.
</P>
<P>
	   Right tackle Leon Searcy, also a Pro Bowl selection, sustained a high ankle
sprain that put him out for the second half. He underwent an MRI Monday. Ben
Coleman, who will replace Boselli at left tackle, has been dealing with a gimpy
knee all season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got to use the personnel we've got," running back Fred Taylor said.
"They've got to step it up. Ben will be the person to take over. He's been in
that position before."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, quarterback Mark Brunell is still working his way back from the
strained ligament he sustained last week in a 41-14 loss to Tennessee. Coughlin
hopes Brunell can practice again by Friday and will be ready for the playoff
game Jan. 15.

<HEADLINE> Now, if He Gets a Good Discount ...  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- More than the spoils go to the victor in college
football these days.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not just being the big game on everybody else's schedule. It means more
attention than anybody in his right mind could desire.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden knows a little about both of those things.
Frank Beamer, his counterpart at Virginia Tech, has yet to find out how bad it
can get.
</P>
<P>
	   For the moment, as he wrapped up preparations for the national title game
against the Seminoles tonight, Beamer seemed more amused than wary about seeing
his name in the newspaper day after day.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife, he said, expressed it best. "She said it's like reading about
somebody new every day."
</P>
<P>
	   Bowden assured him that kind of scrutiny can get old real fast.
</P>
<P>
	   "We recruit the same type of kids we did 25 years ago, when we won the
Sunday school award. The truth is the kids haven't changed. I did some bad
things when I was young and so did you," he told a room full of reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   "The difference is that everybody knows about it now. So if you don't want
everybody to know about it, don't be No. 1 -- be No. 50. That's one thing I've
learned over the years."
</P>
<P>
	   A cynic would suggest one way to find the college football power of tomorrow
is by combing the campus police reports and NCAA infractions lists today.
</P>
<P>
	   With only a little more effort than it takes to get a list of the national
champions of the past decade, you could find their most prominent sins and
scandals to list alongside. There have been enough to smear everybody. There are
even standing gags.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Three players from (fill-in-the-blank) University are sitting in the back
of a car. Who's driving?
</P>
<P>
	   A: The campus police.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowden has been in the spotlight so often, he sometimes tells the jokes on
himself. He won a national title in 1993, and his teams appeared in three of the
last four championship games.
</P>
<P>
	   In between, a few of his ballplayers went on an unauthorized shopping spree
at Foot Locker that gained so much notoriety Bowden's critics howled that FSU
stood for "Free Shoes University."
</P>
<P>
	   Bowden thought the line was so clever, he often repeated it himself. This
season, he's had to get past Peter Warrick's equally infamous shopping spree and
suspension. This week, three of his kids broke curfew.
</P>
<P>
	   Obviously, job security isn't an issue with Bowden, because he was telling
jokes about both of those things, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a kid commits murder, I have to let him go," Bowden said. He paused for
laughs. "Now, if he goes and gets a good discount, I want to know how he did
it."
</P>
<P>
	   Beamer was not nearly as cavalier. Maybe because he can't afford to be.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995 and 1996, while he was building a program that would rise to the top
of the sport, 20 of his players were arrested on charges ranging from
shoplifting to rape.
</P>
<P>
	   On the national telecast of Virginia Tech's Orange Bowl game against
Nebraska in 1996, the network passed on the traditional players' pictures and
statistics. Instead it showed a graphic listing the statistics of players
arrested at the two schools during the year. There were enough for teams on both
sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
	   "You couldn't believe how disappointed he was," said Beamer's son, Shane, a
senior who doubles as the Hokies' long snapper. "Obviously, the program is
supposed to be a reflection of him. With suspensions and such, we lost a few of
our best ballplayers for some important games. I think holding that team
together was one of his best coaching jobs ever."
</P>
<P>
	   It was apparently one of the more nerve-wracking as well, because Beamer's
players haven't turned up in court much since. Now, his heart isn't in his
throat when he sees the word "Tech" in a headline.
</P>
<P>
	   But Beamer knows only how hard it is to take a program from the middle of
the pack and move it into the elite. He's about to find out how much tougher it
is to keep it there.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowden's stature may seem like a function of him being 70. What it really
is, though, is a measure of his success. The 53-year-old Beamer thinks he
understands that, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think because of where we've come from, we've learned to appreciate how
fortunate we are to be here," he said. "We know what a long road it's been."
</P>
<P>
	   And it only gets harder carrying all those reporters on your back.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Bowl QBs Ready To Battle  </HEADLINE>
    By RICHARD ROSENBLATT AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- At long last, four days into a new century, it's time to
decide the 1999 national champion.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State hasn't played in 45 days; Virginia Tech in 39 days. Players
from both teams are sick of strolling down Bourbon Street, watching fans whoop
it up while trying to keep themselves out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know the kids can't wait to play, they've been here so long," Florida
State coach Bobby Bowden said Monday, a week into the Seminoles' visit to the
home of Mardi Gras. "This town has a lot of beautiful sites, but it don't do
nothing. Nothing."
</P>
<P>
	   Something finally will be done to determine a national champion tonight when
the top-ranked Seminoles (11-0) play the No. 2 Hokies (11-0) in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   A win, and Florida State can rightly claim the title as Team of the Decade;
a loss and the Seminoles might join the Atlanta Braves as consistent winners who
could win the big one only once.
</P>
<P>
	   "You go back home and people are saying y'all always go to the big game but
y'all never win them," Florida State cornerback Mario Edwards said. "I have a
little brother that's telling me that. He's 10 years old. Oh, is he making it
hard for me, too. Hopefully, I can come home this time and he'll pat me on the
back and say 'It's about time y'all won it."
</P>
<P>
	   This will be the 32nd time -- 13th in a bowl game -- No. 1 plays No. 2. For
the Seminoles, it will be their sixth 1-2 matchup -- five in the 1990s, plus
tonight's game. Florida State is 2-3, including last year's Fiesta Bowl loss to
Tennessee in the title game.
</P>
<P>
	   While Virginia Tech is playing for its first national crown in 107 years of
football, Florida State is in the title game for the third time in four years
and fourth in seven years -- the 'Noles won the 1993 championship.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes, if we won this one, it would be better than the last," Bowden said.
"The last time it was more of a relief. 'God, we finally got a national
championship.' They can't say Bobby Bowden never won a national championship.
Now, they're saying Bobby Bowden can't win another one."
</P>
<P>
	   If Virginia Tech wins?
</P>
<P>
	   "I ain't cutting my throat, I'm not slicing my wrists," Bowden said. "I'll
come back and we'll try to do it the next year."
</P>
<P>
	   Adds Peter Warrick, the All-American receiver who had just one catch in the
loss to Tennessee and also was around for '97 Sugar Bowl loss to Florida. "We've
been so close. This is the last one, and I don't want to let this one go by like
the other two."
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State won a record 108 games in the '90s and has a 12-year string of
top-four finishes in The AP poll. Among this year's memorable wins -- so far --
was Bowden's 300th, a 17-14 decision over Clemson in college football's first
father vs. son coaching matchup, and the 30-23 victory at Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   A win over the Hokies would also give Bowden the first perfect season in his
40 years as a head coach, and it would make Florida State the first team to go
wire-to-wire in the AP poll since the preseason ratings began in 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirteen seasons after folks in Blacksburg, Va., laughed at coach Frank
Beamer for predicting he would produce a national champion, tens of thousands of
Hokies fans are in town for the biggest game in school history.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think our world is going to start or end with us winning this
football game," Beamer said. "It would be great if we won, it would be a new day
at Virginia Tech. But if we lose, it's not the end of it. I would expect to come
back next year and be in it again."
</P>
<P>
	   Led by the pinpoint passing and flashy footwork of quarterback Michael Vick,
the Hokies have turned into one of the nation's most exciting teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Tech was already known for a relentless defense, led by 17-sack man
Corey Moore and fellow defensive end John Engelberger, and the nation's best
special teams -- 63 blocked kicks in the '90s. But the 19-year-old Vick has
taken the Hokies to new heights.
</P>
<P>
	   He threw for 1,840 yards and 12 TDs, ran for 585 yards and eight TDs and
finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting, equaling the best showing by a
freshman. Tech led the nation in scoring defense at 10.5 points a game and in
scoring, 41.4 points a game.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Vick hasn't flinched under pressure, and doesn't expect to in the
biggest game of his life.
</P>
<P>
	   "Being calm is just the type of person I am," he said. "I go out there and
try to execute the game plan. It's kind of tough to get to me."
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Weinke, the Seminoles' 27-year-old quarterback, is especially thankful
for a chance to play in the title game. He missed the '99 Fiesta Bowl with a
neck injury that almost ended his career. His replacement, Marcus Outzen, was
overmatched against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   "Having Weinke is a big factor," offensive coordinator Mark Richt said. "He
is a great leader. We feed off Weinke. Every day at practice, he tells people
what to do."
</P>
<P>
	   "The layoff could affect us and it could affect them," Bowden said. "We'll
see."
</P>
<P>
	   All-Americans Sebastian Janikowski and Moore created waves the past few
days. Janikowski, Florida State's kicker-party animal, missed curfew New Year's
Eve and had to run extra laps and stay in his room the next night. Moore had a
media meltdown Friday, cursing reporters, then returning for a few interviews
before clamming up for the rest of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't have a Warsaw rule," Bowden said of his Polish-born kicker. "If
he's breathing and alive, he'll kick off that game."
</P>
<P>
	   Beamer said Moore was "apologetic."
</P>
<P>
	   "Corey's a good person. He's just intense," the coach said.

<HEADLINE> Stanford Remains No.1 in AP Poll  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM O'CONNELL AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LSU is one of three unbeaten teams left in Division I. The Tigers are also
back in the Top 25. Not bad for a program that hasn't seen the better side of
.500 in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers (12-0) moved into the AP college basketball on Monday at No. 21,
their first ranking since Dec. 13, 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "Have we arrived? No, we haven't arrived, but we've certainly given an
indication that our process is right," third-year Tigers coach John Brady said
after the new rankings were released. "We basically came from zero to, in the
third year, where we are."
</P>
<P>
	   That would be unbeaten as conference play is about to begin, something only
Stanford, which held the No. 1 spot for the third straight week Monday, and No.
7 Syracuse can claim.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers were not among the preseason favorites in the Southeastern
Conference, but along with No. 4 Auburn, No. 6 Florida, No. 15 Tennessee and No.
25 Kentucky, this week's other newcomer to the rankings, give the SEC five
ranked teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Sophomore forward Stromile Swift and senior center Jabari Smith lead the
front line that has LSU where it is. The Tigers' biggest win of the season was
last week's win over Oklahoma State in a matchup of unbeatens.
</P>
<P>
	   "The question is now, how do we handle it?" Brady said. "I want them to be
aware of what they've done, the success they've had up to this point, but never
lose sight of how they got to this point.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never want to not have the attitude of getting better."
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford (11-0), which won the Stanford Invitational last week, received 62
first-place votes and 1,738 points from the national media panel as the top
seven teams remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut was second with five No. 1 votes and 1,667 points, and was
followed by Cincinnati, which was No. 1 on three ballots. Then came Auburn,
Arizona, Florida and Syracuse (9-0).
</P>
<P>
	   Duke and Kansas moved up one place each to eighth and ninth, while Indiana
rounded out the Top Ten.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan State, stunned by Wright State last week, dropped three spots to
lead the Second Ten, and was followed by Maryland, Ohio State, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Oklahoma State, Texas, Utah, Illinois and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   LSU led the final five teams in the poll and was followed by Tulsa, DePaul,
UCLA and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky (8-4) has won four straight games since falling out of the rankings
last month after a run of 164 consecutive polls.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats had been in every Top 25 from Dec. 4, 1990, until last Dec. 13
-- the fifth-longest run in history. Included in their winning streak was a
30-point win over Louisville and a two-point victory over Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple (6-3), which lost to Wisconsin last week, dropped out from 17th
although the Owls are playing short-handed because point guard Pepe Sanchez and
forward Mark Karcher are injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez has not played since the opening game of the season because of a
sprained ankle. Karcher, the leading scorer, is out for up to three weeks after
spraining his shoulder against Cleveland State last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Wake Forest (9-3) had a rough trip to Hawaii and fell out from 19th. The
Demon Deacons lost to Oregon by one point in the opening round of the Rainbow
Classic, then beat Ohio University in double overtime before losing 70-57 to
Villanova in the fifth-place game.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma State's loss to LSU caused the Cowboys to have the week's biggest
drop, from 11th to No. 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah and Tulsa made the week's biggest jumps, modest moves of three places
to 18th and 22nd, respectively.

<P>
    HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun saw only half of the
second-ranked Huskies' latest victory. He saw enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite being forced to the locker room at halftime because of a stomach
virus, Calhoun was able to assess the Huskies (10-1) after their 10th straight
win, 83-56 over Sacred Heart on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "This team has gotten awful good by playing with a sense of purpose. That
was just a little bit lacking. We rely on passion," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Mouring had 15 points for Connecticut, while Khalid El-Amin had all
of his 13 in the second half in what Calhoun termed a "workmanlike" effort.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything we did, we did OK. I wanted to see us pull away a bit more," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Amin said the Huskies are striving for consistency as Big East play
approaches.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going into the heart of the season. We wanted to hit our peak right
in conference play, and that's what we're starting to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the only other game involving a ranked team on Monday, No. 20 Oklahoma
beat Lamar 67-63.
</P>
<P>
	   Mouring, the Huskies' biggest threat from the perimeter, had four
3-pointers, three in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had a great warmup," he said. "I haven't felt like that since preseason."
</P>
<P>
	   The game was the second straight against a Big East opponent for Sacred
Heart (1-8), which is in its first year as a Division I program. The Pioneers
lost 95-66 to St. John's on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we came in blind to play the best, it could have been worse," coach Dave
Bike said. "We tried to get them frustrated, but they were a little too tough
and too good for that."
</P>
<P>
	   DeVeren Johnson led Sacred Heart with 14 points, and Marijus Kovaliukas
added 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was Calhoun's 100th in the Hartford Civic Center. Associate
coach Dave Leitao took over in the second half as he did for the two games
Calhoun missed last season because of stomach problems -- an early season
victory over Hartford and an NCAA first-round game against Texas-San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
	   Eduardo Najera scored 25 points, including the clinching free throws with
seven seconds remaining, for the Sooners (12-1). Ron Austin hit a 3-pointer with
7.7 seconds left, closing the visiting Cardinals to 65-63. Landon Rowe had 23
points on 9-of-13 shooting for Lamar (6-5).

<HEADLINE> Church Group To Fight For Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- The representatives of an influential American church
organization met Monday with the father of a 6-year-old boy rescued off
Florida's coast and promised to press the U.S. government to return the child to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to help our president see that the issue is a moral one, a
humanitarian one,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the outgoing general
secretary of the National Council of Churches. ``We need to be concerned for a
small boy rather than politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell spoke with reporters after meeting with Elian Gonzalez' father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and the child's four grandparents and great-grandmother in
this coastal town, a two-hour drive east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Accompanied by Cuban church representatives, Campbell, a Baptist minister,
was clearly affected by her hourlong visit inside Gonzalez' modest two-story
home, built of brick and cement on an unpaved street where horse-drawn carts are
as common as automobiles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very loving family,'' Campbell said, appearing to be on the
verge of tears. ``We are more convinced than ever that this child belongs with
this family. We will work very hard to make sure (Elian) comes back very soon.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the council is willing to play a mediation role in the dispute and
even to physically transport Elian back to Cuba and turn him over to the Cuban
Council of Churches to be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez, who has shunned publicity in recent weeks, said he was grateful
for the council's efforts. He said he understood his son was well, but that he
missed him very much. ``How could I not miss him?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said he met a second time with Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials on Friday, but declined to provide details for fear of harming
his case.
</P>
<P>
	   However, The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Cuba said it would take
``under advisement'' a U.S. request that it facilitate an exit visa for the
father, quoting a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Under preliminary plans discussed this weekend, the paper reported, Gonzalez
would be flown to Miami, where he would gain legal custody of Elian and be free
to leave the country with his son, although Elian's relatives in Miami could
seek a temporary restraining order against the action.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, a senior State Department official said late Monday he
doubted that the report was true. A telephone call to the INS was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The council is the United States' largest ecumenical organization,
representing 35 Protestant and Orthodox denominations comprising 52 million
congregants.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials gave temporary custody of Elian to his paternal great-uncle
in Miami in late November after the child was found clinging to an inner tube
off the Florida coast. Elian's mother died in the apparent attempt to illegally
immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has become a political tug-of-war, with Gonzalez demanding that his
son be returned to him in Cuba and the great-uncle fighting to keep the child in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   People on both sides of the Florida Straits have used the case to make their
own political points for or against Fidel Castro's communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the great things about this country, one of the blessings of
freedom that Elian will enjoy here is that everyone is free to speak their
mind,'' Spencer Eig, attorney for the boy's Miami relatives said Monday of the
council of churches campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   During an earlier meeting with INS officials in Cuba, Gonzalez provided them
with the boy's birth certificate, photographs and other documents aimed at
proving his paternity and assumption of parental responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The child's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was to present his own case to the
INS in Miami before Christmas, but that meeting was postponed until Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell said she had informed the White House about the group's trip and
efforts to reunite Elian with his father.

<HEADLINE> Va. Cracks Down on Deadbeat Parents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Virginia is going statewide with another weapon in its
battle against deadbeat parents -- pink and powder-blue car boots.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning this month, the state will immobilize vehicles owned by parents
who are delinquent in child support with the boots that clamp around a car's
front tire. Fairfax County, the state's most populous locality, has been booting
delinquents since 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Delinquent parents also will be greeted by a sticker affixed to their
windshield reading: ``This vehicle has been seized by the sheriff for unpaid
child support.''
</P>
<P>
	   The state is hoping the boots and conspicuous sticker will embarrass parents
into making payments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a certain amount of shame factor,'' said Nick Young, director of
the Virginia Division of Child Support Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has recovered about $347,000 from 70 parents whose vehicles were
booted in Fairfax County. One man even slung a blanket over his immobilized car
so his neighbors wouldn't see it, Young said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresa Myers, a child-support enforcement expert with the National
Conference of State Legislatures, said many states are considering using boots
on deadbeat parents, but Virginia is the first to do so statewide. Wayne County,
Mich. and Cape May County, N.J. also have used boots to boost child-support
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   As state agencies find money in their budgets to try innovative programs,
``we're probably going to see more of it,'' Ms. Myers said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Virginia, about 100,000 delinquent parents collectively owe $1.65 billion
to some 552,000 children, according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Young said the boots will only be used if:
</P>
<P>
	   -- a non-custodial parent owes more than $1,000;
</P>
<P>
	   -- the state has found traditional remedies like court orders unsuccessful;
and
</P>
<P>
	   -- a lien has been filed in the city or county where the vehicle is kept.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our goal is not to seize cars and sell them,'' Young said. ``Our goal is
get them to pay.''
</P>
<P>
	   The state already tows offenders' cars, suspends their licenses and issues
posters featuring the ``Delinquent Dozen'' to shame deadbeats into paying.
</P>
<P>
	   Kent Willis, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in
Virginia, said the boot is another example of humiliation as punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is part of a whole trend to reverse the way we do criminal justice
and civil justice to a system we were using in the 17th century,'' Willis said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the stockades. This is the public humiliation,'' he said. ``It's a
scarlet letter. It's a punishment by itself.''
</P>
<P>
	   Paula Roberts, a child-support expert with the Center for Law and Social
Policy, a public-interest law firm based in Washington, D.C., said the boots
should be used carefully so people who are legitimately trying to pay or are
caught in a paperwork error are not targeted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once you're convinced that someone is a true deadbeat, then I think
everyone agrees that no remedy is too severe,'' Ms. Roberts said Monday. ``But
what so often happens is the data is flawed, and you can end up hurting someone
who is actually a model citizen.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Has Chance To Change Russia  </HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH INGRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Like Boris Yeltsin, the man who handed him power, Vladimir
Putin has the opportunity to change the face of Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as Yeltsin threw wide the doors to reform that Mikhail Gorbachev, the
last Soviet president, had opened a crack, Putin has the chance to drive home
democratic and market reforms that Yeltsin was unable to realize.
</P>
<P>
	   First Putin must win presidential elections expected to be held March 26. He
is the firm favorite because many Russians see him as a strong leader who can
clean up the corruption and disorder that bedevil the country.
</P>
<P>
	   While Putin has benefitted from his strong handling of the war in Chechnya,
he has yet to outline any detailed plans for what he would do as leader of the
world's largest nation -- something he is slowly trying to remedy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putin is now extremely popular and doesn't have to do much except hold the
course'' until the election, said Rani Kronick, an analyst at Control Risks
Group Ltd. in London. ``I think we need to wait and see who's reappointed to the
Cabinet and see what figures emerge before we can really understand what policy
directions he's likely to take.''
</P>
<P>
	   In one of his first official acts, Putin fired Yeltsin's daughter Monday,
moving quickly to distance himself from Yeltsin's scandal-tinged administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The terse announcement of Tatyana Dyachenko's dismissal as ``image adviser''
marked Putin's first personnel change since taking office Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyachenko had been accused of exercising undue influence over government
policy, and has recently been a focus of an investigation into allegations of
Kremlin bribery.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss and Russian prosecutors have been investigating whether Dyachenko and
her sister Yelena Okulova, as well as other Kremlin officials, took bribes from
a Swiss company, Mabetex, that won lucrative Kremlin construction contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   When Yeltsin was in office, he launched a series of reforms, including an
initiative to allow the free purchase and sale of land, simplification of the
unwieldy tax system, transition to a professional army and reduction of the
government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet in each case, he saw his initiatives blocked by the Communist-led
opposition -- or he lost interest in them as he withdrew from the day-to-day
business of governing in the last years of his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   If Yeltsin rarely followed through on policies in recent years, Putin is
perceived by many Russians as a leader who will try to break the government's
chronic inertia. He is known as a consensus-builder, and will have a largely
supportive parliament behind him -- unlike the legislatures that tried to block
Yeltsin practically every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, analysts predict Putin will be unlikely to rock the boat -- at least
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody stands for tax reform. Certainly I think he'll do that, but
that's hardly radical,'' said Margo Light, a Russia expert at the London School
of Economics. ``But I think he's going to be very careful on land reform because
it's such a sacred cow.''
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps the toughest test for Putin will be his approach to fighting
corruption. Analysts say the issue is a natural for a former KGB operative and a
leader who is as yet unsmeared by corruption allegations. As prime minister,
Putin warned bureaucrats that he would not tolerate corruption, but no action
followed.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has said he will pursue reform, although he has stressed that it must
be implemented at a slower pace and with close state control that includes more
emphasis on social welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no alternative to it,'' he wrote in a recent article posted on
the Russian Cabinet's Web site. ``The question for Russia now is what to do
next. How can we make the new, market mechanisms work to full capacity?''
</P>
<P>
	   After months of concentrating almost exclusively on Chechnya, Putin has
gradually begun assembling a political platform -- and broadening his circle of
political advisers.
</P>
<P>
	   In late December, he established the Center for Strategic Elaboration, which
he described as ``an intellectual club tied directly to the government.'' The
center, which brings together scholars from several economic and legal
institutes, is charged with forecasting developments that will have an impact on
policy.
</P>
<P>
	   He outlined broad goals in the Web page article, which was posted just five
days before Yeltsin's surprise resignation and transfer of presidential powers
to Putin. They include a streamlined, more professional bureaucracy; a stronger
fight against corruption and crime; a strengthened judiciary; and creation of
conditions to encourage non-governmental organizations ``to balance out and
monitor the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's fairly firm in that article about the evil that comes from too strong
an executive power,'' giving reason to be optimistic about his support for
democratic reforms, said Light.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Key Stock Index Up  </HEADLINE>
    By KOZO MIZOGUCHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index finished the new
millennium's first trading session at a 28-month high today amid no Y2K computer
problems. The dollar rose against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended the half-day session at
19,002.86, a gain of 68.52 points, or 0.36 percent. On Thursday, it closed up
123.76 points, or 0.66 percent. Today was the first time since Aug. 21, 1997
that the Nikkei ended above 19,000 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 102.38 yen at midafternoon, up 0.30 yen from late Thursday
in Tokyo and above its late New York level of 101.56 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese financial markets were closed Dec. 31 through Jan. 3 for the New
Year's holiday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange traditionally trades for half a day in
the first session of the year. It will return to a full day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening of the Tokyo market, Asia's biggest, was one of the last major
tests of the Y2K computer bug. Yasuo Sakuragi, a spokesman for the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, said that trading opened smoothly without any computer trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nikkei index started higher on buying of blue chips and
telecommunications-related issues, rising about 200 points before losing some
early gains on profit-taking toward the closing bell.
</P>
<P>
	   "European and other Asian stock markets gained strongly at the start of the
year as Y2K ended as a non-event. A similar trend is also seen in Japan," said a
general manager at a Japanese brokerage house who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The rise in Tokyo came one day after Asia's other big stock markets in Hong
Kong and Singapore soared in their first trading sessions of the new year. Both
closed Monday at record highs for the second consecutive session, and no Y2K
glitches were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 139.61 points,
or 1.2 percent, to 11,357.51 at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 4.73 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,717.47. The TOPIX closed up
9.93 points, or 0.58 percent, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar edged higher as Japan's central bank bought

</P>
<P>
	   Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, Haruhiko Kuroda,
confirmed that the Bank of Japan intervened in the Tokyo currency market this
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuroda said that the Ministry of Finance will continue carefully watching
foreign exchange moves and will take more "decisive steps" if necessary.

<P>
	   The amount of the intervention was not immediately known.

late Thursday in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Most Costly Tornado Was in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of tornadoes was down from 1998 to 1999, but
the most expensive twister in U.S. history struck last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In a year-end report, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
said there were six major tornado outbreaks during 1999, with some of them
hitting at unusual times of the year -- during the normally cold months of
January and December.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, there were 1,225 twisters reported in 1999, down from 1,424 a year
earlier, which was the record year for tornadoes in this country. The 1999 total
ranked fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   A 78-tornado outbreak over 21 hours on May 3-4 in Oklahoma and Kansas
included the most costly single tornado in U.S. history, NOAA reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said an F-5 tornado, the strongest on the Fujita Tornado Scale,
moved along a 38-mile path, from Chickasha through south Oklahoma City and the
suburbs of Bridge Creek, Newcastle, Moore, Midwest City and Del City. With 8,000
buildings damaged, the Oklahoma City tornado caused about a billion dollars in
damage. In all, that tornado outbreak killed 46 people, injured 800 and caused
$1.5 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service noted that there was an average warning lead
time of 18 minutes for the tornadoes -- better than the national 11-minute
average -- with some areas receiving more than 30 minutes notice before being
hit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oklahoma and Kansas outbreak contributed to May's monthly total of 325,
the highest for the year. June followed with a total of 275 tornadoes and
January had the third highest total with 216. That topped the previous January
record of 50 set in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The number of tornadoes the U.S. experienced in January is extraordinary
when compared with the 50-year monthly average of 20 tornadoes,'' said Dan
McCarthy, warning coordination meteorologist of the Weather Service's Storm
Prediction Center in Norman, Okla.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The tornadoes occurred because of an unusually warm January weather
pattern that brought moist air from the Gulf of Mexico at low levels in the
atmosphere northward, which combined with strong upper level westerly flow. This
tornado-producing combination is common in March or April, but not in January,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 tornado season began early, with 26 twisters on Jan. 1 and 2 in
Texas and Louisiana that caused one death. On Jan. 17, 25 tornadoes killed eight
people in Arkansas, Tennessee and Missouri. Four days later, six people died as
104 tornadoes struck Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee on Jan. 21 and 22,
including the area around the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
	   The final tornado outbreaks of the year occurred once again in the cool
season. A total of six twisters killed two people in Chico, Texas, on Dec. 2,
and an F3 tornado moved through Bentonia, Miss., on Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
	   Other tornadoes and outbreaks of last year included:
</P>
<P>
	   --April 9: The northeast suburbs of the Cincinnati area were hit by an F4
tornado at 5:30 a.m., part of an outbreak of 70 twisters that began the evening
before and tracked across the plains from Nebraska through Iowa, Missouri,
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   --July 24: Three people were killed when a tornado caused a tree to fall on
a car in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   --Aug. 11: A rare tornado in downtown Salt Lake City killed one person.
</P>
<P>
	   --Sept. 4 and 16: Tropical Storms Dennis and Floyd caused small tornado
outbreaks when they moved over parts of Virginia and North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Workplace Rules Protect Home Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department has concluded that companies who let
employees work at home are responsible for federal health and safety violations
at the homes, The Washington Post reports.
</P>
<P>
	   An Occupational Safety and Health Administration advisory makes employers
responsible for ensuring an employee's home office has ergonomically correct
furniture, proper lighting, ventilation systems and emergency medical plans and
equipment, the newspaper said in today's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   The OSHA letter says that when an employee works at home ``the employer is
responsible for correcting hazards of which it is aware, or should be aware,''
the Post reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The advisory -- two years in the making -- is not a new rule, but rather
lays out the agency's position that the work-at-home policy is already in
effect. The decision potentially applies to nearly 20 million adults who
regularly work from home for an employer, as well as to those who work at home
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
	   While OSHA officials said they will not be inspecting private homes,
employers are responsible for any illnesses or injuries that occur in the home
workplace, the Post reported. These injuries must be reported as if they had
occurred at the employer's work site.
</P>
<P>
	   The policy applies specifically to home work areas and not the entire home.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post quoted the advisory letter, which was sent in mid-November, as
saying, ``An employer is responsible for ensuring that its employees have a safe
and healthful workplace, not a safe and healthful home.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani announces staff moves for expected Senate run  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Although he has yet to announce, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
appears to be gearing up for a U.S. Senate race.
<P>
	   On Monday, Giuliani said Bruce Teitelbaum, who currently heads the mayor's
political action committee, will be the campaign manager for Giuliani's
all-but-announced run for the U.S. Senate against first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Deputy Mayor Randy Levine, the city's lead negotiator in a series of
high-level talks with labor unions and businesses during the past several years,
will aid in the campaign in an as-yet undetermined role, said Giulaini.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there is a campaign, since I have to announce, I'd anticipate that Bruce
Teitelbaum will be the campaign manager and then we would have a campaign
committee structure, and I think Randy would play a very important role in
guiding it," said Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   The 36-year-old Teitelbaum has had a rapid ascendancy - starting in 1993 as
a lowly Giuliani campaign volunteer, rising to chief of staff, and now the top
campaign official. He has never run a major campaign operation.
</P>
<P>
	   His name has also surfaced as part of an investigation by the Brooklyn
District Attorney's Office to determine whether administration officials helped
politically connected Brooklyn developers skirt city building rules in the wake
of a building collapse that killed a construction worker last year.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Teitelbaum's attorney, Richard Weinberg, said his client "is
presently neither a target nor a subject of any criminal investigation."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has said Teitelbaum, who was his chief of staff at the time, did
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   Levine, known for his booming laugh during City Hall press conferences
whenever the mayor tells a joke, has been a deputy mayor since June 1997. He
will resign Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
	   Levine's legacy includes a 1998 deal in which the city agreed to purchase
land and to provide $560 million in buildings and tax incentives to keep the New
York Stock Exchange from leaving town. In recent months, however, Levine had
seen his influence in the administration erode.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to helping Giuliani's Senate campaign, Levine said he will join
the high-powered Washington, D.C.-based law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer
and Feld as a senior counsel on labor and employment practices. He is also
expected to announce later this week that he will take a baseball-related
position, possibly with the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, Levine served as the city's labor relations commissioner under
Giuliani and as the chief labor negotiator for Major League Baseball owners. He
also worked under Giuliani at the U.S. Department of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Schulz Loved Red-Haired Girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dear Charlie Brown, the real little red-haired girl never
forgot you.
</P>
<P>
	   Her hair now gray, Donna Wold remembers Peanuts' creator Charles Schulz with
fondness more than 50 years after she declined his marriage proposal. She went
on to become the inspiration for the unrequited love of his cartoon alter ego.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz, born in Minneapolis and raised in St. Paul, borrowed characters'
names from old Minnesota friends Charlie Brown, Linus Maurer and Frieda Rich.
</P>
<P>
	   The last new daily ``Peanuts'' strip chronicling their exploits ran in
newspapers on Monday, and their final appearance in Sunday newspapers is set for
Feb. 13. After nearly 50 years, Schulz, 77, is discontinuing ``Peanuts'' due to
his health.
</P>
<P>
	   While Charlie Brown and pals became known worldwide, perhaps Shulz's most
touching tribute to the real-life group went unnamed.
</P>
<P>
	   When he returned from World War II and became an instructor at an art school
in downtown Minneapolis, he quickly fell for a red-haired member of the
accounting department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When he proposed, it was agonizing because I did love him at the time,''
said Wold, now 70. ``It's terrible to be in love with more than one guy.''
</P>
<P>
	   She turned Schulz down and instead married Allan Wold, an old friend she'd
known since seventh grade and who had attended her family's church. He became a
Minneapolis firefighter, and they raised four children.
</P>
<P>
	   In some ways, Schulz never got over her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I loved that little girl, but her mother convinced her I would never
amount to anything,'' Schulz said in a 1997 Star Tribune interview. ``You never
get over your first love. More than having your cartoons rejected or
three-putting the 18th green, the whole of you is rejected when a woman says:
`You're not worth it.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Wold thinks Schulz overestimated her mother's influence, but she has no
regrets. She kept in contact with him over the years and has spoken with Schulz'
wife, Jean, since the cartoonist's cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
	   Wold has kept clippings over the years of strips that featured the little
red-haired girl, including one signed by Schulz: ``For Donna, with love,
Sparky.'' She also still has sketches Schulz would leave at her desk at the art
school where they met.
</P>
<P>
	   But her husband was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I really didn't believe that she was the inspiration for it until he came
right out and said that she was and named her by name,'' he said. ``Then it kind
of really hit home, he really had felt bad about losing her.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolds will celebrate their 50th anniversary next October, the month that
``Peanuts'' would have turned 50.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just wishing him the best of everything, a happy retirement and some
good health so he can beat this whole thing. After all these years, he deserves
that much,'' Wold said. ``I guess it was such a good strip because we could all
identify, now and then, with Charlie Brown.''

<HEADLINE> Towns, Pequots return to court over annexation bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) - Lawyers for three eastern Connecticut towns
and the U.S. Justice Department are returning to court in a seven-year battle
over 165 acres on Route 2.
<P>
	   The Mashantucket Pequots want to add the land to their 2,000-acre
reservation, a request the Bureau of Indian Affairs approved in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   But a U.S. District Court judge last year ruled the approval was granted in
error, prompting an appeal by the Justice Department, on behalf of the BIA.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan will hear arguments on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribe's annexation bid polarized already strained relations between the
tribe and three border towns - Ledyard, North Stonington and Preston. It also
touched off a national debate over Indian sovereignty rights and saw a flurry of
bills filed in Congress aimed at changing sovereignty laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The three towns - worried about increased crime and traffic and losses in
tax revenues and zoning oversight - have spent about $1 million fighting the
request, and have been joined by the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't spent this kind of money on just the 165 acres," said Preston
First Selectman Robert Congdon. "The issue is much, much bigger than the 165
acres. The issue is the tribe's ability to take land in any town, anywhere. It's
an issue of huge impact to towns across the state and across the country."
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes are also high for the tribe.
</P>
<P>
	   When U.S. District Court Judge Robert N. Chatigny overturned the land claim
approval, he ruled that the BIA violated the 1983 settlement act that set the
tribe's boundaries. The 165 acres is located outside the settlement boundaries,
and, Chatigny ruled, therefore cannot become part of the reservation.
</P>
<P>
	   In its appeal, the Justice Department has argued that Chatigny
misinterpreted the 1983 law.
</P>
<P>
	   If the ruling stands, the tribe could never expand the reservation beyond
its current borders. The tribe wants the new land to further develop the
Foxwoods Resort Casino.
</P>
<P>
	   A tribal spokesman Monday declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it is
being brought by the government, not the tribe. But he said the tribe considers
the 165 acres part of its homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   North Stonington First Selectman Nicholas H. Mullane II said the outcome of
this week's arguments could finally end for the towns the lingering question of
whether the Mashantuckets can expand their gaming empire by buying real estate
near the reservation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would curtail any future land claims by this tribe," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision by the three-judge panel is expected to take several weeks.

Putin Has Chance To Change Russia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Like Boris Yeltsin, the man who handed him power, Vladimir
Putin has the opportunity to change the face of Russia. Just as Yeltsin threw
wide the doors to reform that Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, had
opened a crack, Putin has the chance to drive home democratic and market reforms
that Yeltsin was unable to realize. First Putin must win presidential elections
expected to be held March 26. He is the firm favorite because many Russians see
him as a strong leader who can clean up the corruption and disorder that bedevil
the country.

Croatia's parliamentary election Tuesday, after campaigning with promises to
bolster democracy and end what it called the autocratic rule of late president
Franjo Tudjman. With 61 percent of the returns from Monday's vote counted,
Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union was trailing in eight of the 10 electoral

Santana, Lead Prospects for Grammys

	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Carlos Santana could be following in Bonnie
Raitt's footsteps as a comeback favorite for this year's Grammy Awards. Like
Raitt's resurgence with "Nick of Time" in 1990, the 52-year-old Santana is
shaping up as the veteran rocker most likely to grab handfuls of nominations
when the Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences announces its picks Tuesday.
Overlooked by the Grammys for his albums in the 1960s and 1970s, Santana could
be a frontrunner this year for his album "Supernatural," which includes
collaborations with Dave Matthews, Lauryn Hill and Eric Clapton.

Mideast Talks Off to Slow Start
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Renewed peace talks between Syria and Israel
are off to a rocky start. While President Clinton has cleared his desk and

Workplace Rules Protect Home Offices

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department has advised companies that they are
responsible for federal health and safety violations that occur at the home
workplaces of their telecommuting employees, The Washington Post reported. An
Occupational Safety and Health Administration advisory makes employers
responsible for ensuring an employee's home office has ergonomically correct
furniture, proper lighting, ventilation systems and emergency medical plans and
equipment, the newspaper said in its Tuesday editions. The OSHA letter says that
when an employee works at home "the employer is responsible for correcting
hazards of which it is aware, or should be aware," the Post reported.

an estimated $100 billion to buy new computers and repair computer software code
as "a marvelous accomplishment" and crucial to keeping the nation's most

technology-dependent nation, spent roughly half the world's total repair costs,

beyond a reasonable doubt. About 525 misdemeanor cases were filed, most charging
failure to disperse or interfering with pedestrians by blocking streets during

Putin Has Chance To Change Russia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Like Boris Yeltsin, the man who handed him power, Vladimir
Putin has the opportunity to change the face of Russia. Just as Yeltsin threw
wide the doors to reform that Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, had
opened a crack, Putin has the chance to drive home democratic and market reforms
that Yeltsin was unable to realize. First Putin must win presidential elections
expected to be held March 26. He is the firm favorite because many Russians see
him as a strong leader who can clean up the corruption and disorder that bedevil
the country.

Raitt's resurgence with "Nick of Time" in 1990, the 52-year-old Santana is
shaping up as the veteran rocker most likely to grab handfuls of nominations
when the Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences announces its picks Tuesday.
Overlooked by the Grammys for his albums in the 1960s and 1970s, Santana could
be a frontrunner this year for his album "Supernatural," which includes

<HEADLINE> Wizards 99, Warriors 87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing one of the few teams whose struggles were worse
than their own, the Washington Wizards weren't lacking for motivation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitch Richmond scored 19 points as Washington beat Golden State 99-87 Monday
night, extending the Warriors' losing streak to six and keeping them winless
under new coach Garry St. Jean.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we have to do is look at the standings (and see) we're still in last
place," Richmond said. "We can't be overconfident with no one."
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Strickland had 15 points and 10 assists and Juwan Howard added 13 points
for the Wizards, who snapped a two-game losing streak and won for the first time
in six games against a Pacific Division opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, Washington has a home-and-home series against Chicago, the
last-place team in the Central Division. The Bulls have the fewest wins in the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
	   That could give the Wizards a three-game winning streak -- which would match
Washington's season high -- a distinct possibility, though Wizards coach Gar
Heard quickly deflected such talk.
</P>
<P>
	   "You guys keep saying we should win. ... I don't think this team will take
anyone lightly," Heard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State, which has dropped three straight since St. Jean replaced the
fired P.J. Carlesimo on Dec. 27, got 21 points from Antawn Jamison. Golden State
has lost four consecutive road games.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is going to take time. Everything is totally new," St. Jean said. "We
haven't had that much time. You learn a lot when you are out on the floor."
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Caffey had 14 points for the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
	   Strickland's jumper started a 9-0 run for Washington midway through the
first period, producing a 20-13 advantage. But Jamison and Donyell Marshall each
had four points in an ensuing 12-2 spree as Golden State regained the lead
25-22.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamison had 17 first-half points, but the Warriors converted only one shot
from the field in the opening six minutes of the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the first half, I got a lot of touches," Jamison said. "In the second
half, things didn't go my way. It was hard for me to get touches around the
rim."
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards couldn't take advantage of the cold spell until Tracy Murray
came off the bench with 9:56 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Murray scored 11 points in five minutes, hitting three of four 3-pointers,
including a shot from deep in the right corner as the first half expired to give
the Wizards a 56-51 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington led by as many as 13 in the third quarter when Strickland hit two
free throws with 1:06 left. Jamison banked in a shot with 2:51 remaining,
cutting the lead to 91-87, but the Wizards got the next four points.

<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- Antoine Walker had 32 points and 13 rebounds, both
game-highs, as the Boston Celtics won on its new parquet floor Monday night,
105-98 over the Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Pierce had 17 points and Kenny Anderson 16 for the Celtics. Adrian
Griffin and Vitaly Potapenko added 12 points as Boston's starters scored all but
16 of the team's points.
</P>
<P>
	   Shawn Kemp led the Cavaliers with 23 points and nine rebounds. Lamond Murray
equaled his season high with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston retired its fabled parquet floor, which was in place for all of the
organization's 16 NBA titles, after its final game of 1999, Dec. 22 against
Atlanta. The new floor is a replica of the old one that the Celtics played on
for 50 seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland took a 72-70 lead on Murray's jam with 5:17 left in the third
quarter before Boston closed the period with a 17-6 run. After Murray's dunk,
Walker keyed an 8-0 run with two free throws, a twisting layup and made a nice
feed to Potapenko for a short jumper.
</P>
<P>
	   The Celtics pushed their lead to 93-80 on Walker's two free throws 2:39 into
the final quarter, but Cleveland scored 14 of the next 17 points to cut it to
96-94 on Cedric Henderson's layin with just over three minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson's jumper and Danny Fortson's free throw gave Boston a 99-94 edge,
and Cleveland was never closer than four points in the final two minutes.
Griffin helped seal it with a pair of free throws and a breakaway dunk 10
seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams were tied 58-58 at the half.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 124, Bucks 120, OT  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN BERGER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson scored 45 points on a career-high 38
shots as the Philadelphia 76ers survived a frantic overtime to beat the
Milwaukee Bucks 124-120 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson was only 1-for-5 in OT, but Ray Allen's running jumper and Scott
Williams' tip-in attempt both rimmed out as the Bucks failed to make another
stunning comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sixer Tim Thomas sent it to overtime with a 3-pointer that tied it at
115 with 3.4 seconds left in regulation. After Iverson hit a running hook shot
for the first basket of OT, Thomas hit another 3-pointer to make it 118-117.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyrone Hill and Matt Geiger provided crucial inside baskets to give
Philadelphia a 122-118 lead with two minutes left, but Allen made a pullup
jumper to cut it to 122-120.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen, who had only seven of his 25 points after the third quarter, saw his
runner somehow come off the rim. Williams, a former Sixer who heard boos and
taunts all night, had his tip-in attempt curl off the same way.
</P>
<P>
	   Bucks coach George Karl ran all the way to the Philadelphia bench pleading
for a jump ball when Vinny Del Negro was called for fouling Eric Snow on the
ensuing inbounds -- to no avail.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow and Aaron McKie each hit a free throw, and Allen missed a long jumper
and got his own rebound as time expired. That came after Glenn Robinson's bad
pass went off Williams' hands to the Sixers.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson was 16-for-38 from the field, surpassing his career high in attempts
by two. He scored 40-plus points for the second time in six games and third time
this season. Iverson was one point shy of his own NBA season high and five shy
of his career high of 50.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill played a huge role inside with Geiger in foul trouble. Hill, acquired
from Milwaukee last season for Thomas and Williams, had 22 points and nine
rebounds. Snow had a career-high 15 assists, 13 points and no turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson and Allen each scored 25 for Milwaukee, and Sam Cassell had 23
points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson drove past Allen for a hard-fought, lightning-quick layup off a
steal by McKie to make it 105-102 with 2:42 left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   After Robinson tied it with a 3-pointer, Iverson lost Cassell twice on the
same curl play and hit two high-arcing jumpers in front of the Bucks bench to
make it 111-108 with 39 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
	   After Snow and Iverson seemingly iced it with four free throws, Thomas
dribbled the length of the court and pulled up for a 3-pointer that tied it at
115-all with 3.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson took the halfcourt inbounds and drove on Cassell, missing a running
one-hander at the buzzer.

    ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Grant Hill scored a season-high 42 points as the
Detroit Pistons snapped a 13-game losing streak at Orlando with a 118-106
victory over the Magic on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill, whose previous high was 41 against Miami in the season opener, made 17
of 30 field goal attempts as the Pistons won their fourth straight.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill was 3-for-5 from 3-point range and added eight assists and seven
rebounds. Lindsey Hunter scored 25 points and Jerry Stackhouse added 19 for
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando, which now holds a 13-7 edge at home against Detroit, has lost five
games in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Reserve Chris Gatling led the Magic with 26 points and 11 rebounds and Corey
Maggette added 20 points. Only one Orlando starter -- Tariq Abdul-Wahad --
scored in double figures with 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic shot 50.6 percent from the field, but had 27 turnovers as the
Pistons scored 37 points off Orlando's miscues.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit shot 58 percent in the third quarter to pull ahead 91-74. The
Pistons led by as many as 21 in the quarter, 89-68.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit held a 17-point lead early in the fourth quarter but Orlando went on
a 10-0 run and cut its lead to 93-86 on a jumper by Chucky Atkins with 8:50
remaining in the game. Orlando could only get within seven again, 105-98, the
remainder of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill scored 24 first-half points as Detroit led 57-47 at the break.
</P>
<P>

scenes. Instead, it's a beautifully told tale of how a terrier puppy transforms
the life of a shy, scrawny 9-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
	   The story comes from a 1995 memoir by writer Willie Morris. The movie is
narrated as if the grown-up Morris were telling the story with an air of fond
recollection. Yazoo, Miss., we're told, was a town of "10,000 souls and nothing
doing," the kind of place people with out-of-state license plates drove through
without giving it a thought.
</P>
<P>
	   Young Willie (excellently played by Frankie Munoz) is the only child of a
stern father (Kevin Bacon) and a high-spirited mother (Diane Lane). Willie, more
interested in books than sports, finds himself the hapless target of teasing and
bullying by other children. He has no friends. At his ninth birthday party, his
only guests are his parents and some white-haired relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was when he receives his greatest gift, Skip.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was just a trembling ball of fur, scared and shy as I was," the
narration recalls. Skip became "my best and most steadfast friend."
</P>
<P>
	   Skip takes an active hand in bettering Willie's life. He engineers some
meetings between Wilie and a pretty young classmate. He helps Willie prove
himself to his tormenters in a football game. He becomes Willie's companion as
they explore the land around Yazoo and enjoy the company of Willie's newfound
friends.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time a teen-age Willie boards a bus to success in the outside world,
you have to give some credit to the dog -- even as you wonder if Skip's social
skills had been improved a bit by Willie's memory.
</P>
<P>
	   But this film goes way beyond a sitcom-level treatment of a smart pet
helping clueless people. "My Dog Skip" is really about Willie. We watch him grow
up, learning painful lessons about life, death and the truth about childhood
heroes.
</P>
<P>
	   This emotionally rich reverie is so enticing that, at a recent screening, it
captured a middle-aged Northerner who never owned a pet and doesn't care for
dogs. More amazingly, it got high marks from a pair of 9-year-old boys, who
might have been expected to want less talk and more action.
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe there's hope for this generation yet. At least they know a good movie
when they see one.
</P>
<P>
	   "My Dog Skip" is distributed by Warner Brothers and produced by Alcon
Entertainment. It was directed by Jay Russell and produced by Mark Johnson, John
Lee Hancock, Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson. It is rated PG. Younger
children might be upset when Willie explores a gunshot wound on a deer or when
it appears Skip is beaten with a shovel, although the impact is not shown.

	   "Murder on Music Row" (Shell Point Records) -- Larry Cordle and Lonesome
Standard Time
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Cordle is best known as a songwriter, with tunes recorded by such
stars as Garth Brooks, George Strait, George Jones, Reba McEntire and Trisha
Yearwood. So it's no surprise that the songs are strong on his bluegrass band's
new release, "Murder on Music Row."
</P>
<P>
	   The 13 tunes -- seven co-written by Cordle -- are closer to country than
most material coming out of Nashville these days, and the record is all the
better for it. That's clear by the second cut, "Black Diamond Strings," a
wistful ode to guitar strings. Cordle sings about the death of traditional
country music on the title cut and comes up with Nashville's couplet of the year
on "Jesus and Bartenders": "One man offers comfort from the cross/the other only
comfort on the rocks."
</P>
<P>
	   Cordle's original tunes mesh nicely with the covers, which include
instrumentals by J.D. Crowe ("Black Jack") and Buck White ("Buck's Run").
</P>
<P>
	   The performances are worthy of the material. Cordle's lead vocals have
plenty of personality, and Lonesome Standard Time provides an excellent
supporting cast, with bracing harmonies and instrumental breaks that are
finger-snappin' good.

	   "Peace" (Arista Records) -- Eurythmics
</P>
<P>
	   In recent TV appearances pushing their new record "Peace," Annie Lennox and
Dave Stewart marked their reunion as Eurythmics with a stripped-down, straight
ahead rock 'n' roll approach. Too bad they didn't do the same on the actual
record.
</P>
<P>
	   While the pop duo's first joint effort in 10 years is definitely listenable,
it is nowhere near as compelling as Eurythmics' previous work. And the fault
lies in the overproduction that almost drowns out Lennox, still the best female
voice in rock today. It also distracts from some fine, albeit overly cynical
lyrics that get at the heart of what it means to get older in a youth-based
culture.
</P>
<P>
	   The duo does get it right on three straight songs in the middle that save
the record. The ethereal "Peace Is Just a Word" highlights Lennox's range and
Stewart's ability to cut back the production; "I've Tried Everything" features
Lennox's soaring vocals undercutting the cynical line: "You're a loser now."
</P>
<P>
	   "I Want It All" is Eurythmics at its best -- Lennox tears chunks out of a
tune with double meaning while Stewart tears into guitar licks with equal
fervor. The overall record may not live up to these standards, but at least
Eurythmics gave us these gems, with the hope for more.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Down 96.80  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply lower this morning as fears of rising
interest rates depressed blue chips for a second consecutive session and knocked
technology stocks lower as well.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 96.80 at 11,260.71.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also down. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 17.99 at 1,437.23, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 65.89 at
4,065.26. The Nasdaq plunged more than 100 points at the opening bell before
creeping higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Market averages swung sharply on Monday as investors balanced good news
about a smooth conversion to the Year 2000 with growing fears that runaway
economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed left rates unchanged at its last meeting, hoping to ensure monetary
stability while Y2K concerns played out around the world. With few reported
troubles, the Fed is now widely expected to raise rates at its next meeting on
Feb. 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits.
Higher rates are especially troubling for banks, which see lending volume shrink
as it becomes more expensive to borrow money, and high-growth stocks, whose
promise of future earnings growth may be threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, American Express fell 2 15/16 to 154 5/16, and Hewlett-Packard fell 2
15/16 to 114 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks also struggled as investors locked in profits from a
stellar year in 1999. Traders said many investors held onto shares of
top-performing companies last year and are now selling because the taxes on
their gains won't be due until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   CMGI lost 10 7/16 to 316, and Apple Computer fell 3 1/8 to 109 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 124.73 million shares, behind Monday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.83 to 489.59.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.4 percent in the first trading
day of the new year, closing at the highest level in 28 months. Markets in Tokyo
reported no Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In Europe, however, markets took their cues from the interest-rate worries
in the United States. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 2.6
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 3.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down
3.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Peterson released after serving 18 months for death of newborn son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WYCKOFF, N.J. (AP) - Brian Peterson returned to his home in this
northern New Jersey community today about two hours after his release from a
Delaware prison where he had served 18 months of a two-year manslaughter
sentence for the death of his newborn son.
<P>
	   Peterson, 21, and his parents arrived here at 10:30 a.m. and pulled their
SUV directly into the garage of their suburban brick home. Peterson emerged
briefly and embraced attorney Jack Litman, who had been waiting in a car
outside. They then entered the house without speaking to media.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Peterson had walked out of the Webb Correctional Facility in
Price's Corner, Del., with his arm around his mother. He did not speak with
media there.
</P>
<P>
	   In a typewritten statement handed out by corrections officials, Peterson
said he was sorry "for my part in the tragic events that occurred three years
ago" and was happy to be going home.
</P>
<P>
	   "I cannot adequately express my appreciation for the sympathy and support I
received from so many people during these trying times. I can assure everyone
that I will reward their confidence in me and make them proud of me in the
future," he said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson and the child's mother, Amy Grossberg, pleaded guilty to
manslaughter in July 1998 for the 1996 death of their son.
</P>
<P>
	   The two former sweethearts from the wealthy New Jersey suburb of Wyckoff
were both freshmen in college when they went to a Newark, Del., motel room Nov.
12, 1996, and delivered a baby boy after a hidden pregnancy. The newborn's body
was later found in a plastic bag in the motel's trash bin.
</P>
<P>
	   The state medical examiner's office said the boy was born alive at full term
and died of multiple skull fractures caused by blunt trauma and shaking.
</P>
<P>
	   Both were initially charged with first-degree murder and prosecutors had
suggested it could be a death penalty case.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson and Ms. Grossberg said they believed the baby was stillborn.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Grossberg is scheduled to be released in May from the Baylor
Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson was released early because of time served before his guilty plea
and good behavior, state corrections spokeswoman Elizabeth Welch said. She
described him as a model inmate who tutored other prisoners and worked in the
commissary and kitchen.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, a judge denied a request by Peterson's attorney to reduce his
sentence by three weeks so he could spend Christmas with his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Henry duPont Ridgely said he considered Peterson's
cooperation, lack of a previous criminal record and his anticipated good
behavior when he imposed the two-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   The state of New Jersey will set the conditions of Peterson's two-year
probation and supervise him. If he violates probation, he would be brought back
to Delaware court.

<HEADLINE> It's not Y2K, but computer malfunction delays flights across  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) - A computer malfunction at the air traffic control
center for the Northeast delayed dozens of flights at airports from Washington
to Boston. But don't blame Y2K.
<P>
	   The failure of one computer forced controllers to shut down the main
computer at the Nashua center for nearly three hours Monday night, Jim Peters, a
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem was not related to the Y2K computer bug, said Eliot Brenner, the
FAA's assistant administrator for public affairs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The center controls flights across a region from the Atlantic Ocean to
western New York and from the Canadian border to south of New York's Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
	   The center still could track airplanes and had a backup system to guide them
to landings, Peters said. However, flights at Logan International Airport in
Boston were delayed on the ground for up to 90 minutes and at airports in the
New York area for up to 75 minutes, Peters said. Delays also extended to
airports at Philadelphia and the Washington area, he said.

<HEADLINE> Workplace Rules Protect Home Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department has concluded that companies that let
employees work at home are responsible for federal health and safety violations
in home workspace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ensuring safe and healthful working conditions for the employee should be
a precondition for any home-based work assignments,'' says an advisory letter
from the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter, dated Nov. 15, answered questions posed by a Texas-based credit
services company planning to have some of its sales executives work at home.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA officials said today that the advisory opinion does not mark any change
in rules and does not mean that the government will routinely begin inspecting
home offices. Rather, they said, it clarifies existing laws that hold employers
liable for and require them to report any worker illnesses or injuries resulting
from assigned duties, even if the workplace is a person's home.
</P>
<P>
	   Some large companies already have written agreements or offer guidelines to
telecommuting employees setting up home offices in recognition of this
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   However, business groups said that the new OSHA interpretation specifies a
greater burden on employers that could have a chilling effect on at-home work
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At a time when we want to provide a maximum amount of flexibility to
workers, this new policy announcement just flies in the face of that,'' said
U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokesman Frank Coleman.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, government inspectors have occasionally visited private homes
to investigate allegations of problems such as sweatshop-type conditions in
apartments converted to workspaces in the garment industry, for example, or to
investigate deaths of at-home workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The advisory letter gives examples of the types of problems companies could
be liable for, ranging from ergonomic injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome,
from improperly configured computer work stations, or fires caused by
overloading home electrical circuits with office equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Employers should exercise reasonable diligence to identify in advance the
possible hazards associated with particular home work assignments and should
provide the necessary protection through training, personal protective
equipment, or other controls appropriate to reduce or eliminate the hazard.''
said the letter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One obvious and effective means of ensuring employee safety would be
periodic safety checks of employee working spaces'' by companies, the advisory
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The policy applies specifically to home work areas and not the entire home.
It potentially applies to nearly 20 million Americans who regularly work from
home for an employer, as well as to those who work at home occasionally.

expected a final settlement to be reached by year-end.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no ideal time to solve a case like this ... but I am assured the
time is now," Telesca said, adding that the proposed deal does not decide "who
was right and wrong. I will leave that to history."
</P>
<P>
	   On behalf of two prison officials, a state police chief and the head of the
department of corrections at the time, the state also agreed after negotiations
to pay $4 million in legal fees and costs to lawyers for the inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   When the lawsuit was filed in 1974, the plaintiffs sought $100 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge would have to decide how to divide the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Telesca was brought into the case in August after the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit reversed two verdicts ordering Karl Pfeil, former
assistant deputy superintendent at Attica, to pay $4 million in damages to
inmate Frank B.B. Smith and $75,000 to David Brosig.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith was forced to lie on a table while officers beat and burned him. He
was also ordered to hold a football under his chin - and threatened with death
if it fell.
</P>
<P>
	   In reversing the jury verdicts based on what the appeals court called faulty
instructions from another federal judge, the court acknowledged "very
substantial evidence that ... some, and perhaps most or even all, of the D Yard
inmates were the victims of brutal acts of retaliation by prison authorities."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith thanked the judge for helping resolve the lawsuit. "God bless you. ...
I think where we're at today is where we need to be," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants in the class-action lawsuit are Vincent Mancusi, who was
superintendent of Attica in 1971; the estate of Russell G. Oswald,
then-commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services; and the estate of
John Monahan, who as commander of the State Police in nearby Batavia played a
key role in retaking the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth Fink, the attorney for the late Akil Al-Jundi, the lead plaintiff,
said the proposed settlement comes after four appeals in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "It looked like we were going to get nothing for a long time," she said,
nothing that she represented "a class of people that are the most vilified in
America, which are inmates."
</P>
<P>
	   "No settlement compensates people for what really happened," she said, but
the proposed settlement "brings closure to what is a significant event in
American history, one that still lives today."

<HEADLINE> Peterson released after serving 18 months for death of newborn son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WYCKOFF, N.J. (AP) - Brian Peterson returned to his home in this
northern New Jersey community today about two hours after his release from a
Delaware prison where he had served 18 months of a two-year manslaughter
sentence for the death of his newborn son.
<P>
	   Peterson, 21, and his parents arrived here at 10:30 a.m. and pulled their
SUV directly into the garage of their suburban brick home. Peterson emerged
briefly and embraced attorney Jack Litman, who had been waiting in a car
outside, before walking back in.
</P>
<P>
	   He came out about an hour later with his lawyers - Litman and Russell
Gioiella - and his mother Barbara and read from a prepared statement saying he
was sorry "for my part in the tragic events that occurred three years ago" and
expressing appreciation for "the sympathy and support I received from so many
people during these trying times."
</P>
<P>
	   "I can assure everyone that I will reward their confidence in me and make
them proud of me in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement was identical to one handed out earlier by officials at the
Webb Correctional Facility in Price's Corner, Del., when Peterson walked out
with his arm around his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing pale and thin, he did not answer reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Litman said Peterson had eaten a chocolate donut from Entemann's on the ride
home and had looked at his fish tank and visited with his cat, Princess,
immediately on arriving home. He said Peterson planned to find a school where he
could resume his college education and must perform 300 hours of unspecified
community service.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson and the child's mother, Amy Grossberg, pleaded guilty to
manslaughter in July 1998 for the 1996 death of their son.
</P>
<P>
	   The two former sweethearts from the wealthy New Jersey suburb of Wyckoff
were both freshmen in college when they went to a Newark, Del., motel room Nov.
12, 1996, and delivered a baby boy after a hidden pregnancy. The newborn's body
was later found in a plastic bag in the motel's trash bin.
</P>
<P>
	   The state medical examiner's office said the boy was born alive at full term
and died of multiple skull fractures caused by blunt trauma and shaking.
</P>
<P>
	   Both were initially charged with first-degree murder and prosecutors had
suggested it could be a death penalty case.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson and Ms. Grossberg said they believed the baby was stillborn.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Grossberg is scheduled to be released in May from the Baylor
Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson was released early because of time served before his guilty plea
and good behavior, state corrections spokeswoman Elizabeth Welch said. She
described him as a model inmate who tutored other prisoners and worked in the
commissary and kitchen.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, a judge denied a request by Peterson's attorney to reduce his
sentence by three weeks so he could spend Christmas with his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Henry duPont Ridgely said he considered Peterson's
cooperation, lack of a previous criminal record and his anticipated good
behavior when he imposed the two-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   The state of New Jersey will set the conditions of Peterson's two-year
probation and supervise him. If he violates probation, he would be brought back
to Delaware court.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 156.99; Nasdaq Off 85.53  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as fears of rising interest rates
depressed blue chips for a second straight session and also prompted some
investors to take profits from technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
156.99 at 11,200.52.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was off 26.75 at 1,428.47, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 85.53 at
4,045.62.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued selling that began Monday as the market balanced good
news about a smooth conversion to the Year 2000 with growing fears that runaway
economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market has had a very strong run," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market
strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore. "Higher interest rates are providing a
catalyst for some selling that probably needs to take place before it can go any
higher."
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors now believe the Fed will raise interest rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1 and 2 now that Year 2000 computer worries proved largely
unfounded. The Fed left rates unchanged at its last meeting, hoping to ensure
monetary stability while Y2K concerns played out around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits.
Higher rates are especially troubling for banks, which see lending volume shrink
as it becomes more expensive to borrow money, and high-growth stocks, whose
promise of future earnings growth may be threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, American Express fell 4 7/8 to 152 3/8, and Hewlett-Packard fell 4 to
113 7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks also struggled as investors collected profits from a
stellar year in 1999. Traders said many investors held onto shares of
top-performing companies last year and are now selling because the taxes on
their gains won't be due until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   CMGI lost 8 7/16 to 318, and Apple Computer fell 5 1/8 to 107 7/8. Yahoo!
was unscathed by the selloff, rising 18 to 493.
</P>
<P>
	   Cripps said a modest correction was overdue in a market that soared to new
records at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it doesn't correct, that would be disturbing," he said. "That would
signify that this is more of an extended bubble that we've believed."
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 433.43 million shares, behind Monday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.45 to 486.97.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.4 percent in the first trading
day of the new year, closing at the highest level in 28 months. Markets in Tokyo
reported no Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In Europe, however, markets took their cues from the interest-rate worries
in the United States and were sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets took little notice of President Clinton's renomination of Alan
Greenspan for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve System. The
announcement was widely expected.

<HEADLINE> Animal Intelligence Debated on PBS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A pigeon that can distinguish between works by Picasso
and Monet. A raven that makes use of a fishing line. A chimpanzee who figures
out how to employ tools to snare a banana hanging tantalizingly overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   These and other behaviors are on display in "Inside the Animal Mind," a
miniseries that puts to the test lay and scientific assumptions about how deeply
animals may feel and think.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of PBS' "Nature," the documentary from Thirteen/WNET New York takes a
look at the debate over how animals stack up against their human counterparts,
allowing for differing perspectives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Inside the Animal Mind" is filled with examples of animal conduct that
raise questions not only about various creatures but about us and our own
mechanics. The film includes explanations of how human and non-human brains
process information.
</P>
<P>
	   How our treatment of animals could be affected by an increased knowledge of
their responses to pain, pleasure and even mortality is on the table. Fish,
despite fisherman's lore, may actually find a hook in the mouth painful, the
documentary says.
</P>
<P>
	   The series, airing at 8 p.m. EST on three consecutive Tuesdays beginning
tonight and narrated by journalist Steve Kroft ("60 Minutes"), opens with an
examination of animal intelligence. The second part is devoted to emotion, the
third to consciousness. "Nature" creator George Page, executive editor of
"Inside the Animal Mind," has written a companion book published by Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
	   Examples of animal capability are presented, including a Southwestern bird
that is a true Houdini when it comes to memory tricks. A nutcracker buries
thousands of pine nuts, one by one, then retrieves virtually all from a winter
landscape transformed by snow.
</P>
<P>
	   There's that artful pigeon, the one who can summon food in a lab experiment
by rapping his beak against a Picasso but not any other artist's work.
</P>
<P>
	   But real intelligence is demonstrated by evidence that animals can
manipulate images or symbols in their mind, proof of more than
trial-and-error-learning, suggests scientist Euan Macphail.
</P>
<P>
	   Macphail and others pop up again and again with questions about how much
animal behavior, no matter how impressive, mirrors what humans deem
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
	   Is the ability to count evidence of perception, or is skill at arithmetic
more persuasive? Can an animal do a task nearly perfectly right away, showing
mental agility, or is it just learning by repetition? If an animal cannot speak,
can it have consciousness?
</P>
<P>
	   Through research experiments presented in the series, we see animals
apparently meeting some of the more demanding standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Some experiments are simple, such as a chimpanzee being directed to add the
amount of fruit contained in two baskets.
</P>
<P>
	   In another trial, conducted by Professor Sally Boysen of Ohio State
University, a room and its contents are reproduced in miniature and an item is
hidden in the same place in both the tiny and full-size rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   A chimpanzee is shown where the item is hidden in the scale room and then
faces the test of finding its bigger counterpart. Can the chimp do what a
3-year-old human being can?
</P>
<P>
	   Whether it succeeds or not, there's a moment that might convince an
untrained observer that this chimp, at least, has the kind of self-awareness we
expect in people. The animal stops at a mirror and checks out its appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most heartfelt voices in support of animal intelligence and
emotion is that of Jane Goodall, the venerable primatologist. Evidence exists
that animals have self-awareness, she says, but some see accepting that as
diminishing humanity.
</P>
<P>
	   "It simply has demolished yet another barrier which we in our arrogance have
erected from time immemorial between ourselves and the animal kingdom," Goodall
says in the film.
</P>
<P>
	   Another scientist, Rob Pickard, suggests that bees, despite a brain a
million times smaller than ours, are abuzz with consciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm quite sure when a honeybee is sitting on a comb at the end of the long
day, she's running through pictures in her mind of the flowers that she's
visited, of the places that she's seen. ... If she wasn't doing that, how would
she build up this wonderful geographic perception of her whole environment?"

<HEADLINE> Diabetes testing lawsuit is settled out of court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   EAST HADDAM, Conn. (AP) - Should Katelyn Cross ever return to public
schools in East Haddam, she will be permitted to prick her finger while sitting
at her classroom desk.
<P>
	   This was the gist of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit brought by the
family of a diabetic child who wanted to be allowed to conduct a common
blood-glucose test while remaining in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cross family said they hoped the out-of-court settlement disclosed
Monday will send a message nationwide to school districts that do not allow
diabetic students to administer the glucose-monitoring test at their desks.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in New Haven in 1996, Katelyn and
her family complained the East Haddam School Board subjected her to undue
ridicule and lost classroom time by forcing her to visit the nurse's office each
time she needed to conduct the test. The lawsuit alleged that the school
violated her rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the lawsuit, the glucose test requires Katelyn to prick her
finger with a lancet and place a tiny blood sample into a device that determines
in less than a minute whether her blood glucose level is in an acceptable range.
</P>
<P>
	   The child, now a sixth grader, transferred to a parochial school in Old
Saybrook this year. But under terms of the settlement, should she ever re-enroll
in East Haddam public schools, the board of education would have to let her
regularly test her blood glucose in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The test is typically done several times per day. In Katelyn's case, the
results are used to adjust her glucose level through food, drink and tablets.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement does not set the sort of legal precedent that a verdict or
court ruling conveys. But by publicizing the settlement, the Cross family hopes
to spread the word to school districts throughout the country as they set
policies
</P>
<P>
	   Doreen Cross, Katelyn's mother, said the family discovered while pursuing
the lawsuit that school districts lack uniform policies for the testing. Some
have rules similar to those that were in place in East Haddam, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cross family says increasing numbers of school districts are adopting
policies governing in- classroom glucose monitoring. They say health departments
in several states, including Vermont, have published comprehensive guidelines
allowing glucose testing wherever the child feels most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been such a long fight and we finally made a difference. I feel
wonderful," Katelyn told The Day of New London.

<HEADLINE> Boys outnumber girls by 18,000 in public schools  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Judging by the latest census at Connecticut
public schools, a lot of boys are going to be hard-pressed to find prom dates or
girls to tease on the playground.
<P>
	   Boys outnumber girls by almost 18,000 in public schools, from
pre-kindergartners to high school seniors, the state Department of Education
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, schools have enrolled 285,743 boys and 267,757 girls.
</P>
<P>
	   The school enrollment figures mirror the state's birth records, which show
about 1,000 more boys than girls are born each year in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Population demographic experts say the trend is a normal fact of biology,
not the product of gender-selective abortions or fertility plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's common for more males to be born, and if you take the national rate
and apply it to the Connecticut rate, it's not any different," said Melissa
Park, a health statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Some fertility experts say the sex of a fetus can depend upon the time of
the month conception occurs and the changing conditions in a woman's body.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Joshua Copel, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale
University, said parents who have tried gender selection "have not had wild
success," and virtually no doctors in the United States admit to performing
gender-selective abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The balance evens out somewhat because boy babies have higher rates of
infant mortality than girl babies, Copel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over time, the trend reverses, since women on average live longer than men -
but not in time to help out high school boys looking for prom dates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're talking about women who live into their 80s and 90s," Copel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Students and educators have their own theories for why more boys are in
school.
</P>
<P>
	   "In all our honors classes, it's practically all girls," said Kelly
Thibault, a sophomore at Wilbur Cross High School. "There's fewer of us, but
we're better and more powerful."
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Murphy, a spokesman for the Department of Education, said boys have
outnumbered girls in school as far back as state statistics go.
</P>
<P>
	   Private schools report the same boy-to-girl ratio, and the small number of
private, girl-only schools do not have enough students to make up for the
difference, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
	   The gap starts to close around 11th grade, when more boys than girls drop
out of school.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, with so much competition, some boys in high school are not taking
any chances in getting prom dates.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've already got mine," said Wilbur Cross senior Jason Goubourn, "so I'm
OK."

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Down 307  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today as fears of rising interest rates
depressed blue chips for a second straight session and also prompted some
investors to take profits from technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 307.77, or by 2.7 percent, at 11,049.74. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was off 47.03, or 3.2 percent, at 1,408.19, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 173.03, or 4.2 percent, at 3,958.12.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued selling that began Monday as the market grew concerned
that, now that concerns about Year 2000 computer bugs have passed, the nation's
robust economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors now believe the Fed will raise interest rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1 and 2. The Fed left rates unchanged at its last meeting,
hoping to ensure monetary stability while Y2K concerns played out around the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets took little notice of President Clinton's renomination of Alan
Greenspan for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve System. The
announcement was widely expected.
</P>
<P>
	   But some of today's selling was also due to the fact that traders who
enjoyed big gains at the end of 1999 can, with the arrival of the new year, take
profits without having to pay taxes on their gains until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said a pullback after the market's December rally was expected.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market has had a very strong run," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market
strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore. "Higher interest rates are providing a
catalyst for some selling that probably needs to take place before it can go any
higher."
</P>
<P>
	   The selloff wasn't limited to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In Britain, where trading resumed today for the first time after a long New
Year's holiday, the main index of the London Stock Exchange had its biggest
daily point loss ever, dropping 264.3 points, or by 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not the biggest percentage loss, however. London's Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index had plunged 12.2 percent on Oct. 27, 1987,
when it had its previous largest point loss, a drop of 250.7.

<HEADLINE> Big Movers in the Stock Market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   An analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette cut his rating on the stock from
"buy" to "market perform."
</P>
<P>
	   Many Mexican shares fell amid concerns that U.S. interest rates are headed
higher. Grupo Televisa said Tuesday it plans to make a secondary stock offering
that could raise as much as $950 million to pay off debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects to report fourth-quarter earnings in the range of 5
cents to 7 cents a share, well below the analysts' estimates of 20 cents a
share. Labor Ready is a staffing company that focuses on providing manual labor.
</P>
<P>
	   The English-Norwegian biotechnology group saw shares rise amid rumors that
it will be acquired. Nycomed Amersham officials said the rumors were groundless.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dutch software maker said its chief executive has resigned and that it
plans to close 14 offices and cut 4 percent of its work force. The restructuring
is aimed at shifting its core business toward making products for businesses
that can be used over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareholders Monday approved steps that would strengthen the
telecommunications company's foothold in China. New Tel and China's Xinhua
Holdings Ltd. will work to establish an Internet service provider and a

</P>
<P>
	   The company expects first-quarter earnings of 4 to 6 cents per share, below
analysts' forecasts of 15 cents per share. Parametric said revenue is likely to
be 12 percent below Wall Street forecasts. Parametric provides manufacturing
software.
</P>
<P>
	   Genesis, citing lower demand for some of its products and the September
earthquake in Taiwan, said it expects to just break even in its fiscal third
quarter. In the second quarter, the semiconductor maker earned 20 cents per

<HEADLINE> TV Game Shows Dominate in January  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Three weeks of buzzer-beating and final answers could make
it clear whether TV's prime-time game show craze is going to last.
</P>
<P>
	   Network television is airing a game show every night but one between
Wednesday and Jan. 23. That includes 11 editions of "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire," the ABC phenomenon that started it all.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox's "Greed" will air three times this week before CBS's "Winning Lines"
debuts on Saturday night. Dick Clark is host of "Winning Lines," a
nerve-rattling quiz where contestants rapidly pick answers from a "wonder wall"
of giant TV screens.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, NBC revives "21," which was at the center of the 1950s cheating
scandal that ended the last prime-time game show craze.
</P>
<P>
	   Even for an industry used to imitation, the speed of bandwagon-jumping is
breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the flavor of the month," said Marc Berman, a television analyst
for Mediaweek.com, "and this flavor is not going to last very long."
</P>
<P>
	   The network maneuvering that brought on this glut may be more compelling
than the shows themselves. After NBC and CBS announced air dates for their new
game shows, ABC sucker-punched them with the announcement that "Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire" would be back for eight nights in a row starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's quick-strike strategy was designed to block viewers from even tuning
in and trying the new game shows on NBC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC responded this week by moving one of its "21" episodes from Jan. 12 to
Jan. 26 to avoid going head-to-head with "Millionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   The danger for ABC is that viewers will quickly grow tired of "Millionaire,"
which settles into ABC's regular schedule three nights a week starting Jan. 16.
The last show to air three times a week, the drama "Peyton Place" in 1965,
quickly lost popularity.
</P>
<P>
	   That's what ABC's rivals hope happens again. They have admitted that one
reason they are rushing game shows on the air -- apart from the desire for a
quick buck -- is to make "Millionaire" less special and dilute its impact.
</P>
<P>
	   Network executives are plainly hedging their bets: CBS has ordered only six
episodes of "Winning Lines," and NBC has scheduled no more than four airings of
"21."
</P>
<P>
	   If anything, it will make Mike Darnell's job easier if viewers reject one of
the new game shows. He is executive vice president of alternative programming at
Fox, overseeing more than a half-dozen game shows in various stages of
development.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly one of these is going to fail," he said, "and then people won't
be so quick to put other shows into production."
</P>
<P>
	   But he predicted that game shows "are going to be part of network television
and you are going to be seeing them for a while. They will be moderately
successful, for the most part."
</P>
<P>
	   And moderate success may be enough. Since the shows are so cheap to produce,
they don't have to be a ratings-grabber like "Millionaire" to make money.
"Winning Lines" airs on Saturday nights, always the lightest viewership night,
so CBS will probably be happy with only a slight boost in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
	   Game shows may be new to prime time, but they have proved themselves
elsewhere on the schedule. "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy" have been the most
successful syndicated shows for years now, said Jake Tauber, executive vice
president of the Game Show Network.
</P>
<P>
	   "The shows that will work will follow the same rules that have always been
successful for game shows -- there must be a strong play-along factor for
audiences at home and they must feel that it could be them up on stage," Tauber
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Assuming viewers do not turn completely cold to the genre, there is edgier
fare on the horizon. Due to arrive in the months ahead: CBS's "Survivor," which
sends contestants to a tropical island in a test of survival skills, and Fox's
attempt to marry off a wealthy bachelor in "Who Wants to Marry A
Multi-Millionaire?"

<HEADLINE> Rep. Fowler Won't Seek Re-Election  </HEADLINE>
   By RON WORD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Rep. Tillie Fowler, who vowed to serve no more
than eight years in Congress when she ran in 1992, announced Tuesday she would
not seek a fifth term despite suggestions by some that she put aside her pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   The top-ranking Republican woman in the House ranks fifth in GOP hierarchy
as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference. In a recent campaign
appearance in Jacksonville, GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush urged her
to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Term Limits, a group supporting term limits, ran 30-second TV
commercials dubbed ``Slick Tillie'' last fall urging her to abide by her pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   She had refused to discuss her re-election plans at that time, calling them
a ``non-issue.'' Still, some had speculated that recent health problems,
including a detached retina, and serious injuries to her brother in a motorcycle
accident might end her career in the House. She is 57.
</P>
<P>
	   She was the last of 10 House members who pledged to leave office after the
2000 election to announce their plans. Six others have said they will not run
again, while three are seeking re-election despite their old pledges.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Fowler, who represents a district with a Republican majority in
northeast Florida, ran unopposed in the last three elections. She is the
second-ranking leader in the Republican Conference, which includes all 223 GOP
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   She is known as the ``Steel Magnolia'' for a sweet Southern demeanor
combined with persistence.

<HEADLINE> Democrats propose earmarking portion of tobacco tax for counties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Democratic state legislators Tuesday proposed
earmarking a portion of the state's soon-to-balloon tax on tobacco to reimburse
counties for significant new insurance coverage costs.
<P>
	   The Democratic bill seeks to amend the Health Care Reform Act 2000
legislation, which went into effect New Year's Day. That new law will create
state-subsidized health insurance programs for up to 1 million more New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   County executives say the bill contains an unfunded mandate on their
taxpayers by paying for the new Family Health Plus program through Medicaid.
County taxpayers cover 25 percent of most Medicaid costs. The legislation
proposed Tuesday would direct the state to earmark about half the money it will
raise through the tobacco taxes to reimburse counties for their share of the
Family Health Plus program.
</P>
<P>
	   Counties can expect to pay about $360 million more over the first three
years of the Family Health Plus program, plus an undetermined extra amount in
administrative costs, according to the state Association of Counties.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've always believed that is not a cost that should be passed along to the
counties," Assemblyman Ronald Canestrari, an Albany County Democrat, said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Neil Breslin, another Albany County representative, said county
leaders and taxpayers are "outraged" by the new expense being laid at their door
by the governor and state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a mandate they are not ready for or capable of bearing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno tried to reassure the counties
that the Legislature will come to their rescue if the cost of Family Health Plus
or other aspects of the $9 billion Health Care Reform Act 2000 become too
burdensome.
</P>
<P>
	   But Albany County Executive Michael Breslin, Neil Breslin's brother, was not
convinced.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have often heard we will be taken care of and we're not," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the Health Care Reform Act 2000 legislation say it contains
cost benefits to counties of $144 million a year. They also note that counties
are beginning to receive hundreds of millions of dollars as part of their share
of the settlement with tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
	   But Breslin and other state legislators say some counties' finances are
precarious - they cited Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties as examples -
and that strapped officials have already spent this year's tobacco settlement
money to head off deficits, on building projects and for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting March 1, the state's current 56-cents-a-pack tax on a pack of
cigarettes will jump to $1.11 a pack. It is expected to raise another $400
million or so a year annually.
</P>
<P>
	   The original Health Care Reform Act proposal in the Democratic Assembly
contained a provision that the state would cover costs to county taxpayers of
subsidized insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno spokesman John McArdle said he had not seen the Democratic proposal
and could not comment on it. But he said counties "did very well" in the Health
Care Reform Act 2000 law through the continuation of cost containments in the
Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
	   "Add that to the tobacco monies, they are getting over $700 million,"
McArdle said. "And they are not paying a nickel this year for anything under the
new plan for the uninsured."
</P>
<P>
	   Neil Breslin said January would be a perfect time to amend the Health Care
Reform Act to get county taxpayers off the hook.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that early in the session is the time to do it because basically we
sit around and do nothing," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gives Greenspan Direction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even while he repeatedly noted the value of an independent
Federal Reserve, President Clinton issued a few instructions to Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton wanted Greenspan to stand beside him in the Oval Office as he
formally announced Greenspan's renomination as head of the Fed. But Greenspan
respectfully hung in the background next to Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
and White House staff members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're supposed to stand over here today,'' Clinton said as he motioned
Greenspan to the podium.
</P>
<P>
	   A startled Greenspan scooped up a sheaf of papers he had just set on the
credenza behind him and followed Clinton's directions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the only time I'm interfering with the independence of the Fed,''
Clinton joked.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech praising Greenspan's 12-year tenure, Clinton noted that his
staff is careful to ensure he never offers advice on how the nation's money is
handled. That is the Fed's province.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have not been able to stop me from asking him for his advice,''
however, Clinton added. ``So, I would also like to thank him for the many
conversations we've had over the last seven years in our ongoing attempt to
understand this amazing and ever-changing economy.'' ------
</P>
<P>
	   Between Greenspan's nomination and Middle East negotiations, Clinton helped
his wife pack up their belongings to move to her new house in New York state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been boxing things up and figuring out what to leave here, what to
move there,'' Clinton told reporters. ``It's been a rather interesting challenge
over the holidays, but I've enjoyed it very much.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two trucks full of the Clintons' belongings left Washington today bound for
the house, where Mrs. Clinton plans to live as she prepares for her Senate
campaign. The first lady plans to go to her new home on Wednesday to begin
unpacking, said her spokeswoman Toby Graff.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton has been waiting for the Secret Service to complete security
work on the $1.7 million house before moving in. Local government officials
recently approved two security additions: an 8-foot fence and a small gatehouse
at the end of the driveway.

<HEADLINE> Santana Leads Grammy Nominees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Veteran rocker Carlos Santana, who returned to
the top of the charts with his album of collaborations with contemporary stars,
led the Grammy Award nominees today. He picked up 10 nods including song, record
and album of the year for "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old Santana, generally overlooked by the Grammys, had previously
received just five nominations during his three-decade career. He won the Grammy
for best rock instrumental in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's collaboration with singer Rob Thomas from the band Matchbox 20,
"Smooth," was nominated for record of the year and best pop collaboration with
vocals.
</P>
<P>
	   His collaboration with Everlast, "Put Your Lights On," was nominated for
best rock performance by a duo or group with vocal.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's guitar collaboration with Eric Clapton, "The Calling," was
nominated for best rock instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The album "Supernatural" itself was nominated for best rock album and album
of the year.

<HEADLINE> Post Office Robber Arrives Wrapped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ROME (AP) -- Robbers targeting an Italian post office did not have anyone on
the inside -- so they mailed someone there.
</P>
<P>
	   The robbers brought a member of their group to the post office wrapped in a
carton. When the package would not fit through the normal package slot,
employees invited them to use a service door behind the counter window, said
Carlo Cerrutti, a spokesman for the Rome police.
</P>
<P>
	   When an employee brought the package inside, a robber burst out of the
carton, waved a gun and shouted, "It's a holdup," according to police.
</P>
<P>
	   The robbery was the fourth in eight years at the post office in the outlying
Casilina district.
</P>
<P>
	   The robbers escaped with $75,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Italian post offices are virtual banks where tens of millions of customers
keep savings accounts, collect pensions and pay taxes and utility bills.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Down 256.27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dropped sharply today as fears of rising interest
rates depressed blue chips for a second straight session and also prompted
investors to take profits from technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was down 256.27 at 11,101.24.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also suffered big losses. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was off 41.03 at 1,414.19, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 143.22
at 3,987.93.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued a wave of selling that began Monday as the market
balanced good news about a smooth conversion to the Year 2000 with growing fears
that runaway economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "The toggle switch moved from 'off' to 'on' regarding interest-rate
worries," said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed of
Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
	   Herrmann said investors were able to brush off concerns about rising rates
while Y2K loomed as a potential threat to the economy. With worries about
technical troubles now mostly alleviated, interest rates are once again rattling
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts believe that the Fed, too, was relieved by the easy path into
2000 and will resume raising interest rates at its next meeting on Feb. 1 and 2.
The Fed left rates unchanged at its last meeting, hoping to ensure monetary
stability while Y2K concerns played out around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits.
Higher rates are especially troubling for banks, which see lending volume shrink
as it becomes more expensive to borrow money, and high-growth stocks, whose
promise of future earnings growth may be threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, American Express fell 5 15/16 to 151 5/16, and Hewlett-Packard fell 6
1/2 to 110 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks also struggled as investors collected profits from a
stellar year in 1999. Traders said many investors held onto shares of
top-performing companies last year and are now selling because the taxes on
their gains won't be due until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   CMGI lost 12 15/16 to 313 1/2, and Apple Computer fell 6 15/16 to 106 1/16.
Yahoo! was unscathed by the selloff, rising 4 1/4 to 480 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the steep decline in stocks was to be expected after a
year-end run that brought every major market index to record highs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market has had a very strong run," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market
strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore. "Higher interest rates are providing a
catalyst for some selling that probably needs to take place before it can go any
higher."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts also suggested that a decline now could calm the Fed, which has
made no secret of its concern over stocks' lofty valuations.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it doesn't correct, that would be disturbing," Cripps said. "That would
signify that this is more of an extended bubble that we've believed."
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 672.65 million shares, ahead of Monday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies plunged 15.08 to 481.34.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.4 percent in the first trading
day of the new year, closing at the highest level in 28 months. Markets in Tokyo
reported no Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In Europe, however, markets took their cues from the interest-rate worries
in the United States and ended sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets took little notice of President Clinton's renomination of Alan
Greenspan for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve System. The
announcement was widely expected.

<HEADLINE> Border Patrol Shortfall Leaves Risk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a time of increased concern about terrorists slipping
into the United States, the Border Patrol fell far short of its goal of hiring
1,000 new agents to guard the nation's borders, a congressional report says.
</P>
<P>
	   The Border Patrol hired only 369 agents during the year that ended Sept. 30,
compared with the 1,000 new border agents directed by Congress, the General
Accounting Office report said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the agency blames the tight job market for the shortfall,
congressional critics say the Immigration and Naturalization Service was too
slow to react when it became clear last year that its recruitment efforts were
slipping.
</P>
<P>
	   The December arrests at Canadian border crossings of two people with alleged
links to an Islamic militant group in Algeria show why the Border Patrol needs
to be beefed up, said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first time we get a terrorist incident because someone came in over
either the southern or the northern border and we didn't have the personnel to
stop them, people are going to be looking at these reports and pointing
fingers,'' said Kyl, a prime backer of the requirement to hire more agents. ``It
seems sometimes as if the INS is just sleepwalking.''
</P>
<P>
	   All new Border Patrol agents are assigned to the southwest border with
Mexico, where 92 percent of all border agents work, the GAO report said. Sen.
Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who heads a Senate subcommittee on immigration, said
he is ``going to keep pressing'' for more agents along the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of the focus has been on the southern border. That's part of the
problem,'' Abraham said. ``The southern border isn't the only place people can
cross into the country and do so with the intent to commit crimes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The GAO report, released late last month, said that although agents left the
Border Patrol at a lower-than-expected 9 percent rate last year, increasing
numbers of recruits washed out before being hired.
</P>
<P>
	   About three-fourths of the applicants did not even show up for the agency's
written job tests, and most who took the test failed it, the report said. About
40 percent of applicants failed their background investigations because of
criminal records or other problems, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS -- the Border Patrol's parent agency -- redirected $2.2 million
toward recruiting last year and trained 200 agents to help bring in new
applicants, INS spokeswoman Nicole Chulick said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We really believe it is the state of the economy, and applicants have so
many other opportunities,'' Chulick said. ``The military had trouble meeting its
recruitment goals last year, as did many local police departments.''
</P>
<P>
	   But congressional critics say the INS took those actions only after stern
prodding from Congress. Lawmakers could not persuade the INS to offer bonuses to
applicants who speak Spanish, for example, said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They keep siphoning off the money to other projects, when Congress has
said clearly that we want 1,000 new agents a year to protect from these illegal
acts that threaten the sovereignty of our borders,'' Hutchison said.

<HEADLINE> McGuire Sisters May Return To NYC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Nearly half a century after they began their show business
careers as teen-agers, the McGuire Sisters are contemplating a return to their
roots in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd like to put together something like a special concert in New York
City, where it all began," Phyllis McGuire said Monday as she and sisters
Dorothy and Christine prepared for a four-night engagement here.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd like to do a concert, maybe in Carnegie Hall, to mark our 50 years in
the business," she told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The three got their show business break in 1952 with an appearance on the
"Kate Smith Show." They quit performing as a trio at the height of their
popularity in 1968 but returned to the stage as a threesome in 1985. Ms. McGuire
said she and her sisters plan to cut back on their performances and concentrate
more on recording.

<HEADLINE> 'Green Mile' Director Has Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- "The Green Mile" director Frank Darabont has one huge fear.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a deep, abiding fear of turning out something crappy," he said in
this month's Premiere magazine. "Well, if you listen to come critics, I already
have."
</P>
<P>
	   "Shawshank Redemption" received seven Oscar nominations but was a box office
failure.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was offered a lot of stuff" after "Shawshank," he said, "most of which I
didn't want to see, much less make. I just kind of retired to my little house in
Los Feliz and thought, 'Well, I won't direct again unless I find something I'm
really excited about. And if I do, I hope I enjoy the process more."'
</P>
<P>
	   It was another Stephen King work, the novella on which "The Green Mile" is
based, that lured back Darabont.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never show up on the set going, 'Whee! I'm directing today,"' he said.
"You just have to show up and keep putting one foot in front of the other. It
really does become a forced march after awhile."

<HEADLINE> Faux turn of the century crimes turn up in Queens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Nothing about the assortment of turn-of-the-century
crimes would have warranted a second glance. Except that, according to the
police complaints, they occurred in the wrong century.
<P>
	   In one of the city's few Y2K glitches, complaints sent to the Queens
district attorney's office in the year 2000 had suspects committing their crimes
in January, 1900. In the age of technology, police were forced to rely on their
pens to remedy the situation - they crossed out 1900 and wrote in 2000 instead.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the person swore the crime was committed on Jan. 1, 1900, and the
complaint is the accusatory instrument, and then some eager prosecutor simply
decided to change it, without having that approved, ratified or initialed by the
complainant, then that's invalid," said Ron Kuby, a well-known defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   But Queens Chief Assistant District Attorney Jack Ryan said Tuesday that the
changes were made by the officers who filled out the complaints. He also said
none of the 50 to 100 erroneous complaints faxed to the DA's office were sent to
court until they were fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Computers in the 16 police precincts in Queens all had caught the Y2K bug
over the weekend, but by Monday, only three precincts still were spewing out
turn-of-the-century dated complaints. Lt. Sean Crowley, a police spokesman, said
the problem had been remedied by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Y2K glitch was limited to Queens because it's the only borough where
police use a program called CAPS - Complaints Arrest Processing System. After
the complaint is completed at the precinct, officers print it out and fax or
deliver it to the DA's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryan said police find the system "very advantageous" because it doesn't take
much time and enables cops to return to the streets quickly after they write up
their complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the error not been caught, "There would have been a problem with the
statute of limitations," joked Ryan.

<HEADLINE> Minister gets 37-month term for setting fire to her church  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A minister was sentenced Tuesday to 37 months in
prison for torching her Jersey City church to collect the insurance money.
<P>
	   Essie Morzell Pierce must also repay $14,975 to the building's insurer,
under the sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Irenas. He waived a
fine, determining she had no means to pay.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Pierce, who lived in an apartment above the Church Upon the Rock and
Church of Jesus Christ, pleaded guilty Sept. 9 to a single charge of making a
false statement to the New Jersey Underwriting Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Pierce, 50, told the insurer she did not know how the Oct. 23, 1996,
fire started, and NJUA paid her claim.
</P>
<P>
	   She is not believed to be an ordained member of the clergy, but was called a
minister as someone who assisted the church's pastor, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Vaughn McKoy, who prosecuted the case.
</P>
<P>
	   She is to surrender and begin serving her term Feb. 21.

<HEADLINE> Moving trucks arrive, Mrs. Clinton to follow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - Six weeks after unofficially announcing her
candidacy for New York's U.S. Senate seat, Hillary Clinton edged ever closer
Tuesday to actually living in the state.
<P>
	   The first lady wasn't here yet, but two moving vans loaded with rolled-up
rugs, kitchen chairs, a mattress and assorted unopened boxes arrived at her new
$1.7 million Westchester County home on a rainy afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who has never lived or worked in New York state, was expected
at the house Wednesday to begin emptying the boxes, said Karen Finney, a member
of Mrs. Clinton's campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary is very excited about this," said Finney. Mrs. Clinton hoped to
move in by the end of next week; the president plans to visit here at the same
time, Finney said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee for the Senate seat opened by
Daniel Patrick Moynihan's retirement, has said she plans to cut back on first
lady duties and to spend most of her time in New York state this year. New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is expected to be her Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons plan to live in the white, three-story wood frame house when
the president leaves office in January 2001. They signed a deal to buy the house
last September.
</P>
<P>
	   The vintage house, built in 1889, features a swimming pool, five bedrooms,
four bathrooms and two fireplaces. The top floor contains an exercise room.
</P>
<P>
	   The lot, just over an acre, is screened by evergreens at the end of a
cul-de-sac in the quiet, suburban hamlet. The Clintons, criticized when a
prominent Democratic fund-raiser offered help in buying the house, instead took
out a $1.36 million, 30-year adjustable rate mortgage.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of Mrs. Clinton's friends, including a decorator, were at the house
to supervise the unloading of the 26-foot trucks. Most of the property was kept
in storage in suburban Virginia, although some items were from the White House,
Finney said.
</P>
<P>
	   The move was paid for by the Clintons and not with public funds, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons were waiting for the Secret Service to finish security work
before moving in. Security precautions approved by local officials included an
8-foot-tall fence around the property and construction of a small gatehouse at
the end of the Clintons' driveway.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither was in place on Tuesday afternoon. Instead of the guardhouse, a
phone sat on a rock at the bottom of the driveway.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Fowler Won't Seek Re-Election  </HEADLINE>
   By RON WORD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Rep. Tillie Fowler, who vowed to serve no more
than eight years in Congress when she ran in 1992, announced Tuesday she would
not seek a fifth term despite suggestions by some that she break her pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   The top-ranking Republican woman in the House ranks fifth in GOP hierarchy
as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference. In a recent campaign
appearance in Jacksonville, GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush urged her
to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Term Limits, a group supporting term limits, ran TV commercials dubbed
``Slick Tillie'' last fall urging her to abide by her pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   She had refused to discuss her re-election plans at that time, calling them
a ``non-issue.'' Still, some had speculated that recent health problems,
including a detached retina, and serious injuries to her brother in a motorcycle
accident might end her career in the House. She is 57.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've always believed that with hard work, determination and the help of
people here at home, you can accomplish a lot in a short period of time, and
together we have,'' Ms. Fowler told about 100 supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   In reviewing the goals she set out in her 1992 announcement speech, she
said, ``We realized that, one after another, those goals have been
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Fowler vowed to do what she could to ensure Bush's election. She had
earlier been a staunch supporter of Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   She was the last of 10 House members who pledged to leave office after the
2000 election to announce their plans. Six others have said they will not run
again, while three are seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Fowler, who represents a district with a Republican majority in
northeastern Florida, ran unopposed in the last three elections. She is the
second-ranking leader in the Republican Conference, which includes all 223 GOP
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   She is known as the ``Steel Magnolia'' for a sweet Southern demeanor
combined with persistence.

as it becomes more expensive to borrow money, and high-growth stocks, whose
promise of future earnings growth may be threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, with a bright outlook for corporate earnings, analysts said it would
take an especially sharp increase, or a series of moderate increases, to
completely deflate the stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, American Express fell 6 7/16 to 150 13/16, and Hewlett-Packard fell 7
3/16 to 110 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks also struggled as investors collected profits from a
stellar year in 1999. Traders said many investors held onto shares of
top-performing companies last year and are now selling because the taxes on
their gains won't be due until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   CMGI lost 22 3/16 to 304 1/4, and Apple Computer fell 6 5/16 to 106 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the steep decline in stocks was to be expected after a
year-end run that brought every major market index to record highs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market has had a very strong run," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market
strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore. "Higher interest rates are providing a
catalyst for some selling that probably needs to take place before it can go any
higher."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts also suggested that a decline now could calm the Fed, which has
made no secret of its concern over stocks' lofty valuations.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it doesn't correct, that would be disturbing," Cripps said. "That would
signify that this is more of an extended bubble that we've believed."
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 791.65 million shares, ahead of Monday's
pace.

day of the new year, closing at the highest level in 28 months. Markets in Tokyo
reported no Y2K-related problems.

<P>
	   In Europe, however, markets took their cues from the interest-rate worries
in the United States and ended sharply lower.

<HEADLINE> Jail guard accused in fatal beating of inmate pleads guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) - Only days before jury selection was to begin, one
of four guards accused in the fatal beating of a Nassau County Jail inmate
pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal conspiracy and witness tampering charges.
<P>
	   Ivano Bavaro, who had previously maintained his innocence, entered the
surprise guilty plea before U.S. District Court Judge Jacob Mishler. Bavaro's
attorney, Edward Jenks, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors alleged that Bavaro acted as a lookout while two other guards -
Patrick Regnier and Edward Velazquez - went into Thomas Pizzuto's cell on Jan.
8, 1999, and beat the recovering heroin addict as he cried out for his methadone
treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The 38-year-old prisoner from Hicksville, who had been serving a 90-day
sentence for traffic violations, suffered a seizure three days after the alleged
beating and died. The Nassau County medical examiner ruled the death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth guard, Joseph Bergen, was accused of filing a false report
indicating that Pizzuto had slipped in the shower. Jury selection is to begin
Monday in the trial against Regnier, Velazquez and Bergen.
</P>
<P>
	   Bavaro's expected testimony in that case could affect the length of his
prison sentence, which could be up to 10 years. Sentencing was scheduled for
March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   All four guards, who were arrested last May, have been suspended without
pay. With the guilty plea, Bavaro is expected to be fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting Sheriff Peter R. Heelan, who oversees operations at the jail, said
his department has cooperated with investigators and will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are committed to discovering the truth surrounding the death of Mr.
Pizzuto and will reserve final judgment until all of the evidence has been
presented," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Lemke, the attorney for Velazquez, said he was "extremely surprised"
by the change of plea.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know exactly what he has said, so I don't know if it's the truth or
if he's merely changing the story around to protect himself from trial," Lemke
said of Bavaro.
</P>
<P>
	   Ernest Peace, who represents Regnier, was out of town and unavailable for
comment. Ben Gullo, who is Bergen's attorney, did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're very, very pleased that the federal prosecutors have handled this
case as aggressively and professionally as they have," said Peter Neufeld, an
attorney representing the Pizzuto family. "We believe that ultimately justice
will prevail and the people responsible for Tommy's death will be convicted and
sentenced appropriately."
</P>
<P>
	   Neufeld has filed notice of an impending civil suit against the jail on
behalf of the Pizzutos, but said Tuesday that he was awaiting the outcome of the
criminal trial before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
	   The East Meadow jail, which houses about 1,800 inmates and is patrolled by
approximately 1,100 guards, has been the subject of numerous allegations of
guard misconduct. Following the death of Pizzuto and other allegations of abuse,
the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of how inmates are
treated.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for Nassau County Executive Thomas Gulotta did not immediately
return a call for comment.

<HEADLINE> Bill would require Megan's Law checks for all coaches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The names of all people coaching young athletes in
New York should be checked against the Megan's Law registry of sex offenders, a
state senator says.
<P>
	   Legislation filed this week by Sen. Michael Nozzolio would be aimed at
identifying convicted sexual abusers and preventing them from getting close to
children through athletics.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coaches at all levels have the tremendous respect of their players,"
Nozzolio said. "Kids look up to these individuals as role models, as traditional
parent figures, and that relationship of trust is so damaged when you have a
sexual predator entering into the situation."
</P>
<P>
	   Nozzolio, a Seneca County Republican, said there is "more potential for
damage than ever" by abusive coaches because so many more girls are getting the
opportunity to compete in both scholastic and recreational youth sports
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Nozzolio's bill, which does not yet have a sponsor in the state Assembly,
would apply to all "youth organizations" who offer sports activities for youths
up to age 18. The legislation would require the organizations themselves to
provide the names, addresses and dates of birth of all coaches and other adult
supervisors, plus the $5 it costs to run each name through the sex registry.
</P>
<P>
	   The first draft of the bill would not require public and private school
coaches to be checked but Nozzolio spokesman Justin McCarthy said Tuesday they
would be added to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   It would become an annual requirement to check coaches' names against the
registry, if the measure becomes law.
</P>
<P>
	   The sex registry is maintained primarily to allow people to check the names
of men and women who move into their neighborhoods to see if they have a history
of criminal sexual activity. The commission of a range of crimes, including
rape, sodomy and sexual abuse, makes offenders subject to being listed on the
sex-crime registry.
</P>
<P>
	   Violations of Nozzolio's initiative could bring fines of up to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Nozzolio said he thought of requiring criminal background checks of all
coaches, but decided that would be too costly and also create problems in
defining what kinds of criminal activities would exempt a person from serving as
a coach. Some minor offenses not related to sex activities or abuse of children
could probably be tolerated without disqualifying some people from coaching,
according to the state senator.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the state Congress of Parents &AMP; Teachers, Jane Bernhard,
said Tuesday her group has not taken a position on Nozzolio's bill. However, she
added that "we certainly are concerned about the welfare of all children and we
would take a look at this legislation and consider it."
</P>
<P>
	   Roy O'Neil, executive director of the state Athletic Administrators'
Association, said he will bring up Nozzolio's bill at a meeting of public school
athletic directors in his group this weekend in Binghamton. He said he can
"sympathize" with the desire of Nozzolio and others to check out as carefully as
possible the backgrounds of youth coaches.
</P>
<P>
	   To coach now in public schools in New York people have to be certified in
first aid, CPR and must also take a course in recognizing when the children in
their charge have been victims of abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Nozzolio said he developed his bill after reading a September article in
Sports Illustrated magazine which detailed instances where coaches sexually
abused athletes under their supervision. The story also noted that more than 10
million children under age 16 play organized sports under the supervision of
about 1 million adults.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine detailed 30 cases of coaches sexually abusing children under
their care in the 16 months before the story appeared.

<HEADLINE> Pataki to propose $700 million business tax cut package in address  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Saying business tax incentives spur economic growth,
Gov. George Pataki on Tuesday proposed more than $700 million in new business
tax cuts that he says will equal $2.3 billion in tax savings by April 2001.
<P>
	   Pataki said his plan puts "in place new job-creating tax cuts to spur
economic growth across the state, particularly in upstate communities."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki wants to eliminate the gross receipts tax on energy, give a new tax
credit to spur job growth in cities, give new tax cuts for farmers and
environmentally-friendly companies, create upstate "high-tech" enterprise zones,
expand low-cost power for businesses and to cut taxes for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now have more private-sector jobs upstate than ever before in history
but we must do even more to create jobs and opportunities for the people of New
York," Pataki said. "This job-creating plan will ensure that every corner of New
York shares fully in our economic revival."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will outline more of his plan in Wednesday's State of the State
address at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP governor called the elimination of all gross receipt taxes on energy
for businesses and residences as the most important component of his plan. When
fully effective, that proposal would provide $500 million in tax savings
statewide for businesses and industries, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Legislature must approve Pataki's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Republicans also proposed the elimination of the "onerous"
gross receipts tax on energy last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elimination of the GRT is critical to maintaining New York's unrivaled
economic resurgence, especially upstate where business and industry accounts for
the major portion of this tax paid to the state through higher electric and gas
bills," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for comment on Pataki's proposal
were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's plan got good reviews from the state Business Council. "This gives
us good reason to hope that the GRT will be eliminated," council spokesman
Robert Ward said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other parts of Pataki's plan include:
</P>
<P>
	   - Expanding the Power for Jobs program to give businesses an extra $20
million in savings. Power for Jobs was conceived as a way of providing
lower-cost electricity to businesses and groups which say they need the cost
savings to create or maintain jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   - Creating upstate high technology enterprise zones, which are supposed to
promote high technology economic development in upstate areas where employment
growth is below the statewide average, and upstate urban job creation tax
credits, which provides a tax credit of as much as $1,000 per job for employers
who either open new companies or expand existing businesses that create a
minimum of 25 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   - Reducing small business corporate franchise tax rates from 7.5 percent to
6.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   - Allowing farmers whose homes are part of their incorporated farming
businesses to take advantage of the school tax relief or STAR tax rebate
program. That would save farmers about $1 million annually after going into
effect in the 2000-01 school year, Pataki said.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Bradley delves into some issues but passes others by  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - As a U.S. senator, Bill Bradley immersed himself in
some issues but seemed unmoved by others, a record that offers clues to what
kind of president he would be, a panel of experts said Tuesday.
<P>
	   Three congressional colleagues of Bradley, a former aide and two reporters
who covered him painted an image of a legislator willing to roll up his sleeves
and get his hands dirty - so long as a bill or a cause appealed to him.
</P>
<P>
	   "He gets deeply involved in the key issues that he wants to get done," said
Marcia Aronoff, Bradley's chief of staff in the Senate from 1978 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who left the Senate in 1997 after three terms, was the topic of the
day at the American Enterprise Institute, which launched a series of seminars on
how presidential candidates would govern if elected. A similar seminar on
Republican John McCain is scheduled for Thursday. Democrat Al Gore and
Republican George W. Bush are on the agenda next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The discussion of Bradley at times resembled the arguments of the Gore
campaign, which regularly charges that the former New Jersey senator views
politics as a lofty academic exercise rather than a day-by-day fight. In New
Hampshire this week, Gore said Bradley "seems to believe America can address
only one thing at a time."
</P>
<P>
	   Former Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., called Bradley "bright as a star" but
wondered whether a President Bradley "would have a tough time bending to
negotiate deals."
</P>
<P>
	   Defending Bradley, former Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., said only the
less thoughtful members of Congress are "into everything."
</P>
<P>
	   Durenberger did, however, question why Bradley, as a senator, pressed for
votes on pet issues when he knew he would lose badly.
</P>
<P>
	   "He'd walk out (to the Senate floor) and do something that at least half of
us thought ought to get done, but it wasn't the right time or place to do it,"
Durenberger said. "We'd sit there and say, 'Oh my god, why does he have to do
it?' And you'd end up going down and voting against your friend on an issue you
probably cared about because it just wasn't appropriate timing."
</P>
<P>
	   Aronoff replied that Bradley believes that if you always wait for the right
moment, "you'll never start."
</P>
<P>
	   Both Rostenkowski, who supports Gore, and Miller, who supports Bradley,
painted a sympathetic picture of Bradley as a senator who stuck tenaciously to
his fights once he picked them.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller said Bradley chose to take on "the most contentious issue in the
history of California" when he proposed new ways to allocate water resources in
the state. Miller said he learned from that fight that Bradley has "incredible
fortitude to hang in there when the incoming fire starts."
</P>
<P>
	   Rostenkowski recalled working with Bradley to help produce the Tax Reform
Act of 1986, which began years earlier as a proposal by Bradley and Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gephardt faded away, but Bradley was still there," Rostenkowski said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Murray, Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal and author
of a book on the 1986 tax reform, said Bradley astutely recognized a chance to
match Republican demands for lower tax rates with Democrats' demands for fewer
loopholes.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a unique opportunity. He saw it; he saw it alone," Murray said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Goodman, longtime political reporter for The Times of Trenton, was asked
why so few leading Democrats in New Jersey have endorsed Bradley. Goodman said
Bradley's departure from the Senate - and his lament about politics being
"broken" - caused hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was an emotional assault on Democrats in New Jersey, the Democratic
leadership," Goodman said. "He was telling them they were in the wrong business,
almost."

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Y2K Hindered Sky Spy Data  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Department said Tuesday it suffered only one
notable Y2K computer breakdown: the loss for several hours on New Year's Eve of
a ground station that processes information from spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   Even that proved to be of no military consequence, senior officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a significant event, but fortunately it had insignificant
consequences,'' John Hamre, the deputy secretary of defense, told a news
conference. He declared the Pentagon's Y2K preparations a success and defended
the $3.6 billion computer fixes as a necessary and prudent investment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had no problems with any of our forces deployed anywhere,'' Hamre said.
</P>
<P>
	   The only significant problem, he said, was the loss for several hours Friday
evening of a computer system used to process data from a group of reconnaissance
satellites. After a back-up system was put to use shortly before midnight EST,
more than half of the incoming satellite data could be processed, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some data was lost but at no time was U.S. national security in jeopardy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing secrecy rules, Hamre declined to reveal more details. He said the
normal system was back on line by Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre said this marked the first time the Pentagon has ever publicly
acknowledged a breakdown in the spy satellite system it uses to keep watch on
the world. Satellite operations are among the closest kept secrets; for many
years even the name of the agency that manages them -- the National
Reconnaissance Office -- was a secret.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre said the problem was reported this time because it was caused by a Y2K
bug and the Clinton administration had committed itself to being open about
problems caused by the year-end rollover.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday evening, after the satellite system broke down, Pentagon officials
repeatedly told reporters the military had experienced no Y2K-related computer
problems anywhere in the world. Hamre said this was because he and others in the
Pentagon did not learn about the satellite problem until later.
</P>
<P>
	   In any case, he said, the loss of satellite data processing would not have
been reported publicly until a backup system was operating, in order not to
reveal the vulnerability to potential adversaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre said another source of Y2K concern among Pentagon officials -- a
potential rash of New Year's Eve cyberattacks by hackers -- did not materialize.
He said technicians who monitor Defense Department Internet web sites ``pulled
the plug'' on four suspected hackers -- fewer than normal during a weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Evidently the lonely hearts out there in cyberland had something else to
do and weren't just banging on us all night,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel To Quit 5 Pct. of West Bank  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Clearing the air for crucial talks on a final peace
treaty, Israel and the Palestinians ended weeks of deadlock Tuesday and signed
an agreement that will pull Israeli troops out of 5 percent of the West Bank
before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This arrangement will go into effect within 48 hours,'' said the Israeli
army statement announcing the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal, originally due Nov. 15, had been held up because the two
sides disagreed over whether Israel alone can determine what areas to hand over.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement was signed by Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon for the Israelis and Maj.
Gen. Haji Ismail for the Palestinians. Yaalon is the central commander, which
includes the West Bank, and Ismail commands Palestinian police forces in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   They signed it in an undisclosed location, apparently to avoid Jewish
settler demonstrators. A group of settler protesters was wandering among major
Tel Aviv hotels on Tuesday night, following rumors that the negotiators were
meeting at a Tel Aviv location.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the compromise reached Tuesday, the withdrawal will be carried out as
originally planned by Israel, while Israel will be open to Palestinian requests
in sketching the map for the next Israeli withdrawal, from 6.1 percent of the
West Bank on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   A Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Palestinians would have a say in the January pullback, while the chief Israeli
negotiator, Oded Eran, said Israel only promised to listen to Palestinian
requests.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had rejected the Nov. 15 withdrawal because
the areas offered by Israel were too sparsely populated and did not connect
lands already under Palestinian control. Arafat demanded to be given West Bank
neighborhoods close to east Jerusalem, the sector he seeks as a future capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran denied Tuesday that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised Arafat
that the Palestinians would get control over one or more of those neighborhoods
-- Abu Dis, Ram, Izzarieh -- in the January withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   The pullbacks were stipulated in a September interim peace agreement.
Tuesday's compromise, reached by Eran and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb
Erekat, clears the air as the two sides try to meet a Feb. 13 deadline for
formulating the framework for a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran has been meeting daily with Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo in
so-called final status talks, with negotiations often lasting late into the
night, said a senior Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Complex issues are on the table, including the status of Jerusalem, the
final borders of the Palestinian entity, the fate of Palestinian refugees and
the future of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides are still far apart on all issues. For example, the
Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as east
Jerusalem, for their state, while Israel wants to keep all of Jerusalem and
nearly half the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran said some progress has been made and that he was optimistic the
framework could be reached, if not in mid-February, then a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said it was ``too early to judge.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Arafat's planned meeting with President Clinton in Washington on
Jan. 20 would be crucial. ``In this meeting, it will become clear if we can
reach an agreement,'' Abourdeneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   The upcoming West Bank troop pullback will be carried out by Thursday, the
eve of Eid al-Fitr, the three-day Muslim holiday that marks the end of the
fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel will hand 2 percent of the West Bank around the town of Ramallah to
full Palestinian control. An additional 3 percent near the towns of Nablus,
Jenin and Hebron will go from sole Israeli jurisdiction to shared rule.

<HEADLINE> French Cave Dweller Marks Y2K Late  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) -- Like many Frenchmen, Michel Siffre rang in the
new millennium with a traditional meal of foie gras, white wine and champagne.
Except he did it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Siffre, a cave explorer who has been isolated underground with no watch for
more than a month, celebrated the New Year at 3:03 p.m. local time Tuesday --
more than 3 1/2 days late.
</P>
<P>
	   The explorer descended 2,970 feet on Nov. 30 and is spending two months in
the Clamousse grotto in southern France to help study sleep patterns.
</P>
<P>
	   Siffre tells researchers what day he thinks it is so they can study his
sleep cycles and his notion of time. Naps have thrown off his day count -- he
celebrated Christmas on Dec. 27 and does not realize that Monday was his 61st
birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   Electrodes attached to his body allow scientists from the National Institute
of Space Studies to take measurements that will be useful for future space
expeditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Siffre, who spends his time reading novels and scientific journals, said he
wished he could have spent New Year's with his family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It hasn't been a good day for me. Not terrible, but I don't feel that
good,'' Siffre said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1972, Siffre spent more than six months at the bottom of Midnight Cave in
Del Rio, Texas.

<HEADLINE> 713 lost their lives in NJ highways in 1999, a 20-year low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Traffic deaths on New Jersey highways fell to a
20-year low of 713 during 1999, according to preliminary statistics released by
the State Police.
<P>
	   The State Police also released figures for the New Year's weekend,
indicating two people lost their lives on state roads.
</P>
<P>
	   State Police spokesman John Hagerty said Tuesday that the 1999 total is the
lowest since the state began keeping statewide statistics in 1979. The figure is
3.8 percent lower than the 741 traffic deaths recorded in 1998, which was the
previous low. The highest number of fatalities was 1,160, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Hagerty cautioned that the figures are preliminary. Some people injured in
traffic accidents from 1999 might die from their injuries and would then be
included in the statistics, he said. Also, State Police will review records to
make sure local police department reports follow the standard for traffic
accident deaths. For example, someone who died of a heart attack at the wheel
would not be included, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Usually it takes about four months to get the final figure, but it usually
only goes up or down by a few," Hagerty said. "This is in the ballpark."
</P>
<P>
	   The 1998 and 1999 figures were recorded during years when New Jersey had
instituted a 65 mph speed limit on 475 miles of highways. The higher speed limit
went into effect in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Studies by several newspapers showed traffic fatalities within the 65 mph
zones rose during the first year of the new speed limit. However, experts also
say it is difficult to draw any conclusions without more intensive review about
the circumstances of the accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Hagerty said the State Police and the Department of Transportation will
release a study on the safety of the 65 mph speed limit in March.
</P>
<P>
	   "These statistics can't be used in any way to measure the 65 mph speed
limit's effectiveness," Hagerty said. "From these statistics, we don't know
where the accidents occurred, and we haven't measured the factors behind the
accidents."
</P>
<P>
	   The Y2K weekend traffic death total was down sharply from last year's total
of 11 New Year's weekend deaths. However, because New Year's Day fell on a
Saturday, the State Police considered this a 54-hour holiday weekend, as
compared to a 102-hour long holiday weekend a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Hagerty said added State Police patrols may have contributed to the lower
New Year's fatality rate. The number of troopers on the highways was tripled
over the weekend. Hagerty also noted that highway traffic was generally light,
as many people preferred to celebrate the turn of the century at home.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Returns to Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- With a procedural hang-up overcome, President
Clinton re-entered peacemaking talks between Israel and Syria today, hoping to
set the two long-time foes on a course to a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton met today with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in a three-way session like one that was scratched
Monday night in a wrangle over which issues should be negotiated first in this
new round of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin declined to say how the dispute
was smoothed over after a solution was finalized at a meeting between Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got a good start yesterday,'' Rubin said. ``There was a procedural
hang-up in the evening. That hang-up has been overcome.''
</P>
<P>
	   With a light rain falling on the oldest town in West Virginia, where talks
are being held at an off-limits federal center, Clinton left Washington in a
motorcade for a second consecutive day of mediating between Barak and al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said committees had been formed to take up all key issues, and none
would be overlooked by the two sides. He included terms of the peace Syria is
offering in return for the strategic Golan Heights, a border plateau Israel has
held since 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Discussions on all the issues, in one form or another, will be held over the
next few days, he told reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   But even with the positive turn of events, Rubin repeated his admonition
that a core agreement on an Israeli pullback, a peace accord, new security
arrangement and other knotty issues, is unlikely to emerge at the end of this
round, the second since Israel and Syria abandoned their peacemaking efforts in
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they're both very serious,'' Clinton said in announcing he would
return to the negotiations. ``They both want an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The agenda disagreement between the two sides apparently centered on the
timing of discussions on an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights -- at the
beginning of the talks, as Syria wanted, or at the end, which Israel preferred.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said in an interview with Israel Radio
that Barak wanted to resume the talks where they broke off more than three years
ago -- ``on issue of security because the scope of a withdrawal depends on what
we will receive in return.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Syria insisted on first taking up the withdrawal issue -- how much land
Israel would yield and the timetable for the pullback, according to Israeli and
Syrian sources.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said that if the priorities issue
was resolved, the committees handling security, water rights, borders and the
normalization would meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a White House ceremony announcing his nomination of Alan
Greenspan to a fourth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Clinton said
today, ``I wish I could have so much success in the Middle East peace talks. I
just ask them and they say yes the way Mr. Greenspan did. It would be joy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said it was ``partly my decision'' not to have a three-way meeting
with Barak and al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're looking at now up in West Virginia is sort of figuring out what
the process for the next few days is going to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he wasn't in a position to talk about the cost to the United States
of any peace agreement, but that there would be consultations with Congress. ``I
believe Americans of all political parties and all stripes desperately want to
see a comprehensive peace in the Middle East,'' he said. ``I'm quite hopeful
about that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nine vans carrying orthodox Jews gathered in Shepherdstown today to protest
a proposed Israeli turnover of the Golan Heights. Though the vans bore New York
license plates, organizers said the protesters were from all over.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, meantime, Israel and the Palestinians broke a deadlock by
agreeing today on an Israeli troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West Bank by
Thursday. Israel will pull back Jan. 20 from an additional 6.1 percent, as
scheduled, under an interim peace accord reached in September.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement reached today by the negotiators, Saeb Erekat for the
Palestinians and Oded Eran for the Israelis, improves the atmosphere of talks
toward reaching a final peace treaty. The two sides have set a Feb. 13 deadline
for agreement on a framework for the final treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The Syrian government-controlled media cautioned that failure to make
progress in the West Virginia talks could result in a ``deep freeze.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless there is a breakthrough very soon, the whole process for making
peace will come to a dangerous recess,'' the English-language Syria Times wrote.
``Until the Israelis summon the courage to move forward, no real breakthrough is
likely to occur.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said, ``The procedure and the
substance are wrapped together at this stage in the discussion. They have not
agreed on a work plan yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Little in the way of news is seeping out. But Lockhart and Rubin said the
two sides were getting into the knotty issues.
</P>
<P>
	   That means how much land Barak is willing to relinquish, the nature of the
peace Syria would commit itself to in return and also the extent of U.S.
involvement in maintaining security along a new border between the two old foes.
</P>
<P>
	   The price tag could be high. Lockhart said informal soundings already were
being taken in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   New security arrangements would be needed to replace the Golan Heights, the
strategic buffer that has shielded Israel since Syria lost the high ground in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 18,000 Jews who live there may have to be relocated, as their farms,
light industries and wineries are abandoned.
</P>
<P>
	   There also has been speculation U.S. troops would be used to help keep the
peace -- an option the administration has not confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between the two countries broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Talks reopened briefly last month in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Pataki to propose $700 million business tax cut package in address  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Saying business tax incentives spur economic growth,
Gov. George Pataki on Tuesday proposed more than $700 million in new business
tax cuts that he says will equal $2.3 billion in tax savings by April 2001 when
added to previous tax cuts.
<P>
	   Pataki said his plan puts "in place new job-creating tax cuts to spur
economic growth across the state, particularly in upstate communities."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki wants to eliminate the gross receipts tax on energy, give a new tax
credit to spur job growth in cities, give new tax cuts for farmers and
environmentally-friendly companies, create upstate "high-tech" enterprise zones,
expand low-cost power for businesses and to cut taxes for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now have more private-sector jobs upstate than ever before in history
but we must do even more to create jobs and opportunities for the people of New
York," Pataki said. "This job-creating plan will ensure that every corner of New
York shares fully in our economic revival."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will outline more of his plan in Wednesday's State of the State
address at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP governor called the elimination of all gross receipt taxes on energy
for businesses and residences as the most important component of his plan. When
fully effective, that proposal would provide $500 million in tax savings
statewide for businesses and industries, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Legislature must approve Pataki's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Republicans also proposed the elimination of the "onerous"
gross receipts tax on energy last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elimination of the GRT is critical to maintaining New York's unrivaled
economic resurgence, especially upstate where business and industry accounts for
the major portion of this tax paid to the state through higher electric and gas
bills," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for comment on Pataki's proposal
were not immediately returned. Silver will give the Democrats' response to
Pataki after the State of the State address Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's plan got good reviews from the state Business Council. "This gives
us good reason to hope that the GRT will be eliminated," council spokesman
Robert Ward said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other parts of Pataki's plan include:
</P>
<P>
	   - Expanding the Power for Jobs program to give businesses an extra $20
million in savings. Power for Jobs was conceived as a way of providing
lower-cost electricity to businesses and groups which say they need the cost
savings to create or maintain jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   - Creating upstate high technology enterprise zones, which are supposed to
promote high technology economic development in upstate areas where employment
growth is below the statewide average, and upstate urban job creation tax
credits, which provides a tax credit of as much as $1,000 per job for employers
who either open new companies or expand existing businesses that create a
minimum of 25 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   - Reducing small business corporate franchise tax rates from 7.5 percent to
6.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   - Allowing farmers whose homes are part of their incorporated farming
businesses to take advantage of the school tax relief or STAR tax rebate
program. That would save farmers about $1 million annually after going into
effect in the 2000-01 school year, Pataki said.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Practitioners Studied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Patients who have asthma, diabetes or high blood pressure
and receive their primary care from nurse practitioners fare just as well as
those treated by doctors, a study suggests.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers randomly assigned 1,316 such patients to either nurse
practitioners or doctors. After six months, patients in the two groups got equal
benefit medically and were just as satisfied.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is unclear whether the findings -- involving mostly poor immigrants
-- are representative of the population at large or whether the results would be
the same over longer periods, when more complex medical problems might arise,
said an expert not involved in the research.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings were published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with advanced, specialized
training. They are licensed in all 50 states and can write prescriptions in all
50, though four -- Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Ohio -- require a doctor
to co-sign the order.
</P>
<P>
	   About 65,000 nurse practitioners work in this country. Proponents say their
training places greater emphasis on disease prevention, risk reduction and
empowering patients to care for themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   "This study adds strong science to earlier studies that suggest nurse
practitioners are high quality, competent providers of primary care who can
achieve the same health outcomes physicians can," said the lead author, Mary O.
Mundinger, professor of health policy and dean of the Columbia University School
of Nursing in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   She said more than 100 studies had been conducted over the past 30 years
measuring nurse practitioner competence among patients from all walks of life,
in all parts of the United States and with all age groups, including children.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the context of all those other studies, this strongly suggests that
nurse practitioners with other populations will do just as well," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers found the nurse-practitioner patients fared as well
medically -- measured by breathing capacity in asthmatics, blood-sugar control
in diabetics and blood pressure in people with hypertension -- as the doctors'
patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The two groups also had similar rates of referrals to specialists,
hospitalizations and costs, and they were equally satisfied with caregivers, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
	   "This study is a remarkable accomplishment, the most ambitious and
well-executed comparison of nurse practitioners with physicians," an expert not
involved in the work, Dr. Harold C. Sox of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in
Lebanon, N.H., said in an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sox noted that the patients were a select population -- they were
younger, mostly female, Spanish-speaking and on Medicaid -- and that a six-month
study may not have been long enough to see the full spectrum of complex medical
problems such patients could face.
</P>
<P>
	   Participants were recruited from Columbia-affiliated emergency rooms in New
York while being treated for problems other than asthma, diabetes or high blood
pressure.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Recovering From Floods  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- There's still hardly any drinking water, no
schools, no transportation and little security in the area worst hit by killer
floods in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   Three weeks after the devastation, officials are still evacuating thousands
of people living in high-risk areas, and efforts to relocate survivors are far
from complete.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuela can expect a long and arduous road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials estimate that between 5,000 and 30,000 people were killed by the
avalanche of water, mud, boulders and trees that on Dec. 15 came roaring down
the mountain that separates Caracas from the Caribbean Sea to the north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It wasn't just a regular rain. It was as if the entire mountainside rained
down on us,'' Jesuit priest Jose Virtuoso said Tuesday. His religious order
works in a Caracas slum where the mudslide sent huge trees flying through the
neighborhood ``like torpedoes.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the worst hit area -- Vargas state along the Caribbean coast -- hardship
is now a way of life.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents line up at fire stations to fill jugs with water, dust from
streets covered with dried mud chokes the air, and rotting garbage and corpses
emit putrid smells. Elite troops march through affluent neighborhoods that are
now ghost towns to curb looting.
</P>
<P>
	   Most schools were either damaged or destroyed, and those still standing are
being used to shelter the homeless. Authorities are still bulldozing their way
through roads to reach some of the most remote towns.
</P>
<P>
	   The international airport has resumed international flights, but domestic
flights remain suspended. La Guaira, Venezuela's main port, may reopen within a
week, Vargas Gov. Alfred Laya said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people have refused to abandon the disaster zone, saying they
don't want to live in shelters. But on Monday authorities started to evacuate an
estimated 2,500 people from houses located in the most high-risk areas of Vargas
and Caracas.
</P>
<P>
	   Angel Rangel, the national civil defense director, said some residents were
resisting and might have to be forced out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We prefer to have 5,000 people unhappy with us than to have to come to
look for 5,000 cadavers,'' he told Globovision on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   More rain in recent days has triggered concerns that some houses -- shacks
perched precariously on mountainsides -- could collapse. In the western border
state of Tachira, flooding on Monday destroyed the homes of 200 people, forced
the international airport to shut down and prompted the declaration of a state
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel said the rains are especially dangerous now because the ground is
already saturated. ``A rainfall of 30 millimeters today is the equivalent of
rains ten times that amount a month ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the estimated 150,000 people left homeless by the floods are still
living in schools, military bases and stadiums turned into shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is rushing to build new housing, mainly in rural areas as
part of President Hugo Chavez's plan to move millions of people from teeming
cities to the countryside. But most of the homes won't be ready for months.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill for the cleanup and reconstruction effort will be painful for a
government already saddled with a $3 billion fiscal deficit and an economy that
shrank by a staggering 7.2 percent last year. Experts say the mudslides caused
as much as $15 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Vargas state, which was a booming weekend beach resort for hundreds of
thousands of Caracas residents, probably will need years to fully recover.
Still, Gov. Laya said he thinks some Caribbean beaches could be reopened by the
Carnival holidays in early March -- a thought some find morbid, since the bodies
of many victims were washed out to sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Venezuelans still don't know the fate of their loved ones. Truck driver
Reinaldo Figueroa, 34, and his brothers have spent days shoveling through mud
that smothered the house of their uncle, a police officer who lived in a Caracas
slum and hasn't been seen since the disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He may or may not be here, but we're his family and we have to keep
looking,'' Figueroa said.

<HEADLINE> Unions win rally site near Capitol after dispute with police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Two of the state's biggest labor unions will
demonstrate outside the state Capitol Wednesday during Gov. George Pataki's
State of the State address - but only after a last-minute dispute.
<P>
	   Leaders of the Civil Service Employees Association and Public Employees
Federation who planned to shout protests throughout the speech complained that
the state Monday yanked permission to rally in front of the Capitol. State
police ordered the rally moved to the state Museum, at the opposite end of the
sprawling Empire State Plaza from the Capitol, for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The unions threatened legal action Tuesday, then arrived at a compromise
with the state. As many as 20,000 state workers will protest across the street
from the Capitol on the deck of the Empire State Plaza.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the two unions have just entered their tenth month without a
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   "The question is being asked whether the governor will hear us," said the
CSEA spokesman Stephen Madarasz. "I think the governor has already heard us. The
question is what he will do about it."
</P>
<P>
	   CSEA President Danny Donahue and PEF President Roger Benson said 8,000 to
10,000 union members from across the state are expected to meet Wednesday
morning at the downtown Pepsi Arena, a couple blocks from the Capitol. Another
12,000 members who work downtown have been encouraged to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue said state officials have been told for more than a month that "tens
of thousands" of members are expected at the rally. But he said the state may
have been surprised by an estimate of 20,000 protesters carried in a report on
the planned rally last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the governor wasn't immediately available for comment. Last
week, Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon called the demonstration a "campaign
rally" for Donohue, who is facing a challenge for re-election this winter.
McKeon accused the union of closing down negotiations until the CSEA election
was resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki himself said last week that state employees have been treated fairly
by his negotiators and that the state has made "solid" offers to both unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Union members have been working without a contract since April 1. Benson's
union represents 53,000 professional and scientific workers. The Civil Service
Employees Association has about 77,000 mostly blue-collar state workers.

<HEADLINE> Santana Leads Grammy Nominees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Carlos Santana, whose career caught fire when
he gave a scorching performance at Woodstock in 1969, received 10 Grammy
nominations Tuesday for his commercial comeback album, "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old guitarist, who previously had received just five nominations
overall, led all nominees for the 42nd annual Grammys.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernatural," Santana's best-selling collaboration with such stars as Eric
Clapton and Lauryn Hill, was nominated for best album and rock album.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana was also nominated for record of the year for "Smooth," which
featured Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20. "Smooth" and Santana's "Love of My Life"
with Dave Matthews accounted for two of the five nominees for pop vocal
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've heard that the way the music rules apply, only 17 to 27 years old is
cool. Well, surprise," Santana said. "You know, there's a reason why teen-agers
listen to '60s music, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Santana: They need to
pass through us to get to their thing."
</P>
<P>
	   In pop music categories, the group TLC was second with six nominations for
the album "FanMail."
</P>
<P>
	   "I was really shocked," TLC member Chilli said. "I can't wait to call my
group members because they have no idea."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides album of the year, TLC's nominations included best rhythm and blues
album, record of the year for "No Scrubs," and pop vocal performance by a duo or
group for "Unpretty."
</P>
<P>
	   Classical conductor Pierre Boulez also received six nominations. Other
multiple nominees included Asleep at the Wheel with five, and the Backstreet
Boys, Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, Hill and Whitney Houston, all with four
apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   The best new artist nominees were Christina Aguilera, Macy Gray, Kid Rock,
Britney Spears and Susan Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Santana's "Smooth," other nominees for record of the year were "I
Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys, "Believe" by Cher, "Livin' La Vida
Loca" by Ricky Martin and "No Scrubs" by TLC.
</P>
<P>
	   The other album of the year nominees were "Millennium" by Backstreet Boys,
"Fly" by the Dixie Chicks and "When I Look in Your Eyes" by Diana Krall.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, whose only Grammy win is a rock instrumental award in 1988, also
picked up nominations for pop instrumental for "El Farol," pop vocal performance
by a duo or group for "Maria Maria" and rock instrumental for "The Calling," a
collaboration with Clapton.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana has put out 29 albums over 30 years, but it has been many years
since he has had a major commercial success. He said that the nominations
Tuesday were gratifying but that he had never felt slighted.
</P>
<P>
	   "Things come when they come," Santana said. "I always felt my reward was for
Miles Davis to call my house, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Buddy Guy, B.B.
King. When people like these call my house, those are my Grammys, my Oscars, my
Emmys, my Tonys. I know I'm connected with some of the very, very important
people on the planet."
</P>
<P>
	   The Grammys will be awarded Feb. 23 in a CBS broadcast from the Staples
Center in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Returns to Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- A procedural hang-up resolved, President Clinton
brought together Israel's prime minister and the foreign minister of Syria for
face-to-face negotiations Tuesday aimed at setting their countries on a course
toward peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton held a half-hour meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak before
including Syria's Farouk al-Sharaa in the meeting. A similar three-way session
was canceled Monday night in a wrangle over what should be negotiated first.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they're both very serious,'' Clinton said before leaving
Washington. ``They both want an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said it was unlikely an
accord can be reached by the end of the week on peace terms, an Israeli pullback
on the Golan Heights and new security arrangements on the Israel-Syria border.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the first time in almost four years that Israel and Syria have met
to deal with issues of substance. Having Barak and al-Sharaa talk about them
face-to-face, under Clinton's auspices, gives new meaning to the decades-old
U.S. drive to gain Arab recognition of the Jewish state in exchange for
Israeli-held territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin would not say how Monday night's dispute was smoothed over during a
meeting between Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got a good start yesterday,'' Rubin said. ``There was a procedural
hang-up in the evening. That hang-up has been overcome.''
</P>
<P>
	   With a light rain falling on the oldest town in West Virginia, where talks
are being held at a federal center off-limits to reporters, Clinton arrived from
Washington in a motorcade for his second consecutive day of mediating with Barak
and al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   The second day of talks also brought out protesters from Brooklyn, N.Y. --
about 40 of them, led by Orthodox Jews who oppose the proposed Israeli turnover
of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Golan is our security,'' said protest leader Levi Huebner. ``Peace
will be in security and trust in our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, 20 rabbis linked to the Jewish settlement movement ruled that the
Golan Heights are part of biblical Israel and that Israeli communities cannot be
removed from the territory.
</P>
<P>
	   While Israel's secular majority does not follow rabbinical strictures, the
ruling may make it more difficult for Barak to get a land-for-peace agreement
approved in a national referendum. It is expected that as part of such an
agreement, the 17,000 Israelis living in 33 communities would be forced to
leave.
</P>
<P>
	   In Damascus, meanwhile, the state-run Syria Times said a ``deep freeze''
could follow if the West Virginia talks are not successful.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless there is a breakthrough very soon, the whole process for making
peace will come to a dangerous recess,'' the English-language daily said.
``Until the Israelis summon the courage to move forward, no real breakthrough is
likely to occur.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said committees had been formed to take up all key issues, and that
none would be overlooked by the two sides. He included terms of the peace Syria
is offering in return for the strategic Golan Heights, a border plateau Israel
has held since the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
	   Having swapped the Sinai for little more than a diplomatically correct peace
treaty in 1979 with Egypt, Israel is looking for more than simply recognition
from Syria, with which it has fought three wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Its aim is an exchange of ambassadors, commercial ties and the kind of
acceptance the Arabs have been reluctant to extend to Israel since its creation
52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday night's procedural dispute centered on Israel's demand to take up
peace terms and security first, and Syria's to deal first with an Israeli
pullback from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon, speaking on Israeli Army radio, accused
the Syrians of reneging on an understanding that talks begin where they left off
nearly four years ago, with discussion of peace terms and security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was with the concurrence of the Americans and the Syrians. It was
clear,'' Ramon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are embarking on tough, problematical negotiations, in which we say to
the other side if you break agreements there will be no negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said, meanwhile, the hurdle was
overcome with an American proposal that the committees meet simultaneously.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, he told The Associated Press the committees
were assigned to deal with border demarcation, water, security and normalization
of relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who has made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000, has
signaled that he is available all week long to assist, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a White House ceremony announcing his nomination of Alan
Greenspan to a fourth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Clinton said: ``I
wish I could have so much success in the Middle East peace talks. I just ask
them and they say yes, the way Mr. Greenspan did. It would be joy.''

<HEADLINE> Syria Arrests Anti-Peace Activists  </HEADLINE>
   By SALAH NASRAWI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Syrian authorities arrested hundreds of Islamic and
leftist radicals in an apparent crackdown on opponents of peace talks with
Israel, a major newspaper and an Islamic leader reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The London-based Al Hayat newspaper said the arrests of Islamic radicals
occurred in early December, just before the first round of Syria-Israel talks in
the United States. A gunfight broke out during the arrests and at least one
officer and two servicemen were killed, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   No comment was immediately available from the Syrian government. Al Hayat
was not on newsstands where it is normally available in the Syrian capital
Tuesday. There was no explanation for the newspaper's absence in the country,
where the media is carefully controlled by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   With the U.S.-brokered talks reportedly under strain, Syria also stepped up
pressure on Israel. A state-run newspaper warned of a ``deep freeze'' if there
is no quick progress in the round of talks in their second day Tuesday in West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless there is a breakthrough very soon, the whole process for making
peace will come to a dangerous recess,'' the English-language Syria Times daily
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Omer Bakri, head of a London-based umbrella group of several exiled Muslim
organizations, told The Associated Press the arrests had occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrests were made because the Syrian government wants to ``smash the
Islamic movement,'' Bakri, the leader of the Mouhajireen Movement, said in a
telephone interview from London, where he is based.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Syria has to pay a price for its deal with Israel and ``the heads of
the Islamic movements in Syria and Lebanon are part of that price.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Hayat quoted unidentified Arab sources as saying that the crackdown was
launched as a precaution against possible protests against the talks. Some of
those arrested included Palestinian radicals based in Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Tahrir Islamic Party said on its Web site that some 60 of
its members were arrested on Nov. 13 in Homs, a city in northern Syria. The
party said Syrian forces made similar arrests in neighboring Lebanon a day
later. The party wants to establish Islamic rule across the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   Animosity toward Israel is high in Syria, fed by the memories of the 1967
Middle East war, the discontent of thousands of Palestinian refugees who live in
Syria and by government rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
	   The Syrian government has remained suspicious of Israel in its official
media and backed an anti-Israel protest Monday to coincide with the opening of
the second round of talks. But the government also has used its media recently
to express hope that the talks will be successful, and it will have to prepare
its citizens for a new relationship with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the underground Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic group which has
been crushed in Syria but has members abroad, denounced the renewed
Syrian-Israeli peace talks. The group said the Palestinian cause should be the
priority, not Syria's efforts to regain the Golan Heights, which Israeli
occupied in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Syrians remain hopeful.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything can be solved ... I don't think there is any problem that
cannot be overcome by Syrian and Israeli negotiators as long as the will is
there,'' said Abboud Sarraj, a political analyst and dean of the law faculty at
Damascus University.

<HEADLINE> Troops To Leave Parts of West Bank  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Clearing the air for crucial talks on a final peace
treaty, Israel and the Palestinians ended weeks of deadlock Tuesday and signed
an agreement that will pull Israeli troops out of 5 percent of the West Bank
before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This arrangement will go into effect within 48 hours,'' said the Israeli
army statement announcing the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal, originally due Nov. 15, had been held up because the two
sides disagreed over whether Israel alone can determine what areas to hand over.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement was signed by Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon for the Israelis and Maj.
Gen. Haj Ismail Jabr for the Palestinians. Yaalon is the central commander,
which includes the West Bank, and Ismail commands Palestinian police forces in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   They signed it in an undisclosed location, apparently to avoid Jewish
settler demonstrators. A group of settler protesters was wandering among major
Tel Aviv hotels on Tuesday night, following rumors that the negotiators were
meeting at a Tel Aviv location.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the compromise reached Tuesday, the withdrawal will be carried out as
originally planned by Israel, while Israel will be open to Palestinian requests
in sketching the map for the next Israeli withdrawal, from 6.1 percent of the
West Bank on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   A Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Palestinians would have a say in the January pullback, while the chief Israeli
negotiator, Oded Eran, said Israel only promised to listen to Palestinian
requests.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had rejected the Nov. 15 withdrawal because
the areas offered by Israel were too sparsely populated and did not connect
lands already under Palestinian control. Arafat demanded to be given West Bank
neighborhoods close to east Jerusalem, the sector he seeks as a future capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran denied Tuesday that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised Arafat
that the Palestinians would get control over one or more of those neighborhoods
-- Abu Dis, Ram, Izzarieh -- in the January withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   The pullbacks were stipulated in a September interim peace agreement.
Tuesday's compromise, reached by Eran and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb
Erekat, clears the air as the two sides try to meet a Feb. 13 deadline for
formulating the framework for a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran has been meeting daily with Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo in
so-called final status talks, with negotiations often lasting late into the
night, said a senior Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Complex issues are on the table, including the status of Jerusalem, the
final borders of the Palestinian entity, the fate of Palestinian refugees and
the future of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides are still far apart on all issues. For example, the
Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as east
Jerusalem, for their state, while Israel wants to keep all of Jerusalem and
nearly half the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran said some progress has been made and that he was optimistic the
framework could be reached, if not in mid-February, then a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said it was ``too early to judge.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Arafat's planned meeting with President Clinton in Washington on
Jan. 20 would be crucial. ``In this meeting, it will become clear if we can
reach an agreement,'' Abourdeneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   The upcoming West Bank troop pullback will be carried out by Thursday, the
eve of Eid al-Fitr, the three-day Muslim holiday that marks the end of the
fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel will hand 2 percent of the West Bank around the town of Ramallah to
full Palestinian control. An additional 3 percent near the towns of Nablus,
Jenin and Hebron will go from sole Israeli jurisdiction to shared rule.

<HEADLINE> Peterson released after serving 18 months for death of newborn son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WYCKOFF, N.J. (AP) - A young man went home to his parents on Tuesday
after serving an 18-month prison sentence for killing his newborn son.
<P>
	   A thin, pale Brian Peterson hugged his lawyer and visited his pets after his
release from the Webb Correctional Facility in Price's Corner, Del. He later
stood in the front yard of his parents' home and read a statement apologizing
"for my part in the tragic events that occurred three years ago."
</P>
<P>
	   He thanked people who supported him and said, "I can assure everyone that I
will reward their confidence in me and make them proud of me in the future."
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson, who had been a freshman at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania,
plans to try to enroll in college again and to begin the 300 hours of community
service that is a requirement of his two-year probation, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   What the 21-year-old learned most of all from his ordeal was that he should
have confided in his parents or other adults after learning that his girlfriend,
Amy Grossberg, was pregnant, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're 18 years old and you have a big problem, you have to get help,"
said Peterson attorney Russell Gioiella.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson and Ms. Grossberg were both in their first year of college when
they went to a Newark, Del., motel room near Ms. Grossberg's University of
Delaware campus on Nov. 12, 1996, and delivered a baby boy.
</P>
<P>
	   The baby's body was found wrapped in a plastic bag in a trash bin in the
motel's parking lot. The couple, both 18 at the time, had said they believed the
child was stillborn when Peterson placed it there. But the medical examiner's
office said the boy died of skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson pleaded guilty to manslaughter in March 1998 and agreed to
cooperate with authorities in Ms. Grossberg's trial. Ms. Grossberg pleaded
guilty a month later. She was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison and is
scheduled to be released in May from the Baylor Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson was released early from his two-year sentence because of time
served before his guilty plea and good behavior, state corrections spokeswoman
Elizabeth Welch said. She described him as a model inmate who tutored other
prisoners and worked in the commissary and kitchen.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, a judge denied a request by Peterson's attorney to reduce his
sentence by three weeks so he could spend Christmas with his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson walked out of the Delaware prison with his arm around his mother
Tuesday morning and ate an Entenmann's chocolate doughnut on the ride back to
Wyckoff.
</P>
<P>
	   He hugged his lawyer, Jack Litman, outside the house. Inside, he visited his
pet fish and his cat, Princess, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson doesn't have immediate goals beyond school, Gioiella said, noting
that he was still young. But "he matured a lot by tragedy," he said. "Brian has
suffered a lot. I'm sure Amy has as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson does not plan to have future contact with Ms. Grossberg, Litman
said. Grossberg's attorney did not immediately return a telephone message
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Gene in Women May Have Cancer Link  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A gene that is more active in women than in men may
explain why women smokers are more than twice as likely to develop lung cancer
as men smokers, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers studying the genetic structure of lung tissue cells removed from
both men and women found that a gene linked to abnormal growth of lung cells is
much more active in women.
</P>
<P>
	   "Women are more likely to develop lung cancer after less smoking exposure
than are men," said Sharon P. Shriver, a Pennsylvania State University
biologist. "Also a nonsmoker who develops lung cancer is three times more likely
to be female than male. Our study may provide an explanation for this."
</P>
<P>
	   The study showed that the action of a specific gene increased lung cancer
risk in both women and men smokers, but the risk was 12 times higher for women
smokers with the active gene and only 2.4 times higher for men smokers who had
the active gene, said Shriver.
</P>
<P>
	   Shriver is first author of the study appearing Wednesday in the Journal of
the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   Many studies have shown that both smoking and nonsmoking women are at much
higher risk of developing lung cancer than are their male counterparts, and some
studies have found the risks up to 2.3 times higher for women, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The genetic study suggests a biological reason for this difference, Shriver
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Curtis C. Harris of the National Cancer Institute said the study "adds
evidence that women are more sensitive to tobacco-induced lung cancer." It
supports the conclusion of an earlier NCI study by Harris and others that a
genetic difference in the lungs of women may contribute to the greater lung
cancer risk among women, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the new study, researchers did a genetic study of lung specimens taken
from 38 women and 40 men, both smokers and nonsmokers. Fifty-eight were lung
cancer patients. The rest were undergoing lung surgery for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers tested the lung tissue for activity by a gene called
gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, or GRPR. The gene prompts cells to link up
with the GRP hormone. This linkage, in turn, causes abnormal cell growth that
can lead to lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The GRPR gene was found to be active in 55 percent of the nonsmoking women
and about 75 percent of the smoking women, even if they had been using
cigarettes for less than 25 pack years. (A pack year is smoking 20 cigarettes a
day for one year.)
</P>
<P>
	   Among male nonsmokers, the gene was not active at all, the researchers
found. The gene was active in only 20 percent of the male smokers with 25 or
fewer pack years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Men have to smoke for this gene to kick in," said Jill M. Siegfried, a
University of Pittsburgh researcher who was a co-author of the study. "But women
don't have to smoke at all for the gene to be active. This may be why nonsmoking
women are more susceptible to lung cancer."
</P>
<P>
	   The GRPR gene plays a key role in the development of the lungs and the
bronchial tree, but the gene is usually inactive in adults, Siegfried said. It
becomes active only in the presence of tobacco smoke or some other respiratory
insult, she said.

	   The gene is on the X chromosome. Women have two of these chromosomes, while
men have one.
</P>
<P>
	   Most genes on one of the X chromosomes in women are inactivated, said
Siegfried, but for some reason the GRPR gene can remain active on both X
chromosomes in women.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think that is the most likely explanation of why we see more frequent
expression of the gene in females compared to males," said Siegfried.
</P>
<P>
	   The important message from the study, said the researchers, is that women
are much more susceptible to lung cancer from cigarette smoke and that women
will develop the disease with a lesser amount of smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   "The take-home message, especially for teen-age girls, is that they should
stop smoking, or, better yet, never start," said Shriver.

<HEADLINE> Gloria Steinem, Rep. Maloney urge prosecution of alleged sex tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Rep. Carolyn Maloney, feminist Gloria Steinem and the
group Equality Now urged local and federal officials Tuesday to crack down on a
Queens group they say has been running sex tours to Thailand and the Philippines
for years.
<P>
	   They urged Queens District Attorney Richard Brown to prosecute Big Apple
Oriental Tours, which they called one of the nation's leading sex tour
operators, for promoting prostitution - a violation of New York state law.
</P>
<P>
	   Maloney said she also wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday
calling for action against the Queens agency. A federal statute passed in 1994
makes travel with the intent to have sex with minors subject to up to 10 years'
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   "They should have had their sleazy doors closed long ago," the Democratic
congresswoman told reporters. "Big Apple Oriental Tours' promotional materials
make it clear that money is being exchanged for the company of women and
strongly suggest that sex is part of the transaction," she wrote in a letter to
Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   But Brown responded in a statement that his "office has expended significant
time and resources investigating Big Apple Oriental Tours ... (with) the
assistance of the NYPD, the FBI and U.S. Customs Service, among others."
</P>
<P>
	   The conclusion, he said, was that there is no legal basis to prosecute in
Queens because the alleged prostitution occurs outside the jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   "The acts alleged to have occurred here in New York have been carefully
circumscribed by Big Apple Oriental Tours and its principals to avoid a
successful prosecution under existing New York law," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although sex tours are illegal in the United States, Thailand and the
Philippines, Equality Now, a New York-based women's rights organization, said no
U.S. sex tour operator had ever been convicted under either state or federal
law.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are simply asking that a law be enforced," said Steinem. "By some
estimates, the sex travel industry is bigger than the drug industry ... and the
girls involved are getting younger and younger and younger."
</P>
<P>
	   Calls Tuesday to the tour agency in the Bellerose section were not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency's promotional video shows New Yorker Norman Barabash checking out
scantily dressed women gyrating in dimly lit bars in the Philippines. At the
end, it zooms in on naked female "wet T-shirt contestants" being pinched and
groped by a crowd of American "judges."
</P>
<P>
	   Barabash, who runs Big Apple Oriental Tours, previously told The Associated
Press he opposed the term "sex tour." "It's only the media that tend to reduce
any kind of romantic adventure to the mere joining of the genitals," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carol Smolenski, coordinator at End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism,
U.S.A., said there is little mention in the United States of sex tours because
"there just seems to be a real desire to delude ourselves that Americans (don't)
do this."
</P>
<P>
	   Tour operators deny they provide access to underage girls. They place
disclaimers in their ads to that effect. But Barabash previously admitted to the
AP: "There's no way of knowing for certain."
</P>
<P>
	   "Short of giving women lie detector tests, who can tell?" said Barabash. A
Filipina woman in Barabash's video identified herself as "17 years young."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria To Release Some Prisoners  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- The Nigerian government decided Tuesday to release
prisoners who have spent more than 20 years on death row.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-time gesture is being made on ``compassionate grounds,'' Minister of
Cooperation Jerry Gana said after a Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates who have spent less than 20 years, but more than 10 years awaiting
execution, will have their sentences commuted to life in prison, Gana said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government did not say how many prisoners would benefit from the
gesture, but they are believed to number in the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights groups have pressed for the abolition of the death penalty,
which was used by former military regimes against their opponents. But capital
punishment is widely supported in the West African country as a means of
combatting soaring violent crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The election of President Olusegun Obasanjo last year ended 15 years of
military rule.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Bradley delves into some issues but passes others by  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - As a U.S. senator, Bill Bradley immersed himself in
some issues but seemed unmoved by others, a record that offers clues to what
kind of president he would be, a panel of experts said Tuesday.
<P>
	   Three congressional colleagues of Bradley, a former aide and two reporters
who covered him painted an image of a legislator willing to roll up his sleeves
and get his hands dirty - so long as a bill or a cause appealed to him.
</P>
<P>
	   "He gets deeply involved in the key issues that he wants to get done," said
Marcia Aronoff, Bradley's chief of staff in the Senate from 1978 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, a Democrat who left the Senate in 1997 after three terms, was the
topic of the day at the American Enterprise Institute, which launched a series
of seminars on how presidential candidates would govern if elected. A similar
seminar on Republican John McCain is scheduled for Thursday. Democrat Al Gore
and Republican George W. Bush are on the agenda next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The discussion of Bradley at times resembled the arguments of the Gore
campaign, which regularly charges that the former New Jersey senator views
politics as a lofty academic exercise rather than a day-by-day fight. In New
Hampshire this week, Gore said Bradley "seems to believe America can address
only one thing at a time."
</P>
<P>
	   Former Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., called Bradley "bright as a star" but
wondered whether a President Bradley "would have a tough time bending to
negotiate deals."
</P>
<P>
	   Defending Bradley, former Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., said only the
less thoughtful members of Congress are "into everything."
</P>
<P>
	   Durenberger did, however, question why Bradley, as a senator, pressed for
votes on pet issues when he knew he would lose badly.
</P>
<P>
	   "He'd walk out (to the Senate floor) and do something that at least half of
us thought ought to get done, but it wasn't the right time or place to do it,"
Durenberger said. "We'd sit there and say, 'Oh my god, why does he have to do
it?' And you'd end up going down and voting against your friend on an issue you
probably cared about because it just wasn't appropriate timing."
</P>
<P>
	   Aronoff replied that Bradley believes that if you always wait for the right
moment, "you'll never start."
</P>
<P>
	   Both Rostenkowski, who supports Gore, and Miller, who supports Bradley,
painted a sympathetic picture of Bradley as a senator who stuck tenaciously to
his fights once he picked them.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller said Bradley chose to take on "the most contentious issue in the
history of California" when he proposed new ways to allocate water resources in
the state. Miller said he learned from that fight that Bradley has "incredible
fortitude to hang in there when the incoming fire starts."
</P>
<P>
	   Rostenkowski recalled working with Bradley to help produce the Tax Reform
Act of 1986, which began years earlier as a proposal by Bradley and Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gephardt faded away, but Bradley was still there," Rostenkowski said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Murray, Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal and author
of a book on the 1986 tax reform, said Bradley astutely recognized a chance to
match Republican demands for lower tax rates with Democrats' demands for fewer
loopholes.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a unique opportunity. He saw it; he saw it alone," Murray said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Goodman, longtime political reporter for The Times of Trenton, was asked
why so few leading Democrats in New Jersey have endorsed Bradley. Goodman said
Bradley's departure from the Senate - and his lament about politics being
"broken" - caused hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was an emotional assault on Democrats in New Jersey, the Democratic
leadership," Goodman said. "He was telling them they were in the wrong business,
almost."

<HEADLINE> Pesticides in Schools Data Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency should make a
nationwide effort to determine what pesticides are used in schools and minimize
the health risks to children, a Democratic senator said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., released a study by the General Accounting
Office that said too little is known about children's exposure to such toxic
chemicals in classrooms and school playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This information gap is troubling,'' said Lieberman, the ranking Democrat
on the Governmental Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that children are particularly vulnerable to risks associated with
pesticides, including elevated rates of leukemia and brain cancer. So we have
every right to be concerned,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
	   The GAO said its investigators could find no credible statistics on the
amount of pesticide used in the nation's 110,000 public schools, nor how often
students might have been exposed to dangerous chemicals. It said there is even
less data on short-term or long-term health impacts.
</P>
<P>
	   A private advocacy group, the National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides, has maintained that students frequently are exposed to unhealthy
levels of pesticide residues in classrooms and on playgrounds because of
spraying by pest control companies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the data available suggest students face a hazard,'' said Jay Feldman,
the coalition's executive director, who joined Lieberman at a news conference.
Feldman acknowledged that hard data on pesticide use and health risks in schools
is sketchy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lieberman said he would join Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., in pushing for legislation that would require schools to
notify parents before pesticides are to be used in a school and require schools
to adopt pest management plans that rely less on toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Lieberman said, the EPA should take steps to minimize
students' exposure to pesticides by establishing federal guidelines on parent
notification and use of pesticides in school environments.
</P>
<P>
	   And he said in a letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner the agency should
``conduct a full-scale statistical survey on the use of pesticides in schools to
determine whether there are risks ... to children due to accumulative
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA issued a statement saying that it was ``vitally important to call
attention to potential risks from pesticides in schools and in all other places
where children may be exposed.'' It said the agency would consider all of the
recommendations by Lieberman and the GAO report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``EPA evaluates pesticides for safety before registering them for use,
including uses in schools based on the best science available,'' said the
statement. While the EPA supports use of nonchemical and safer pest control
approaches in schools, it has not supported a federal mandate for such programs,
preferring to leave it up to the states.
</P>
<P>
	   Six states -- Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Texas and West
Virginia -- require schools to adopt integrated pest management strategies.
Maryland and Texas are the only states to require parent notification in advance
of pesticide use, although seven other states require schools to provide that
information when requested by a parent, according to GAO.

<HEADLINE> Workplace Rules Protect Home Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans who work at home should expect to be covered by
the same safety standards that apply in their companies' offices, says a federal
advisory that outlines how traditional workplace protections affect the growing
number of people who telecommute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ensuring safe and healthful working conditions for the employee should be
a precondition for any home-based work assignments,'' said the Labor
Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The advisory came in a letter to a Texas-based credit services company that
had sought advice about moving some of its sales executives into home offices.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, OSHA provided clear examples of companies' responsibilities in
an area that had been murky, even as the numbers of Americans regularly working
at home has swelled to almost 20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Such federal advisory letters to individual companies are made public so
that they may serve as general guidance.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA officials said Tuesday there has been no change in government policy,
only a clarification of existing law, and the agency will take no new action.
There will be no government inspections of home offices, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency did suggest, in its advisory, that companies should periodically
inspect at-home workers' quarters themselves, as well as train people to set up
safe home offices. Some large companies already have written safety agreements
with or offered guidance to telecommuting employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Business groups that called attention this week to the OSHA action said the
new specifics create a greater legal burden on employers, which could have a
chilling effect on at-home work arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At a time when we want to provide a maximum amount of flexibility to
workers, this new policy announcement just flies in the face of that,'' said
U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokesman Frank Coleman.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, called OSHA's action ``an
outrageous extension of the Washington bureaucracy into the lives of working men
and women across America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders had already vowed to scrutinize OSHA after Congress
returns from its holiday break because of regulations the agency proposed in
November that would require employers to minimize everyday physical -- or
``ergonomic'' -- stresses of certain jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA's advisory on at-home work, dated Nov. 15, said companies must provide
necessary protective equipment and guidance against hazards that will ensure
home offices are set up safely. An example of such a hazard, it said, is a
computers that could overload electrical circuits in a residence and create a
fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the advisory, employers can be held liable if they know or
should reasonably have known about home workplace hazards, even rickety stairs
leading to a basement office that result in a fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal experts said if a fall were caused by a child's toy left on an
otherwise safe stairway, that likely would be considered beyond a company's
control.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, OSHA said companies aren't liable if a worker is injured in a
home office while doing something other than working, such as eating lunch.
Also, hazardous conditions elsewhere in the home are not the company's
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA did not specifically address whether someone who works at home and is
injured on the job would be entitled to normal workman's compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   That's implied, however, said AFL-CIO director of safety and health, Peg
Seminario.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Workers' comp coverage does follow the worker and would apply whether the
employee is working at home or whether someone's at a fixed work site,''
Seminario said. ``It's a matter of common sense that if you have people
conducting extensive work at home, then the home essentially becomes a
workplace.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 359; Nasdaq Down 230  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today as fears of rising interest rates
depressed blue chips for a second straight session and also prompted some
investors to take profits from technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 359.58, or by 3.2 percent, to close at
10,997.93 in heavy trading. It was the fourth-biggest point drop ever for the
Dow but was not close to its largest daily percentage decline.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, which closed at an all-time high on Monday, fell
a record 230.01 points to 3,901.14. The Nasdaq drop surpassed the previous
largest daily loss of 140.43 points set on Aug. 31, 1998, the 5.6 percent slide
today was the seventh-largest ever in percent terms, according to preliminary
figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued selling that began Monday as the market grew concerned
that, now that concerns about Year 2000 computer bugs have passed, the nation's
robust economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors now believe the Fed will raise interest rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1 and 2. The Fed left rates unchanged at its last meeting,
hoping to ensure monetary stability while Y2K concerns played out around the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets took little notice of President Clinton's renomination of Alan
Greenspan for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve System. The
announcement was widely expected.
</P>
<P>
	   But some of today's selling was also due to the fact that traders who
enjoyed big gains at the end of 1999 can, with the arrival of the new year, take
profits without having to pay taxes on their gains until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said a pullback after the market's December rally was expected.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market has had a very strong run," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market
strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore. "Higher interest rates are providing a
catalyst for some selling that probably needs to take place before it can go any
higher."
</P>
<P>
	   The selloff wasn't limited to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In Britain, where trading resumed today for the first time after a long New
Year's holiday, the main index of the London Stock Exchange had its biggest
daily point loss ever, dropping 264.3 points, or by 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not the biggest percentage loss, however. London's Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index had plunged 12.2 percent on Oct. 27, 1987,
when it had its previous largest point loss, a drop of 250.7.

<HEADLINE> Putin Knew of Yeltsin's Plans  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that he knew about 10 days before
the rest of the world that Boris Yeltsin planned to resign and turn Russia's
presidency over to him.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin also urged Russians to honor Yeltsin, who became very unpopular during
eight years of chaotic rule and stalled reforms that saw living standards for
many Russians plummet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must have a very kind and humane attitude to the first president of
Russia,'' Putin told the ORT television network in his first major interview
since becoming acting president.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said Yeltsin's decision caught him entirely by surprise and he would
have been willing to go on working as prime minister. He said Yeltsin's move was
clearly motivated by the desire to boost Putin's chances of being elected
president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wanted the presidential campaign to develop according to his wishes, he
was helping me,'' Putin said. ``To put it flatly, he gave me a head start in the
current presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   The acting president made no reference to corruption allegations surrounding
Yeltsin and his family or his decision to give Yeltsin immunity from criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said Yeltsin told him of the move during a routine meeting soon after
Dec. 19 parliamentary elections in which centrists, including the Kremlin-backed
Unity, scored a surprise triumph. The vote was a strong endorsement for Putin,
who supported Unity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came to him about 10 days before the New Year to deliver a report on
economic problems and the situation in the North Caucasus and soon after I
started speaking, I realized that Boris Nikolayevich was thinking about
something else,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He interrupted me and said `I have been thinking for a long time about the
situation in the country and have made the decision to resign,''' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to the parliamentary election, Yeltsin told him: ``I made this
decision because something I consider very important has happened: People trust
you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although Putin often appears serious and unemotional in public, he projected
a more relaxed side in the friendly interview with the state-run ORT network.
Sitting at a table in his Kremlin office, with a snow-covered fir tree framed in
a window behind him, Putin took deep breaths before answering questions and
sometimes hesitated when talking about the emotions of Yeltsin's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was a difficult day for all of us,'' he said of the president's last
day in office.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's upper chamber of parliament, the Federation Council, was to meet
Wednesday to set the date for presidential elections. The constitution says
elections must be held within 90 days and March 26 has been tipped as the likely
date.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin may soon announce a Cabinet shuffle, government chief of staff Dmitry
Kozak said Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Kozak declined to give
details.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin already has made several staff changes, the presidential press service
said, including naming Alexei Gromov, former chief of the Kremlin press service,
as his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   In the TV interview, Putin said Yeltsin had a few parting words just before
he stepped into his limousine to leave the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He looked around sadly, and said it was sad to leave because so much was
connected with these walls, these premises and the people who worked here,''
Putin said. ``Addressing me in the end, he said very simple words: Protect
Russia.''

<HEADLINE> Orthodox Jews Protest Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Protesters led by ultra-Orthodox Jews demanded
Tuesday that Israel immediately stop negotiating with Syria over a possible
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Traitor, go home,'' they chanted in a message to Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, in Shepherdstown for peace talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   They staged the demonstration in a light rain outside the makeshift media
center at Shepherd College, about a mile from the Clarion Hotel and Conference
Center where Tuesday's meeting was held.
</P>
<P>
	   Relinquishing the strategic Golan Heights, which Syria has set as the price
for peace, would leave Israel's northern border unprotected, protest leader Levi
Huebner said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Golan is our security,'' Huebner said. ``Peace will be in security and
trust in our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Huebner arrived Tuesday morning with about 40 others in a convoy of nine
vans from Brooklyn, N.Y., headquarters of the strict Lubavich Hasidic movement.
</P>
<P>
	   They were joined at an hour-long afternoon demonstration by about 40
representatives from the New York-based group America for a Safe Israel and
about 40 children from a Hebrew school in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Herbert Zweibon, chairman of America for a Safe Israel, urged U.S. citizens
to oppose proposals for using U.S. troops or money to enforce a turnover of the
Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The last thing we need to do is spend money on a deal that will not
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lubavichers arrived in vans plastered with slogans including ``We will
not move from the Golan.'' Honking horns and chanting, they drove several times
past the Clarion on the outskirts of the town of 1,300.
</P>
<P>
	   Religious Jews do not uniformly oppose giving up the Golan, which Israel
captured in the 1967 Six-Day War. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of
Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas party, a coalition partner in Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's government, has spoken for returning captured land to Israel's Arab
neighbors if it would lead to a genuine peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Shas supporters tend to be suspicious of Arab intentions and are wary
of returning the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, asked about the Golan, told a
news conference that a peace agreement would ``require the most painful of
political decisions by both parties.''
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators' arrival heightened apprehension among Shepherdstown
residents who opposed staging the peace talks in the town because of feared
security problems and inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a real concern people have that the way of life we all love here
in Shepherdstown is somehow diminished by this sort of thing,'' said Steve
Warner, owner of a local advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Town Councilman Larry Murphy said a slim majority on the seven-member town
council supported having the talks in Shepherdstown, a college town on the
Potomac River about 70 miles from Washington.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Returns to Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- With a procedural hang-up overcome, President
Clinton re-entered peacemaking talks between Israel and Syria today, hoping to
set the two longtime foes on a course to a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton met for more than an hour with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in a three-way session attended also by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   The session, at the Clarion Hotel and Conference Center just outside this
239-year-old town, followed cancellation of a three-way session Monday night. It
was called off in a wrangle over what should be negotiated first in this new
round of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin declined to say how the dispute
was smoothed over after a solution was worked out in a meeting between Albright
and Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got a good start yesterday,'' Rubin said. ``There was a procedural
hang-up in the evening. That hang-up has been overcome.''
</P>
<P>
	   With a light rain falling on the oldest town in West Virginia, where talks
are being held at an off-limits federal center, Clinton left Washington in a
motorcade for a second consecutive day of mediating between Barak and al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said committees had been formed to take up all key issues, and none
would be overlooked by the two sides. He included terms of the peace Syria is
offering in return for the strategic Golan Heights, a border plateau Israel has
held since 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Discussions on all the issues, in one form or another, will be held over the
next few days, he told reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   But even with the positive turn of events, Rubin repeated his admonition
that a core agreement on an Israeli pullback, a peace accord, new security
arrangement and other knotty issues, is unlikely to emerge at the end of this
round, the second since Israel and Syria abandoned their peacemaking efforts in
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they're both very serious,'' Clinton said in announcing he would
return to the negotiations. ``They both want an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The agenda disagreement between the two sides apparently centered on the
timing of discussions on an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights -- at the
beginning of the talks, as Syria wanted, or at the end, which Israel preferred.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said in an interview with Israel Radio
that Barak wanted to resume the talks where they broke off more than three years
ago -- ``on issue of security because the scope of a withdrawal depends on what
we will receive in return.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Syria insisted on first taking up the withdrawal issue -- how much land
Israel would yield and the timetable for the pullback, according to Israeli and
Syrian sources.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said that if the priorities issue
was resolved, the committees handling security, water rights, borders and the
normalization would meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a White House ceremony announcing his nomination of Alan
Greenspan to a fourth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Clinton said
today, ``I wish I could have so much success in the Middle East peace talks. I
just ask them and they say yes the way Mr. Greenspan did. It would be joy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said it was ``partly my decision'' not to have a three-way meeting
with Barak and al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're looking at now up in West Virginia is sort of figuring out what
the process for the next few days is going to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he wasn't in a position to talk about the cost to the United States
of any peace agreement, but that there would be consultations with Congress. ``I
believe Americans of all political parties and all stripes desperately want to
see a comprehensive peace in the Middle East,'' he said. ``I'm quite hopeful
about that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nine vans carrying orthodox Jews gathered in Shepherdstown today to protest
a proposed Israeli turnover of the Golan Heights. Though the vans bore New York
license plates, organizers said the protesters were from all over.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, meantime, Israel and the Palestinians broke a deadlock by
agreeing today on an Israeli troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West Bank by
Thursday. Israel will pull back Jan. 20 from an additional 6.1 percent, as
scheduled, under an interim peace accord reached in September.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement reached today by the negotiators, Saeb Erekat for the
Palestinians and Oded Eran for the Israelis, improves the atmosphere of talks
toward reaching a final peace treaty. The two sides have set a Feb. 13 deadline
for agreement on a framework for the final treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The Syrian government-controlled media cautioned that failure to make
progress in the West Virginia talks could result in a ``deep freeze.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless there is a breakthrough very soon, the whole process for making
peace will come to a dangerous recess,'' the English-language Syria Times wrote.
``Until the Israelis summon the courage to move forward, no real breakthrough is
likely to occur.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said, ``The procedure and the
substance are wrapped together at this stage in the discussion. They have not
agreed on a work plan yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Little in the way of news is seeping out. But Lockhart and Rubin said the
two sides were getting into the knotty issues.
</P>
<P>
	   That means how much land Barak is willing to relinquish, the nature of the
peace Syria would commit itself to in return and also the extent of U.S.
involvement in maintaining security along a new border between the two old foes.
</P>
<P>
	   The price tag could be high. Lockhart said informal soundings already were
being taken in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   New security arrangements would be needed to replace the Golan Heights, the
strategic buffer that has shielded Israel since Syria lost the high ground in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 18,000 Jews who live there may have to be relocated, as their farms,
light industries and wineries are abandoned.
</P>
<P>
	   There also has been speculation U.S. troops would be used to help keep the
peace -- an option the administration has not confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between the two countries broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Talks reopened briefly last month in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Nations Under Fire for Accused Nazi  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE CORDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian and British officials were put on the
defensive Tuesday for their handling of Konrad Kalejs, an accused Nazi war
criminal who has been booted out of several countries for allegedly taking part
in mass killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Australia has come under fire for agreeing to let Kalejs back into his
adopted homeland. The 86-year-old had been living in a retirement home in
Leicestershire, central England, for the past six months but is preparing to
leave after Britain decided to deport him for his alleged war atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   He is believed to be planning to return Thursday to Australia, where he has
held a passport since 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's obvious that Australia looks terrible, because Australia is
the only country that is willing to admit Konrad Kalejs,'' Efraim Zuroff,
director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Israeli branch, told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
	   But Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said Tuesday that Canberra would not
be bullied into banning Kalejs without proper proof.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't submit to criminal charges on the basis of assertion, we do it on
the basis of evidence and that is the assumption of every Australian,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the British government came under fire Tuesday for deporting
Kalejs rather than bringing charges against him. Home Secretary Jack Straw, the
country's top law enforcement official, noted that police advised him that there
wasn't sufficient proof against Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the absence of admissible evidence, the police have no power to detain
Mr. Kalejs,'' said Straw. But, he added, deportation efforts were put into
motion because Kalejs' presence in Britain was ``not conducive to the public
good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ann Widdecombe, Straw's counterpart in the opposition Conservative Party,
accused him of ``bungling'' the case, expressing concern that Kalejs could be
deported while British police are still investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs was deported from the United States in 1994 and from Canada in 1997.
Both countries kicked him out over allegations that he was in a unit that took
part in killing more than 30,000 people, primarily Jews, in Latvia during World
War II. Kalejs has denied the charges and described his accusers as ``liars and
storytellers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Tuesday, Ruddock hinted Australia would reopen investigations
against Kalejs if authorities were given new evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If this issue is to be progressed those people who believe that they have
evidence that this man was involved in criminal activities in the war, they
should bring their information forward and put it before the Australian Federal
Police,'' Ruddock said. ``If it's new information, I'm sure they'd be willing to
look at it''
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs is one of six men in Australia who have been accused of World War
II-era crimes, but despite lengthy investigations none of them has been
successfully prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   Due to lack of evidence Kalejs was never formally charged.

<HEADLINE> Dow Off 359.58; Nasdaq Off 229.99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices plummeted today as fears of rising interest
rates gave investors a reason to sell shares and capture gains from last year's
spectacular performance. The Nasdaq composite index, the best performer in 1999,
suffered its worst point loss in history.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
359.58 to close at 10,997.93, its fourth-worst point decline ever. The Dow
dropped 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The blue-chip index had dipped as much as 380 points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also sustained sharp losses.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 55.80
to 1,399.42.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index plunged 229.99 points to 3,901.16, a decline of
5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the Dow nor the Nasdaq percentage drops were records.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 2,239 down, 919 up and 398 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 983.61 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 921.34 million
in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 18.02 to 478.40.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued a wave of selling that began Monday as the market
balanced good news about a smooth conversion to the Year 2000 with growing fears
that runaway economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "The toggle switch moved from 'off' to 'on' regarding interest-rate
worries," said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed of
Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
	   Herrmann said investors were able to brush off concerns about rising rates
while Y2K loomed as a potential threat to the economy. With worries about
computer troubles now mostly alleviated, interest rates are once again rattling
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed left rates unchanged at its last meeting, hoping to ensure monetary
stability while Y2K concerns played out around the world. Now, central bankers
are likely to focus on continued signs of economic growth, and a stock market
that defied rising rates to set a string of new records at the close of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates typically hurt stocks by cutting into corporate
profits as it becomes more expensive to borrow money. Higher rates can be
especially devastating to high-growth stocks, whose promise of future earnings
growth may be threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, only technology stocks proved immune to the Fed's rate increases,
breaking out of a springtime lull to move to record-breaking highs by the end of
the year. But inflation jitters loomed over the broad market all year long,
contributing to a protracted slump for many stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Ironically, a decline in U.S. equities now could help assuage the Fed, which
has made no secret of its concern over stocks' lofty valuations, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The stock market has become such an important source of economic growth,"
Herrmann said. "If economic growth is too high, the Fed must continue raising
rates, and the stock market has become a real factor in that decision."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, most analysts believe today's selloff was a temporary drop in a
market that still feeds on strong corporate profits and a robust economy. The
steep decline in stocks was to be expected, and could leave the market in better
shape for another advance, said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for
Legg Mason in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market has had a very strong run," said Cripps. "Higher interest rates
are providing a catalyst for some selling that probably needs to take place
before it can go any higher."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, American Express and Hewlett-Packard led the Dow's decliners.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks also struggled as investors collected profits from a
stellar year in 1999. Traders said many investors held onto shares of
top-performing companies last year and are now selling because the taxes on
their gains won't be due until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets took little notice of President Clinton's renomination of Alan
Greenspan for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve System. The
announcement was widely expected, but traders said the market would probably
have fared worse without it.

<HEADLINE> Irish Court Halts Extradition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Lawyers for an escaped Irish Republican Army convict
won a court ruling Tuesday delaying their client's extradition to Northern
Ireland, where he faces a life sentence for participating in the killing of a
British soldier in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Detectives were driving Angelo Fusco, 43, to the Republic of Ireland's
border with the British-linked province when Dublin's High Court Justice Joseph
Finnegan ruled to block the extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   Fusco, who was arrested Monday night near the southwest town of Tralee, is
now scheduled to appear before the High Court on Thursday for legal arguments
about whether his extradition can proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   Fusco was a member of a four-man IRA unit that ambushed and killed a British
army commando in Belfast in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   He and his comrades all escaped from the city's Crumlin Road Jail the day
before their 1981 convictions by changing clothes with their defense attorneys
during a jailhouse visit. The disguised prisoners tried to walk out the front
gate undetected, then one opened fire with a smuggled handgun when a guard
recognized them. Nobody was wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Fusco was arrested in the Republic of Ireland three years ago, but went
missing again after being granted bail during a legal fight against extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   All three of Fusco's comrades have already been recaptured, served severely
shortened sentences in Northern Ireland, and been paroled. They included Joe
Doherty, who became a cause celebre in Irish-American circles after the FBI
arrested him in New York City in 1984. Doherty was finally extradited back to
Belfast in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if Fusco is returned to Northern Ireland to begin serving his life
sentence, he could be paroled by July under terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace
accord, which recommended freedom for convicted members of truce-observing
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA, which killed more than 1,800 people during a 27-year campaign to
destabilize Northern Ireland, called a cease-fire in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately on Tuesday, inmates at Northern Ireland's Maghaberry Prison
briefly seized control of a wing and set fire to two cells in a protest over
their conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen prisoners barricaded themselves in a recreation room and lit fires
to prevent guards from gaining access, the Northern Ireland Prison Service said.
But the prisoners were forced to return to their cells after firefighters doused
the flames.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison service declined to identify the political affiliation, if any,
of the protesters at Maghaberry, west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported among the 483 people housed at the prison, some on
terrorist-related convictions.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison service said all of those who protested had not received holiday
parole. The violence erupted a few hours after about 50 who had received the
12-day parole returned.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Sues Flight Attendants  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines Tuesday filed a federal lawsuit
against its flight attendants' union and its officers, accusing them of
conducting a "sickout" to pressure the airline as a new contract is negotiated.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit in U.S. District Court in St. Paul accuses Teamsters Local 2000
of conducting an illegal job action. Northwest, based in Eagan, said union
leaders made public statements showing their intent to take action in their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline said that the union has encouraged and directed flight
attendants to call in sick rather than report to work since late December.
Northwest said the encouragement came in the form of e-mail, phone calls and
notices on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
	   "These notices have made clear that the purpose of the sickout is to protest
Northwest's position in collective bargaining and to bring pressure to bear on
Northwest to accede to the union's demands," the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teamsters Local 2000 president Billie Davenport did not immediately return a
message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest said there has been a dramatic increase in sick calls, "far beyond
historic norms and prior year averages."
</P>
<P>
	   Since Dec. 30, Northwest said it has had to cancel more than 300 flights
because of the sickout.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline asked for an immediate restraining order so it can provide
"adequate and reliable service" to its customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest also asked the court to require the union to publicly withdraw any
orders, requests or suggestions that its members participate in the action.
</P>
<P>
	   A hearing on the request was set for 8:15 a.m. Wednesday before U.S.
District Judge Donovan Frank in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   The union of 11,000 flight attendants has been seeking a new contract for 3
1/2 years, increasing frustrations for some employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Courts have ruled recently against sickouts or other job actions not
approved by the National Mediation Board.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Texas early last year slapped a $45 million penalty on
the union representing pilots at American Airlines, who staged a sickout in
February to protest American's acquisition of Reno Air, and then defied the
judge's back-to-work order.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Comair filed a lawsuit against union pilots for refusing to fly
270 flights because of mechanical issues that Comair said were minor.
</P>
<P>
	   The future of the Northwest talks remains uncertain. Flight attendants in
late August overwhelmingly rejected a tentative agreement that had been endorsed
by union negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides met in a mediated session on Dec. 7, but the mediation board
said a union proposal presented then asked for too many contract changes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts Economic Expansion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- In nearly every speech he gives, President Clinton notes,
with some pride, that America is enjoying the "longest peacetime economic
expansion in our history."
</P>
<P>
	   As he noted Tuesday, that rhetoric will likely change for the better very
soon. If the national economic surge continues apace, Clinton can drop the
"peacetime" qualifier next month.
</P>
<P>
	   "In February it will become the longest economic expansion ever," Clinton
said as he announced the renomination of Alan Greenspan as chairman of the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   The president credited "wise leadership from the Fed" for much of that
success, and Greenspan agreed that the expansion should set a record next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The current economic expansion began in March 1991. This month, it should
tie the previous record of 106 months of uninterrupted expansion set between
February 1961 and December 1969, a period that included part of the Vietnam War.
Next month, the current expansion would hold the new record of 107 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The official arbiter of expansions is the National Bureau of Economic
Research, a private Cambridge, Mass., think tank that has been labeling
America's economic cycles since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
	   The bureau uses a number of statistics -- industrial production, employment,
business sales, the gross domestic product -- to pinpoint the actual month that
expansions begin and end. The research is conducted by more than 500 university
professors around the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The month-by-month economic tally is a useful tool, but the mere fact of a
record-setting expansion does not tell the whole story, said Washington economic
forecaster and inflation-watcher Joel Popkin.
</P>
<P>
	   "The real question is where does the economy go from there, and part of that
depends on how much the Federal Reserve decides to tighten the money supply and
raise interest rates," Popkin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed's next opportunity to change interest rates comes at a two-day
session that opens Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   "The importance of a steady, long expansion is that it maintains the
confidence of businesses to keep expanding, investing and hiring in a way that
does not happen in more short-lived recoveries," said White House economic
adviser Gene Sperling.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the expansion continues so long like this it forces businesses to have
to reach out and train and hire Americans that were often left on the fringes of
the economy," Sperling said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is expected to make the current expansion a centerpiece of his State
of the Union speech later this month. He will also continue to press the theme
in less weighty addresses, including fund-raising talks to fellow Democrats. In
those venues, Clinton usually pokes gentle fun at Republicans who doubted his
economic policies would work.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not an argument anymore," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan can perhaps claim greater bragging rights than the Clinton
administration for the current national boom. He has been on the job 12 years --
since long before the current boom began. Clinton took office in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   But he was gracious Tuesday in accepting Clinton's nomination for a fourth
term as chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's support and "commitment to fiscal discipline" have been key to the
expansion, Greenspan said. "I must say you have been a good friend to America's
central bank," Greenspan added.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Norway Train Collision  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG MELLGREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Two passenger trains collided Tuesday, killing at least
seven people, leaving 26 missing and sparking a fire that hampered rescue
efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire burned for almost four hours, sending smoke billowing above the
snow and pine trees that surrounded the wreck, 110 miles north of Oslo, before
it was put out by firefighters.
</P>
<P>
	   Elverum Police Chief Per Erik Skjefstad said rescue efforts were suspended
after a seven-hour search and would resume at daylight. He said seven people
were confirmed dead and 26 were missing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we don't know is whether some just left'' the crash scene for a
nearby train station, Skjefstad said in telephone interview. ``That is what we
are trying to check.''
</P>
<P>
	   The national news agency NTB reported that dozens of people were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The two trains carrying a total of 100 people collided around 1:30 p.m. at
the Aasta Station in Aamot township, near the town of Rena. One train was headed
south from the city of Trondheim carrying 81 passengers and two crew, while the
other was headed north from the city of Hamar with 15 passengers and two crew.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities refused to speculate on the total number of fatalities. With the
injured being sent to different hospitals and some uninjured passengers simply
leaving the crash scene, it could take some time for police to account for all
the passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a terrible tragedy,'' Osmund Ueland, the chief executive of the
Norwegian state railroad, told a news conference in Oslo. ``Three of our crew
are missing,'' including two engineers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two trains were on the same track at the time of the collision and news
reports said they had traveled that way for several miles. However, officials
said it was too early to speculate on the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   National Railways Director Steinar Killi said the section of track where the
collision occurred had been due for a safety upgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Next year we will have an automatic train stop system there that we
unfortunately didn't have today,'' he told a news conference in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses and rescuers described calm after the crash, followed by chaos as
flames spread through at least one of the trains.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought we stopped for a moose,'' said passenger Jeanette Haug. ``People
said there was fire and we had to get out. But it was calm and I think people
did well.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least one locomotive overturned, flames could be seen shooting out of the
windows of at least one passenger car and some cars were reported to have slid
down an embankment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We didn't get any warning that anything was wrong before the crash,''
passenger Robert Ulriksen said on Norway's state radio NRK. ``I flew forward and
hit my knees pretty hard on the seat in front. I picked myself up and realized
it was pretty serious because the car was leaning and on its side.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said those on board tried to help each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got those who were the least injured out,'' he said. ``Passengers and
baggage were strewn all across the middle corridor. It looked worse in the car
behind.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second serious public transport accident in Norway in just over a
month. On Nov. 26, 16 people drowned when a high-speed ferry ran aground and
sank.

<HEADLINE> One Minor Glitch Reported by Fed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The banking system continued to operate largely free of
Y2K glitches on Tuesday, the second business day of the new year, after a
problem described as minor at a regional Federal Reserve bank had been fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no problems reported with ATM machines and other banking
operations, said Charlotte Birch, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything is very quiet," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Armored trucks around the country, meanwhile, continued to carry back to the
regional Fed banks some of the billions of extra dollars distributed to banks,
thrifts and credit unions in case of Y2K panic.
</P>
<P>
	   Some banks have elected to keep the surplus currency for future use rather
than return it, Fed spokesman David Skidmore said. He said the number of banks
planning to do so was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   The central bank's check-clearing and payments systems "have functioned very
smoothly," Skidmore said. He noted one exception, which he described as a
Y2K-related "minor glitch" in the electronic system by which banks transfer
federal tax payments from businesses and individuals to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
	   Skidmore said the glitch occurred Monday at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago and involved about $700,000 in tax payments from customers of 60
financial institutions in the region, out of a total of some $15 billion
processed nationwide that day. It was repaired by Tuesday, he said, adding that
the only result is that the affected payments were being posted Tuesday, a day
late.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve distributed some $80 billion to banks, thrifts and
credit unions during the fourth quarter of 1999, compared with $23 billion over
the same period a year earlier. But some of the extra currency could have been
requested for reasons unrelated to Y2K, such as bank customers' holiday shopping
needs, Fed officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that 2000 has arrived without a run on banks, the banks and other
financial institutions on Monday started packing up the surplus currency and
sending it back to regional Federal Reserve banks, as previously planned. The
process is expected to take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Banking industry officials say they're optimistic people won't experience
problems withdrawing cash from automated teller machines.

<HEADLINE> Quotes on Greenspan's Appointment  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Reactions to Alan Greenspan's appointment to a fourth term as chairman of
the Federal Reserve:
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel a key player in this period of economic prosperity has been Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. I am confident that Chairman Greenspan's
technical experience, common sense and commitment to fiscal discipline will
continue to expand our nation's prosperity for all Americans." -- Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a nice man but I would prefer new and different leadership at the
Fed." -- Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "I welcome the appointment of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to
another term. He has served with a steady hand as the spirit and ingenuity of
the American people have brought forth unprecedented economic prosperity. I have
heard nothing from my colleagues which would indicate that there would be any
problem with his Senate confirmation." -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "The president has made a wise and timely decision. It underscores that the
country has been well served by an independent, nonpartisan Federal Reserve." --
Rep. James A. Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking and Financial
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a basic rule in business: Don't mess with success. That's why the
reappointment of Alan Greenspan is such welcome news. Chairman Greenspan has
provided thoughtful, forward-looking and very prudent leadership as head of the
Federal Reserve, and his continued stewardship of the nation's monetary system
bodes well for continued noninflationary economic growth." -- Jerry Jasinowski,
president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "Chairman Greenspan believes strongly in lower taxes, less government
spending, paying down the debt and creating jobs at home by expanding trade
overseas -- the four pillars of our economic plan to keep America strong. His
leadership has helped to free the energy, creativity and productivity of the
American worker which has brought us unprecedented economic growth." -- Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "His relentless pursuit of price stability is one of the key factors behind
the robust economic growth we are experiencing today. Since Alan Greenspan has
chaired the Federal Reserve, inflation and unemployment are both down nearly 2
percentage points, interest rates are down 2.5 percentage points, the Dow is up
325 percent and the economy has grown at a 3.2 percent annual rate." -- Sen.
Connie Mack, R-Fla., chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "The chairman, more than any other single individual, has aided in reducing
unemployment and inflation at the same time for over seven years, a feat unheard
of in many circles until his tenure. The Fed's chief duty is price stability and
inflation control. Alan Greenspan has done that and done it well." Rep. Jim
Saxton, R-N.J., vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "With this announcement, President Clinton has taken a necessary step to
ensure that the Federal Reserve remains independent and will not be subject to
the pressures that could arise in the heat of an election year. I hope that the
Senate will approve this nomination at the earliest opportunity." -- House
Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "I strongly support the reappointment of Alan Greenspan. He's been good for
the markets and instrumental in helping resolve the Asian financial crisis." --
Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "Now that Chairman Greenspan has achieved renomination with acclamation, he
hopefully will be less timid toward the robust U.S. economy. Federal Reserve
policy can and should work to limit real interest rates, allowing economic
growth without another series of rate hikes or threats of hikes that are
detrimental to hard-working American families." -- Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn. and
a member of the Banking Committee.

<HEADLINE> Unions win rally site near Capitol after dispute with police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Two of the state's biggest labor unions will
demonstrate outside the state Capitol Wednesday during Gov. George Pataki's
State of the State address - but only after a last-minute dispute with the
state.
<P>
	   Leaders of the Civil Service Employees Association and Public Employees
Federation who planned to shout protests throughout the speech complained that
the state Monday yanked permission to rally in front of the Capitol. State
police ordered the rally moved to the state Museum, at the opposite end of the
sprawling Empire State Plaza from the Capitol, for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The unions threatened legal action Tuesday, then arrived at a compromise
with the state, according to the union and state police. As many as 20,000 state
workers will protest across the street from the Capitol on the deck of the
Empire State Plaza.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the two unions have just entered their tenth month without a
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   "The question is being asked whether the governor will hear us," said the
CSEA spokesman Stephen Madarasz. "I think the governor has already heard us. The
question is what he will do about it."
</P>
<P>
	   CSEA President Danny Donahue and PEF President Roger Benson said 8,000 to
10,000 union members from across the state are expected to meet Wednesday
morning at the downtown Pepsi Arena, a couple blocks from the Capitol. Another
12,000 members who work downtown have been encouraged to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue said state officials have been told for more than a month that "tens
of thousands" of members are expected at the rally. But he said the state may
have been surprised by an estimate of 20,000 protesters carried in a report on
the planned rally last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours later, state Criminal Justice Director Katherine Lapp produced an
application dated Nov. 18 from a CSEA officer that estimated the crowd to be
2,000 to 3,000 protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent increase in that estimate along with what Albany Mayor Gerald
Jennings called inflammatory and irresponsible remarks by union leaders led to
the revocation of the original permit, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennings cited a comment from Benson that Albany could turn into a "Seattle
East," making reference to recent violent protests there. Benson, however,
insists his tape-recorded comment included the phrase "peaceful Seattle East."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the governor wasn't immediately available for comment. Last
week, Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon called the demonstration a "campaign
rally" for Donohue, who is facing a challenge for re-election this winter.
McKeon accused the union of closing down negotiations until the CSEA election
was resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Donohue's opponents in that election, Patrick Ellis of Albany, said
he and other members will join the rally, but will make it clear they believe
Donahue is to blame for the lack of a contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki himself said last week that state employees have been treated fairly
by his negotiators and that the state has made "solid" offers to both unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Union members have been working without a contract since April 1. Benson's
union represents 53,000 professional and scientific workers. The Civil Service
Employees Association has about 77,000 mostly blue-collar state workers.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Rains Claim 26 Lives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Heavy rains have swept away bridges, flooded
cities, claimed at least 26 lives and left thousands homeless in southeastern
Brazil, civil defense officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The death toll was highest in Rio de Janeiro State, where 13 people have
been killed since Sunday -- mostly in landslides, according to Civil Defense
Col. Jorge Lopes. About 6,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
state because of the flooding.
</P>
<P>
	   In the neighboring state of Minas Gerais, civil defense officials said 11
people had died since the rains began Saturday. Resulting floods drove about
14,000 people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   In Sao Paulo State, two people were confirmed dead, and just over 2,000 were
forced from their homes, civil defense officials said. But officials warned that
the death toll could rise after rescuers investigate the 60 or so houses that
were buried under mud in the mountain resort city of Campos de Jordao. Many
people who were living in the area had been evacuated before the mudslides.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The situation is serious,'' Campos do Jordao Mayor Oswaldo Gomes da Silva
Filho told the Estado news agency, declaring a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso visited the flooded areas in all three
states by helicopter Tuesday, and promised $2.7 million in disaster relief,
local media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Mudslides along the Dutra Highway, Brazil's most traveled road linking Rio
and Sao Paulo, caused traffic to back up for 6 miles as motorists traveling in
both direction took turns using the only lane open near the states' border.
</P>
<P>
	   Weather forecasters said the worst had passed, and that the rains should
dissipate.

<HEADLINE> Jury selection begins for brothers accused in boy witness slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP)- On the quiet cul-de-sac where 8-year-old Leroy
"B.J." Brown Jr. lived with his mother, there is no sign of the horror that
ended their lives.
<P>
	   No blood, no bullet casings, no yellow police tape cordoning off the
wood-shingled duplex where they lived.
</P>
<P>
	   It's been almost a year since B.J. and his mother were gunned down in their
home as they returned from a trip to the grocery store. Jury selection is
scheduled to begin Thursday in the trial of two brothers accused in the
killings.
</P>
<P>
	   B.J. was scheduled to be a key prosecution witness against one of the men.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell Peeler Jr., 27, and his brother, Adrian Peeler, 24, are accused of
killing B.J. and his mother, Karen Clarke, to stop the boy from testifying
against Russell in the 1998 murder of Clarke's boyfriend. Both brothers face the
possibility of the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Memories of the slayings are still painful to those who knew B.J. and his
mother.
</P>
<P>
	   "Amongst the children, whenever his name is brought up, there is a sadness,"
said Carlos Collazo, a counselor at the Boys and Girls Club of Bridgeport, where
B.J. spent many hours after school playing basketball, air hockey and kickball.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's also an anger. It shouldn't have came down that way," Collazo said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the killings, police and prosecutors were harshly criticized for not
protecting the mother and son after the boy had promised to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   A year earlier, B.J., at the age of 7, had become an unwitting witness as he
rode in a car with his mother's boyfriend, Rudy Snead. Another car pulled
alongside them and someone began firing at Snead, grazing him in the forehead.
B.J. saw the gunman's face.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine months later, a man walked into the Boston Avenue Barber Shop and
pumped seven bullets into Snead. Suddenly, B.J. became the key witness in a
murder trial. He picked out Russell Peeler's photograph for police.
</P>
<P>
	   After B.J. agreed to testify against Peeler, police placed special patrols
near B.J.'s house. But after just a few days, his mother asked police to stop
the patrols. She found the police presence disruptive.
</P>
<P>
	   When Clarke failed to show up for work on Jan. 8, one of her co-workers
drove to the duplex. He found B.J.'s body on the second floor near the top of
the stairs. He'd been shot once in the back of the head and once in the back.
His mother was a few feet away, shot twice in the back. Police said they had
been killed the night before.
</P>
<P>
	   Josephine Lee, a woman who lived across the street, is expected to be the
prosecution's key witness at the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, who cut a deal with prosecutors for a reduced sentence, told police
Russell Peeler asked his brother Adrian to kill B.J. and his mother. She said
she alerted the Peelers when the mother and son returned home from shopping,
then watched Adrian Peeler kill them.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee gave a chilling account in a statement included in arrest warrant
affidavits for the brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   She said Adrian Peeler chased B.J. and his mother up the stairs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I heard the shot and the little boy was reaching out for his mother," Lee
said. "He was yelling, 'Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy."'
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, a convicted prostitute and drug user, has an undisclosed terminal
illness. Her testimony was videotaped in November because prosecutors fear she
may die before she can testify at the trial. Testimony is not expected to begin
for another two or three months because of the lengthy jury selection process in
death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The Peelers' attorneys have made it clear they plan to go after Lee during
the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Her credibility will be strenuously challenged ... because we believe that
she is a completely un-credible witness," said Patrick Culligan, Adrian Peeler's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Culligan said Lee gave five different accounts of the killings in statements
to police and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Jonathan Benedict would not comment on Lee's testimony or the
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Since their deaths, friends of B.J. and his mother have found ways to
remember them. B.J.'s third-grade classmates at Read School planted a dogwood
tree in his honor. His friends at the Boys and Girls Club raised money to
restore a park and name it after him.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Legislature created a comprehensive witness protection program
named after B.J. and his mother. The new law stiffens penalties for intimidating
a witness.
</P>
<P>
	   In their old neighborhood, residents are reluctant to talk about the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Doreen Goodrich said that with two young sons of her own, she finds it
difficult to even think about the killings.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's devastating - for a mother," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It really concerns me a lot, especially a young child like that. He didn't
have a chance to live his life."

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton rakes in soft money for Democratic fund  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton has helped raise more than
$360,000 in unregulated soft money donations for a special Democratic fund set
up for the New York Senate race, federal records showed Tuesday.
<P>
	   The soft money donations to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
allow supporters to bypass more stringent campaign limits of $2,000 per donor on
what candidates can accept directly.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no limit on soft money contributions that can be made to pay for
issue-oriented ads and activities that do not specifically advocate voting for a
candidate. Corporations that cannot donate directly to candidates may also give
soft money. Critics of the funding scheme say it allows candidates to skirt
campaign contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton attended 11 events last year to raise money for the DSCC's "New
York Senate 2000." She helped take in cash from California, Texas and her native
Illinois, as well as New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund-raising events helped raise money for Mrs. Clinton's campaign and
the DSCC. By law, the DSCC cannot earmark contributions raised in the name of a
certain candidate to help that candidate. But DSCC officials admit they keep
track of the amounts candidates raise, and the committee's political director,
Jim Jordan, said, "we certainly anticipate spending heavily in a large state
like New York."
</P>
<P>
	   DSCC Chairman Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey said Monday that he would
spend "whatever is required to win" in the high-stakes New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of Democratic activists from Westport, Conn., topped the givers to
the DSCC's New York committee. Sandra Wagenfeld and Francine Goldstein donated a
combined $160,000, according to new disclosure reports. Neither woman could be
reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Also donating large sums were Metabolife, a San Diego-based diet pill
supplement maker that handed over $25,000, and Chicago-based television mogul
Fred Eychaner who contributed $20,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have already begun spending soft money in the New York race. They
used about $338,000 for television ads that showed footage of the first lady in
New York and asked voters to "call Hillary." At about the same time the DSCC
received a $500,000 donation from the politically powerful hospital workers
union Local 1199. The New York City union's president, Dennis Rivera, is one of
Mrs. Clinton's strongest backers.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady's most likely rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
said Tuesday he still had not made up his mind whether to forgo soft money. But
he indicated Mrs. Clinton's early use of it might force him to do so as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe you have to be competitive. I intend to get my message out,"
Giuliani said.
</P>

	   Both the Clinton and Giuliani camps have said they have raised more than
$6.6 million, the amount former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato raised in 1997 the year
before he was defeated by Charles Schumer. Neither camp will not say
specifically how much they have in the bank for the campaign filing period that
ended Dec. 31. Those financial filings are due at the end of January.

	   Officials at the National Republican Senatorial Committee said Tuesday they
have not decided whether to set up an account specifically for the New York
race. But they took a shot at Mrs. Clinton's prolific fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's given them one of their best years," Republican committee spokesman
Stuart Roy said. "They should call the DSCC the 'donations saved for the Clinton
campaign."'
</P>
<P>
	   While "victory" committees have been set up by the DSCC in six other states,
they have been dwarfed by the New York effort. The California fund, for example,
has raised only $57,000 for the DSCC, records show.

<HEADLINE> Dow Off 359.58; Nasdaq Off 229.99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices plummeted today as fears of rising interest
rates gave investors a reason to sell shares and capture gains from last year's
spectacular performance. The Nasdaq composite index, the best performer in 1999,
suffered its worst point loss in history -- down 229.99 points to 3,901.16, a
decline of 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 359.58 to close at 10,997.93, its
fourth-worst point decline ever. The Dow dropped 3.2 percent. The blue-chip
index had dipped as much as 380 points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the Dow nor the Nasdaq percentage drops were records.
</P>
<P>
	   Other stock indicators also sustained sharp losses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 55.80 to 1,399.42.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 2,239 down, 919 up and 398 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 983.61 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 921.34 million
in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 18.02 to 478.40.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued a wave of selling that began Monday as the market
balanced good news about a smooth conversion to the Year 2000 with growing fears
that runaway economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "The toggle switch moved from 'off' to 'on' regarding interest-rate
worries," said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed of
Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
	   Herrmann said investors were able to brush off concerns about rising rates
while Y2K loomed as a potential threat to the economy. With worries about
computer troubles now mostly alleviated, interest rates are once again rattling
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed left rates unchanged at its last meeting, hoping to ensure monetary
stability while Y2K concerns played out around the world. Now, central bankers
are likely to focus on continued signs of economic growth, and a stock market
that defied rising rates to set a string of new records at the close of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates typically hurt stocks by cutting into corporate
profits as it becomes more expensive to borrow money. Higher rates can be
especially devastating to high-growth stocks, whose promise of future earnings
growth may be threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, only technology stocks proved immune to the Fed's rate increases,
breaking out of a springtime lull to move to record-breaking highs by the end of
the year. But inflation jitters loomed over the broad market all year long,
contributing to a protracted slump for many stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Ironically, a decline in U.S. equities now could help assuage the Fed, which
has made no secret of its concern over stocks' lofty valuations, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The stock market has become such an important source of economic growth,"
Herrmann said. "If economic growth is too high, the Fed must continue raising
rates, and the stock market has become a real factor in that decision."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, most analysts believe today's selloff was a temporary drop in a
market that still feeds on strong corporate profits and a robust economy. The
steep decline in stocks was to be expected, and could leave the market in better
shape for another advance, said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for
Legg Mason in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market has had a very strong run," said Cripps. "Higher interest rates
are providing a catalyst for some selling that probably needs to take place
before it can go any higher."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, American Express and Hewlett-Packard led the Dow's decliners.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks also struggled as investors collected profits from a
stellar year in 1999. Traders said many investors held onto shares of
top-performing companies last year and are now selling because the taxes on
their gains won't be due until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets took little notice of President Clinton's renomination of Alan
Greenspan for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve System. The
announcement was widely expected, but traders said the market would probably
have fared worse without it.

<HEADLINE> 'People's State of State' anticipates Pataki's annual plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Activists for the poor say their message to share
the wealth is heard less today than during their first "People's State of the
State" message 11 years ago, when conservative Republicans ruled the White House
and "greed is good" was a catch phrase.
<P>
	   "Eleven years ago, (then-Gov.) Mario Cuomo at least argued whether he was
trying to help the poor. Now you don't even hear the argument," said Mark
Dunlea, executive director of Hunger Action Network of New York State. "I can't
say we're being heard more now than 11 years ago."
</P>
<P>
	   On the side steps of the capitol during a cold rain, a dozen activists used
folk songs and a takeoff on a television game show to announce mostly to
themselves their 11th People's State of the State. It plays off Gov. George
Pataki's annual State of the State address Wednesday in which he'll map out the
state's programs and spending for the next year. As many as 20,000 unionized
state workers plan to protest the speech from outside the capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   The activists for the poor on Tuesday called for Pataki and the state
Legislature to share the prosperity of an economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   Specific measures sought by the statewide coalition of activist groups
includes raising the minimum wage to $7.65 an hour, adopting a "living wage
policy" that would regularly increase the pay scale. They also called for
savings from welfare reform to further fund the Empire State Jobs Program to
create transitional jobs for welfare recipients seeking to leave or being
dropped from public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Legislature approved increasing the state's minimum wage
from $4.25 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour starting April
1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "People receiving public assistance have not had an increase in their
benefits in 10 years," said Don Friedman of the Community Food Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
	   "In that time, the value of the grant has decreased by about 25 percent," he
said. "The current level makes the meeting of the most basic human needs a
day-to-day struggle."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think if you ask people out on the street if there should be better
education, decent housing, decent jobs - all would agree," said Joe Seeman of
the Alliance for Democracy. "But you've got an entrenched system that's like the
Soviet Union."
</P>
<P>
	   He said groups like his must target individual races in the state
Legislature to change the face of power inside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunlea noted that recent weeks showed a glimmer of hope.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, lawmakers passed a $9 billion health care reform act to provide
care for as many as 1 million New Yorkers and a lobbying law aimed at making
special interest representatives more accountable for their spending to
influence public policy and law.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to be optimistic," Dunlea said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the governor didn't respond to a request for comment on the
"People's State of the State" message.

<HEADLINE> Young Chess Whiz Defeats World Champ  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- A young Hungarian chess whiz defeated the world
champion on Tuesday in the second of a series of six chess matches.
</P>
<P>
	   The win, coupled with a draw in their first encounter on Monday, leaves
Hungary's Peter Leko leading the series over Alexander Khalifman of Russia, said
Daniel Molnar, a spokesman for the event's organizers.
</P>
<P>
	   The match lasted for more than five hours, with the 21-year-old Leko winning
on the 52nd move.
</P>
<P>
	   Khalifman became world champion in Las Vegas last August. Despite holding
the title, the 33-year-old Russian is ranked 28th in the world by FIDE, the
international chess federation. Leko is eighth.
</P>

	   The match is being sponsored by the German Westfalische Ferngas AG. The
winner will get $10,280 and his opponent, $5,140.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, Israeli Leaders Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- A procedural hang-up resolved, President Clinton
brought together Israel's prime minister and the foreign minister of Syria for
an hour-long face-to-face meeting Tuesday aimed at setting their countries on a
course toward peace.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called the session ``more of a
general discussion'' than negotiations over hard issues. But he said Clinton,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa had ``a very
constructive and productive discussion that put the process clearly on track.''
</P>
<P>
	   They ``reaffirmed their commitment to the process,'' Rubin said, but he said
Barak and al-Sharaa still apparently did not shake hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton met for half an hour with Barak before al-Sharaa joined them. A
similar three-way session was canceled Monday night in a wrangle over what
should be negotiated first.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first face-to-face session between Barak and al-Sharaa, and
committees assigned to grapple with terms of a peace accord were to begin
meeting later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the talks will continue at least for the rest of this week. ``I
don't have an end point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the two sides were ``getting
down to business.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later Tuesday, Clinton was giving a reception for the Israeli and Syrian
delegations before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his relatively upbeat assessment of the first meeting, Rubin said it
is unlikely an accord can be reached by the end of the week on peace terms, an
Israeli pullback on the Golan Heights and new security arrangements on the
Israel-Syria border.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the first time in almost four years that Israel and Syria have met
to deal with issues of substance. Having Barak and al-Sharaa talk about them
face-to-face, under Clinton's auspices, gives new meaning to the decades-old
U.S. drive to gain Arab recognition of the Jewish state in exchange for
Israeli-held territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin would not say how Monday night's dispute was smoothed over during a
meeting between Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got a good start yesterday,'' Rubin said. ``There was a procedural
hang-up in the evening. That hang-up has been overcome.''
</P>
<P>
	   With a light rain falling on the oldest town in West Virginia, where talks
are being held at a federal center off-limits to reporters, Clinton arrived from
Washington in a motorcade for his second consecutive day of mediating with Barak
and al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   The second day of talks also brought out protesters from Brooklyn, N.Y. --
about 40 of them, led by Orthodox Jews who oppose the proposed Israeli turnover
of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Golan is our security,'' said protest leader Levi Huebner. ``Peace
will be in security and trust in our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, 20 rabbis linked to the Jewish settlement movement ruled that the
Golan Heights are part of biblical Israel and that Israeli communities cannot be
removed from the territory.
</P>
<P>
	   While Israel's secular majority does not follow rabbinical strictures, the
ruling may make it more difficult for Barak to get a land-for-peace agreement
approved in a national referendum. It is expected that as part of such an
agreement, the 17,000 Israelis living in 33 communities would be forced to
leave.
</P>
<P>
	   In Damascus, meanwhile, the state-run Syria Times said a ``deep freeze''
could follow if the West Virginia talks are not successful.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless there is a breakthrough very soon, the whole process for making
peace will come to a dangerous recess,'' the English-language daily said.
``Until the Israelis summon the courage to move forward, no real breakthrough is
likely to occur.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said committees had been formed to take up all key issues, and that
none would be overlooked by the two sides. He included terms of the peace Syria
is offering in return for the strategic Golan Heights, a border plateau Israel
has held since the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
	   Having swapped the Sinai for little more than a diplomatically correct peace
treaty in 1979 with Egypt, Israel is looking for more than simply recognition
from Syria, with which it has fought three wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Its aim is an exchange of ambassadors, commercial ties and the kind of
acceptance the Arabs have been reluctant to extend to Israel since its creation
52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday night's procedural dispute centered on Israel's demand to take up
peace terms and security first, and Syria's to deal first with an Israeli
pullback from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon, speaking on Israeli Army radio, accused
the Syrians of reneging on an understanding that talks begin where they left off
nearly four years ago, with discussion of peace terms and security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was with the concurrence of the Americans and the Syrians. It was
clear,'' Ramon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are embarking on tough, problematical negotiations, in which we say to
the other side if you break agreements there will be no negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said, meanwhile, the hurdle was
overcome with an American proposal that the committees meet simultaneously.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, he told The Associated Press the committees
were assigned to deal with border demarcation, water, security and normalization
of relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who has made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000, has
signaled that he is available all week long to assist, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a White House ceremony announcing his nomination of Alan
Greenspan to a fourth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Clinton said: ``I
wish I could have so much success in the Middle East peace talks. I just ask
them and they say yes, the way Mr. Greenspan did. It would be joy.''

<HEADLINE> Clooney To Star in TV's 'Fail-Safe'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- "ER" departee George Clooney returns to television to star
in "Fail-Safe," a TV play scheduled for live broadcast Sunday, April 9, on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   The drama is based on both the 1962 bestselling novel and the 1964 feature
film of the same name, in which Cold War tensions mount when a U.S. bomber is
accidentally ordered to drop a nuclear warhead on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Clooney plays Col. Jack Grady, the U.S. Air Force bomber pilot assigned to
what he imagines will be another routine flight. Edward Binns played that role
in the film, which starred Henry Fonda as the U.S. president and was directed by
Sidney Lumet.
</P>
<P>
	   Clooney, who was part of the "ER" ensemble's live telecast in September
1997, will also serve as executive producer of "Fail-Safe."

<HEADLINE> One day into trial, serial killer admits two more murders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A man already convicted of killing three women
on Long Island admitted Tuesday that he had murdered two more who were found
crammed into garbage cans in Westchester.
<P>
	   Robert Shulman, 35, who was sentenced to death after his previous trial in
Suffolk County, now faces up to 25 years to life in prison after pleading guilty
in Westchester to two counts of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said they pursued the case to make sure Shulman would be
punished even if he won an appeal on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will guarantee that he dies in prison, either way," District Attorney
Jeanine Pirro said after the plea. "He'll go by lethal injection or by natural
causes."
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, 45, pleaded guilty one day after his trial began with prosecutor
Robert Neary telling the jury that Shulman had admitted the killings and that
DNA tests had matched the victims' blood to stains in Shulman's Hicksville
apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman was accused of killing Lori Vasquez of Brooklyn, 24, and a woman who
could not be identified after Shulman cut her up. The remains were found in
plastic garbage pails in Yonkers in 1991 and 1992, before the state had a death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor said Shulman often picked up prostitutes and shared crack
with them at his apartment. Sometimes he didn't let them out alive. He used bats
and barbells to kill them, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   Yonkers police Officer William Howell testified Monday about finding the
garbage can that held Ms. Vasquez's body and peering inside to see a human hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman's brother, Barry Shulman, was convicted in Suffolk of helping his
brother dump bodies and faces similar charges in Westchester.

<HEADLINE> Jail guard accused in fatal beating of inmate pleads guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) - Only days before jury selection was to begin, one
of four guards accused in the fatal beating of a Nassau County Jail inmate
pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal conspiracy and witness tampering charges.
<P>
	   Ivano Bavaro, who had previously maintained his innocence, entered the
surprise guilty plea before U.S. District Court Judge Jacob Mishler. Bavaro's
attorney, Edward Jenks, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors alleged that Bavaro acted as a lookout while two other guards -
Patrick Regnier and Edward Velazquez - went into Thomas Pizzuto's cell on Jan.
8, 1999, and beat the recovering heroin addict as he cried out for his methadone
treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The 38-year-old prisoner from Hicksville, who had been serving a 90-day
sentence for traffic violations, suffered a seizure three days after the alleged
beating and died. The Nassau County medical examiner ruled the death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth guard, Joseph Bergen, was accused of filing a false report
indicating that Pizzuto had slipped in the shower. Jury selection is to begin
Monday in the trial against Regnier, Velazquez and Bergen.
</P>
<P>
	   Bavaro's expected testimony in that case could affect the length of his
prison sentence, which could be up to 10 years. Sentencing was scheduled for
March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   All four guards, who were arrested last May, have been suspended without
pay. With the guilty plea, Bavaro is expected to be fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting Sheriff Peter R. Heelan, who oversees operations at the jail, said
his department has cooperated with investigators and will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are committed to discovering the truth surrounding the death of Mr.
Pizzuto and will reserve final judgment until all of the evidence has been
presented," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Lemke, the attorney for Velazquez, said he was "extremely surprised"
by the change of plea.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know exactly what he has said, so I don't know if it's the truth or
if he's merely changing the story around to protect himself from trial," Lemke
said of Bavaro.
</P>
<P>
	   Ernest Peace, who represents Regnier, was out of town and unavailable for
comment. Ben Gullo, who is Bergen's attorney, maintained that his client is
innocent and wasn't at the jail at the time of the alleged attack. He also said
he was not aware of any conversations between Bergen and Bavaro that would
indicate a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're very, very pleased that the federal prosecutors have handled this
case as aggressively and professionally as they have," said Peter Neufeld, an
attorney representing the Pizzuto family. "We believe that ultimately justice
will prevail and the people responsible for Tommy's death will be convicted and
sentenced appropriately."
</P>
<P>
	   Neufeld has filed notice of an impending civil suit against the jail on
behalf of the Pizzutos, but said Tuesday that he was awaiting the outcome of the
criminal trial before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
	   The East Meadow jail, which houses about 1,800 inmates and is patrolled by
approximately 1,100 guards, has been the subject of numerous allegations of
guard misconduct. Following the death of Pizzuto and other allegations of abuse,
the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of how inmates are
treated.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for Nassau County Executive Thomas Gulotta did not immediately
return a call for comment.

of 5.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 359.58 to
close at 10,997.93, its fourth-worst point decline ever. The Dow
dropped 3.2 percent. The blue-chip index had dipped as much as 380
points earlier in the session. Neither the Dow nor the Nasdaq

	   Clinton Renominates Greenspan
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Greenspan, who has guided the nation's
monetary policy since Ronald Reagan was president, was nominated
today by President Clinton to serve a fourth term as chairman of
the Federal Reserve. With Greenspan at his side in the Oval Office,
Clinton ticked off a list of economic achievements during his
administration and added: ``Clearly, wise leadership from the Fed
has played a very large role in our strong economy.'' It had been
widely expected that Clinton would nominate the highly regarded
Greenspan for a fourth term but the timing of the announcement came
as a surprise. The nomination must be confirmed by the Senate and
Greenspan, a Republican, is expected to have little trouble getting
the nod. Greenspan praised the Federal Reserve, and said he enjoyed
working there.

	   Construction Spending Jumps 2.6 Pct.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending rose 2.6 percent in
November, the biggest increase in 17 months, led by much higher
government spending on highways and schools. The Commerce
Department reported today that the escalation in November followed
three consecutive monthly declines. The big jump in building
activity was well over the 0.3 percent advance analysts had
expected. Many analysts said the strength in construction, one of
the most interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy, means the
Federal Reserve will feel compelled to raise interest rates further
in coming months to slow down the red-hot U.S. economy.

	   Technology, Japan Funds Rule in '99
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The top performing mutual funds in 1999 focused
either on technology stocks or Japanese companies. Five of the top
10 performing funds last year as ranked by Lipper Inc., a New York
firm that tracks mutual funds, were rife with technology stocks.
And four others in the top 10 focused either exclusively on Japan
or on all of Asia. Nicholas-Applegate's Global Technology fund was
the year's top performer, with a one-year gain of 493.7 percent,
according to Lipper. In second place was the Warburg Pincus Japan
Small Companies fund, which rose 328.7 percent.

	   Europe Economy, Rates Discussed
</P>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The influential German economic
institute DEW warned today that an interest rate hike by the
European Central Bank would jeopardize predictions for an economic
comeback in the countries using Europe's common currency, the euro.
The report came on the eve of tomorrow's ECB meeting, where the
bank's governing board was expected to discuss the merits of a
further rate increase to guard against inflation. Economists
speculate another hike could be in the works as early as March, and
that central bank chief Wim Duisenburg might signal the bank's
intentions after the regular meeting.

	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Until now, Microsoft's strategy toward
consumer electronics and the Internet has been somewhat slapdash.
But as chairman Bill Gates prepares to address his first Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas tomorrow, there are signs the
25-year-old company is taking its consumer computing strategy in a
new direction. Microsoft is not abandoning its core computer
software business. But Gates is expected to introduce a new version
of The Microsoft Network's mobile operating system, which will
allow users to get e-mail from cell phones. Gates' primary focus,
though, will be on trying to sell electronics manufacturers on his

<HEADLINE> Peterson released after serving 18 months for death of newborn son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WYCKOFF, N.J. (AP) - A young man went home to his parents on Tuesday
after serving an 18-month prison sentence for killing his newborn son.
<P>
	   A thin, pale Brian Peterson hugged his lawyer and visited his pets after his
release from the Webb Correctional Facility in Price's Corner, Del. He later
stood in the front yard of his parents' home and read a statement apologizing
"for my part in the tragic events that occurred three years ago."
</P>
<P>
	   He thanked people who supported him and said, "I can assure everyone that I
will reward their confidence in me and make them proud of me in the future."
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson, who had been a freshman at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania,
plans to try to enroll in college again and to begin the 300 hours of community
service that is a requirement of his two-year probation, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   What the 21-year-old learned most of all from his ordeal was that he should
have confided in his parents or other adults after learning that his girlfriend,
Amy Grossberg, was pregnant, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're 18 years old and you have a big problem, you have to get help,"
said Peterson attorney Russell Gioiella.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson and Ms. Grossberg were both in their first year of college when
they went to a Newark, Del., motel room near Ms. Grossberg's University of
Delaware campus on Nov. 12, 1996, and delivered a baby boy.
</P>
<P>
	   The baby's body was found wrapped in a plastic bag in a trash bin in the
motel's parking lot. The couple, both 18 at the time, had said they believed the
child was stillborn when Peterson placed it there. But the medical examiner's
office said the boy died of skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson pleaded guilty to manslaughter in March 1998 and agreed to
cooperate with authorities in Ms. Grossberg's trial. Ms. Grossberg pleaded
guilty a month later. She was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison and is
scheduled to be released in May from the Baylor Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
	   "She'd like to be coming home today as well," said her attorney, John Malik,
who had argued in court that both youths should receive identical prison
sentences. Peterson received a two-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Grossberg is tutoring inmates in prison and mops the floor twice a day
as a hall janitor, Malik said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson was released early from his sentence because of time served before
his guilty plea and good behavior, state corrections spokeswoman Elizabeth Welch
said. She described him as a model inmate who tutored other prisoners and worked
in the commissary and kitchen.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, a judge denied a request by Peterson's attorney to reduce his
sentence by three weeks so he could spend Christmas with his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson walked out of the Delaware prison with his arm around his mother
Tuesday morning and ate an Entenmann's chocolate doughnut on the ride back to
Wyckoff.
</P>
<P>
	   He hugged his lawyer, Jack Litman, outside the house. Inside, he visited his
pet fish and his cat, Princess, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson doesn't have immediate goals beyond school, Gioiella said, noting
that he was still young. But "he matured a lot by tragedy," he said. "Brian has
suffered a lot. I'm sure Amy has as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson does not plan to have future contact with Ms. Grossberg, Litman
said. Malik said he didn't know whether Ms. Grossberg wanted to see Peterson
again.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Makes Offer on Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has asked Cuba to let Elian
Gonzalez's father escort him back to the island if U.S. officials decide the boy
should return to Cuba, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said the request is a contingency plan and does not signal a
decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to resolve the
politically charged issue by sending Elian back to his homeland. The official,
asking not to be identified, said Cuba is considering the request.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was retrieved from an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25.
He had been aboard a Florida-bound boat that capsized, killing 10 other
passengers, including his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   A tug of war has developed over Elian. The Cuban government wants him
returned to Cuba to be raised by his father, while his relatives in Miami and
many Cuban exiles insist he would have a better life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   As controversy continued to swirl around the boy, he began attending classes
at the private Lincoln-Marti School in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. He
wore the school uniform of a white dress shirt and blue pants, and carried a
book bag.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, told U.S. National Council of
Churches officials in Cuba, ``I should be in charge of my child's education,
where he goes to school and what kind of schooling he receives.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, said a decision by the father to
apply for a non-immigrant visa would be welcome. But for Gonzalez to make the
trip, he also would need travel documents from the Cuban government, Rubin
noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The other U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said there were two
main reasons for suggesting as a contingency plan that the father be allowed to
travel to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said it would make more sense for the father to escort the boy
back to Cuba than anyone else. Secondly, if the father were in Miami, it would
ease concerns among Cuban-Americans that he currently is not free to speak his
mind because of Cuba's tight controls over its citizenry.
</P>
<P>
	   But the free speech issue still would not be resolved, contended Spencer
Eig, a Miami attorney representing Elian's great-uncle who, along with his
great-aunt, have been caring for the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel that if Juan Miguel Gonzalez comes alone, leaving his new wife and
child under the control of the Cuban government, then he'll still be under
duress,'' said Eig. ``This case should be settled by a fair and impartial
decision maker with Elian Gonzalez's best interest as the sole issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two days after the boy was rescued, Cuban President Fidel Castro demanded
that the boy be returned to Cuba within 72 hours. He relented on that demand and
also has backed off his insistence that no meeting between the father and INS
officials would be allowed except to inform him of the date of Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   INS officials have had two meetings in Cuba with the father, including one
on New Year's Eve. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the father denied
to the INS officials that he was speaking under duress. There were no Cuban
officials present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has set a Jan. 21 hearing on the case but INS officials said this
does not preclude an earlier decision.
</P>
<P>
	   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said Tuesday in Washington that the agency has
told Cuban officials it is interested in resolving the issue quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Another INS spokesman, Russ Bergeron, said Cuba would have no assurances
that Juan Miguel Gonzalez would return to the island if he got the green light
to travel to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anyone who is physically in the United States can ask for asylum,''
Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another regulation, however, allows the State Department to issue a
non-immigrant visa only if it is convinced that the applicant does not intend to
remain in the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Helps ABC's Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The millennium helped hurl ABC into the winner's circle for
the first Nielsen report of year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The three prime-time hours of "ABC 2000," the network's round-the-clock
millennium extravaganza, won its time slot with an average 18.6 million viewers.
The 10.6 household rating for that portion of "ABC 2000" tied for eighth place
with NBC's "Frasier."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC also scored with sports, including "NFL Monday Night Football" (3rd
place) and "The Orange Bowl" (6th place).
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, ABC won for the week of Dec. 27-Jan 2, with an average prime-time
audience of 14 million viewers (9.0 household rating, 15 share), according to
Nielsen Media Research figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Nielsen data that omits one 30-minute measurement, CBS ranked
second with 12.5 million viewers (8.3 household rating, 14 share). That network
had four shows in the Top 10, including the TV film "Beyond the Prairie: The
True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder" and "60 Minutes," which were top-ranked and
runnerup, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC had 10.2 million viewers (6.8 rating, 12 share) and Fox had 8.1 million
viewers (5.1 rating, 9 share).
</P>
<P>
	   UPN had 3.9 million viewers (2.5 rating, 4 share), while the WB had 3.0
million viewers (2.1 rating, 3 share). The Pax network had 1.1 million viewers
(0.8 rating, 1 share).
</P>
<P>
	   For the century's final prime-time race last Friday, NBC came in a distant
second to ABC with "Dateline NBC" and a two-hour news special that averaged 9.6
million viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS' Friday lineup, which included a "Late Show with David Letterman"
special, "Grammy's Greatest Performances" and "America's Millennium" (a live
telecast of the outdoor concert in Washington, D.C.), averaged 7.6 million
viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the evening news derby (measuring Monday through Thursday), ABC's "World
News Tonight" tied for first place with customary frontrunner "NBC Nightly
News." Both had an 8.5 rating and 17 share, with NBC narrowly edging out ABC in
total viewers (12.01 million to 11.98 million). "CBS Evening News" had 9.42
total million viewers (6.9 rating, 13 share).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Dec. 27-Jan. 2, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were: "CBS Sunday Movie: 'Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls
Wilder,"' CBS, 15.3; "60 Minutes," CBS, 14.5; "NFL Monday Night Football: N.Y.
Jets at Miami," ABC, 14.4; "Touched By an Angel," CBS, 14.2; "Rose Bowl
Post-game," ABC, 11.9; "Orange Bowl: Alabama vs. Michigan," ABC, 11.3; "NFL
Monday Showcase," ABC, 10.9; tied: "ABC 2000," ABC, and "Frasier," NBC, both
10.6; "Everybody Loves Raymond," CBS, 10.5.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renominates Greenspan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Greenspan was nominated for a fourth term as
chairman of the Federal Reserve on Tuesday by President Clinton, who praised the
73-year-old Republican economist for helping pilot the U.S. economy to what will
soon become the longest economic expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
	   In accepting Clinton's request to stay on the job another four years,
Greenspan joked that it was "like eating peanuts. You keep doing it, keep doing
it and you never get tired, because the future is always unknowable."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Wall Street holds Greenspan in the highest regard, the announcement
of a fourth term did not prevent a plummet in stock prices Tuesday. The Dow
Jones industrial average suffered its fourth-worst point decline in history,
dropping 359.58 points to close at 10,997.93.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts blamed the precipitous drop on rising fears of further Fed interest
rate increases rather than the Greenspan announcement. However, some did say
those rate increases were more likely now that Clinton has removed any
uncertainty about renominating Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who praised Greenspan's "rare combination of technical expertise,
sophisticated analysis and old-fashioned common sense," announced his decision
during a brief Oval Office ceremony with Greenspan at his side.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, wise leadership from the Fed has played a very large role in our
strong economy," Clinton said, noting that unemployment is at a 30-year low and
next month the current expansion will become the longest in U.S. history,
surpassing the old record set in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   It had been widely expected that Clinton would nominate the highly regarded
Greenspan for a fourth term. Greenspan's current term ends June 20 and it had
been considered unlikely that the Republican-controlled Senate would have
approved any choice other than Greenspan in Clinton's last year in office.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan stressed in his Oval Office remarks that he had enjoyed every
minute of his more than 12 years as Fed chairman, joking about his well-known
love of economic statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really been an extraordinary challenge and especially for an economist
who likes to get into the nitty-gritty of every statistic you've ever seen,"
said Greenspan, who has said he spends a couple of hours most mornings in his
bathtub poring over the latest batch of economic statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Various Republican presidential candidates including Texas Gov. George Bush
had urged Clinton to end the suspense and announce Greenspan's renomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the nomination should sail
through the Senate, and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
announced he would expedite the nomination, scheduling a hearing for Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan became Fed chairman -- often called the nation's second most
powerful job -- on Aug. 11, 1987, when then-President Reagan tapped him to
succeed Paul Volcker.
</P>
<P>
	   In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Volcker drove up interest rates to levels
not seen since the Civil War in a successful effort to tame double-digit
inflation triggered by the oil shocks of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan had only been in office two months when Wall Street was hit by
Black Monday, a 508-point crash, the largest point decline at the time. He
quickly assembled a crisis management team and won praise for deft moves that
kept the market meltdown from broadening into a banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed has raised interest rates three times since last June and more rate
increases are expected. Nevertheless, economists give Greenspan credit for
arguing against faster rate boosts even as the unemployment rate fell far below
the 6 percent that economists once feared would trigger inflationary pressures.
It currently stands at 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Greenspan contended that Americans' productivity was now at a
higher level, letting the economy grow at a faster rate than previously believed
possible without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan did voice worries about "irrational exuberance" in the stock
market in December 1996, but he has stood back and let investors carry stock
prices to ever-higher levels since that time without trying to use interest rate
policies to deflate the boom.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan has been an extremely innovative Fed chairman," said Allen Sinai,
chief economist for Primark Global Economics in New York. "He has shown an
uncanny ability to sniff out major structural changes in the economy that have
made some of the old rules obsolete."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, whose administration has restrained itself from criticizing the Fed
even when it raised interest rates, told Greenspan he appreciated "the many
conversations we've had over the last seven years" on the economy and praised
his support for the landmark banking legislation enacted last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was nominated for a second term in 1991 by then-President Bush
even though Bush's treasury secretary, Nicholas Brady, had fumed that Greenspan
had been too slow in cutting interest rates and blamed the Fed in part for the
recession that allowed Clinton to beat Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton nominated Greenspan for a third four-year term in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Feds Appeal Indian Fund Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge lacks the authority to oversee reforms in
a $500 million system of trust funds for American Indians, Justice Department
lawyers said in a challenge of the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled last month that the federal
government violated its responsibility to safeguard the money in more than
300,000 accounts for individual Indians. Lamberth put himself in charge of
supervising efforts to fix problems with the accounts, requiring the government
to file progress reports every three months for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court Monday to consider a
challenge to Lamberth's ruling. The court could reject the request or decide to
hear arguments on the government's appeal from both sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Government lawyers argue that Lamberth's ruling went too far. They say the
Interior Department should be allowed to finish reforms directed by a 1994
federal law before any court intervention, and the judge should be able to
intervene only after the department's plans are completed or if they were
delayed improperly.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for the Indians said Tuesday he was puzzled by the challenge to
Lamberth's ruling. Interior Department officials said they were pleased Lamberth
did not put the trust system into receivership, Native American Rights Fund
lawyer Keith Harper said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We rarely see people appeal what they define themselves as victories,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of Indians sued the Interior and Treasury departments in 1996 over
more than a century of mismanagement of the trust funds. The accounts include
proceeds from leases of Indian lands for farming, grazing, oil drilling and the
like.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamberth ruled the accounts were so mismanaged that the government cannot
say precisely how many there are or how much money should be in them. He ruled
that the Interior Department's plans for new computer systems and other changes
could rectify the problems but kept oversight of the reforms to ensure the plans
are carried out.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also ruled that a second trial in the case would focus on
accounting for how much money should be in the accounts. Eloise Cobell, the
Blackfeet banker who is the lawsuit's lead plaintiff, contends the amount could
be $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Government lawyers also objected to Lamberth's plans for the second trial,
saying the judge has no authority to order the accounts to be reconciled
``without regard to when the funds were deposited.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Interior Department is readying a plan to determine each correct account
balance and will announce the plan by March 1, government lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What they're arguing, essentially, is they should be able to do an
accounting any way they want, to interpret the statute the way they see fit, and
then take any actions they think they need to,'' Harper said. ``We don't believe
so, and Judge Lamberth doesn't believe so.''

<HEADLINE> Jury selection begins for brothers accused in boy witness slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP)- On the quiet cul-de-sac where 8-year-old Leroy
"B.J." Brown Jr. lived with his mother, there are no traces of the horror that
ended their lives.
<P>
	   No blood, no bullet casings, no yellow police tape cordoning off the
wood-shingled duplex where they lived.
</P>
<P>
	   It's been almost a year since B.J. and his mother were gunned down in their
home as they returned from a trip to the grocery store. Jury selection is
scheduled to begin Thursday in the trial of two brothers accused in the
killings.
</P>
<P>
	   B.J. was scheduled to be a key prosecution witness against one of the men.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell Peeler Jr., 27, and his brother, Adrian Peeler, 24, are accused of
killing B.J. and his mother, Karen Clarke, to stop the boy from testifying
against Russell in the 1998 murder of Clarke's boyfriend. Both brothers face the
possibility of the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Memories of the slayings are still painful to those who knew B.J. and his
mother.
</P>
<P>
	   "Amongst the children, whenever his name is brought up, there is a sadness,"
said Carlos Collazo, a counselor at the Boys and Girls Club of Bridgeport, where
B.J. spent many hours after school playing basketball, air hockey and kickball.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's also an anger. It shouldn't have came down that way," Collazo said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the killings, police and prosecutors were harshly criticized for not
protecting the mother and son after the boy had promised to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   A year earlier, B.J., at the age of 7, had become an unwitting witness as he
rode in a car with his mother's boyfriend, Rudy Snead. Another car pulled
alongside them and someone began firing at Snead, grazing him in the forehead.
B.J. saw the gunman's face.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine months later, a man walked into the Boston Avenue Barber Shop and
pumped seven bullets into Snead. Suddenly, B.J. became the key witness in a
murder trial. He picked out Russell Peeler's photograph for police.
</P>
<P>
	   After B.J. agreed to testify against Peeler, police placed special patrols
near B.J.'s house. But after just a few days, his mother asked police to stop
the patrols. She found the police presence disruptive.
</P>
<P>
	   When Clarke failed to show up for work on Jan. 8, one of her co-workers
drove to the duplex. He found B.J.'s body on the second floor near the top of
the stairs. He'd been shot once in the back of the head and once in the back.
His mother was a few feet away, shot twice in the back. Police said they had
been killed the night before.
</P>
<P>
	   Josephine Lee, a woman who lived across the street, is expected to be the
prosecution's key witness at the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, who cut a deal with prosecutors for a reduced sentence, told police
Russell Peeler asked his brother Adrian to kill B.J. and his mother. She said
she alerted the Peelers when the mother and son returned home from shopping,
then watched Adrian Peeler kill them.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee gave a chilling account in a statement included in arrest warrant
affidavits for the brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   She said Adrian Peeler chased B.J. and his mother up the stairs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I heard the shot and the little boy was reaching out for his mother," Lee
said. "He was yelling, 'Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy."'
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, a convicted prostitute and drug user, has an undisclosed terminal
illness. Her testimony was videotaped in November because prosecutors fear she
may die before she can testify at the trial. Testimony is not expected to begin
for another two or three months because of the lengthy jury selection process in
death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The Peelers' attorneys have made it clear they plan to go after Lee during
the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Her credibility will be strenuously challenged ... because we believe that
she is a completely un-credible witness," said Patrick Culligan, Adrian Peeler's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Culligan said Lee gave five different accounts of the killings in statements
to police and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Jonathan Benedict would not comment on Lee's testimony or the
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Since their deaths, friends of B.J. and his mother have found ways to
remember them. B.J.'s third-grade classmates at Read School planted a dogwood
tree in his honor. His friends at the Boys and Girls Club raised money to
restore a park and name it after him.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Legislature created a comprehensive witness protection program
named after B.J. and his mother. The new law stiffens penalties for intimidating
a witness.
</P>
<P>
	   In their old neighborhood, residents are reluctant to talk about the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Doreen Goodrich said that with two young sons of her own, she finds it
difficult to even think about the killings.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's devastating - for a mother," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It really concerns me a lot, especially a young child like that. He didn't
have a chance to live his life."

<HEADLINE> Pataki to propose $700 million business tax cut package in address  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Saying business tax incentives spur economic growth,
Gov. George Pataki on Tuesday proposed more than $700 million in new business
tax cuts that he says will equal $2.3 billion in tax savings by April 2001 when
added to previous tax cuts.
<P>
	   Pataki said his plan puts "in place new job-creating tax cuts to spur
economic growth across the state, particularly in upstate communities."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki wants to eliminate the gross receipts tax on energy, give a new tax
credit to spur job growth in cities, give new tax cuts for farmers and
environmentally-friendly companies, create upstate "high-tech" enterprise zones,
expand low-cost power for businesses and to cut taxes for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now have more private-sector jobs upstate than ever before in history
but we must do even more to create jobs and opportunities for the people of New
York," Pataki said. "This job-creating plan will ensure that every corner of New
York shares fully in our economic revival."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will outline more of his plan in Wednesday's State of the State
address at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP governor called the elimination of all gross receipt taxes on energy
for businesses and residences as the most important component of his plan. When
fully effective, that proposal would provide $500 million in tax savings
statewide for businesses and industries, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Legislature must approve Pataki's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Republicans also proposed the elimination of the "onerous"
gross receipts tax on energy last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elimination of the GRT is critical to maintaining New York's unrivaled
economic resurgence, especially upstate where business and industry accounts for
the major portion of this tax paid to the state through higher electric and gas
bills," Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for comment on Pataki's proposal
were not immediately returned. Silver will give the Democrats' response to
Pataki after the State of the State address Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's plan got good reviews from the state Business Council. "This gives
us good reason to hope that the GRT will be eliminated," council spokesman
Robert Ward said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other parts of Pataki's plan include:
</P>
<P>
	   - Expanding the Power for Jobs program to give businesses an extra $20
million in savings. Power for Jobs was conceived as a way of providing
lower-cost electricity to businesses and groups which say they need the cost
savings to create or maintain jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   - Creating upstate high technology enterprise zones, which are supposed to
promote high technology economic development in upstate areas where employment
growth is below the statewide average, and upstate urban job creation tax
credits, which provides a tax credit of as much as $1,000 per job for employers
who either open new companies or expand existing businesses that create a
minimum of 25 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   - Reducing small business corporate franchise tax rates from 7.5 percent to
6.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   - Allowing farmers whose homes are part of their incorporated farming
businesses to take advantage of the school tax relief or STAR tax rebate
program. That would save farmers about $1 million annually after going into
effect in the 2000-01 school year, Pataki said.

<HEADLINE> Santana Leads Grammy Nominees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Carlos Santana, whose career caught fire when
he gave a scorching performance at Woodstock in 1969, received 10 Grammy
nominations Tuesday for his commercial comeback album, "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old guitarist, who previously had received just five nominations
overall, led all nominees for the 42nd annual Grammys.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernatural," Santana's best-selling collaboration with such stars as Eric
Clapton and Lauryn Hill, was nominated for best album and rock album.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana was also nominated for record of the year for "Smooth," which
featured Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 and was Santana's first No. 1 single.
"Smooth" and Santana's "Love of My Life" with Dave Matthews accounted for two of
the five nominees for pop vocal collaboration.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've heard that the way the music rules apply, only 17 to 27 years old is
cool. Well, surprise," Santana said. "You know, there's a reason why teen-agers
listen to '60s music, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Santana: They need to
pass through us to get to their thing."
</P>
<P>
	   In pop music categories, the group TLC was second with six nominations for
the album "FanMail."
</P>
<P>
	   "I was really shocked," TLC member Chilli said. "I can't wait to call my
group members because they have no idea."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides album of the year, TLC's nominations included best rhythm and blues
album, record of the year for "No Scrubs," and pop vocal performance by a duo or
group for "Unpretty."
</P>
<P>
	   Classical conductor Pierre Boulez also received six nominations. Other
multiple nominees included Asleep at the Wheel with five, and the Backstreet
Boys, Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, Hill and Whitney Houston, all with four
apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   The best new artist nominees were Christina Aguilera, Macy Gray, Kid Rock,
Britney Spears and Susan Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Santana's "Smooth," other nominees for record of the year were "I
Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys, "Believe" by Cher, "Livin' La Vida
Loca" by Ricky Martin and "No Scrubs" by TLC.
</P>
<P>
	   The other album of the year nominees were "Millennium" by Backstreet Boys,
"Fly" by the Dixie Chicks and "When I Look in Your Eyes" by Diana Krall.
</P>
<P>
	   By nominating Asleep at the Wheel for five awards and band leader Ray Benson
for one, Grammy voters showed a taste for western swing music -- which combines
big band and country.
</P>
<P>
	   The group is up for best country album for "Ride With Bob"; best country
instrumental for "Bob's Breakdown"; best long form music video; and is twice
nominated for best country collaboration with vocals, one for a duet with the
Dixie Chicks and the other for one featuring Manhattan Transfer and Willie
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is just wonderful," Benson said. "It's infectious kind of music to
make, crossing all those borders into pop and jazz and all that. I think it
brings a musicality quotient because it's a kind of music which takes a good bit
of musical ability to play."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, whose only Grammy win is a rock instrumental award in 1988, also
picked up nominations for pop instrumental for "El Farol," pop vocal performance
by a duo or group for "Maria Maria" and rock instrumental for "The Calling," a
collaboration with Clapton.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana has put out 29 albums over 30 years, but it has been many years
since he has had a major commercial success. He said that the nominations
Tuesday were gratifying but that he had never felt slighted.
</P>
<P>
	   "Things come when they come," Santana said. "I always felt my reward was for
Miles Davis to call my house, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Buddy Guy, B.B.
King. When people like these call my house, those are my Grammys, my Oscars, my
Emmys, my Tonys. I know I'm connected with some of the very, very important
people on the planet."
</P>
<P>
	   The Grammys will be awarded Feb. 23 in a CBS broadcast from the Staples
Center in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Workplace Rules Protect Home Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans who work at home should expect to be covered by
the same safety standards that apply in their companies' offices, says a federal
advisory that outlines how traditional workplace protections affect the growing
number of people who telecommute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ensuring safe and healthful working conditions for the employee should be
a precondition for any home-based work assignments,'' said the Labor
Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The advisory came in a letter to a Texas-based credit services company that
had sought advice about moving some of its sales executives into home offices.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, OSHA provided clear examples in an area that had been murky,
even as the number of Americans regularly working at home has swelled to almost
20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Such federal advisory letters to individual companies often are made public,
and other businesses look to them for general guidance.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said Tuesday that in this case, the advice was
intended for a specific company and should not be taken out of that context.
However, she said, it raises questions that may eventually need to be addressed
more broadly with new laws or regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope that for businesses that happen to see this letter that it does
raise the important questions that we should be asking ... what are the new
issues of the workplace of the future?'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA officials said Tuesday there has been no change in government policy
and the agency will take no new action. There will be no government inspections
of home offices, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency did suggest, in its advisory, that companies should periodically
inspect at-home workers' quarters themselves, as well as train people to set up
safe home offices. Some large companies already have written safety agreements
with or offered guidance to telecommuting employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Business groups that called attention this week to the OSHA action said it
creates a greater legal burden on employers, which could have a chilling effect
on at-home work arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At a time when we want to provide a maximum amount of flexibility to
workers, this new policy announcement just flies in the face of that,'' said
U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokesman Frank Coleman.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, called OSHA's action ``an
outrageous extension of the Washington bureaucracy into the lives of working men
and women across America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders had already vowed to scrutinize OSHA after Congress
returns from its holiday break because of regulations the agency proposed in
November that would require employers to minimize everyday physical -- or
``ergonomic'' -- stresses of certain jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA's advisory on at-home work -- directed to CSC Credit Services of
Houston, Texas, and dated Nov. 15 -- said companies should provide necessary
protective equipment and guidance against hazards that will ensure home offices
are set up safely. An example of such a hazard, it said, is a computer that
could overload electrical circuits in a residence and create a fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the advisory, employers can be held liable if they know or
should reasonably have known about home workplace hazards, even rickety stairs
leading to a basement office that result in a fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal experts said if a fall were caused by a child's toy left on an
otherwise safe stairway, that likely would be considered beyond a company's
control.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, OSHA said companies aren't liable if a worker is injured in a
home office while doing something other than working, such as eating lunch.
Also, hazardous conditions elsewhere in the home are not the company's
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA did not specifically address whether someone who works at home and is
injured on the job would be entitled to normal workman's compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   That's implied, however, said AFL-CIO director of safety and health, Peg
Seminario.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Workers' comp coverage does follow the worker and would apply whether the
employee is working at home or whether someone's at a fixed work site,''
Seminario said. ``It's a matter of common sense that if you have people
conducting extensive work at home, then the home essentially becomes a
workplace.''

<HEADLINE> Coke Top Black Exec Delays Leaving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- The top black executive at The Coca-Cola Co. delayed his
retirement Tuesday after being promoted by the company's incoming chairman and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Ware was named executive vice president and assigned to lead a new
division overseeing global public affairs and administration by Douglas Daft,
who himself was named the replacement for retiring CEO M. Douglas Ivester just
last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing that happened ... last November impacted on my acceptance of this
new role," said Ware, 56. "To be named executive vice president at Coca-Cola is
a big honor for me, because this is a company that I love very much."
</P>
<P>
	   Ware announced his retirement last November, shortly after a management
shakeup that meant he would not report directly to Ivester. Ware said in an
interview Tuesday that the new offer was not a figurehead position and that it
was not offered or taken as a peace offering.
</P>
<P>
	   "This stands on the merit of being a substantive and operational role, and
very involved with all aspects of the company," said Ware, who did not disclose
what he would be earning. "My thought process about my retirement was completely
different than this one. And Doug Ivester is still the CEO of Coca-Cola and he
approved this appointment, so that's important to point out."
</P>
<P>
	   The move still needs to be approved by the Atlanta-based soft drink giant's
board of directors. Approval is expected, though, since Ware's demotion last
year was one of the reasons that several key board members told Ivester they had
lost confidence in his leadership, according to numerous reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Ware announced his retirement last November, shortly after a management
shakeup that meant he would not report directly to Ivester.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not only a way for the company to say 'Oops we goofed,' but also a
way to put to rest the racial question," said David Goldman, an industry analyst
with Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Ware will continue to chair the company's diversity advisory council, set up
after four current and former Coke employees sued the company, claiming they
were denied promotions and raises because they were black.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of Coke's 24 vice presidents are black, including Ware.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's one of the reasons (the demotion) was a mistake to begin with,"
Brown Brothers Harriman and Co. analyst Roy Burry said. "This promotion is the
company's way of saying we can't do that, especially when we have that kind of
thing going on."
</P>
<P>
	   Ware is a former Atlanta city councilman, joining Coke in 1974. He was named
vice president in 1979 and senior vice president in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   He will retain his duties as vice president for the Africa division until a
successor is named, and keep strategic oversight of African operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Carl Ware is really a multitalented executive," said John Sicher,
editor-publisher of Beverage Digest. "He knows the business and has a very good
sense for dealing with governments around the world as well as the media."
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement was also Daft's first major move since it was announced
last month that he will succeed Ivester as CEO and chairman at the company's
shareholder meeting in April. Daft currently serves as president and chief
operating officer.

<HEADLINE> Sears Expecting Strong 4th Quarter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.'s fourth-quarter and year-end earnings
are expected to top forecasts as the nation's second-larger retailer sold more
goods at full price and saw improvements in its credit-card business.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears shares rose $1.50 or 5 percent, to $31.56 1/4 after the company
announced its earnings outlook on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first positive sign to come from the retailer as it embarks on a
major overhaul of its business to lift sagging sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears and other mid-priced department store chains such as J.C. Penney have
lost shoppers to higher priced competitors such as Macy's and Bloomingdales and
discount and specialty shops such as Wal-Mart and the Gap.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent months, Sears has shaken up its executive ranks, begun to remodel
its stores and added more fashionable clothing to its selling floors.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears also dumped its "Softer Side of Sears" ads this summer for a new
value-focused campaign, with the tag: "The Good Life At A Great Price.
Guaranteed. Sears."
</P>
<P>
	   Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears now expects fourth-quarter profits to
increase about 20 percent from last year's $1.48 a share. Wall Street analysts
were expecting about a 1 percent gain over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Sears expects earnings per share to increase about 10 percent
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also reported that sales at stores open at least a year, also
known as same-store sales, fell 0.6 percent in December. That decline resulted
from the company offering fewer discount promotions than a year ago, which in
turn helped boost revenue.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good thing that they are trying to get consumers off the drug of
coupons and promotions," said Wayne Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential
Securities Inc. in Atlanta. "You want them to come in and buy regularly priced

<P>
	   Sears is also seeing strength in its credit-card business. The company is
being more selective in who it signs up for its credit cards.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Resists Resignation Calls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's embattled President Ezer Weizman resisted calls
for his resignation Tuesday, even as speculation increased in his party that
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres would soon replace him.
</P>
<P>
	   This week's allegations that Weizman breached ethics by accepting wads of
cash from a millionaire friend escalated Tuesday into suggestions that he
embezzled funds earmarked for a small party he once headed.
</P>
<P>
	   Yoav Yitzhak, the journalist who revealed Weizman's acceptance of $430,000
in gifts from French millionaire Edouard Sarousi, said Tuesday that Weizman also
pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations Sarousi made to Yahad in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Yitzhak also said Weizman planned to resign in the coming days, three years
before his term ends -- and that he would blame ill health.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman, who has acknowledged the gifts but denied impropriety, ridiculed
Yitzhak's latest claims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am healthy,'' he said, handing out public service awards at his
Jerusalem residence. ``I'm going through a difficult time, and I'll get through
it. I have no intention of resigning.''
</P>
<P>
	   The director of Weizman's office, Aryeh Shumer, said Weizman would cooperate
with the State Attorney's office, which is investigating the claims. He also
said Yitzhak's information was coming from files reported stolen from Weizman's
lawyers' offices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a scandal,'' Shumer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who is in the United States negotiating with the
Syrians, expressed his backing for Weizman. But members of Barak's Labor party
have touted Peres, a Nobel peace laureate, as the best man to usher Israelis
past the painful territorial concessions that peace with the Palestinians and
Syrians will entail. Barak promised final agreement on both fronts by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Peres says of his prospects only that Weizman has three years left to serve.
Polls suggest Peres has support among the public, as well as among the 120
legislators who elect presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel television reported that Barak feared Peres -- currently sidelined in
an ineffectual ministry -- would use presidential prestige to push for greater
concessions than Barak has been willing to give. Weizman has offered unstinting
support to Barak's policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The presidency in Israel is a ceremonial post, with political power in the
hands of the prime minister and legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the denials, Israelis braced for the possibility of an ignominious
farewell to a man that lived their best self-images: fighter pilot, backroom
politician, populist and president.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever Weizman did, it seemed to have been the right thing at the right
time. He swooped fierce when his people wanted a hawk, and he cooed peace when
they wanted a dove.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman is the nephew of first President Chaim Weizmann and as close to
being a blueblood as is possible in a country founded by refugees. He helped
found and eventually commanded Israel's air force. He was an architect of
Israel's lightning victory in the 1967 Mideast war. And in 1977, he coordinated
the campaign of the hawkish Likud party, bringing territorial maximalist
Menachem Begin to power.
</P>
<P>
	   As defense minister, though, he coaxed Begin to relinquish the Sinai
peninsula to make peace with Egypt. When he quit government in 1981, Weizman
delivered a memorable speech excoriating Begin for failing the slum residents
who elected him.
</P>
<P>
	   He established Yahad and began pushing peace with other Arab nations.
Eventually, he joined the Labor party. He was fired from a joint Labor-Likud
government in January, 1990, when it was revealed that he broke Israeli law by
meeting Palestinian Liberation Organization leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   It only made him more popular. In 1993, the law banning contacts with the
PLO was rescinded -- and parliament elected Weizman to his first term as
president. Polls vindicated the choice.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman also scored points with blunt talk. When President Jimmy Carter's
brother, Billy, reportedly invited Jews who criticized his ties with Libya to
kiss a delicate part of his anatomy, Weizman said he would do so if Billy was
perched atop an Israeli flagpole at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations of financial impropriety are less likely to dissipate --
although even those calling directly for his resignation stressed their
admiration for his career.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even if he goes, Ezer Weizman ... will be remembered for what he
contributed to Israel,'' said Binyamin Ben Eliezer, Weizman's Yahad colleague
who confirmed Sarousi's donations to the party.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, Israeli Leaders Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- A procedural hang-up resolved, President Clinton
brought together Israel's prime minister and the foreign minister of Syria for
an hour-long face-to-face meeting Tuesday aimed at setting their countries on a
course toward peace.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called the session ``more of a
general discussion'' than negotiations over hard issues. But he said Clinton,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa had ``a very
constructive and productive discussion that put the process clearly on track.''
</P>
<P>
	   They ``reaffirmed their commitment to the process,'' Rubin said, but he said
Barak and al-Sharaa still apparently did not shake hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton met for half an hour with Barak before al-Sharaa joined them. A
similar three-way session was canceled Monday night in a wrangle over what
should be negotiated first.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first face-to-face session between Barak and al-Sharaa, and
committees assigned to grapple with terms of a peace accord were to begin
meeting later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the talks will continue at least for the rest of this week. ``I
don't have an end point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the two sides were ``getting
down to business.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later Tuesday, Clinton was giving a reception for the Israeli and Syrian
delegations before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his relatively upbeat assessment of the first meeting, Rubin said it
is unlikely an accord can be reached by the end of the week on peace terms, an
Israeli pullback on the Golan Heights and new security arrangements on the
Israel-Syria border.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the first time in almost four years that Israel and Syria have met
to deal with issues of substance. Having Barak and al-Sharaa talk about them
face-to-face, under Clinton's auspices, gives new meaning to the decades-old
U.S. drive to gain Arab recognition of the Jewish state in exchange for
Israeli-held territory.
</P>
<P>
	   With a light rain falling on the oldest town in West Virginia, where talks
are being held at a federal center off-limits to reporters, Clinton arrived from
Washington in a motorcade for his second consecutive day of mediating with Barak
and al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked earlier about reports the Israelis were seeking $17 billion in aid to
implement a peace deal, Clinton said, ``There will be some costs involved there
over a period of years, not just in one year. We're trying to determine exactly
what that should be.''
</P>
<P>
	   He promised ``serious consultation'' with congressional leaders on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The second day of talks also brought out protesters from Brooklyn, N.Y. --
about 40 of them, led by Orthodox Jews who oppose the proposed Israeli turnover
of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Golan is our security,'' said protest leader Levi Huebner. ``Peace
will be in security and trust in our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, 20 rabbis linked to the Jewish settlement movement ruled that the
Golan Heights are part of biblical Israel and that Israeli communities cannot be
removed from the territory.
</P>
<P>
	   While Israel's secular majority does not follow rabbinical strictures, the
ruling may make it more difficult for Barak to get a land-for-peace agreement
approved in a national referendum. It is expected that as part of such an
agreement, the 17,000 Israelis living in 33 communities would be forced to
leave.
</P>
<P>
	   In Damascus, meanwhile, the state-run Syria Times said a ``deep freeze''
could follow if the West Virginia talks are not successful.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless there is a breakthrough very soon, the whole process for making
peace will come to a dangerous recess,'' the English-language daily said.
``Until the Israelis summon the courage to move forward, no real breakthrough is
likely to occur.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said committees had been formed to take up all key issues, and that
none would be overlooked by the two sides. He included terms of the peace Syria
is offering in return for the strategic Golan Heights, a border plateau Israel
has held since the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
	   Having swapped the Sinai for little more than a diplomatically correct peace
treaty in 1979 with Egypt, Israel is looking for more than simply recognition
from Syria, with which it has fought three wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Its aim is an exchange of ambassadors, commercial ties and the kind of
acceptance the Arabs have been reluctant to extend to Israel since its creation
52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday night's procedural dispute centered on Israel's demand to take up
peace terms and security first, and Syria's to deal first with an Israeli
pullback from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon, speaking on Israeli Army radio, accused
the Syrians of reneging on an understanding that talks begin where they left off
nearly four years ago, with discussion of peace terms and security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was with the concurrence of the Americans and the Syrians. It was
clear,'' Ramon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are embarking on tough, problematical negotiations, in which we say to
the other side if you break agreements there will be no negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said, meanwhile, the hurdle was
overcome with an American proposal that the committees meet simultaneously.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, he told The Associated Press the committees
were assigned to deal with border demarcation, water, security and normalization
of relations.

<HEADLINE> Dow Off 359.58; Nasdaq Off 229.46  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices plummeted Tuesday as growing fears of higher
interest rates gave investors a reason to sell shares and capture gains from
last year's spectacular performance. The Nasdaq composite index, the best
performer in 1999, suffered its worst point loss in history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 359.58, to close at 10,997.93, its
fourth-worst point decline ever and a drop of 3.17 percent. The blue-chip index
had dipped as much as 380 points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also sustained sharp losses. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 fell 55.80 to 1,399.42, and the Nasdaq composite index plunged 229.46 to
3,901.69. In percentage terms, the Nasdaq's 5.6 percent decline was the
eighth-worst in history.
</P>
<P>
	   The retreat, on top of Monday's decline of 140 points, brought the Dow down
its lowest level since Nov. 30. The Nasdaq's close was the lowest since Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued a wave of selling that began Monday as the market
balanced good news about a smooth conversion to the Year 2000 with concern that
runaway economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to resume raising
interest rates as a way to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The toggle switch moved from 'off' to 'on' regarding interest-rate
worries," said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed of
Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
	   Herrmann said investors had been able to brush off concerns about rising
rates while Y2K loomed as a potentially greater threat to the market. With
worries about computer troubles now mostly alleviated, interest rates are once
again rattling investors.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, only technology stocks proved immune to the Fed's three rate
increases, breaking out of a springtime lull to move to record-breaking highs by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   While inflation fears and the Fed's rate increases put many stocks into a
protracted slump in the second half of the year, tech shares helped the major
market indexes to new records at year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed left rates unchanged at its December meeting, hoping to ensure
monetary stability while Y2K concerns played out around the world. Now, central
bankers are likely to focus on continued signs of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates typically hurt stocks by cutting into corporate
profits as it becomes more expensive to borrow money. Higher rates can be
especially devastating to younger, fast-growing companies, whose promise of
future earnings growth may be threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   Ironically, a decline in U.S. shares now could help assuage the Fed, which
sees the market itself as one of the main engines of economic growth. The Fed
has made no secret of its concern over stocks' lofty valuations.
</P>
<P>
	   "If economic growth is too high, the Fed must continue raising rates, and
the stock market has become a real factor in that decision," said Herrmann.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, most analysts believe Tuesday's selloff was a temporary drop in a
market that still feeds on strong corporate profits and moderate economic
growth. A steep decline in stocks was to be expected, and could leave the market
in better shape for another advance, said Richard E. Cripps, chief market
strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market has had a very strong run," said Cripps. "Higher interest rates
are providing a catalyst for some selling that probably needs to take place
before it can go any higher."
</P>
<P>
	   American Express and Hewlett-Packard led the Dow's decliners. American
Express fell 5 15/16 to 151 5/16, and Hewlett-Packard fell 8 7/8 to 108 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks also struggled as investors collected profits from a
stellar year in 1999. Traders said many investors held onto shares of
top-performing companies last year and are now selling because the taxes on
their gains won't be due until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the decliners: CMGI, down 32 11/16 to 293 3/4; Qualcomm, down 17 1/4
at 162 1/16; and Yahoo, which rose sharply in early trading only to finish down
32 at 443.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, three stocks fell for every one that rose.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.24 billion shares, compared with 1.17
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 18.67 to 478.38.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets took little notice of President Clinton's renomination of Alan
Greenspan for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve System. The
announcement was widely expected.
</P>
<P>
	   In Europe, markets also took their cues from the interest rate worries in
the United States and ended sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
	   London's FTSE-100 Share Index fell 3.8 percent, or 264.3 points, to 6,665.9,
the index's biggest-ever point loss. Germany's DAX index fell 2.4 percent while
France's CAC-40 lost 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.4 percent in the first trading
day of the new year, closing at the highest level in 28 months. Markets in Tokyo
reported no Y2K-related problems.

<HEADLINE> Chairman Greenspan Highlights  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Some of the key events since 1987 when Alan Greenspan took over as chairman
of the Federal Reserve:
</P>
<P>
	   Aug. 11, 1987 -- Greenspan, a New York economist and adviser to Republican
presidents going back to Richard Nixon, is sworn in as chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board after having been picked by President Reagan to succeed Paul
Volcker.
</P>
<P>
	   Oct. 19, 1987 -- Wall Street suffers the "Black Monday" stock market crash
as the Dow Jones industrial average falls by 508 points, the biggest one-day
point drop at that time. Greenspan, in what many see as his finest hour,
immediately assembles a crisis management team that keeps the market turmoil
from spiraling into a banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   June 1990 -- Economy slumps into brief recession that lasts until March
1991. The Bush administration is unhappy that Greenspan did not move more
aggressively to combat economic weakness by cutting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   July 10, 1991 -- Despite frosty relations, President Bush nominates
Greenspan to a second term, a decision cheered by financial markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Feb. 4, 1994 -- Greenspan launches a pre-emptive strike against inflation by
engineering the first of seven interest rate increases. President Clinton fumes
privately, but his administration avoids public criticism of the Fed's moves.
</P>
<P>
	   July 6, 1995 -- With fears mounting that the economy could be headed into a
recession, the Federal Reserve makes the first of three small cuts in interest
rates, successfully reigniting growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Feb. 22, 1996 -- Clinton, faced with a Senate in Republican hands, announces
he will nominate Greenspan for a third term as Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Dec. 5, 1996 -- Greenspan, in a Washington speech, worries that financial
markets could be exhibiting "irrational exuberance." Investors, after an initial
pause, shrug off the warning and push stock prices to new highs.
</P>
<P>
	   Sept. 29, 1998 -- Greenspan leads the Fed to cut interest rates in response
to global financial turmoil triggered by Russia's default on billions of dollars
in foreign debt. The Fed reduces its federal funds rate three times in the fall
of 1998 in a successful effort to keep the global financial crisis from
derailing the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   June, 30, 1999 -- Fed pushes through the first of three rate hikes in 1999
because of worries that unemployment, which dropped to a 30-year low, could
begin triggering inflationary wage demands.
</P>
<P>
	   Jan. 4, 2000 -- Clinton nominates Greenspan for a fourth term as Fed
chairman, expressing happiness with an economy that in February will enjoy the
longest period of uninterrupted growth in U.S. history.

<HEADLINE> NASD Board OKs For-Profit Market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A plan to convert the Nasdaq Stock Market to a private,
for-profit company owned by shareholders was approved Tuesday by the board of
the National Association of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by a majority of NASD's members, the proposal would create the
first shareholder-owned U.S. stock market. The association is aiming to complete
the restructuring by midyear.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan does not include an initial public stock offering, known as an IPO,
but leaves that option open.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the NASD intends to sell about a 78 percent stake in the Nasdaq to
a group of Nasdaq market participants that includes NASD member broker-dealer
firms, large institutional investors such as pension and mutual fund companies,
and a handful of large Nasdaq listed companies.
</P>
<P>
	   NASD officials have said the restructuring is necessary to help keep the
computerized Nasdaq stock market competitive with upstart electronic trading
exchanges, known as electronic communications networks, or ECNs.
</P>
<P>
	   The restructuring will create "a much more flexible, viable marketplace,"
said NASD Chairman Frank Zarb.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Stock Exchange is also considering a public stock offering for
the same competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The NASD, which plans to retain a minority stake of about 22 percent in the
computerized Nasdaq market, said it expects to raise about $1 billion by selling
shares in the Nasdaq through so-called private placement deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the proceeds, about $500 million of the sale would be earmarked toward
the NASD's regulation arm. Additional plans include $215 million for the
American Stock Exchange, which merged with the NASD last year, and $114 million
to reduce fees to NASD members.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale is expected to be completed in two phases: the first representing a
47 percent to 49 percent stake, and the second a 30 percent stake. Investment
banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney assisted a NASD committee in
preparing the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Zarb said the entire NASD membership is expected to vote on the plan by the
end of March. The first phase of the sale will be completed soon after the vote,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman said no decision was made on a possible IPO.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Have Sluggish Dec.  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler AG and some foreign
automakers ended a record-breaking 1999 on a wan note, reporting sluggish U.S.
light vehicle sales for December.
</P>
<P>
	   Chrysler said Tuesday that sales of cars and light trucks were up less than
1 percent in December, with a 3 percent boost in car sales overcoming a slight
decline in truck sales. The increase in cars was led by a surprising increase in
sales of its small Neon compact and Plymouth Breeze/Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge
Stratus sedans.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Neon is a fairly new model, the Breeze/Cirrus/Stratus models are
aging; all have seen sales declines this year, and Chrysler offers rebates of
$1,000 on 2000 Neons and $1,250 on the so-called "cloud cars." But Chrysler
officials said the rebates were not entirely responsible for the sales surge.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've noticed that in certain parts of country the car market has had a
resurgence," said Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and
marketing operations. "We've seen a lot of strength coming in the Northeast."
</P>
<P>
	   The company ended the year with sales up 5 percent, with most of the
increase coming from strong sales of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Dodge
trucks. One dark spot: Chrysler's minivans ended the year with sales off 4
percent for the year and down 8 percent in December. The current models, due to
be replaced this year, have suffered in competition with the Honda Odyssey and
Ford Windstar.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said Tuesday it was increasing minivans incentives again.
Theodor Cunningham, DaimlerChrysler's executive vice president for global sales
and marketing, said the move was intended to protect Chrysler's market share
until the new models go on sale later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The competition in the minivan segment is fierce right now and we are
maintaining what we think are reasonable incentive levels," Cunningham said.
"We're going to be aggressive for the rest of the year."
</P>
<P>
	   Some other automakers also reported slower December sales. Toyota Motor Co.
said it sales were down 12 percent, while sales for the year ended up 8 percent.
The Toyota Camry will likely take the crown of best-selling car in America
again, with sales of 320,156 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Subaru said its December sales were down 11 percent, while Saab AB said its
sales for the month were off 17.5 percent for the month. But both posted strong
gains for the year, part of an industrywide increase expected to push total
light vehicle sales well past the record of 16 million vehicles set in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one could have predicted such a monster year, nor anticipated the
sustained strength of consumer confidence," said Jim Press, executive vice
president for Toyota's U.S. sales arm. "Every indicator points to a leveling-off
in 2000. But of course, that's what we all said last year."
</P>
<P>
	   Art Spinella, an industry sales analyst with CNW Marketing Research in
Bandon, Ore., said automakers' monthly sales would suffer in comparison to a
strong month last year, and that mild weather had influenced sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "The weather has been fairly decent, and you tend to see cars sell better
than they normally would," he said "Last year, the weather was lousy, and you
saw more trucks."
</P>
<P>
	   Several foreign automakers reported continued strong sales in December,
though. Honda Motor Co. said its sales were up 6 for the month and 6.5 percent
for the year; both increases were driven by the popularity of the Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
	   Nissan Motor Co. saw its sales increase 7.5 percent for the month and 9
percent for the year, thanks to its Xterra SUV.
</P>
<P>
	   European automakers also rang in 2000 with a bang. Mercedes-Benz officially
took the title of best-selling luxury brand, selling 189,011 vehicles in 1999,
an 11 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Volkswagen said its sales were up 33 percent for the month and 43 percent
for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. will report their sales totals
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Lower Fares Spread to More Airlines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines and US Airways on Tuesday joined two other
major air carriers in announcing lower sharply lower air fares for travel
through the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest round of airline discounts was triggered by Southwest Airlines,
which last month announced a coast-to-coast fare of $198. TWA followed suit on
Monday when it announced a 50 percent reduction on the round trip cost on its
Boston-Los Angeles route. The airline also reduced the prices on other domestic
routes and on several of its international routes.
</P>
<P>
	   United reduced its fares by up to 30 percent, offering round-trip air fares
of $348 for its Chicago-London route; $274 for New York-Denver and $518 for Los
Angeles-Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   US Airways is charging $338 roundtrip on its New York-San Francisco and Los
Angeles-Philadelphia routes, as well as discounting fares on routes serving
smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers purchasing tickets on United's and US Airways' Web sites up to
Jan. 14, can get up to 5 percent off the sale fares.
</P>
<P>
	   The fare reduction is designed to stimulate traffic during the winter and
early spring months when air travel is generally at its lowest, said United
spokesman Joe Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
	   "What UAL (and the other airlines) are doing is trying to generate leisure
traffic volume," said analyst James Higgins of Donaldson Luftkin &AMP; Jenrette.
Airlines usually reduce fares this time of year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Parson of BestFares.Com, a clearing house for travel deals, said the
reductions are steeper than in the past. He said air travel declined sharply
because of public jitters over the possibility of Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are not very many places you can travel where the price is not
discounted," he said, adding airfares to Europe should be particularly appealing
to travelers.
</P>
<P>
	   Restrictions have been placed on all the fares, with United and US Airways
requiring purchases at least 14 days in advance of travel or by Jan. 14.
United's reduced fares are not applicable during the Presidents Day and Easter
holiday weekends.

<HEADLINE> USDA Faces Squabble Over Pork Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department is caught between squabbling
hog farmers over whether to hold a referendum on payment of producer fees for
the ``other white meat'' advertising campaign for pork.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the ``checkoff fees'' demanded Tuesday that the USDA hold a
referendum on the program by March. They submitted petitions to the department
last May, but USDA officials have not validated the signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At best this is bureaucratic bungling. At worse, the USDA is trying to
derail the democratic process,'' said Mark McDowell, a Hampton, Iowa, farmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the $48 million program, which pays for research as well as
advertising, say it has done little to stimulate pork consumption and mostly
benefits meat processors and large, corporate farm operations. Defenders of the
program say many of the signatures on the petitions may be invalid.
</P>
<P>
	   The Campaign for Family Farmers, which led the petition drive, submitted
16,500 signatures, more than the 14,986 required under government rules.
Kathleen Merrigan, administrator of USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, said
she hopes to finish reviewing the petitions this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the signatures were illegible, and some petitions were missing
addresses and other information, Merrigan said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't appear at this time that anyone is pleased with all that we've
done. ... Sometimes that happens when you are in the middle and you are trying
to run a fair and objective process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA used a telemarketing firm to contact a statistically valid sample of
1,400 people whose signatures appeared on the petitions. Some refused to
cooperate with the callers, and others denied signing the petitions. The
department sent followup letters last month to 428 petition signers pleading for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   The fee, or ``checkoff,'' requires pork producers to pay 45 cents for every
$100 of animal value. The money goes to the quasigovernmental National Pork
Board, which contracts promotional services through the National Pork Producers
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the program say they get little for the fees. Pork consumption
has been relatively flat despite the advertising, rising from 51.5 pounds per
person in 1985 to 53.4 pounds last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The program's supporters, led by the National Pork Producers Council,
contend it has benefited all farmers by improving pork's reputation with
consumers and sponsoring research that has yielded leaner pigs.
</P>
<P>
	   If the fee is abolished, ``the only people who will benefit are the largest
players in the industry, who have the capacity in their own integrated
structures to do their own promotion and to maintain their own research and to
keep it to themselves,'' said John McNutt, a West Branch, Iowa, farmer who is
president of the producers council.
</P>
<P>
	   The pork program is among several that have come under criticism from
consumers. Last month, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman endorsed several steps
to increase USDA's oversight of the research and promotion programs, including
submitting them to mandatory votes by producers every five years.

<HEADLINE> Attica Riot Lawsuit Settled for $8M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- New York state agreed Tuesday to pay $8 million to
inmates caught up in the 1971 Attica riot, settling a 25-year-old lawsuit over
the nation's deadliest prison uprising.
</P>
<P>
	   The money will go to 1,280 inmates -- or their survivors -- who claimed they
were tortured, beaten and denied medical treatment in the aftermath of the
revolt and authorities' bloody efforts to put it down. The original class-action
suit, filed in 1974, sought $100 million.
</P>
<P>
	   State police launched an all-out assault on the maximum-security Attica
Correctional Facility near Buffalo on Sept. 13, 1971, the fifth day of the
uprising. More than 2,000 rounds of ammunition were fired over six minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 32 inmates and 11 correction officers died, most of them killed
during the raid. Hundreds more were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   In agreeing to settle, the state admitted no wrongdoing. It also agreed to
pay the inmates' lawyers up to $4 million in legal fees and costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates or their heirs must contact plaintiffs' lawyers to be included in
the settlement. U.S. District Judge Michael Telesca will hold hearings in
February to give claimants a chance to object to the terms of the settlement. He
said he expects a final deal to be reached by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no ideal time to solve a case like this ... but I am assured the
time is now,'' Telesca said. He added that any deal would not determine ``who
was right and wrong. I will leave that to history.''
</P>
<P>
	   Frank ``Big Black'' Smith, who helped lead the revolt, thanked the judge for
helping resolve the protracted dispute. ``God bless you,'' he said. ``I think
where we're at today is where we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who was released in 1973, had been forced to lie on a table while
officers beat and burned him. He was also ordered to hold a football under his
chin and threatened with death if he allowed it to fall.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear how many people would come forward and claim compensation.
Elizabeth Fink, attorney for lead plaintiff Akil Al-Jundi, who died in 1997,
said she believes several hundred have died.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No settlement compensates people for what really happened,'' Ms. Fink
said. However, the offer ``brings closure to what is a significant event in
American history, one that still lives today.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, a federal jury awarded $4 million to Smith and $75,000 to David
Brosig, another inmate who was injured. Telesca was brought into the case in
August when an appeals court reversed those verdicts.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after the prison was recaptured, Saladin Hadid was one of hundreds of
inmates forced to run naked through a gantlet of law enforcement officers who
hit them with clubs and nightsticks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They beat you to your knees, called you degrading things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hadid, who was 19 when he was transferred to Attica in 1971, served 16 years
for robbery, burglary and drug-related crimes. Since being released in 1997, he
has worked at a hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement offer, he said, ``doesn't seem adequate at all. Money will
never compensate for the things that were done. I would take whatever is offered
but that doesn't mean I have to like it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates can have access to their settlement money. The state recently
enacted some controls on how inmates can use the money.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Worker Charged in Killings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The hotel housekeeper accused of killing five people last
week was arrested in 1997 for a vicious stabbing in Alabama but was never
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   The district attorney in Mobile County, Ala., said Tuesday that a grand jury
refused to indict Silvio Izquierdo-Leyva after investigators failed to get the
victim and a key witness to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Izquierdo-Leyva, 36, fatally shot four co-workers at Tampa's
Radisson Bay Harbor hotel Thursday, then killed a woman in an attempt to steal
her car. Three other hotel employees were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Izquierdo-Leyva is being held without bail on charges of murder and
carjacking. A motive for the shootings has not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 200 people attended a funeral Tuesday for Dolores Perdomo, 56, the
motorist shot in the botched carjacking. A service was planned Tuesday night for
another victim, Jose R. Aguilar, 40.
</P>
<P>
	   Holly Winn, the wife of the Alabama stabbing victim, said she still can't
understand what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Silvio was one of my best friends,'' she said. ``He would come eat at our
house. He would drink there at weekends. He never appeared violent. He was shy,
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Winn said Izquierdo-Leyva, looking ``dazed, not his usual self,'' showed
up at her home a week after she moved in with her future husband. Ms. Winn said
Izquierdo-Leyva stabbed the man repeatedly. The man needed about 200 stitches,
and his face and arms are scarred.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobile County District Attorney John Tyson said records indicate his office
repeatedly tried to contact Ms. Winn and her husband, Luis Gordillo-Leal, to ask
them to testify but could not reach them.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Winn said she and Gordillo-Leal moved to Tampa soon after the stabbing
but gave statements to prosecutors before moving.

<HEADLINE> Transient Accused of Killing Girls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas (AP) -- A rail-riding transient has been charged with
murdering two 13-year-old girls in Texas and Kentucky, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tommy Lynn Sells, 35, was arrested Sunday in the stabbing death of Kaylene
Harris, 13, and the slashing of 10-year-old Krystal Surles, who survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Both girls were sleeping at Kaylene's mother's home near Del Rio on Friday
when Sells allegedly broke in and attacked them with a knife, Val Verde County
Sheriff D'Wayne Jernigan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Krystal, who was in stable condition after her vocal cords were severed in
the attack, helped authorities find Sells by writing down a description of the
attacker. Sells was an acquaintance of Kaylene's father and had visited the home
several times, Jernigan said.
</P>
<P>
	   When police started questioning him about the attack, Sells stated, ``I
guess you want to know about both of them,'' according to Lt. Larry Pope of the
sheriff's department.
</P>
<P>
	   He then confessed to the May slaying of Haley McHone, 13, of Lexington, Ky.,
police said. He was charged Monday with murder, rape and kidnapping in her
death.
</P>
<P>
	   Haley's decomposed body was found in bushes by railroad tracks near her
house on May 23. Police briefly booked Sells on a charge of public drunkenness
that night before releasing him, Lexington police Sgt. Mark Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
	   The site was just a couple of hundred yards from where University of
Kentucky student Christopher Maier was beaten to death in August 1997.
Authorities in June linked Maier's killing to Angel Maturino Resendiz, a
rail-riding drifter who authorities believe is to blame for a string of murders
near railroad tracks in several states, including Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Resendiz's arrest, police said that they did not believe he was
responsible for Haley McHone's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Lexington police described Sells as a transient who rode the rails and
passed through Kentucky in May. Police said he has held several odd jobs,
including a stint in a circus.

<HEADLINE> Archer Retiring in Texas  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer is
retiring after 30 years representing Houston, but that doesn't mean there won't
be an Archer on this year's ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   William Archer, a Houston lawyer who is not related to the Republican
congressman, surprised local GOP officials by jumping into the spirited
Republican primary just hours before Monday night's filing deadline. Nine
Republicans are running in the solidly Republican district, as is one Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Archer thing definitely throws a wild card into it,'' Harris County
Republican Party spokesman Mark Cowart said Tuesday. ``This poses a problem for
candidates that they've got to ... indicate that they are not running against
THE Bill Archer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Archer, the lawyer, evinced little concern about mistaken identity for
voters in the March 14 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that the Republicans in the 7th District are some of the most
educated people throughout the Houston area,'' he said. ``And they don't just
lightly support or pull the lever for someone without some type of knowledge of
who they are and what they stand for.''
</P>
<P>
	   Archer said he has been involved in politics ``but not to the greatest
degree.'' He served as a delegate to the Harris County Republican convention in
1980, he said.

<HEADLINE> One day into trial, serial killer admits two more murders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A man already convicted of killing three women
on Long Island admitted Tuesday that he had murdered two more who were found
crammed into garbage cans in Westchester.
<P>
	   Robert Shulman, 45, who was sentenced to death after his previous trial in
Suffolk County, now faces up to 25 years to life in prison after pleading guilty
in Westchester to two counts of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said they pursued the case to make sure Shulman would be
punished even if he won an appeal on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will guarantee that he dies in prison, either way," District Attorney
Jeanine Pirro said after the plea. "He'll go by lethal injection or by natural
causes."
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, 45, pleaded guilty one day after his trial began with prosecutor
Robert Neary telling the jury that Shulman had admitted the killings and that
DNA tests had matched the victims' blood to stains in Shulman's Hicksville
apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman was accused of killing Lori Vasquez of Brooklyn, 24, and a woman who
could not be identified after Shulman cut her up. The remains were found in
plastic garbage pails in Yonkers in 1991 and 1992, before the state had a death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor said Shulman often picked up prostitutes and shared crack
with them at his apartment. Sometimes he didn't let them out alive. He used bats

<HEADLINE> Weizman Resists Resignation Calls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's embattled President Ezer Weizman resisted calls
for his resignation Tuesday, even as speculation increased in his party that
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres would soon replace him.
</P>
<P>
	   This week's allegations that Weizman breached ethics by accepting wads of
cash from a millionaire friend escalated Tuesday into suggestions that he
embezzled funds earmarked for a small party he once headed.
</P>
<P>
	   Yoav Yitzhak, the journalist who revealed Weizman's acceptance of $453,000
in gifts from French millionaire Edouard Sarousi, said Tuesday that Weizman also
pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations Sarousi made to Yahad in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Yitzhak also said Weizman planned to resign in the coming days, three years
before his term ends -- and that he would blame ill health.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman, who has acknowledged the gifts but denied impropriety, ridiculed
Yitzhak's latest claims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am healthy,'' he said, handing out public service awards at his
Jerusalem residence. ``I'm going through a difficult time, and I'll get through
it. I have no intention of resigning.''
</P>
<P>
	   The director of Weizman's office, Aryeh Shumer, said Weizman would cooperate
with the State Attorney's office, which is investigating the claims. He also
said Yitzhak's information was coming from files reported stolen from Weizman's
lawyers' offices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a scandal,'' Shumer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who is in the United States negotiating with the
Syrians, expressed his backing for Weizman. But members of Barak's Labor party
have touted Peres, a Nobel peace laureate, as the best man to usher Israelis
past the painful territorial concessions that peace with the Palestinians and
Syrians will entail. Barak promised final agreement on both fronts by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Peres says of his prospects only that Weizman has three years left to serve.
Polls suggest Peres has support among the public, as well as among the 120
legislators who elect presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel television reported that Barak feared Peres -- currently sidelined in
an ineffectual ministry -- would use presidential prestige to push for greater
concessions than Barak has been willing to give. Weizman has offered unstinting
support to Barak's policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The presidency in Israel is a ceremonial post, with political power in the
hands of the prime minister and legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the denials, Israelis braced for the possibility of an ignominious
farewell to a man that lived their best self-images: fighter pilot, backroom
politician, populist and president.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever Weizman did, it seemed to have been the right thing at the right
time. He swooped fierce when his people wanted a hawk, and he cooed peace when
they wanted a dove.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman is the nephew of first President Chaim Weizmann and as close to
being a blueblood as is possible in a country founded by refugees. He helped
found and eventually commanded Israel's air force. He was an architect of
Israel's lightning victory in the 1967 Mideast war. And in 1977, he coordinated
the campaign of the hawkish Likud party, bringing territorial maximalist
Menachem Begin to power.
</P>
<P>
	   As defense minister, though, he coaxed Begin to relinquish the Sinai
peninsula to make peace with Egypt. When he quit government in 1981, Weizman
delivered a memorable speech excoriating Begin for failing the slum residents
who elected him.
</P>
<P>
	   He established Yahad and began pushing peace with other Arab nations.
Eventually, he joined the Labor party. He was fired from a joint Labor-Likud
government in January, 1990, when it was revealed that he broke Israeli law by
meeting Palestinian Liberation Organization leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   It only made him more popular. In 1993, the law banning contacts with the
PLO was rescinded -- and parliament elected Weizman to his first term as
president. Polls vindicated the choice.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman also scored points with blunt talk. When President Jimmy Carter's
brother, Billy, reportedly invited Jews who criticized his ties with Libya to
kiss a delicate part of his anatomy, Weizman said he would do so if Billy was
perched atop an Israeli flagpole at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations of financial impropriety are less likely to dissipate --
although even those calling directly for his resignation stressed their
admiration for his career.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even if he goes, Ezer Weizman ... will be remembered for what he
contributed to Israel,'' said Binyamin Ben Eliezer, Weizman's Yahad colleague
who confirmed Sarousi's donations to the party.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise Amid Fall in Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose sharply Tuesday, as investors sought the
safety of government backed securities while stock prices plunged due to profit
taking and concerns about interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond rose 1 1/16 points, or $10.62 1/2 per $1,000
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.53
percent from 6.62 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's closing figure was the highest point reached since the 30-year
yield hit 6.69 percent on Sept. 11, 1997. Yields on the so-called long bond
peaked last year at 6.49 percent on Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 359.58 to close at
10,997.93, its fourth-worst decline ever. The Nasdaq composite index fell 229.46
points to 3,901.69, its worst ever one-day point drop. Neither drop ranked in
the top 10 in terms of percentage drops.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors tend to buy bonds amid steep losses in stocks because the
government backed securities offer a fixed rate of return. High bond yields,
fueled by falling bond prices, also helped the trend.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices have fallen in recent weeks amid concerns that the Federal
Reserve plans to hike interest rates again early this year now that fears of a
Year 2000 computer disaster have dissipated.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates hurt bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return to
investors. The Fed raised rates three times in 1999 -- in June, August and
November -- to slow the red-hot economy and to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.42 percent as the discount fell
0.09 percentage point from Monday's treasury auction to 5.27 percent. Six-month
yields were 5.74 percent, as the discount fell 0.09 percentage point from
Monday's auction to 5.50 percent. One-year yields were 5.99 percent as the
discount fell 0.8 percentage point from Monday to 5.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities rose 3/16
point and intermediate maturities rose 15/32 to 11/16 point, reported Bridge
Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was
5.00 percent, down from 5.50 percent on Monday
</P>
<P>
	   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer said the new contract for its index
of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose 1/32 to 91 31/32. The average yield
to maturity remained unchanged at 6.25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Phone Deals May Confuse Consumers  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that local and long-distance phone companies are
starting to offer both types of service, consumers may find their shopping
skills put to the test by an array of package deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Most people have never had any choice in local phone service, which was
monopolized by AT&AMP;T for decades and more recently by the regional Baby Bells.
Likewise, it's been more than 15 years since most people could buy local and
long distance from one company, and back then they had no choice except AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, real competition for local service is starting in New York and will
spread to other parts of the country in the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last February, MCI Worldcom, AT&AMP;T and Sprint have all introduced local
calling service in New York, preparing for what will finally become a reality on
Wednesday, when Bell Atlantic becomes the first Baby Bell to sell long-distance
service in the same market where it provides local service.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic, the local phone company for most of the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic, gained clearance for New York last week as the Federal
Communications Commission declared that the company had finally met its
obligation to open the state's local calling market to competition.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC Communications, which serves the Southwest and Midwest, expects FCC
approval to provide long distance service in Texas this year and BellSouth
expects it in Georgia. Bell Atlantic hopes for FCC approval for New Jersey,
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania by year-end.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T is using cable TV lines to deliver bundles of local and long
distance in 13 cities and plans to expand the service rapidly.
</P>
<P>
	   Naturally, the sudden spurt of competition is expected to bring prices down.
But with four major companies and numerous calling plans to choose from, what's
a consumer to do? They may be well-versed in the art of picking through a
variety of long-distance plans, but many of the new plans put local and long
distance together.
</P>
<P>
	   "There will be confusion," said Samuel Simon, chairman of the
Washington-based Telecommunications Research and Action Center. "The simple
advice is to sit down, catalogue what you're using, and see what it's costing."
</P>
<P>
	   That means weeding through recent phone bills that may compare with the new
offerings like apples to oranges.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic, for example, is offering a local-long distance package for
$19.99 per month, plus 10 cents per minute for long-distance calls and a small
charge for each local call that varies with the time of day. The monthly fee
includes up to eight additional features such as caller ID, call waiting and
3-way calling.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, AT&AMP;T is charging $24.90 for virtually unlimited local service
-- 75 hours -- and long-distance calls for 7 cents a minute. An optional package
of caller ID, call waiting and 3-way calling costs an additional $12.50 per
month.
</P>
<P>
	   For those who live in areas where AT&AMP;T provides phone service via cable TV
lines, the price is about $25 per month, including the three optional services.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprint is charging $35 per month for unlimited local calls and long-distance
rates of either 7 cents per minute all the time or 5 cents per minute from 7
p.m. to 7 a.m. and 10 cents a minute other times.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI still treats local and long distance as separate calling plans, but
offers a $5 monthly discount to customers who take both services.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic's move into long distance comes despite a continued court
fight from AT&AMP;T to overturn the Federal Communications Commission's approval.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, a federal court rejected AT&AMP;T's request to block Bell Atlantic
while it appeals that decision.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T contends that Bell Atlantic still hasn't made it physically and
financially feasible for rivals to sell local service by leasing Bell Atlantic's
phone lines.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen on Intervention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar moved sharply higher against the yen Tuesday
after the Japanese central bank once again intervened in financial markets to
bring down the value of the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 103.28 Japanese yen
compared with 101.56 yen late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the action occurred in Tokyo after the Bank of Japan sold yen for
dollars in the open market in a bid to tame the ascent of the yen, which has
been threatening to stifle an economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's central bank has been on a campaign since June to rein in the rising
yen, which crimps the profits of Japanese exporters as they convert revenues
from overseas sales back into Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bank's effort to tame the yen has met with only sporadic success
since Japan has been acting on its own without the support of the two other
major central banks, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar's unusually large jump of nearly two yen against the Japanese
currency came despite a selloff on Wall Street as fears of interest rate
increases took the air out of a recent stock rally. The Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled nearly 360 points -- its fourth-worst point drop ever -- to end
at 10,997.93.
</P>
<P>
	   Declines in U.S. stocks can often hurt the value of the dollar against other
currencies as traders anticipate future demand for dollars by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar declined slightly against the euro after an influential German
economic institute, DIW, forecast for 3 percent growth this year in the 11
countries sharing the euro, up from an estimated 2.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro was quoted at $1.0299, up from $1.0259 late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro had been in a slump against the dollar for several months on
concerns that countries in the euro bloc would have slower economic growth over
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5576 Swiss francs, down from 1.5650, and
1.4525 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4457. The British pound fell to $1.6364 from
$1.6372.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Tuesday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8987 German marks, down from 1.9067; 6.3679
French francs, down from 6.3949; and 1,879.69 Italian lire, down from 1,887.66.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Legislature Elects New Gov.  </HEADLINE>
   By GINA HOLLAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi lawmakers voted Democrat Ronnie Musgrove
into the governor's office Tuesday in the first gubernatorial race settled in
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   As expected, Musgrove was the overwhelming winner in the historic vote in
the heavily Democratic House, which settled his razor-tight race with Republican
Mike Parker.
</P>
<P>
	   Many legislators were jubilant after voting 86-36 to select the mild
mannered Musgrove to replace the contentious Kirk Fordice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fat lady sang and it was in perfect tune,'' said Rep. Steve Holland,
D-Plantersville.
</P>
<P>
	   Fordice, the only Republican governor to serve Mississippi in the last
century, could not have sought a third term. Fordice is getting a divorce after
44 years of marriage and has had a very public affair with his childhood
sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
	   Musgrove, the lieutenant governor the past four years, had 8,300 more votes
than Parker in the Nov. 2 election but not the required majority -- half the
popular vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The state constitution, written a century ago to keep blacks out of the
Governor's Mansion, sent the decision to the House.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker, 50, had refused calls to concede and said after the House vote that
the situation illustrates a need to change the constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is a mistake for our constitution to call on the
representatives of the House to make that decision. I think the people of the
state should make that decision,'' Parker said at a news conference at the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker and Musgrove, 43 talked Tuesday for the first time since before the
election.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker said he congratulated Musgrove and said he urged him ``to move this
state to a place it has never been.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some House members said they did not make up their minds until the night
before the vote. Mostly, they broke along party lines. Two Democrats voted for
Parker and two Republicans voted for Musgrove. Musgrove's other 84 votes came
from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Rep. Jim Ellington said Parker could make no headway in
convincing the Democrat-controlled House to elect a Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mike's hands were basically tied,'' Ellington said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fordice press secretary Robbie Wilbur said the governor would have no
comment on Musgrove's election. He said Fordice was packing bags at the
Governor's Mansion and would be moved out before Musgrove's inauguration in a
week.

<HEADLINE> Moving trucks arrive, Mrs. Clinton to follow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - Six weeks after unofficially announcing her
candidacy for New York's U.S. Senate seat, Hillary Rodham Clinton edged ever
closer Tuesday to actually living in the state.
<P>
	   The first lady wasn't here yet, but two moving vans loaded with rolled-up
rugs, kitchen chairs, a mattress and assorted unopened boxes arrived at her new
$1.7 million Westchester County home on a rainy afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who has never lived or worked in New York state, was expected
at the house Wednesday to begin emptying the boxes and to spend her first night
there, said Karen Finney, a member of Mrs. Clinton's campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary is very excited about this," said Finney. She said Mrs. Clinton
hoped to be "fully moved in" by the end of next week, in time for a visit from
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee for the Senate seat opened by
Daniel Patrick Moynihan's retirement, has said she plans to cut back on first
lady duties and to spend most of her time in New York state this year. New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is expected to be her Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons plan to live in the white, three-story wood frame house when
the president leaves office in January 2001. They signed a deal to buy the house
last September.
</P>
<P>
	   The vintage house, built in 1889, features a swimming pool, five bedrooms,
four bathrooms and two fireplaces. The top floor contains an exercise room.
</P>
<P>
	   The lot, just over an acre, is screened by evergreens at the end of a
cul-de-sac in the quiet, suburban hamlet. The Clintons, criticized when a
prominent Democratic fund-raiser offered help in buying the house, instead took
out a $1.36 million, 30-year adjustable rate mortgage.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of Mrs. Clinton's friends, including a decorator, were at the house
to supervise the unloading of the 26-foot trucks. Most of the property was kept
in storage in suburban Virginia, although some items were from the White House,
Finney said.
</P>
<P>
	   The move was paid for by the Clintons and not with public funds, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons were waiting for the Secret Service to finish security work
before moving in. Security precautions approved by local officials included an
8-foot-tall fence around the property and construction of a small gatehouse at
the end of the Clintons' driveway.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither was in place on Tuesday afternoon. Instead of the guardhouse, a
phone sat on a rock at the bottom of the driveway.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Defender Newspaper For Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Time has run out on efforts by the family that owns the
Chicago Defender to maintain a role at the fabled newspaper that once helped
lure blacks off southern plantations and into northern factories.
</P>
<P>
	   A $10 million debt-financed recapitalization plan that would have left the
Sengstacke family with 49 percent of the company has fallen through. Now the
daily newspaper is on the auction block to pay $3 million in estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defender's future was placed in doubt after John Sengstacke, nephew of
the paper's founder, Robert Abbott, died in 1997 at age 84. In 1975, he placed
Sengstacke Enterprises Inc. in trust with instructions that it be sold upon his
death. His heirs had no say in the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to auction the Defender, and its three weeklies, the Tri-State
Defender in Memphis, the Pittsburgh Courier and Detroit's Michigan Chronicle,
came after the collapse of a deal giving Detroit businessman Don Barden control
of Sengstacke Enterprises Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Telephone calls Tuesday to Myiti Sengstacke, niece of John Sengstacke, and
Barden for comment on the auction were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Barden Companies Inc. -- which owns the Majestic Star riverboat casino in
Gary, Ind., five Illinois radio stations and other businesses -- will be one of
three black-owned firms that will be allowed to submit bids on the company by
Jan. 31. The others bidding at the auction, to be conducted by Duff &AMP; Phelps
LLC, are PublicMediaWorks Inc., an investment group, and Houston-based Equal
Access Media Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Because it is privately owned, earnings and revenues were not available. But
the Michigan Chronicle is the only newspaper of the four that appears to be
profitable, said Kurt Cherry, who heads PublicMediaWorks.
</P>
<P>
	   Cherry said his investment group made previous efforts to buy Sengstacke
Enterprises, offering $12 million when the company first went up for sale two
years ago, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
	   Until he receives information from Duff &AMP; Phelps outlining its financial
condition, Cherry said he couldn't estimate how much his group would bid for the
company. Whoever acquires the newspapers will face a major task to turn them
around, he said, estimating it could be a $30 million effort, including the
purchase price.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have an institution that is 95 years old that has been operated by a
single family," he said. "The newspaper landscape has been radically transformed
during that time. And the results speak for themselves."
</P>
<P>
	   The Defender dates back to 1905 when Abbott arrived in Chicago nearly
penniless and founded the newspaper as a weekly. It went on to be read by
thousands in the South, where it was distributed by Pullman porters and sold by
newsboys who risked being lynched for their actions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defender riled southern whites with its editorials, which urged blacks
to abandon the Jim Crow south and its cotton fields for the north's factories
and less menacing segregation.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Defender is the best known of Sengstacke Enterprises' holdings,
the weekly Michigan Chronicle is the company's most prized possession. With a
circulation of about 43,000, the Chronicle is usually thick with local and
national advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defender has a paid circulation of 16,000 and weekend circulation of
19,000. In the 1950s, when it first became a daily, circulation topped 50,000.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Stocks Dive; Real Weakens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian stocks took their biggest dive in nearly
a year and the currency closed sharply weaker Tuesday as investors feared a
possible U.S. interest rate rise would attract money away from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, South America's largest, closed down 6.4
percent, or 1,079.42, to 15,851.00 -- its worst performance since Jan. 14, 1999
when the government let the currency float freely and the market dropped nearly
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a very strong profit-taking action, and I believe there is room for
more of it," said a Sao Paulo-based dealer with a European bank. "However, there
should be some news around soon to revert that bad sentiment."
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange's Bovespa index rose 69.6 percent in dollar terms in 1999,
rising 32 percent in December alone. But Tuesday's fall erased all the gains
earned in the last two weeks of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Brazil's currency, the real, also dropped against the dollar Tuesday, with
the market spooked by falls in Brazilian and international stock markets,
traders said. In the United States, stock prices plummeted as well: The Nasdaq
composite index, the best performer in 1999, suffered its worst point loss in
history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Brazilian real closed at 1.85 to the dollar compared with Monday's close
of 1.82 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   The Central Bank intervened late in the trading day when the real reached
1.86 to the dollar, selling dollars to support the local currency. The
intervention brought some relief for the real but was unable to reverse the
day's sharp losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders added that planned buybacks of dollars by the central bank on
Wednesday and next week could cause some additional pressure on the real.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the central bank auctioned $1.3 billion to banks willing to sell
the same amount of dollars back to the monetary authority this month in order to
ease liquidity fears in the run up to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The central bank is due to buy back the dollars on Jan. 5 and Jan. 10.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Sues Flight Attendants  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines Tuesday filed a federal lawsuit
against its flight attendants' union and its officers, accusing them of
conducting a "sickout" to pressure the airline as a new contract is negotiated.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit in U.S. District Court in St. Paul accuses Teamsters Local 2000
of conducting an illegal job action. Northwest, based in Eagan, said union
leaders made public statements showing their intent to take action in their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline said that the union has encouraged and directed flight
attendants to call in sick rather than report to work since late December.
Northwest said the encouragement came in the form of e-mail, phone calls and
notices on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
	   "These notices have made clear that the purpose of the sickout is to protest
Northwest's position in collective bargaining and to bring pressure to bear on
Northwest to accede to the union's demands," the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teamsters Local 2000 president Billie Davenport denied Tuesday afternoon
that the union's executive committee has encouraged members to participate in
any illegal job action.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have advocated and spoken out to our members on many occasions
encouraging them not to participate in any illegal activities," Davenport said.
She noted that union officials have cautioned against a sickout or other job
actions repeatedly since September, in both hot line messages and e-mail
messages to members.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest said there has been a dramatic increase in sick calls, "far beyond
historic norms and prior year averages."
</P>
<P>
	   Since Dec. 30, Northwest said it has had to cancel more than 300 flights
because of the sickout.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline asked for an immediate restraining order so it can provide
"adequate and reliable service" to its customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest also asked the court to require the union to publicly withdraw any
orders, requests or suggestions that its members participate in the action.
</P>
<P>
	   A hearing on the request was set for 8:15 a.m. Wednesday before U.S.
District Judge Donovan Frank in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   The union of 11,000 flight attendants has been seeking a new contract for 3
1/2 years, increasing frustrations for some employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Courts have ruled recently against sickouts or other job actions not
approved by the National Mediation Board.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Texas early last year slapped a $45 million penalty on
the union representing pilots at American Airlines, who staged a sickout in
February to protest American's acquisition of Reno Air, and then defied the
judge's back-to-work order.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Comair filed a lawsuit against union pilots for refusing to fly
270 flights because of mechanical issues that Comair said were minor.
</P>
<P>
	   The future of the Northwest talks remains uncertain. Flight attendants in
late August overwhelmingly rejected a tentative agreement that had been endorsed
by union negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides met in a mediated session on Dec. 7, but the mediation board
said a union proposal presented then asked for too many contract changes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Propose Schools Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to propose a new program of
federal grants for school construction and revive his effort to use tax breaks
to help local communities upgrade existing schools, congressional officials and
lobbyists said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton plans to announce his proposal Wednesday, after he meets with
congressional Democratic leaders, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. It will be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he will introduce on
Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the school construction proposal were not immediately available.
The plan, however, underlines a desire by the White House and congressional
Democrats to emphasize education during this election year.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls suggest Democrats have an advantage over Republicans on the issue,
even though the GOP has sought to improve its image by abandoning earlier plans
to abolish the Education Department in favor of supporting added spending for
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has repeatedly proposed using federal money for school construction
in recent years, only to see the idea repeatedly ignored or shot down by
Congress. Many Republicans have objected, saying the plan would impose federal
strictures on education decisions that should be made by state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Clinton's budget proposed using $3.7 billion in tax credits over
five years to help local governments issue nearly $25 billion worth of bonds for
school repair and modernization. He said that would be enough to improve 5,000
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if that money had been approved, it would address only a fraction of
the problem that school and construction industry groups say exists.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that renovation
and repair of America's schools would cost $112 billion, with an additional $60
billion needed to provide space for an expected 3 million new students over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   That report also said a third of all elementary and secondary schools need
some repair, with 14 million children attending class in substandard buildings.
Almost half the schools lacked the wiring needed to accommodate computer
systems, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is exactly the type of program that's needed,'' said Dan Wilson,
senior director of federal affairs for the American Institute of Architects.
``If we don't do something, it's a national disgrace.''

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Aides to Vice President Al Gore said Tuesday they have
collected signatures from more than 100,000 Democrats in their effort to assure
him a spot on New York's March 7 presidential primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic contenders technically need only 5,000 signatures statewide to be
in the hunt for national convention delegates in New York. However, they must
collect an additional 23,192 signatures -- spread across each of the state's 31
congressional districts -- if they want to completely control who becomes their
delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's campaign said it easily had met both requirements and would file
their petitions this week with the state Board of Elections. Candidates have
until Thursday to file. The state board will certify the ballot on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The numbers speak for themselves,'' said Eric Eve, Gore's New York
campaign manager. ``Al Gore's commitment to change that works for working
families has generated tremendous enthusiasm for our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's rival for
the Democratic presidential nomination, said Bradley's petitions would be filed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think it's been a good process and that there's been enormous
grassroots enthusiasm for Bill Bradley in New York state, and we think the
numbers will demonstrate that,'' Bradley aide Julia Rothwax said. She said the
campaign believes Bradley will have enough signatures to qualify delegate slates
in all parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes
filed petitions to qualify their delegate slates in all 31 congressional
districts for the March 7 GOP primary. Sen. John McCain's New York campaign
manager, Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, said petitions would be
filed later this week to qualify McCain delegate slates in the ``majority'' of
the state's congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the state's demanding ballot access rules, only Bush, Forbes and
McCain are competing in the GOP primary. McCain has filed a federal lawsuit in
an attempt to open up the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a U.S. senator, Bill Bradley immersed himself in some
issues but seemed unmoved by others, a record that some former congressional
colleagues and aides say offers clues as to what kind of president he would be.
</P>
<P>
	   They painted an image Tuesday of a legislator willing to roll up his sleeves
and get his hands dirty -- so long as a bill or a cause appealed to him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He gets deeply involved in the key issues that he wants to get done,''
said Marcia Aronoff, Bradley's chief of staff in the Senate from 1978 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, a Democrat who left the Senate in 1997 after three terms, was the
topic at the American Enterprise Institute, which is holding a series of
seminars on how the presidential candidates would govern if elected. A similar
seminar on Republican John McCain is scheduled for Thursday, followed by
sessions next week on Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The discussion of Bradley at times echoed arguments by Gore's campaign,
which charges that the former New Jersey senator views politics as a lofty
academic exercise rather than a day-by-day fight. In New Hampshire this week,
Gore said Bradley ``seems to believe America can address only one thing at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., called Bradley ``bright as a star''
but wondered whether he ``would have a tough time bending to negotiate deals''
as president. Rostenkowski supports Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Defending Bradley, former Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., said only the
less thoughtful members of Congress are ``into everything.''
</P>
<P>
	   Durenberger did, however, question why Bradley pressed for Senate votes on
pet issues knowing that he would lose.
</P>
<P>
	   Aronoff said Bradley did so because he believes that if you always wait for
the right moment, ``you'll never start.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- There were no surprises as Florida's Presidential
Candidate Selection Committee on Tuesday chose two Democrats and six Republicans
to appear on the state's March 14 presidential primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley are the
Democrats. The Republicans are Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Arizona Sen. John
McCain, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, conservative activist Gary Bauer, former U.N.
Ambassador Alan Keyes and magazine publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida law lets political parties select the candidates who will appear on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal election law limits spending by candidates in
each state, but the rules governing the law aren't always straightforward.
</P>
<P>
	   Advertising on WMUR-TV in Manchester, the biggest station in New Hampshire,
is a no-brainer for any politician competing in the state that holds the
nation's first presidential primary, this year on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   But Manchester is technically part of the Boston media market, so all but 17
percent of the spending on WMUR may be attributed to Massachusetts. That allows
candidates to spend much more than the $661,000 limit in New Hampshire -- which
is what Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain plans to do.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Bush campaign is out there criticizing it,'' said McCain campaign
spokesman Howard Opinsky. But many other Republicans, including former President
Bush and former Sen. Bob Dole, the failed 1996 GOP presidential nominee, did the
same thing, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The law is the law,'' Opinsky said. ``We are well within the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is not accepting federal campaign funds, has
raised a record $67 million and is not bound by the federal spending caps. The
same goes for millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who is financing his own
campaign.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Makes Offer on Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has asked Cuba to let Elian
Gonzalez's father escort him back to the island if U.S. officials decide the boy
should return to Cuba, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said the request is a contingency plan and does not signal a
decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to resolve the
politically charged issue by sending Elian back to his homeland. The official,
asking not to be identified, said Cuba is considering the request.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was retrieved from an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25.
He had been aboard a Florida-bound boat that capsized, killing 10 other
passengers, including his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   A tug of war has developed over Elian. The Cuban government wants him
returned to Cuba to be raised by his father, while his relatives in Miami and
many Cuban exiles insist he would have a better life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   As controversy continued to swirl around the boy, he began attending classes
at the private Lincoln-Marti School in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. He
wore the school uniform of a white dress shirt and blue pants, and carried a
book bag.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, told U.S. National Council of
Churches officials in Cuba, ``I should be in charge of my child's education,
where he goes to school and what kind of schooling he receives.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, said a decision by the father to
apply for a non-immigrant visa would be welcome. But for Gonzalez to make the
trip, he also would need travel documents from the Cuban government, Rubin
noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The other U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said there were two
main reasons for suggesting as a contingency plan that the father be allowed to
travel to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said it would make more sense for the father to escort the boy
back to Cuba than anyone else. Secondly, if the father were in Miami, it would
ease concerns among Cuban-Americans that he currently is not free to speak his
mind because of Cuba's tight controls over its citizenry.
</P>
<P>
	   But the free speech issue still would not be resolved, contended Spencer
Eig, a Miami attorney representing Elian's great-uncle who, along with his
great-aunt, have been caring for the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel that if Juan Miguel Gonzalez comes alone, leaving his new wife and
child under the control of the Cuban government, then he'll still be under
duress,'' said Eig. ``This case should be settled by a fair and impartial
decision maker with Elian Gonzalez's best interest as the sole issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two days after the boy was rescued, Cuban President Fidel Castro demanded
that the boy be returned to Cuba within 72 hours. He relented on that demand and
also has backed off his insistence that no meeting between the father and INS
officials would be allowed except to inform him of the date of Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   INS officials have had two meetings in Cuba with the father, including one
on New Year's Eve. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the father denied
to the INS officials that he was speaking under duress. There were no Cuban
officials present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has set a Jan. 21 hearing on the case but INS officials said this
does not preclude an earlier decision.
</P>
<P>
	   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said Tuesday in Washington that the agency has
told Cuban officials it is interested in resolving the issue quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Another INS spokesman, Russ Bergeron, said Cuba would have no assurances
that Juan Miguel Gonzalez would return to the island if he got the green light
to travel to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anyone who is physically in the United States can ask for asylum,''
Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another regulation, however, allows the State Department to issue a
non-immigrant visa only if it is convinced that the applicant does not intend to
remain in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
	   An American Baptist minister, the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, met with the
boy's father and maternal grandparents in Havana and said Tuesday she believed
the boy should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The human emotion in this family is very real and very powerful,'' said
Campbell, outgoing general secretary of the National Council of Churches. ``We
believe that this family has both the emotional strength and economic resources
to raise this child.''

their custody fight with a recovering black cocaine addict Tuesday and were
named the permanent guardians of her 3-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
	   Circuit Judge Judith Brawka's ruling transferred guardianship of the boy
known as Baby T from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to
appellate Judge Anne Burke and Alderman Edward Burke, who were already the boy's
foster parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Brawka was brought in from Kane County in to assure that the Burkes'
influence in Chicago politics would play no part in deciding custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Brawka's ruling turned down a request from the boy's mother, Tina Olison,
for overnight visits with the youngster. She currently is allowed to visit Baby
T for four hours every other week. Brawka's ruling gave her one additional visit
each month.
</P>
<P>
	   Olison said she would appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am disappointed,'' she said after the hearing. ``I had hoped for more
time, and I hope it will be increased.''
</P>
<P>
	   Olison had waged a two-year custody fight for her son, who was born with
cocaine in his system.
</P>
<P>
	   Brawka ruled in March that Baby T should go back to Olison, saying at the
time that black culture should be a factor in Baby T's upbringing.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Oct. 19, Brawka reversed herself, saying Baby T should remain with
the Burkes for the time. She expressed concern that he was having trouble
adjusting and said Olison had been feuding with her social workers.

<HEADLINE> USDA Faces Squabble Over Pork Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department is caught between squabbling
hog farmers over whether to hold a referendum on payment of producer fees for
the ``other white meat'' advertising campaign for pork.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the ``checkoff fees'' demanded Tuesday that the USDA hold a
referendum on the program by March. They submitted petitions to the department
last May, but USDA officials have not validated the signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At best this is bureaucratic bungling. At worse, the USDA is trying to
derail the democratic process,'' said Mark McDowell, a Hampton, Iowa, farmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the $48 million program, which pays for research as well as
advertising, say it has done little to stimulate pork consumption and mostly
benefits meat processors and large, corporate farm operations. Defenders of the
program say many of the signatures on the petitions may be invalid.
</P>
<P>
	   The Campaign for Family Farms, which led the petition drive, submitted
16,500 signatures, more than the 14,986 required under government rules.
Kathleen Merrigan, administrator of USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, said
she hopes to finish reviewing the petitions this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the signatures were illegible, and some petitions were missing
addresses and other information, Merrigan said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't appear at this time that anyone is pleased with all that we've
done. ... Sometimes that happens when you are in the middle and you are trying
to run a fair and objective process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA used a telemarketing firm to contact a statistically valid sample of
1,400 people whose signatures appeared on the petitions. Some refused to
cooperate with the callers, and others denied signing the petitions. The
department sent followup letters last month to 428 petition signers pleading for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   The fee, or ``checkoff,'' requires pork producers to pay 45 cents for every
$100 of animal value. The money goes to the quasigovernmental National Pork
Board, which contracts promotional services through the National Pork Producers
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the program say they get little for the fees. Pork consumption
has been relatively flat despite the advertising, rising from 51.5 pounds per
person in 1985 to 53.4 pounds last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The program's supporters, led by the National Pork Producers Council,
contend it has benefited all farmers by improving pork's reputation with
consumers and sponsoring research that has yielded leaner pigs.
</P>
<P>
	   If the fee is abolished, ``the only people who will benefit are the largest
players in the industry, who have the capacity in their own integrated
structures to do their own promotion and to maintain their own research and to
keep it to themselves,'' said John McNutt, a West Branch, Iowa, farmer who is
president of the producers council.
</P>
<P>
	   The Campaign for Family Farms got a judge last year to block USDA from
releasing the petitioners' names to McNutt's group. The decision is now on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   The pork program is among several that have come under criticism from
producers. Last month, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman endorsed several steps
to increase USDA's oversight of the research and promotion programs, including
submitting them to mandatory votes by producers every five years.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Kennedy To Endorse Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSWORTH, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. Edward Kennedy will endorse Al Gore for
president Wednesday in a move the Gore campaign hopes will help with voters in
New Hampshire, next door to Kennedy's Massachusetts, and with wavering Democrats
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy normally does not endorse candidates before the party's nominating
convention. The decision to act now came after reflection over the Christmas
holiday and a phone call between Kennedy and Gore since New Year's, according to
people in the Kennedy camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore supporters had pushed for the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy, brother of President Kennedy, remains a liberal hero to many
Democrats. He sought the presidency himself in 1980 and has served in the Senate
not only with both Gore and rival Democratic contender Bill Bradley but with the
vice president's father, Al Gore Sr., in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy and Gore planned to appear at a Boston middle school to talk about
education policy on Wednesday before driving north to Portsmouth, N.H., to
discuss health care with senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   The two issues are paramount to Kennedy and have been mainstays of Gore's
campaign for the party's 2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent months, the vice president has seen his once sizable lead in the
polls diminish in the face of a strong challenge from Bradley, the former New
Jersey senator. That has caused some Democrats to wish out loud that Kennedy
would announce an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kennedy camp said the endorsement should not be viewed as a slap against
Bradley, who has unveiled a health care plan that Gore has criticized.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley suggested the development only bolstered his contention that Gore,
unlike him, is a Washington insider.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought all along he would have more of the establishment support,''
Bradley told reporters in Bedford, N.H.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I have are the people. He has entrenched power, he has a president who
is supporting him, loyal to him -- as he was loyal to the president -- he's got
most of the DNC (Democratic National Committee), he's got most of the big
Democratic fund-raisers, he rides on Air Force Two. That is entrenched power,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kennedy endorsement is sure to garner huge coverage in the Boston media
-- which spills into vote-rich southern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   It may also trigger other endorsements by the Massachusetts congressional
delegation, which largely has held off endorsing in the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, speaking with reporters after addressing students at the
high school in this seacoast community, was clearly pleased by the development.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think anybody in the modern history of America has really
accomplished more in the United States Senate over the course of a career than
Ted Kennedy,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Glitch Affects Indiana Licenses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana residents who got a driver's license this week
will have to get a new one because of a Y2K-related computer glitch, state
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The licenses were printed with five-year expiration dates instead of four
years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It really is a minor problem,'' said Bureau of Motor Vehicles spokesman
Alvin Hayes. ``We're talking about a limited number of driver's licenses.''
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't have an exact number and said the problem should be corrected
soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Another minor computer problem this week at the BMV involved vehicle
registration. Some registrations had to be processed manually instead of by
computer because of an apparent Y2K-related problem, Hayes said. That problem
was discovered late Monday and fixed Tuesday morning, state officials said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Starts Move to New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- If her kitchen chairs have arrived, can Hillary
Clinton be far behind?
</P>
<P>
	   Six weeks after she unofficially announced her candidacy for New York's U.S.
Senate seat, two moving vans loaded with rolled-up rugs, kitchen chairs, a
mattress and assorted boxes arrived at the Clintons' new $1.7 million
Westchester County home on a rainy Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton was expected at the house Wednesday to begin emptying the boxes
and to spend her first night there, said Karen Finney, a member of her campaign
staff.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady hopes to move in by the end of next week, and President
Clinton is planning to visit here at the same time, Finney said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee for the Senate seat opened by
Daniel Patrick Moynihan's retirement, has said she plans to cut back on White
House duties and spend most of her time in New York state this year. New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is expected to be her Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons plan to live in the white, three-story frame house when the
president leaves office in January 2001. They signed a deal to buy the house
last September.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of Mrs. Clinton's friends, including a decorator, were at the house
Tuesday to supervise the unloading of the 26-foot trucks. Most of the items had
been kept in storage in suburban Virginia although some were from the White
House, Finney said.
</P>
<P>
	   The move was paid for by the Clintons, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons have been waiting for the Secret Service to finish security
work before moving in. Security precautions approved by local officials included
an 8-foot-tall fence around the property and construction of a small gatehouse
at the end of the driveway.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither was in place Tuesday. Instead of the guardhouse, a phone sat on a
rock at the bottom of the driveway.

<HEADLINE> Investors Buy The Village Voice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK -- A group of investors bought The Village Voice and six other
alternative weeklies on Tuesday, according to a spokeswoman for the publisher.
</P>
<P>
	   The leading partner of the group is Weiss, Peck &AMP; Greer, a money management
firm with offices in New York and San Francisco. The group bought the papers
from Stern Publishing, a company with revenues of more than $80 million and 500
employees nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times first reported the sale on its Web site Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The specifics of the deal were not released.
</P>
<P>
	   David Schneiderman, current publisher of the Voice, will become the chief
executive for the new company. Schneiderman told The Times he expects few
changes will be made to the New York weekly's journalistic style and said The
Village Voice's current editor, Donald H. Forst, will remain "as long as he
wants to."
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Schneiderman nor officials with the new buyers were available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Village Voice, founded in 1955 by Norman Mailer and two colleagues, has
a circulation of about 250,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Stern Publishing announced in September that the paper and six weeklies
published in Long Island, Seattle, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Orange County,
Calif., and Cleveland were being put up for sale. The new company will include
an alternative weekly in Nashville, Tenn., already owned by the investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Stern Publishing purchased the Voice from Rupert Murdoch 14 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Humans Smuggled in Cargo Containers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- More and more Chinese immigrants are trying to smuggle
themselves into the country by crossing the Pacific packed in cargo containers
aboard ships, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last week, four of the 40-foot-long, canvas-topped metal containers
have been found and 60 suspected aliens captured.
</P>
<P>
	   In Canada, 25 stowaways were found Monday inside two containers on the
Seattle-bound California Jupiter. It remained docked in Vancouver on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems to be a troubling new trend,'' said Sharon Gavin, a spokeswoman
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service Western Region in Laguna Niguel.
``We're concerned that this may increase.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another INS spokeswoman, Virginia Kice, said: ``Some of these ships have
over 1,000 containers. It is, in a sense, like looking for a needle in a
haystack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal agencies formed a working group to investigate. So far, it is
unclear if the same group of smugglers is responsible, Ms. Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
	   For at least a decade, Chinese lured by dreams of financial or political
freedom have sought to enter the United States illegally. The INS estimates as
many as 27,000 illegal Chinese were in the United States in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement success in stopping smuggling boats apparently has sparked
the container trend, Ms. Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smugglers charge as much as $60,000 per person for container space, about
twice the fee charged those who come on smuggling boats, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
	   Rusty fishing boats and freighters have carried hundreds to America.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, about 700 Chinese citizens were arrested after arriving on boats in
the San Francisco area, including 200 who were dumped from a freighter near the
Golden Gate Bridge. That same year, 10 immigrants died when they jumped from a
freighter that ran aground near New York City. About 300 immigrants were on
board. More recently, boats have been stopped near Guam and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Dole Endorses Bush in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush picked up the endorsement of former GOP
rival Elizabeth Dole on Tuesday and took dead aim at his leading challenger,
saying John McCain's tax-cut plan would not do as much for lower-income
Americans as his own $483 billion proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a tax gap in this campaign,'' Bush declared. ``His plan doesn't
address the people who live on the outskirts of poverty, working hard to get to
the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dole, joining Bush at presidential primary campaign stops here and in Iowa,
compared the Texas governor to President Reagan, calling him ``my kind of
conservative'' and saying he would restore trust in a tarnished White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today we rally to another Western governor, just as bold at challenging
the status quo, just as resolved to restore pride in our institutions, just as
determined to be himself,'' Dole said, recalling Reagan's tenure as California
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, in a deadheat with McCain in New Hampshire, according to most polls,
is trying to draw sharper distinctions between his rival ahead of the nation's
first primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how he would do that, the Texas governor pointed to their competing
tax-cut plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a difference of attitude. There is a difference of opinion,''
Bush said. ``He's called my plan too big; so has Vice President Gore, and I
believe my plan not only is just right, it's realistic, it can get done and it's
going to make a big difference for the families of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said that under his plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would see
their taxes cut by $2,000 and under Senator McCain's plan, that same family
would save only $200.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, asked to respond aboard his campaign bus across town, didn't address
the different figures, but said Bush had characterized McCain's stance wrongly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't view Governor Bush's tax cut as too big, I view it as misplaced,''
said McCain, who has in the past criticized the plan as too hefty. ``Sixty
percent of the tax cut goes to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans. That's
not the kind of tax relief that I think America needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, accused McCain of pitting the rich against
the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's wrong to engage in class warfare,'' Fleischer said. ``That's what the
Democrats like to do and I hope Republicans in the primary do not engage in
class warfare.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told reporters that Dole's endorsement and Bush's attack are natural
results of a strong challenge to a frontrunner backed by the party's
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's gonna get very, very, very intense,'' McCain said. ``It's gonna get
very tough. When you see a campaign get traction, it gets very tough. I have
every reason to think it's gonna get tougher.''
</P>
<P>
	   The challenges to Bush's frontrunner status stretch beyond New Hampshire. In
Iowa, he is leading Steve Forbes, but the campaign is wary that the publisher
could soon unleash an ad blitz similar to the one that Dole's husband, Bob, felt
weakened him in his 1996 race.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's endorsement added to his collection of high-profile backers as he
tries to fend off those challenges and court female voters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Dole and Bush were quick to douse speculation that Bush's kickoff
appearance for the year in New Hampshire was a preview of a Bush-Dole ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First things first,'' Bush told reporters. ``It's important to have a
strong woman like Elizabeth Dole standing by my side to help me win the
primaries and the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dole, too, declined to be drawn into vice presidential speculation. She
said, ``The governor has got to win the nomination and when he does the party is
very fortunate to have a large number of very talented leaders with great
experience from which he can choose.''
</P>
<P>
	   She had pursued the nomination herself until October, when she quit the race
citing a lack of money. By that time, Bush had raised $57 million to her $5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole echoed Bush's lines on tax cuts and school reform. In a slap at the
Democratic Clinton administration, the former Red Cross president said that
``trust is the coin of the realm'' in a democracy and ``lately, that trust has
been tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like Reagan, she said, Bush ``would innovate, not regulate.'' She said,
``That's my kind of conservative.''
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, Bush cited Dole's allegiance to Reagan, for whom she served as
transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elizabeth, you have always said that you have been a lieutenant in Ronald
Reagan's army. I am proud to have you as a general in mine,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one woman in the audience thought she was looking at a winning team
on the stage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of women like her and I think would like to see a woman in the
limelight,'' said Sue Ritze, 46, of Bedford.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and Dole later flew to Iowa for stops at Des Moines and Davenport --
and an endorsement by Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley.

<HEADLINE> Connection Sought in Explosive Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Federal agents have linked an Algerian man arrested near here
on Christmas Eve with a countryman accused of trying to smuggle explosives into
the United States from Canada, The Seattle Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Quoting unidentified sources, the Times said FBI officials have connected
Abdel Hakim Tizegha, arrested Dec. 24 and charged Monday with immigration
violations, with Ahmed Ressam, who was arrested Dec. 14 in Port Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   No link was made in court between Tizegha and Ressam, who has pleaded
innocent to federal charges accusing him of having bomb-making materials in his
rental car as he entered the country.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Times reported the FBI gained key evidence from conversations
between Tizegha and another Algerian, Abdel Ghani, in New York. Ghani was
arrested Thursday and charged with helping Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   How FBI agents learned of the men's conversations was not clear, but they
may have listened through a court-approved wiretap, or recorded calls with
Tizegha's permission, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times source said that after Ressam's arrest, Tizegha spoke with Ghani
about Ressam and a plot to smuggle explosives into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Tizegha, 29, is charged with re-entering the United States without
permission and with eluding examination by Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials when he re-entered the country in November at Blaine, about
100 miles north of Seattle. If convicted, he could face up to 2 1/2 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal agents began questioning people around the country last week about
possible links to Ressam. About 15 people -- mostly Algerians -- were either
charged with criminal violations or held in civil detention.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Defender Newspaper For Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Time has run out on efforts by the family that owns the
Chicago Defender to maintain a role at the fabled newspaper that once helped
lure blacks off southern plantations and into northern factories.
</P>
<P>
	   A $10 million debt-financed recapitalization plan that would have left the
Sengstacke family with 49 percent of the company has fallen through. Now the
daily newspaper is on the auction block to pay $3 million in estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defender's future was placed in doubt after John Sengstacke, nephew of
the paper's founder, Robert Abbott, died in 1997 at age 84. In 1975, he placed
Sengstacke Enterprises Inc. in trust with instructions that it be sold upon his
death. His heirs had no say in the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to auction the Defender, and its three weeklies, the Tri-State
Defender in Memphis, the Pittsburgh Courier and Detroit's Michigan Chronicle,
came after the collapse of a deal giving Detroit businessman Don Barden control
of Sengstacke Enterprises Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Telephone calls Tuesday to Myiti Sengstacke, granddaughter of John
Sengstacke, and Barden for comment on the auction were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Barden Companies Inc. -- which owns the Majestic Star riverboat casino in
Gary, Ind., five Illinois radio stations and other businesses -- will be one of
three black-owned firms that will be allowed to submit bids on the company by
Jan. 31. The others bidding at the auction, to be conducted by Duff &AMP; Phelps
LLC, are PublicMediaWorks Inc., an investment group, and Houston-based Equal
Access Media Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Because it is privately owned, earnings and revenues were not available. But
the Michigan Chronicle is the only newspaper of the four that appears to be
profitable, said Kurt Cherry, who heads PublicMediaWorks.
</P>
<P>
	   Cherry said his investment group made previous efforts to buy Sengstacke
Enterprises, offering $12 million when the company first went up for sale two
years ago, but was rebuffed.
</P>

	   Until he receives information from Duff &AMP; Phelps outlining its financial
condition, Cherry said he couldn't estimate how much his group would bid for the

penniless and founded the newspaper as a weekly. It went on to be read by
thousands in the South, where it was distributed by Pullman porters and sold by
newsboys who risked being lynched for their actions.

<HEADLINE> Santana Leads Grammy Nominees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Carlos Santana, whose career caught fire when
he gave a scorching performance at Woodstock in 1969, received 10 Grammy
nominations Tuesday for his commercial comeback album, "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old guitarist, who previously had received just five nominations
overall, led all nominees for the 42nd annual Grammys.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernatural," Santana's best-selling collaboration with such stars as Eric
Clapton and Lauryn Hill, was nominated for best album and rock album.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana was also nominated for record of the year for "Smooth," which
featured Rob Thomas of matchbox 20 and was Santana's first No. 1 single.
"Smooth" and Santana's "Love of My Life" with Dave Matthews accounted for two of
the five nominees for pop vocal collaboration.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've heard that the way the music rules apply, only 17 to 27 years old is
cool. Well, surprise," Santana said. "You know, there's a reason why teen-agers
listen to '60s music, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Santana: They need to
pass through us to get to their thing."
</P>
<P>
	   In pop music categories, the group TLC was second with six nominations for
the album "FanMail."
</P>
<P>
	   "I was really shocked," TLC member Chilli said. "I can't wait to call my
group members because they have no idea."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides album of the year, TLC's nominations included best rhythm and blues
album, record of the year for "No Scrubs," and pop vocal performance by a duo or
group for "Unpretty."
</P>
<P>
	   Classical conductor Pierre Boulez also received six nominations. Other
multiple nominees included Asleep at the Wheel with five, and the Backstreet
Boys, Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, Hill and Whitney Houston, all with four
apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   The best new artist nominees were Christina Aguilera, Macy Gray, Kid Rock,
Britney Spears and Susan Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Santana's "Smooth," other nominees for record of the year were "I
Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys, "Believe" by Cher, "Livin' La Vida
Loca" by Ricky Martin and "No Scrubs" by TLC.
</P>
<P>
	   The other album of the year nominees were "Millennium" by Backstreet Boys,
"Fly" by the Dixie Chicks and "When I Look in Your Eyes" by Diana Krall.
</P>
<P>
	   By nominating Asleep at the Wheel for five awards and band leader Ray Benson
for one, Grammy voters showed a taste for western swing music -- which combines
big band and country.
</P>
<P>
	   The group is up for best country album for "Ride With Bob"; best country
instrumental for "Bob's Breakdown"; best long form music video; and is twice
nominated for best country collaboration with vocals, one for a duet with the
Dixie Chicks and the other for one featuring Manhattan Transfer and Willie
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is just wonderful," Benson said. "It's infectious kind of music to
make, crossing all those borders into pop and jazz and all that. I think it
brings a musicality quotient because it's a kind of music which takes a good bit
of musical ability to play."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, whose only Grammy win is a rock instrumental award in 1988, also
picked up nominations for pop instrumental for "El Farol," pop vocal performance
by a duo or group for "Maria" and rock instrumental for "The Calling," a
collaboration with Clapton.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana has put out 29 albums over 30 years, but it has been many years
since he has had a major commercial success. He said that the nominations
Tuesday were gratifying but that he had never felt slighted.
</P>
<P>
	   "Things come when they come," Santana said. "I always felt my reward was for
Miles Davis to call my house, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Buddy Guy, B.B.
King. When people like these call my house, those are my Grammys, my Oscars, my
Emmys, my Tonys. I know I'm connected with some of the very, very important
people on the planet."
</P>
<P>
	   The Grammys will be awarded Feb. 23 in a CBS broadcast from the Staples
Center in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Norway Train Collision  </HEADLINE>
   By NILS MYKLEBOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENA, Norway (AP) -- Two Norwegian passenger trains crashed head-on in
flames and twisted metal Tuesday, killing at least seven people and leaving
another 26 missing and feared dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters battled the fire and thick smoke for nearly six hours before
rescuers could get into the heated wreckage. No survivors were found.
</P>
<P>
	   The 26 missing ``are probably not alive,'' district Police Chief Magnar
Lynum said at a news conference in the nearby town of Elverum, about 100 miles
north of Oslo. ``The damage was so great that they could not have survived.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the other 67 people aboard the trains were accounted for by late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Per Erik Skjefstad, of the Elverum police, said rescue efforts were
suspended after a seven-hour search and would resume at daylight.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, police held out hope for the 26 missing, saying that some might
have just walked away. However, by late Tuesday authorities said that
possibility had been virtually ruled out.
</P>
<P>
	   The national news agency NTB reported that dozens of people were injured.
Authorities said they still did not know how many were hurt, saying they lost
count as injured passengers were taken to various hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   The two trains collided around 1:30 p.m. at the Aasta Station in Aamot
township, near the town of Rena. One train was headed south carrying 81
passengers and two crew, while the other was headed north from the city of Hamar
with 15 passengers and two crew.
</P>
<P>
	   The two trains were on the same track at the time of the collision and news
reports said they had traveled that way for several miles. Officials said they
still didn't know why they were on the same track and were investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a terrible tragedy,'' Osmund Ueland, the chief executive of the
Norwegian state railroad, told a news conference in Oslo. ``Three of our crew
are missing,'' including two engineers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses and rescuers described calm after the crash, followed by chaos as
flames spread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought we stopped for a moose,'' said passenger Jeanette Haug. ``People
said there was fire and we had to get out. But it was calm and I think people
did well.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least one locomotive overturned, flames could be seen shooting out of the
windows of at least one passenger car and some cars were reported to have slid
down an embankment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We didn't get any warning that anything was wrong before the crash,''
passenger Robert Ulriksen said on Norway's state radio NRK. ``I flew forward and
hit my knees pretty hard on the seat in front. I picked myself up and realized
it was pretty serious because the car was leaning and on its side.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said those on board tried to help each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got those who were the least injured out,'' he said. ``Passengers and
baggage were strewn all across the middle corridor. It looked worse in the car
behind.''
</P>
<P>
	   National Railways Director Steinar Killi said the section of track where the
collision occurred had been due for a safety upgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Next year we will have an automatic train stop system there that we
unfortunately didn't have today,'' he told a news conference in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second serious public transport accident in Norway in just over a
month. On Nov. 26, 16 people drowned when a high-speed ferry ran aground and
sank.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Sues Flight Attendants  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines filed a federal lawsuit against
its flight attendants' union and its officers Tuesday, accusing them of
conducting a "sickout" to pressure the airline as a new contract is negotiated.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit accuses Teamsters Local 2000 of conducting an illegal job
action.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Dec. 30, Northwest said it has had to cancel more than 300 flights
because of the sickout.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline asked for an immediate restraining order so it can provide
"adequate and reliable service" to its customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline, based in Egan, said the union has encouraged and directed
flight attendants to call in sick rather than report to work since late
December. Northwest said the encouragement came in the form of e-mail, phone
calls and notices on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Teamsters Local 2000 President Billie Davenport denied that the union's
executive committee has encouraged members to participate in any illegal job
action.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have advocated and spoken out to our members on many occasions
encouraging them not to participate in any illegal activities," Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest asked the court to require the union to publicly withdraw any
orders, requests or suggestions that its members participate in the action. A
hearing on the request was set for Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The union of 11,000 flight attendants has been seeking a new contract for 3
1/2 years, increasing frustrations for some employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The future of the Northwest talks remains uncertain. Flight attendants in
late August overwhelmingly rejected a tentative agreement that had been endorsed
by union negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   Courts have ruled recently against sickouts or other job actions not
approved by the National Mediation Board.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Texas early last year slapped a $45 million penalty on
the union representing pilots at American Airlines, who staged a sickout in
February to protest American's acquisition of Reno Air, and then defied the
judge's back-to-work order.

<HEADLINE> 3 Boys Eat Crack, Get Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   APOPKA, Fla. (AP) -- Three elementary school boys were hospitalized Tuesday
after they ate small amounts of crack cocaine that one of them found near their
school bus stop.
</P>
<P>
	   An 8-year-old boy found the bag of crack cocaine before boarding his school
bus and ate it thinking it was candy, said Sgt. Bernie Presha, a spokesman for
the Orange County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
	   A 10-year-old boy on the bus took the bag, consumed some of the crack
cocaine and gave some to a 6-year-old boy, Presha said.
</P>
<P>
	   The three boys became sick and were taken to a hospital immediately after
arriving at Lovell Elementary School. They were released a short time later.
</P>
<P>
	   No charges will be filed, Presha said.

<HEADLINE> Ivorian Junta Head Becomes President  </HEADLINE>
   By AMBA DADSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- The general who toppled Ivory Coast's elected
government named himself president Tuesday, saying he will lead a coalition to
run the West African country until democracy is restored.
</P>
<P>
	   Within hours, a leading opposition party protested the move and announced it
was withdrawing its members from the 21-member Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Army chief Gen. Robert Guei, who seized power in a Christmas Eve coup,
appointed military officers to the key ministries of defense, security and
interior. Guei also named himself defense minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining positions were distributed among independents and political
parties -- including that of ousted President Henri Konan Bedie.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo said his Ivorian Popular Front party was
pulling out its members because the rival Rally of the Republicans party of
Alassane Dramane Ouattara received more posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Ouattara's party was given three Cabinet posts compared to the other's five.
But Gbagbo said as many as 10 Cabinet members were supporters of Ouattara's
party.
</P>
<P>
	   The junta has promised a new constitution and elections to restore civilian
rule, but has not said when the elections will be held.
</P>
<P>
	   Guei dodged journalists' questions Tuesday on whether he would run for
president in the elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't have the skin of a bear before you've killed it,'' he said,
explaining that much work needed to be done before democracy could be restored.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people asked me to carry out a mission, and I am fulfilling that
mission,'' Guei said. ``It seems in bad taste for me to already think about
power.''
</P>
<P>
	   The coup came amid an economic decline in Ivory Coast, which was considered
one of West Africa's most stable and prosperous countries.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty in King Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, Maine (AP) -- The motorist who hit horror writer Stephen King pleaded
guilty Tuesday to lesser charges under a plea agreement that will keep him out
of jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan Smith pleaded guilty to driving to endanger, and a more serious
charged of aggravated assault was dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith's license had been suspended for six months after the incident, and
that will be extended to a year. Smith was also given a suspended six-month jail
sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who has a history of driving offenses, did not address the court. He
has said he was distracted by his dog when his van veered off a road and hit
King on June 19 in Lovell, where King has a vacation home.
</P>
<P>
	   King, 52, underwent five operations to set the broken bones in his right leg
and hip. He also suffered broken ribs, a punctured lung and a skull laceration.
</P>
<P>
	   He chided prosecutors for not trying Smith on the more serious charge and
called the plea agreement ``irresponsible public business.'' He said he did not
believe a license suspension would keep Smith off the road because it did not in
the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What he took from me, my time, my piece of mind and my ease of body, are
simply gone and no court can bring them back,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
	   King has said he was angered that Smith was allowed to keep his license for
three months after the crash. It was suspended after Smith was indicted.
</P>
<P>
	   State records show Smith was convicted of driving to endanger and failing to
stop upon the signal of a police officer in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   He was also convicted of failing to produce evidence of insurance in 1991,
driving while intoxicated in 1989 and four speeding violations since 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   King has kept his sense of humor. In September, King bought the 1985 Dodge
Caravan that hit him for $1,500 cash and said he planned to ``beat the hell out
of it'' with a sledgehammer.

<HEADLINE> Springlike East Coast Winter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Up and down the East Coast on Tuesday, people were playing
golf, washing their cars in T-shirts and shorts and skiing without parkas.
</P>
<P>
	   The East Coast basked in unseasonable winter warmth as cold air remained
locked in Canada. And with temperatures in the 60s, new record highs were set, a
day after records were set in cities including Boston and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   In the western Massachusetts city of Westfield, a wayward pelican, usually
home in more tropical conditions, roosted on a pond.
</P>
<P>
	   At Ashbourne Country Club in suburban Philadelphia, golf course supervisor
Mark Yates reported about 40 golfers by early afternoon Tuesday, after about 60
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've absolutely been overwhelmed with players,'' Yates said. ``We've got
the diehards playing, and we've got those fair weather golfers.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Myrtle Beach, S.C., families frolicked in the surf, while across the
state, trees started to bud and flowers began to bloom.
</P>
<P>
	   The party was set to end, however, as a cold front pushed its way across the
country Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The unseasonably warm weather is just another problem for South Carolina
farmers who are dealing with a drought that ravaged crops last year. Across the
state, rainfall for 1999 was 16 to 20 inches below normal, said Mike Helfert, a
climatologist with the state Natural Resources Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeated winter warm spells can wreak havoc on fruit and grain crops, said
Dale Linvill, an agricultural meteorologist at Clemson University.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the cleanup began in Owensboro, Ky., after a tornado -- more
commonly seen in the spring -- destroyed hundreds of homes and injured at least
18 people Monday. The tornado was blamed in part on the unusually warm weather.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're getting some unusual weather here, no doubt about it,'' said Dale
Mohler, senior meteorologist at the AccuWeather national weather service.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohler pinned the warm spell on La Nina -- the cooling of Pacific Ocean
temperatures off the coast of South America that alters normal jet stream
patterns.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacific jet stream has veered northward over the Eastern Seaboard in
recent days, keeping the cold air in Canada and pulling up warm air from the
Gulf Coast and Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That front sparked the storm in Kentucky when it clashed with the warm air
that had settled in the state, according to Jim Laver, deputy director of the
National Weather Services Climate Prediction Center.
</P>
<P>
	   A collision of warm and cool air is all that's needed to start a major
storm, but in the winter, the temperature difference between the two air masses
usually is not quite as extreme as it was Monday, Laver said.
</P>
<P>
	   The front didn't wreak havoc on the rest of the East Coast, though. Some
cities approached or broke high temperature marks Tuesday before the colder
weather hit.
</P>
<P>
	   Savannah, Ga., broke its record high at 79 degrees, one more than the mark
set in 1971. It was a major contrast to the 51 degree temperature a few hours
west in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
	   In Boston, warm air blew into the region in the early afternoon, raising the
temperature in one hour from 43 degrees to 61, three degrees below a record for
the date.
</P>
<P>
	   Providence, R.I., hit 60 degrees, one degree from its record for a Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   In Philadelphia, the temperature hit 67, one degree off the record set in
1950 and well above the 36 degree temperature cross-state in Erie, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   In Westfield, the brown pelican found its way to a local pond, the first
time the warm weather bird was reported so far inland in Massachusetts. State
Ornithologist Brad Blodgett said the bird was likely lost, rather than attracted
to the warm weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The pelican had frostbitten feet, he said, adding that the warm weather
probably made it easier for the bird to find fish.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone was pleased with the high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Colleen Drew, co-owner of Drew's True Value in Buffalo, N.Y., said rock salt
sales were down in the traditionally snowbound city. Snowblower sales were also
slow after a quick start.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They aren't using them at all,'' Drew said.

<HEADLINE> Texas Man Indicted in Wife's Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A federal grand jury indicted a Texas businessman Tuesday
in the Florida slaying of his ex-wife, a mother of quadruplets, KSAT-TV
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment against Allen Blackthorne remained sealed, and Blackthorne
had not been arrested, the station reported.
</P>
<P>
	   No further details on the charge were revealed in the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Blackthorne has maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our position is, if it happens, great; let's get it over and done with,''
said Maureen Blackthorne, his wife. ``You get tired of it. You can't continue
living your life in fear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal and state authorities have been investigating the Nov. 7, 1997,
death of his ex-wife, 35-year-old Sheila Bellush, who was shot and stabbed in
her Sarasota, Fla., home.
</P>
<P>
	   Her 2-year-old quadruplets were found wandering in blood near her body. The
children were not harmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Antonio,
would not confirm an indictment against Blackthorne. The U.S. attorney and
county district attorney planned a joint news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Wen Ho Lee Appeals Bail Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A fired weapons lab scientist is appealing a lower court
ruling denying him bail as he awaits trial for allegedly mishandling some of the
nation's top nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Wen Ho Lee filed their notice of appeal Tuesday in the 10th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, 60, has pleaded innocent to 59 counts under the Atomic Energy and
Espionage Acts. If convicted, the former employee of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory could be sentenced to life in prison. A trial may be a year away.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albuquerque, N.M., U.S. District Judge James Parker rejected Lee's
request for bail on Dec. 29, referring to missing computer tapes containing
classified material and citing the potential for ``enormous harm'' to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
	   In upholding an earlier ruling, Parker said he would likely reconsider Lee's
request depending on the results of another lie-detector test.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges allege Lee transferred classified material from secure to
unsecure computers and to computer tapes. Seven of the tapes remain missing. The
indictment does not accuse Lee of passing classified information to a foreign
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee has said he destroyed the tapes after losing his security clearance. He
was fired in March, a month after he failed questions on a polygraph test that
lab officials said asked whether he had passed information and classified codes
to a foreign country.

<HEADLINE> Troops To Leave Parts of West Bank  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Clearing the air for crucial talks on a final peace
treaty, Israel and the Palestinians ended weeks of deadlock Tuesday and signed
an agreement that will pull Israeli troops out of 5 percent of the West Bank
before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This arrangement will go into effect within 48 hours,'' said the Israeli
army statement announcing the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal, originally due Nov. 15, had been held up because the two
sides disagreed over whether Israel alone can determine what areas to hand over.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement was signed by Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon for the Israelis and Maj.
Gen. Haj Ismail Jabr for the Palestinians. Yaalon is the central commander,
which includes the West Bank, and Ismail commands Palestinian police forces in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   They signed it in an undisclosed location, apparently to avoid Jewish
settler demonstrators. A group of settler protesters was wandering among major
Tel Aviv hotels on Tuesday night, following rumors that the negotiators were
meeting at a Tel Aviv location.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the compromise reached Tuesday, the withdrawal will be carried out as
originally planned by Israel, while Israel will be open to Palestinian requests
in sketching the map for the next Israeli withdrawal, from 6.1 percent of the
West Bank on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   A Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Palestinians would have a say in the January pullback, while the chief Israeli
negotiator, Oded Eran, said Israel only promised to listen to Palestinian
requests.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had rejected the Nov. 15 withdrawal because
the areas offered by Israel were too sparsely populated and did not connect
lands already under Palestinian control. Arafat demanded to be given West Bank
neighborhoods close to east Jerusalem, the sector he seeks as a future capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran denied Tuesday that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised Arafat
that the Palestinians would get control over one or more of those neighborhoods
-- Abu Dis, Ram, Izzarieh -- in the January withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   The pullbacks were stipulated in a September interim peace agreement.
Tuesday's compromise, reached by Eran and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb
Erekat, clears the air as the two sides try to meet a Feb. 13 deadline for
formulating the framework for a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran has been meeting daily with Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo in
so-called final status talks, with negotiations often lasting late into the
night, a senior Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Complex issues are on the table, including the status of Jerusalem, the
final borders of the Palestinian entity, the fate of Palestinian refugees and
the future of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides are still far apart on all issues. For example, the
Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as east
Jerusalem, for their state, while Israel wants to keep all of Jerusalem and
nearly half the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran said some progress has been made and that he was optimistic the
framework could be reached, if not in mid-February, then a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said it was ``too early to judge.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Arafat's planned meeting with President Clinton in Washington on
Jan. 20 would be crucial. ``In this meeting, it will become clear if we can
reach an agreement,'' Abourdeneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   The upcoming West Bank troop pullback will be carried out by Thursday, the
eve of Eid al-Fitr, the three-day Muslim holiday that marks the end of the
fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel will hand 2 percent of the West Bank around the town of Ramallah to
full Palestinian control. An additional 3 percent near the towns of Nablus,
Jenin and Hebron will go from sole Israeli jurisdiction to shared rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians may have relented because they don't want to get left
behind while Israel makes progress in peace talks with Syria, which also
controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We support any progress on the Syrian track, but at the same time we
should beware of any attempt to play the tracks against each other,'' said top
Arafat aide Tayeb Abdel Rahim.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak is eager to reach agreement with Damascus on keeping a promise to
withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon by summer.

<HEADLINE> Dole Endorses Bush in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush picked up the endorsement of former GOP
rival Elizabeth Dole on Tuesday and took dead aim at his leading challenger,
saying John McCain's tax-cut plan would not do as much for lower-income
Americans as his own $483 billion proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a tax gap in this campaign,'' Bush declared. ``His plan doesn't
address the people who live on the outskirts of poverty, working hard to get to
the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dole, joining Bush at presidential primary campaign stops here and in Iowa,
compared the Texas governor to President Reagan, calling him ``my kind of
conservative'' and saying he would restore trust in a tarnished White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today we rally to another Western governor, just as bold at challenging
the status quo, just as resolved to restore pride in our institutions, just as
determined to be himself,'' Dole said, recalling Reagan's tenure as California
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, in a deadheat with McCain in New Hampshire, according to most polls,
is trying to draw sharper distinctions between his rival ahead of the nation's
first primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how he would do that, the Texas governor pointed to their competing
tax-cut plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a difference of attitude. There is a difference of opinion,''
Bush said. ``He's called my plan too big; so has Vice President Gore, and I
believe my plan not only is just right, it's realistic, it can get done and it's
going to make a big difference for the families of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said that under his plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would see
their taxes cut by $2,000 and under Sen. McCain's plan, that same family would
save only $200.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides said Bush was criticizing a compromise tax-cut plan that the
senator had proposed in Congress to help end the budget standoff last year. The
tax-cut plan McCain will propose next week will be more generous to lower and
middle income Americans, his campaign said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, asked to respond aboard his campaign bus across town, didn't address
the different figures, but said Bush had characterized McCain's stance wrongly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't view Governor Bush's tax cut as too big, I view it as misplaced,''
said McCain, who has in the past criticized the plan as too hefty. ``Sixty
percent of the tax cut goes to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans. That's
not the kind of tax relief that I think America needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, accused McCain of pitting the rich against
the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's wrong to engage in class warfare,'' Fleischer said. ``That's what the
Democrats like to do and I hope Republicans in the primary do not engage in
class warfare.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told reporters that Dole's endorsement and Bush's attack are natural
results of a strong challenge to a frontrunner backed by the party's
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's gonna get very, very, very intense,'' McCain said. ``It's gonna get
very tough. When you see a campaign get traction, it gets very tough. I have
every reason to think it's gonna get tougher.''
</P>
<P>
	   The challenges to Bush's frontrunner status stretch beyond New Hampshire. In
Iowa, he is leading Steve Forbes, but the campaign is wary that the publisher
could soon unleash an ad blitz similar to the one that Dole's husband, Bob, felt
weakened him in his 1996 race.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's endorsement added to his collection of high-profile backers as he
tries to fend off those challenges and court female voters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Dole and Bush were quick to douse speculation that Bush's kickoff
appearance for the year in New Hampshire was a preview of a Bush-Dole ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First things first,'' Bush told reporters. ``It's important to have a
strong woman like Elizabeth Dole standing by my side to help me win the
primaries and the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dole, too, declined to be drawn into vice presidential speculation. She
said, ``The governor has got to win the nomination and when he does the party is
very fortunate to have a large number of very talented leaders with great
experience from which he can choose.''
</P>
<P>
	   She had pursued the nomination herself until October, when she quit the race
citing a lack of money. By that time, Bush had raised $57 million to her $5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole echoed Bush's lines on tax cuts and school reform. In a slap at the
Democratic Clinton administration, the former Red Cross president said that
``trust is the coin of the realm'' in a democracy and ``lately, that trust has
been tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like Reagan, she said, Bush ``would innovate, not regulate.'' She said,
``That's my kind of conservative.''
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, Bush cited Dole's allegiance to Reagan, for whom she served as
transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elizabeth, you have always said that you have been a lieutenant in Ronald
Reagan's army. I am proud to have you as a general in mine,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one woman in the audience thought she was looking at a winning team
on the stage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of women like her and I think would like to see a woman in the
limelight,'' said Sue Ritze, 46, of Bedford.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and Dole later flew to Iowa for stops at Des Moines and Davenport --
and an endorsement by Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley.

<HEADLINE> Nordstrom Recalling Sweatshirts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nordstrom Inc. is recalling about 5,300 infant and girls'
sweatshirts because the heart-shaped pull tabs on their zippers pose a choking
hazard to young children.
</P>
<P>
	   Zipper pulls on the sweatshirts can detach from them, Nordstrom and the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The clothes were sold in infant size 6 months to ``big girl'' size 16 in
December for between $22 and $28 each.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nordstrom is aware of one incident in which an infant choked on the zipper
pull, but suffered no permanent injuries,'' the Seattle-based company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nordstrom and the commission advised consumers to stop wearing the
sweatshirts immediately and return them to a Nordstrom store for a refund.
</P>
<P>
	   The recalled garments are pink or blue long-sleeved, half-zippered
sweatshirts with the heart-shaped zipper pull. They have collars reading, ``Baby
N'' or ``N Kids.''
</P>
<P>
	   For more information, consumers can call Nordstrom at 1-800-695-8000 during
business hours.

<HEADLINE> Two Cops Killed Attempting Arrest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROXTON, Ga. (AP) -- A small-town police officer and a sheriff's deputy were
shot to death by a reclusive man who was trying to keep his rusty mobile home
from being hauled away for nonpayment of rent, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broxton officer James Bryant, 35, and Coffee County Deputy Almond ``Tub''
Merritt, 53, were killed Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant was sent to a mobile home park in Broxton, a town of 1,600, to help
evict Willie Mitchell, 55, for failure to pay rent on his lot, Sheriff Carlton
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This should have been one of the simplest things in law enforcement work,
moving a sorry joker who won't pay his rent,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant was shot in both arms and the mouth with a deer rifle. A state
trooper attempted to crawl to Bryant, and Merritt tried to cover the trooper.
Merritt was shot in the chest; the trooper was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell surrendered after police helicopters began circling overhead,
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell was arraigned on murder charges Tuesday afternoon and told the
judge he wanted a court-appointed attorney. The judge said she could not
immediately set bond because the investigation was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors described Mitchell as a recluse who had lived in the trailer
without water or electricity for years. Patrina Porter, who lived across the
street, said Mitchell has served in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He used to work until a few years ago,'' she said. ``After that, he just
let things go down. His pickup stopped running. He was probably just protecting
his house because that's all he had left.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the neighborhood took Merritt's death particularly hard because he
used to go door to door selling collard, turnip and mustard greens. He was
married and had three daughters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a sweet man,'' Miss Porter said. ``He wouldn't hurt a fly.''
</P>
<P>
	   The sheriff said Merritt was good at handling desperate situations and
domestic disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant, who was married and had two children, comes from a law-enforcement
family. His brother is an officer in nearby Hazlehurst and his cousin a
detective in Lyons.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant's wife is the manager of a fast-food restaurant. He also worked as as
an officer in nearby Lumber City.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was either working or with his family,'' Broxton Police Chief Doyle
Paulk said. ``They were trying their best to make a life for their children.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Extends Soldier's Detention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An Israeli court decided Tuesday to keep an Israeli soldier
in custody for 15 more days on suspicions he may have been involved in a murder
case in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   At Canada's request, Israeli police arrested Daniel Weiz at his army base on
Dec. 21. Toronto police suspect Weiz, 19, was involved in beating 15-year-old
Dimitri Baranovski to death in a Toronto park.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiz insists that he was not in the park on the night of Nov. 14, when
witnesses say they saw a dozen people attack Baranovski over a pack of
cigarettes. Six of those who allegedly mobbed Baranovski said Weiz was present,
and three said he beat and kicked the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiz's lawyer, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, said Canadian authorities had not
supplied enough evidence to warrant her client's continued arrest. Canada has
not yet requested Weiz's extradition, but has until February to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiz's appeal against his continued detention is pending in a higher court.
</P>
<P>
	   But Prosecutor Irit Kahn said Weiz should not be released since he had a
criminal past and may attempt to avoid re-arrest. It was not clear what that
criminal past included.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiz was born in Israel, but gained residency in Canada after his family
moved there in 1993. He was drafted into the Israeli army early in 1999, and
received a leave of absence to visit his father in Toronto over the summer,
returning to Israel on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian police have charged another 19-year-old, Michael Issariotis, and
two 16-year-olds with second degree murder in the case.

<HEADLINE> Surplus Plutonium Site Selected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIKEN, S.C. (AP) -- The Energy Department said Tuesday it has selected its
Savannah River Site nuclear complex as the location for three new facilities to
dispose of surplus weapons-grade plutonium.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This decision sends a strong signal to the world that the U.S. is
determined to reduce surplus weapons-grade plutonium as quickly and efficiently
as possible to ensure that it cannot be used in weapons again,'' Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency's approach calls for immobilizing about 17 metric tons of surplus
plutonium and using as many as 33 metric tons as mixed oxide fuel, or MOX. The
three new facilities will provide pit disassembly, plutonium conversion,
immobilization and MOX fuel fabrication services.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency recommended in a Nov. 12 report that the Savannah River Site
house facilities to get rid of the plutonium.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, part of an agreement with Russia to reduce nuclear stockpiles
and keep weapons-grade plutonium out of the hands of terrorists and rogue
nations, would create as many as 4,000 construction jobs and about 1,100
operational jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Energy Department has estimated it will cost about $1.32 billion to
design and build the new facilities and $1.5 billion to operate and dismantle
them in about 2020. Construction is expected to peak in 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   The department is expected to announce details next month on plutonium
shipments from the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site near Denver to the
Savannah River Site.

<HEADLINE> Restrictions Put on Ex-Tyson Execs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- A judge ruled Tuesday that ConAgra Inc. and
ConAgra Poultry Co. cannot use certain sales and marketing trade secrets of
Tyson Foods Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Springdale-based Tyson Foods, the nation's largest poultry producer, filed
suit against ConAgra in August, saying the Nebraska-based food giant had caused
it irreparable harm and exploited proprietary information when it hired on Tyson
executives and put them in positions at ConAgra "substantially similar" to those
they held at Tyson.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on a three-day trial in December, Washington County Chancellor John
Lineberger found three former Tyson employees had knowledge of the company's
trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   He barred two executives from selling and marketing poultry products at
ConAgra for one year. The third executive was prohibited from having contract
with certain poultry customers, such as Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken,
for one year.
</P>
<P>
	   Wayne Britt, Tyson's chief executive officer, said the ruling protects the
company's trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   "This suit was always about safeguarding our company, our team members and
our shareholders from ConAgra's improper acquisition and use of this
confidential information," he said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   Lineberger is to hold a second trial next month on nutritional and
scientific aspects of the trade-secrets lawsuit. The trial will begin Feb. 1 to
determine how ConAgra came into possession of Tyson's feed formula.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Norway Train Collision  </HEADLINE>
   By NILS MYKLEBOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENA, Norway (AP) -- Two speeding passenger trains crashed head-on and
spread flames and twisted metal Tuesday, killing at least seven people and
leaving another 26 missing and feared dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters battled the fire and thick smoke for nearly six hours before
rescuers could get to some parts of the charred wreckage. No survivors were
found.
</P>
<P>
	   The 26 missing ``are probably not alive,'' district Police Chief Magnar
Lynum said at a news conference near Rena, 110 miles north of Oslo. ``The damage
was so great that they could not have survived.''
</P>
<P>
	   The wreck could wind up as Norway's worst in decades, surpassing the toll of
27 dead in a 1975 two-train crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the other 67 people aboard the trains were accounted for by late
Tuesday, at least 30 of them injured. The engineers on both trains were missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Police spokesman Per Erik Skjefstad said rescue efforts were suspended and
would resume at daylight.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, police held out hope for the 26 missing, saying that some might
have just walked away. However, by late Tuesday authorities said that
possibility had been virtually ruled out.
</P>
<P>
	   The diesel-driven trains -- one southbound and the other northbound --
collided at about 1:30 p.m. at the Aasta Station in Aamot township near Rena. A
local train with 17 people aboard and a larger regional express carrying 83
people were each traveling about 55 mph around a curve when they hit head on,
the state railroad directorate said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they didn't know why the trains were on the same track and
were investigating. The rail line had been due for a safety upgrade, a move that
would have included equipment to automatically stop trains in such
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses and rescuers the crash scene was at first calm then became chaotic
as flames spread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought we stopped for a moose,'' said passenger Jeanette Haug. ``People
said there was fire and we had to get out. But it was calm and I think people
did well.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least one locomotive overturned, flames could be seen shooting out of the
windows of passenger cars. Smoke billowed above the pine trees that lined the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Passengers and baggage were strewn all across the middle corridor,'' said
passenger Robert Ulriksen.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of eight Britons and a Dutch couple on board all survived the crash
without serious injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Four rescue helicopters, at least 20 ambulances and up to 200 rescuers
quickly arrive at the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second serious public transport accident in Norway in just over a
month. On Nov. 26, 16 people drowned when a high-speed ferry ran aground and
sank.

	   "There's a basic rule in business: Don't mess with success. That's why the
reappointment of Alan Greenspan is such welcome news. Chairman Greenspan has
provided thoughtful, forward-looking and very prudent leadership as head of the
Federal Reserve, and his continued stewardship of the nation's monetary system
bodes well for continued noninflationary economic growth." -- Jerry Jasinowski,
president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "Chairman Greenspan believes strongly in lower taxes, less government
spending, paying down the debt and creating jobs at home by expanding trade
overseas -- the four pillars of our economic plan to keep America strong. His
leadership has helped to free the energy, creativity and productivity of the
American worker which has brought us unprecedented economic growth." -- Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ------

<P>
	   "His relentless pursuit of price stability is one of the key factors behind
the robust economic growth we are experiencing today. Since Alan Greenspan has
chaired the Federal Reserve, inflation and unemployment are both down nearly 2
percentage points, interest rates are down 2.5 percentage points, the Dow is up
325 percent and the economy has grown at a 3.2 percent annual rate." -- Sen.
Connie Mack, R-Fla., chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "The chairman, more than any other single individual, has aided in reducing
unemployment and inflation at the same time for over seven years, a feat unheard
of in many circles until his tenure. The Fed's chief duty is price stability and
inflation control. Alan Greenspan has done that and done it well." Rep. Jim

	   "With this announcement, President Clinton has taken a necessary step to
ensure that the Federal Reserve remains independent and will not be subject to

</P>
<P>
	   "Now that Chairman Greenspan has achieved renomination with acclamation, he
hopefully will be less timid toward the robust U.S. economy. Federal Reserve

growth without another series of rate hikes or threats of hikes that are
detrimental to hard-working American families." -- Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn. and

<HEADLINE> Reporter Saves Baby From Sinking Car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- A routine weather story turned into a daring rescue
for an Evansville Courier &AMP; Press reporter who saved a baby from a car sinking
into a rain-filled ditch.
</P>
<P>
	   General assignment reporter Kevin Kinnaird was working on a story about a
storm Monday when the southern Indiana road he was on became flooded. Looking in
the rear-view mirror of his sport utility vehicle, he saw a small car slip
nose-first into a flooded ditch.
</P>
<P>
	   No longer a journalist making observations, Kinnaird raced to the sinking
car as the driver called out to him.
</P>
<P>
	   In a front-page story in Tuesday's edition, he wrote: ```Take my baby, take
my baby,' was all she said, as I neared the passenger door.
</P>
<P>
	   ```Don't worry, we're going to get you out of here,' I remember telling her
twice as I clutched the car's roof. She handed her 13-month-old son, Isaiah, to
me as the swift, cold water rushed over my legs and against the passenger
door.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kinnaird carried the infant to safety. Another person rescued the mother,
24-year-old Mitzi Bolin.
</P>
<P>
	   When Kinnaird got back to the newsroom, his editors were impressed, and
asked him to write the story up just as he remembered it happening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't think it was that great of a thing, really, but everyone else
here did,'' said Kinnaird, who has worked for the paper for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Managing editor J. Bruce Baumann said the newspaper will do a follow-up
story about the woman and her baby.

<HEADLINE> Dole Endorses Bush in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush picked up the endorsement of former GOP
rival Elizabeth Dole on Tuesday and took dead aim at his leading challenger,
saying John McCain's tax-cut plan would not do as much for lower-income
Americans as his own $483 billion proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a tax gap in this campaign,'' Bush declared. ``His plan doesn't
address the people who live on the outskirts of poverty, working hard to get to
the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dole, joining Bush at presidential primary campaign stops here and in Iowa,
compared the Texas governor to President Reagan, calling him ``my kind of
conservative'' and saying he would restore trust in a tarnished White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today we rally to another Western governor, just as bold at challenging
the status quo, just as resolved to restore pride in our institutions, just as
determined to be himself,'' Dole said, recalling Reagan's tenure as California
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, in a deadheat with McCain in New Hampshire, according to most polls,
is trying to draw sharper distinctions between his rival ahead of the nation's
first primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how he would do that, the Texas governor pointed to their competing
tax-cut plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a difference of attitude. There is a difference of opinion,''
Bush said. ``He's called my plan too big; so has Vice President Gore, and I
believe my plan not only is just right, it's realistic, it can get done and it's
going to make a big difference for the families of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said that under his plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would see
their taxes cut by $2,000 and under Sen. McCain's plan, that same family would
save only $200.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides said Bush was criticizing a compromise tax-cut plan that the
senator had proposed in Congress to help end the budget standoff last year. The
tax-cut plan McCain will propose next week will be more generous to lower and
middle income Americans, his campaign said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, asked to respond aboard his campaign bus across town, didn't address
the different figures, but said Bush had characterized McCain's stance wrongly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't view Governor Bush's tax cut as too big, I view it as misplaced,''
said McCain, who has in the past criticized the plan as too hefty. ``Sixty
percent of the tax cut goes to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans. That's
not the kind of tax relief that I think America needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, accused McCain of pitting the rich against
the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's wrong to engage in class warfare,'' Fleischer said. ``That's what the
Democrats like to do and I hope Republicans in the primary do not engage in
class warfare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush planned Wednesday to spotlight the extra tax savings he said his plan
would offer, using Iowa citizens at a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids to
demonstrate how they could save more money.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told reporters that Dole's endorsement and Bush's attack are natural
results of a strong challenge to a frontrunner backed by the party's
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's gonna get very, very, very intense,'' McCain said. ``It's gonna get
very tough. When you see a campaign get traction, it gets very tough. I have
every reason to think it's gonna get tougher.''
</P>
<P>
	   The challenges to Bush's frontrunner status stretch beyond New Hampshire. In
Iowa, he is leading Steve Forbes, but the campaign is wary that the publisher
could soon unleash an ad blitz similar to the one that Dole's husband, Bob, felt
weakened him in his 1996 race.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's endorsement added to his collection of high-profile backers as he
tries to fend off those challenges and court female voters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Dole and Bush were quick to douse speculation that Bush's kickoff
appearance for the year in New Hampshire was a preview of a Bush-Dole ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First things first,'' Bush told reporters. ``It's important to have a
strong woman like Elizabeth Dole standing by my side to help me win the
primaries and the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dole, too, declined to be drawn into vice presidential speculation. She
said, ``The governor has got to win the nomination and when he does the party is
very fortunate to have a large number of very talented leaders with great
experience from which he can choose.''
</P>
<P>
	   She had pursued the nomination herself until October, when she quit the race
citing a lack of money. By that time, Bush had raised $57 million to her $5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole echoed Bush's lines on tax cuts and school reform. In a slap at the
Democratic Clinton administration, the former Red Cross president said that
``trust is the coin of the realm'' in a democracy and ``lately, that trust has
been tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like Reagan, she said, Bush ``would innovate, not regulate.'' She said,
``That's my kind of conservative.''
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, Bush cited Dole's allegiance to Reagan, for whom she served as
transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elizabeth, you have always said that you have been a lieutenant in Ronald
Reagan's army. I am proud to have you as a general in mine,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one woman in the audience thought she was looking at a winning team
on the stage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of women like her and I think would like to see a woman in the
limelight,'' said Sue Ritze, 46, of Bedford.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and Dole later flew to Iowa for stops at Des Moines and Davenport --
and an endorsement by Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Challenges Corp. Tax Breaks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley promised Tuesday to shut down corporate
tax shelters and loopholes to the tune of $125 billion over 10 years if he's
elected president. Special tax favors to big business ``make the rest of us pay
more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, also engaged in a
fresh round of finger-pointing over who's the bigger spender in proposals
they're making in their race for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning on the New Hampshire seacoast, Gore quickly changed the subject
when a reporter asked about Bradley's new tax proposals, which are likely to
have some ``little guy'' appeal in this vehemently anti-tax state that conducts
the first primary on Feb. 1
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I'm glad to talk about our respective health care plans,'' Gore said,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
	   In an earlier interview with USA Today, Gore said Bradley was
single-mindedly pursuing a health proposal that would risk ``destroying the
harmony between fiscal policy and monetary policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Retorted Bradley: ``I think he hasn't paid attention to the campaign because
there is clearly a series of things that I've laid out as priorities.'' Gore has
been vague about his own proposals' costs, Bradley added.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question of who the big spender is, is pretty clear,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, on MSNBC's ``Hardball,'' Bradley warned Democrats they'd have a
harder time getting Gore elected in November because of his 1996 campaign
fund-raising tactics -- soliciting cash at a Buddhist temple and over White
House phones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's clear to me is the Republicans think it's a problem and I think
they will use it in the fall campaign if it's the case that he's the nominee,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   At work before sunrise on a 16-hour day of campaigning, he promised an
energetic and aggressive fight in New Hampshire as well as in Iowa, where
delegate caucuses are three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
	   In between predawn talk shows, on which he philosophized about the day's
foreign-policy headlines and Peanuts characters, Bradley plopped down at a hotel
piano and played a bit of classical music from memory.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked for his personal feelings about Gore, Bradley called him ``a good vice
president,'' but he added, ``I feel like I feel toward all competitors -- and
that is, competitive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, a former New Jersey senator who championed the 1986 tax bill and
its loophole closures, detailed his own tax plans at a luncheon with New
Hampshire business leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unacceptable, he said, that ``in this time of unprecedented economic
growth,'' corporate tax revenue has dropped over the past two years thanks to
shelters and loopholes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That means individual Americans end up paying higher taxes,'' Bradley
said. ``I think everybody should pay their share of taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   He proposed killing subsidies to hardrock mining companies, oil and gas
producers and ranchers grazing livestock on federal land.
</P>
<P>
	   He would end a 1997 tax benefit to companies that ``park profits in foreign
subsidiaries'' and also go after chemical companies that avoid Superfund
waste-cleanup taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Bradley acknowledged, the bulk of the new revenue he estimates -- $100
billion -- was slated to come from tougher enforcement of the existing tax code
through stepped-up audits of large corporations and increased penalties for
illegal tax-avoidance business transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired software industry executive Peter McElroy, a Republican from
Barrington, said Bradley's plan was appealing. ``And I'm reasonably
conservative. But it's about fairness. It has to be across-the-board.''
</P>
<P>
	   Helen Hamilton, a political independent who runs a nonprofit civic group,
said after Bradley's speech: ``How can you not agree with the fact that when
somebody has a shelter, we're paying through the nose for them?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley did not earmark prospective new revenue for spending -- hoping to
blunt Gore claims that Bradley's a reckless spender.
</P>
<P>
	   It didn't stop the criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's remember that in 1992 and 1993, Bill Bradley supported a
special-interest tax loophole that was a boondoggle for the pharmaceutical
industry and then-Senator Gore voted against that in 1992,'' said Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   On other matters, Bradley told MSNBC:
</P>
<P>
	   -- He considers Thurgood Marshall a role model Supreme Court justice. The
late William J. Brennan, who voted with the majority in Roe vs. Wade and was put
on the court by President Eisenhower, ``hasn't been bad in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Abortion is a privacy right. But after the sixth month of pregnancy,
``the health of the woman has to be at stake, however she and her doctor define
it.'' In the Senate, Bradley did vote against attempts to ban certain late-term
abortion procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   -- He would ``have a hard time nominating'' to the Supreme Court anyone who
would turn back civil rights or abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   -- President Clinton, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, former
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his successor, Larry Summers, -- but not
Gore -- deserve credit for the economy.

   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Egypt's top Muslim cleric visited
Palestinian-ruled Gaza Tuesday in a rare visit that showed support for Yasser
Arafat, who has been called a traitor by some Muslims for making peace with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, Grand Sheik of Cairo's Al Azhar Mosque, told Arafat
and over 2,000 Muslim clerics and students that Egyptians supported Palestinian

	   Arafat hopes to declare a state as part of a final peace agreement with
Israel by the end of this year.
</P>

	   Tantawi attended prayers with Arafat and dined with him at the close of the
Ramadan fast, before returning to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel captured Gaza in the 1967 Mideast War, but has relinquished parts of
it and the West Bank in a series of interim peace agreements since 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Islamic regimes have said that any peace with Israel is tantamount to
treason, and have reviled Arafat for accepting territory in dribs and drabs.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Sharply Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks opened sharply lower Wednesday, shaken by a
sharp plunge on Wall Street. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 293.84 points, or 1.55
percent, to 18,709.02 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the
average closed up 68.52 points, or 0.36 percent to finish at a 28-month high of
19,002.86. The half-day session was the first of the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 103.26 yen, up 0.28 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but
marginally below its late New York level of 103.28 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices dropped after the Dow Jones industrial average
tumbled 359.58 points, or 3.17 percent, to 10,997.93 on Tuesday, its
fourth-worst point loss amid worries about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 229.46 points to 3,901.69,
its worst point loss and eighth-worst percentage decline.
</P>
<P>
	   Kazunori Jinnai, deputy general manager at Daiwa Securities SB Capital
Markets in Tokyo, said the Nikkei could fall as far as 18,500 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   High-technology as well as information and telecommunication shares were
among early noticeable losers.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 63.53 points, or 3.70 percent, to 1,653.94. The TOPIX closed
down 4.73 points, or 0.27 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was higher after gaining ground against the
yen the previous day following intervention by Japan's central bank to weaken
the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   But trades remained in a narrow range early Wednesday as investors watched
Tokyo stocks and stayed alert for possible further intervention by the Bank of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, dealers in Tokyo estimated that the bank spent about $3 billion
in greenback purchases. The interventions, though not the amount, were confirmed
by the Ministry of Finance's vice minister for international affairs Haruhiko
Kuroda.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.05 yen, up from 105.72 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unquoted in
early trading. On Tuesday, it settled at 1.7200 percent and its price stood at

<HEADLINE> FAA Faulted for Security Lapse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration failed to conduct security
checks on dozens of foreigners hired to fix Y2K problems in sensitive computer
systems used for air traffic control, congressional investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said it
found the FAA had violated its own security policies by allowing its
contractors' foreign employees, who had not received background checks, to be
involved in repairing 15 of 153 critical computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Citizens of Ukraine, Pakistan, Britain and Ethiopia were given access
without proper checks, as well as 36 Chinese who performed Y2K reviews on eight
critical systems, including one involved in air-to-ground communications.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By not following sound security practices, FAA has increased the risk that
inappropriate individuals may have gained access to its facilities, information
or resources,'' said Joel C. Willemssen, the GAO's director of civil agencies
information systems, in a report to the House Science Committee. The panel had
asked the GAO to investigate the extent to which the FAA relied on foreign
nationals for Y2K preparedness.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's air traffic systems were at greater risk to people wishing to
insert faulty or deliberately harmful changes to the computer code, Willemssen
said. One of the systems reviewed by the foreign citizens helps manage the flow
of air traffic across the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   When the investigators issued a draft report in early December, the FAA
immediately started the background checks that should have been conducted
initially, said chief spokesman Eliot Brenner. The checks are now almost
complete and have revealed no security problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We didn't follow our procedures,'' Brenner said. ``It was pointed out to
us. We fixed it immediately and the system worked.''
</P>
<P>
	   None of the computer systems involved were classified and none experienced
Y2K problems, Brenner said. He added that the FAA is reviewing all its software
contracts to discover why some initially failed to conduct the security checks.
They plan to issue a report by the end of the month, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA's policy requires background checks of all FAA and contractor
employees. The agency's Y2K Program Office told the investigators it didn't know
about the requirement, the GAO said. The FAA also was unaware of whether the
agency or the contractors had performed background checks on any of the
contractor employees, including foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   The contractors, Primeon and Computer Generated Solutions Inc., were not
given direct access to the FAA's computers. Instead, the FAA sent them copies of
the program codes on computer disks through express mail, the investigators
said. The contractors had to sign agreements requiring them to return or destroy
all copies of the program codes.
</P>
<P>
	   But the investigators warned that ``copies of the code could be sold and/or
reviewed to identify system weaknesses that could later be exploited.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brenner said the FAA's contractors were well known to government agencies
and had years of experience and reliability.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House Science
Committee, sent a letter to National Security Adviser Sandy Berger on Dec. 20,
expressing concern that other agencies might have violated security rules while
rushing to repair Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement on the FAA, Sensenbrenner said, ``The extent of access
unscreened individuals had to the air traffic control system merits serious
attention by the White House and others responsible for ensuring the security of
sensitive computer systems on which we all rely.''

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Rains Claim 28 Lives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Heavy rains in southeastern Brazil swept away
bridges and flooded cities, spreading devastation that killed at least 28 people
and left tens of thousands homeless, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Landslides killed 13 people in Rio de Janeiro State, according to Civil
Defense Col. Jorge Lopes. About 6,000 people were forced to flee their homes
because of rising waters.
</P>
<P>
	   In the neighboring state of Minas Gerais, officials said 11 people had died
since the rains began Saturday and 30,000 people were left homeless by floods.
</P>
<P>
	   In Sao Paulo State, four people were killed and about 3,000 were forced from
their homes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   But civil defense warned that the death toll could rise after rescuers
investigate the 60 or so houses that were buried under mud in the mountain
resort city of Campos de Jordao. Many people who were living in the area had
been evacuated before the mudslides.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The situation is serious,'' Campos do Jordao Mayor Oswaldo Gomes da Silva

<HEADLINE> Ill. Driver's License Head Gets 18  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE ROBINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- The former manager of a corruption-riddled driver's license
facility was sentenced Tuesday to 18 months in prison for trading truck driver's
licenses for some $82,000 in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just want to apologize for this whole thing,'' Marion Seibel said before
becoming the latest former Illinois driver's licensing official sent to prison
as a result of a two-year federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say most of the money was used by employees of the Illinois
secretary of state's office to buy political fund-raising tickets at a time when
Gov. George Ryan was secretary of state. Ryan has said he knew nothing about the
payoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Seibel, 62, pleaded guilty July 8 to charges that she took part in a
racketeering conspiracy during the six years that she was at the McCook facility
-- a licensing station so stained by the scandal that new Secretary of State
Jesse White wants to close it.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge could have sentenced Seibel to nearly three years in prison but
bowed to a request for leniency from prosecutors who said Seibel had helped in
their investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Seibel will be on probation for two years after she serves her prison term.
</P>
<P>
	   She is among 27 individuals charged thus far in the investigation and the
eighth sentenced to prison. Fourteen have pleaded guilty, and some have been
sentenced to home confinement or halfway houses.

<HEADLINE> Texas Man Indicted in Wife's Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A federal grand jury indicted a Texas businessman Tuesday
in the Florida slaying of his ex-wife, a mother of quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen Blackthorne was arrested after playing golf in San Antonio, said his
lawyer, Richard Lubin of West Palm Beach, Fla. The indictment remained sealed
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Lubin was unaware of the specific charge against his client, but KMOL-TV
reported Blackthorne was charged with conspiracy to commit interstate family
violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We, of course, for two years have been offering to turn him in if they
ever decided to charge him,'' Lubin said in a phone interview. ``We again made
that offer in writing today, but they chose to arrest him rather than
voluntarily surrender.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lubin said Blackthorne is looking forward to the opportunity to prove his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a terrible tragedy what happened here, but Allen Blackthorne had
nothing to do with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal and state authorities have been investigating the Nov. 7, 1997,
death of his ex-wife, 35-year-old Sheila Bellush, who was shot and stabbed in
her Sarasota, Fla., home.
</P>
<P>
	   Her 2-year-old quadruplets were found wandering in blood near her body. The
children were not physically harmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. attorney would not comment and the district attorney did not return
a phone message to The Associated Press. They planned a joint news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Bellush's killing occurred six weeks after she and her husband, James
Bellush, and children moved to Florida from San Antonio. Mrs. Bellush had two
older daughters in addition to the quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men are serving prison sentences in connection with the scheme to kill
or maim Mrs. Bellush. Another, alleged triggerman Jose Luis Del Toro, is
awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Life for 1969 Rape, Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SASKATOON, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Larry Fisher was sentenced Tuesday to life in
prison for a 1969 rape and murder that initially was blamed on another man, who
served 23 years before being exonerated.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Gerry Allbright imposed the life sentence on the 50-year-old Fisher
for the sexual assault and killing of 20-year-old Gail Miller. He can apply for
parole in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   After Miller was killed in January, 1969, police arrested 16-year-old David
Milgaard, who was passing through Saskatoon at the time. He was convicted of the
murder and spent 23 years in prison until 1992, when the Supreme Court set aside
the guilty verdict. Five years later, DNA evidence proved Milgaard innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the Saskatchewan government awarded Milgaard, now 47, about $7
million for his wrongful conviction -- the largest criminal compensation in
Canadian history.

Canada
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An Israeli court decided Tuesday to keep an Israeli
soldier in custody for 15 more days on suspicions he may have been involved a
murder case in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   At Canada's request, Israeli police arrested Daniel Weiz at his army base on
Dec. 21. Toronto police suspect Weiz, 19, was involved in beating 15-year-old
Dimitri Baranovski to death in a Toronto park.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiz insists that he was not in the park on the night of Nov. 14, when
witnesses say they saw a dozen people attack Baranovski over a pack of
cigarettes. Six of those who allegedly mobbed Baranovski said Weiz was present,
and three said he beat and kicked the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiz's lawyer, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, said Canadian authorities had not
supplied enough evidence to warrant her client's continued arrest. Canada has
not yet requested Weiz's extradition, but has until February to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiz's appeal against his continued detention is pending in a higher court.
</P>
<P>
	   But Prosecutor Irit Kahn said Weiz should not be released since he had a
criminal past and may attempt to avoid re-arrest. It was not clear what that
criminal past included.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiz was born in Israel, but gained residency in Canada after his family
moved there in 1993. He was drafted into the Israeli army early in 1999, and
received a leave of absence to visit his father in Toronto over the summer,
returning to Israel on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian police have charged another 19-year-old, Michael Issariotis, and
two 16-year-olds with second degree murder in the case.

</P>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- For two weeks, 25 Chinese men discovered
aboard a cargo ship Monday were locked inside two canvas-covered containers
buried beneath thousands of tonnes of other cargo.
</P>
<P>
	   The men, who were en route to Seattle when they were discovered at the Port
of Vancouver on Monday, had garbage cans for toilets. They had battery-operated
fans and lights and small mattresses to sleep on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people were in very good condition,'' said Rob Johnston. ``They had
food and water and bedding and were fairly well-dressed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The men, who are in custody at the Vancouver pre-trial center, will undergo
medical checks, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 25 men, including four juveniles, were discovered aboard the California

------ Miners Ordered To End Wildcat
</P>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Devco coal miners were ordered back to work
Tuesday, less than 48 hours after staging a wildcat strike that began at the
Prince mine and spread to all other Devco sites.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canada Industrial Relations Board, in a news release, declared the
strike by 1,600 members of District 26 of the United Mine Workers of America to
be illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   The wildcat began Sunday night to press demands for better pension and
severance benefits for Devco miners facing layoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government announced last January that it would get out of the
Cape Breton coal industry by the end of 2000, spending $111 million on early
retirements and severance packages.
</P>
<P>
	   The union's main concern is that while 460 miners meet the requirement for
early retirement and another 650 will get severance packages, a number of older
miners have 30 years service but don't meet the requirements for early
retirement packages because they started work at an early age.
------ Larry Fisher Sentenced to Life in Prison for 1969 Sex Slaying
</P>
<P>
	   SASKATOON, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Larry Fisher was sentenced Tuesday to life
in prison for the brutal 1969 sex-slaying of a young nursing aide, but he could
be eligible for parole in as little as seven years, his lawyer says.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Gerry Allbright took just seconds to pass sentence on Fisher for the
murder of Gail Miller -- the same crime for which David Milgaard was wrongly
convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Normally, first-degree murder means no parole for 25 years, although
murderers can apply for a judicial review after 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   But because Fisher was sentenced under the Criminal Code in place in 1969,
Allbright left the issue of parole eligibility up to the National Parole Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the old law, murderers could apply for parole after 10 years, or in
certain cases, seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, a jury in Yorkton found Fisher guilty of killing Ms. Miller.
</P>
<P>
	   Milgaard, who was a 16-year-old hippie passing through Saskatoon at the time
of the murder, spent 23 years in prison before the Supreme Court set aside his
conviction in 1992. He was exonerated five years later by DNA evidence.

Ottawa Worried for a Decade About Water Exports, Documents Show
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- For more than a decade, Ottawa has worried about tankerloads
of fresh water being shipped out of the country, yet its barriers remain porous,
federal documents show.
</P>
<P>
	   Since at least 1988, federal officials have said they must act to protect
Canada's fresh water resources from a thirsty world, according to documents
obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet an accord between Ottawa and the provinces to ban bulk fresh water
exports remains elusive.
</P>
<P>
	   Five provinces refused to sign on to a national ban on large-scale water
exports after a meeting in late November of federal, provincial and territorial
environment ministers.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Environment Minister David Anderson says the government is
still optimistic a deal will be concluded this year.

<HEADLINE> 6 Die in Venezuela Prison Brawl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A gang fight broke out in a prison in northwest
Venezuela on Tuesday, leaving six inmates dead and 27 injured, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The uprising broke out at the Tocuyito Prison in Carabobo State, which is 80
miles southwest of Caracas.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the inmates who led the gang fight will be transferred to another
prison in Venezuela's eastern rain forests so as to avoid more bloodshed, said
Gen. Vassily Kotosky Flores, the vice-Interior Minister. But he said he did not
know what provoked the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuela's overcrowded and chaotic jails are considered among the most
violent in the world. Last year about 350 inmates were killed in a prison system
that held about 25,000 inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have declared a ``prisons emergency,'' and are seeking to clean
up jails partly through a new penal code aimed at modernizing the South American
country's archaic justice system. Half of all inmates have never had their day
in court because of an astounding backlog.

<HEADLINE> Girl Awarded $80M in Humana Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Humana Health Insurance Co. must pay a girl
with cerebral palsy almost $80 million because it improperly terminated her
treatment and lied to her parents, a Florida jury ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine-year-old Caitlyn Chipps and her parents will receive $1 million in
compensatory damages and $78.5 million in punitive damages from Humana and its
Florida subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisville, Ky.-based Humana denied any wrongdoing and said it would appeal,
calling the award excessive.
</P>
<P>
	   "This wasn't about the welfare of Caitlyn Chipps," said Humana spokesman
Dick Brown. "This case was about lawyers trying to hit the jackpot."
</P>
<P>
	   The Palm Beach County Circuit Court jury found that Humana violated its own
rules in 1995 when it removed the girl from a special program for chronically
ill patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chipps' lawyer, Theodore J. Leopold, said Humana insured Caitlyn through
its high-intensity Medical Case Management Program until it summarily dismissed
the cases of Caitlyn and about 100 other chronically ill children.
</P>
<P>
	   Leopold said Humana told Chipps his daughter's records had been reviewed and
she no longer needed such intensive treatment. Cerebral palsy is a birth defect
that impairs motor control and coordination.
</P>
<P>
	   Caitlyn was reinstated to the case management program after her parents
filed suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown, the Humana spokesman, said Caitlyn was not summarily dismissed from
the program and that her case was reviewed by doctors. He also said that
independent doctors testified during the trial that Caitlyn had not suffered any
setbacks while she was out of the program.

<HEADLINE> Court Not Required To Release Info  </HEADLINE>
   By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a case stemming from the Monica Lewinsky scandal, an
appeals court said Tuesday the federal court here is not required to release a
public list of court matters related to federal grand jury investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   Media organizations, including Dow Jones &AMP; Co. and The Associated Press,
sought such a public docket during the grand jury investigation in 1998 led by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
	   The grand jury investigation led to a number of court proceedings as
witnesses challenged subpoenas or raised other objections. For example, the
Clinton administration asserted executive privilege to keep some top
presidential aides from answering certain questions.
</P>
<P>
	   The news organizations' lawyer, Theodore Boutrous Jr., said, ``Everyone knew
what was going on generically. Starr was beginning an investigation, and the
White House was claiming executive privilege, but there was no way of knowing
how, where and when events would take place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even though grand jury proceedings themselves are secret, related documents
and transcripts of hearings can be opened to the public if they do not disclose
matters occurring before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Public docket entries would allow the media to argue for open proceedings
before hearings are held.
</P>
<P>
	   District Court Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson refused to allow a public
docket. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia later
ruled that the media had no constitutional right to a public listing of such
matters.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the appeals court ruled that a local federal court rule also did
not require a public docket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unlike typical judicial proceedings, grand jury proceedings and related
matters operate under a strong presumption of secrecy,'' Chief Judge Harry
Edwards, a President Carter nominee, wrote for the court. ``We have no good
reason to second-guess the district court's interpretation of its own rule'' on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Edwards said media organizations can file requests for such public
listings under the current court rule on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said a denial of such a request must be based on more than
administrative burdens or ``an arguable possibility of leaks.'' His opinion was
joined by Judges Judith Rogers and David Tatel, both Clinton nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   Boutrous said, ``This provides a new, much better, level of access for the
public and the press to review and watch over grand jury public proceeding.''

</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- For more than a decade, Ottawa has worried about tankerloads
of fresh water being shipped out of the country, yet its barriers remain porous,
federal documents show.
</P>
<P>
	   Since at least 1988, federal officials have said they must act to protect
Canada's fresh water resources from a thirsty world, according to documents
obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet an accord between Ottawa and the provinces to ban bulk fresh water
exports remains elusive.
</P>
<P>
	   Five provinces refused to sign on to a national ban on large-scale water
exports after a meeting in late November of federal, provincial and territorial
environment ministers.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Environment Minister David Anderson says the government is
still optimistic a deal will be concluded this year.

<HEADLINE> McCain Ads To Focus on Net Taxes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain plans
new advertising this week to reaffirm his commitment to keeping the Internet
free from taxation and, perhaps, to underscore a difference with GOP
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Tuesday, McCain noted the success of Internet shopping during
the just-concluded Christmas buying season. Analysts say holiday shopping on the
Internet grew 300 percent last year, generating an estimated $10 billion to $11
billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign said it will produce print ads this week to draw attention
to the issue, as well as the Arizona senator's pledge to keep the Internet tax
free. The ads will begin Wednesday in the Concord Monitor and the Nashua
Telegraph, both in New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primary on
Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Plans also are underway to buy banner ads on targeted Internet commerce
sites to alert shoppers to the issue, the McCain campaign statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said the Internet ``continues to be the greatest engine of economic
growth in America today and I will not have it strangled with new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Keeping the Internet tax free will prevent the federal government from
becoming the ghost of Christmas future for consumers,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain helped push through Congress a three-year ban on new Internet taxes
that expires in October 2001. The legislation also created an advisory panel to
study the issue and make recommendations to Congress, but its members are deeply
divided.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. Bush, meanwhile, supports extending the moratorium on taxing
Internet sales at least through 2004, according to his campaign Web site.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Sharply Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks tumbled sharply Wednesday morning, shaken by a
plunge on Wall Street. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 539.59 points, or 2.84
percent, to 18,463.27 by mid-morning. On Tuesday, the average closed up 68.52
points, or 0.36 percent to finish at a 28-month high of 19,002.86. The half-day
session was the first of the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 103.26 yen, up 0.28 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but
marginally below its late New York level of 103.28 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices dropped after the Dow Jones industrial average
tumbled 359.58 points, or 3.17 percent, to 10,997.93 on Tuesday, its
fourth-worst point loss amid worries about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 229.46 points to 3,901.69,
its worst point loss and eighth-worst percentage decline.
</P>
<P>
	   High-technology as well as information and telecommunication shares were
among early noticeable losers.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 83.58 points, or 4.87 percent, to 1,633.89. The TOPIX closed
down 4.73 points, or 0.27 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was higher after gaining ground against the
yen the previous day following intervention by Japan's central bank to weaken
the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   But trades remained in a narrow range early Wednesday as investors watched
Tokyo stocks and stayed alert for possible further intervention by the Bank of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, dealers in Tokyo estimated that the bank spent about $3 billion
in greenback purchases. The interventions, though not the amount, were confirmed
by the Ministry of Finance's vice minister for international affairs, Haruhiko
Kuroda.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.05 yen, up from 105.72 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unquoted in
early trading. On Tuesday, it settled at 1.7200 percent and its price stood at
101.52.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Eyes Strike Survival  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- US Airways may train managers to work as flight
attendants in case of a strike over contract negotiations that began in 1996, a
union official said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That costs money," union spokesman Jeff Zack said. "US Airways should put
that money towards the contract."
</P>
<P>
	   In a recorded message to employees Monday, US Airways said it was exploring
methods to resist a strike or other union job action from flight attendants. The
message said US Airways had formed a "working group" of managers to prepare for
job actions by the 9,000-member Association of Flight Attendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the flight attendants are in talks overseen by a federal mediator
and are not now free to strike under labor law, the airline appears to be
anticipating its first walkout since the International Association of Machinists
struck predecessor USAir for four days in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   During that strike, some flights operated, but the airline was largely shut
down. A strike at US Airways would greatly affect Charlotte, where the airline
operates its busiest hub with 321 daily jet departures and employs about 7,200
workers, including 2,500 flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight attendants are working under a 1993 contract, meant to last until
1996 but still in effect. Under labor laws intended to maintain reliability in
the transportation system, contracts do not expire but remain in place while new
contracts are negotiated.
</P>
<P>
	   US Airways flight attendants' salaries start at about $17,000 annually and
rise to about $30,000 after 10 years, the union said. The flight attendants are
resisting company efforts to link their salaries and benefits to a composite of
the contracts at larger airlines, which would result in raises but could
threaten other benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Mediated talks between the two sides resumed Monday after a two-week holiday
break. Any job action is at least a month away.
</P>
<P>
	   Under labor law, job actions are legal only if a mediator releases the union
and company from mediation. That triggers a 30-day "cooling-off period," after
which a union can strike or a company can impose new work rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Intense negotiations usually occur during cooling-off periods.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has said it is angered by the union's continuing talk of CHAOS,
or "create havoc around our system," a union strike tactic that can include
brief, mass walkouts or unannounced walkouts affecting individual flights.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ill. License Head Gets 18 Months  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE ROBINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- The former manager of a corruption-riddled driver's license
facility was sentenced Tuesday to 18 months in prison for trading truck driver's
licenses for some $82,000 in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just want to apologize for this whole thing,'' Marion Seibel said before
becoming the latest former Illinois driver's licensing official sent to prison
as a result of a two-year federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say most of the money was used by employees of the Illinois
secretary of state's office to buy political fund-raising tickets at a time when
Gov. George Ryan was secretary of state. Ryan has said he knew nothing about the
payoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Seibel, 62, pleaded guilty July 8 to charges that she took part in a
racketeering conspiracy during the six years that she was at the McCook facility
-- a licensing station so stained by the scandal that new Secretary of State
Jesse White wants to close it.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge could have sentenced Seibel to nearly three years in prison but
bowed to a request for leniency from prosecutors who said Seibel had helped in
their investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Seibel will be on probation for two years after she serves her prison term.
</P>
<P>
	   She is among 27 individuals charged thus far in the investigation and the
eighth sentenced to prison. Fourteen have pleaded guilty, and some have been
sentenced to home confinement or halfway houses.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Critical of Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes said
he worries that President Clinton's desire to leave a legacy will put Israel at
a disadvantage in peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got to pop this euphoric bubble of peace talks and realize that
there's a lot of hard bargaining that has to be done and the Syrians have to be
made to realize they have to make real concessions, not just the Israelis,''
Forbes told reporters Tuesday after meeting with voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who polls show running behind Republican rivals George W. Bush and
John McCain in New Hampshire, voiced several foreign policy concerns at a string
of campaign events in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   He said his experience running Radio Free Europe under President Reagan and
as head of his own publishing company has prepared him to make foreign policy
decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll match my knowledge of the world with that of any other candidate,''
he said after greeting workers at Crown Point Cabinetry in Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said that as part of a Mideast peace deal, Syria should be required
to reduce its military and withdraw from Lebanon, where it is the main
power-broker.
</P>
<P>
	   If Israel returns the strategic Golan Heights to Syria, there should be a
buffer zone with satellite monitors to warn Israelis of a Syrian advance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel and Syria are engaged in peace talks in West Virginia this week, the
first time in nearly four years that the countries have met to deal with
substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes also said he was frustrated with Clinton-Gore policies on Russia. He
criticized the administration for its ``naive notion that if you just throw
money over there all will be well,'' adding that much of the money has been
pocketed by corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said he would pressure Russia to end the conflict with separatist
Chechnya by not inviting acting President Vladimir Putin to the next meeting of
the G-8 and by cutting off funds, a sentiment also voiced by McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With Chechnya, obviously we'd be cutting off funding to the Russian
government,'' he said on New Hampshire Public Radio. ``What they're doing there
is almost reminiscent of what the Germans did to them during World War II --
indiscriminately slaughtering civilians.''

<HEADLINE> Broken wire disrupts rail service on East Coast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Amtrak and NJ Transit rail service was halted for
three hours Tuesday after a cable that powers the trains broke, turning the rush
hour along the East Coast into a commuters' nightmare, officials said.
<P>
	   The overhead cable, located in Kearny, was reported broken at about 3:30
p.m., just before the start of evening rush, said Ken Miller, NJ Transit
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Service stopped between Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station as NJ
Transit and Amtrak crews repaired the cable. The downed line affected service
only on one of two tracks in the area but officials shut down both lines as a
safety precaution, said Rick Remington, Amtrak spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had to make sure the system was fully operating," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak service on the Northeast Corridor and service on the Midtown Direct
line and North Jersey Coast line was disrupted. Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers
were instructed to take trains from other stations.
</P>
<P>
	   People using the Northeast Corridor and the North Jersey Coast lines were
told to travel from the 33rd Street PATH station in New York to Newark Penn
Station. But many of the trains used to carry passengers from Newark were stuck
in New York because of the power outage, so service from Newark was severely
limited.
</P>
<P>
	   "This happened before the start of our peak period and as a result of that,
we have a majority of our trains in New York," said Penny Bassett Hackett, an NJ
Transit spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   People using the Midtown Direct Service were told to go to the 33rd Street
PATH station in New York and take the train to the 33rd Street station in
Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers also were told they could use their NJ Transit rail passes for
PATH trains and some bus services.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers at New York Penn Station expressed frustration as indefinite
delays for all Amtrak and NJ Transit trains were announced over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to get home. I'm going to cry," said Makia Spence, a social worker
who works in Brooklyn. "This is my worst nightmare. I'm tired. I'm hungry. This
is going to make my acid reflux problem worse," she said as she pulled out a
pack of Tums.
</P>
<P>
	   "What are you going to do? Grin and bear it. It's rotten service. It never
improves," said Ed Ryan of Princeton Junction, who works in real estate in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Full service was restored by 7:25 p.m., Remington said, adding that he
expected no problems in the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Remington said officials would investigate what caused the cable to break.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Norway Train Collision  </HEADLINE>
   By NILS MYKLEBOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENA, Norway (AP) -- Two speeding passenger trains crashed head-on in
central Norway on Tuesday, killing at least seven people and leaving 26 others
missing and feared dead. Flames engulfed the wreckage of one train and blocked a
rapid rescue.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters battled the fire and thick smoke for nearly six hours before
rescuers could reach some parts of the charred debris. No survivors were found.
</P>
<P>
	   The 26 missing ``are probably not alive,'' district Police Chief Magnar
Lynum said at a news conference near Rena, 110 miles north of Oslo. ``The damage
was so great that they could not have survived.''
</P>
<P>
	   The wreck could wind up as Norway's worst in decades, surpassing the toll of
27 dead in a 1975 two-train crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the other 67 people aboard the trains were accounted for by late
Tuesday, at least 30 of them injured. The engineers on both trains were missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Police spokesman Per Erik Skjefstad said rescue efforts were suspended and
would resume at daylight.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, police held out hope for the 26 missing, saying that some might
have just walked away. However, by late Tuesday authorities said that
possibility had been virtually ruled out.
</P>
<P>
	   The diesel-driven trains -- one southbound and the other northbound --
collided at about 1:30 p.m. at the Aasta Station in Aamot township near Rena. A
local train with 17 people aboard and a larger regional express carrying 83
people were each traveling about 55 mph around a curve when they hit head on,
the state railroad directorate said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they didn't know why the trains were on the same track and
were investigating. The rail line had been due for a safety upgrade, a move that
would have included equipment to automatically stop trains in such
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses and rescuers the crash scene was at first calm then became chaotic
as flames spread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought we stopped for a moose,'' said passenger Jeanette Haug. ``People
said there was fire and we had to get out. But it was calm and I think people
did well.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least one locomotive overturned, flames could be seen shooting out of the
windows of passenger cars. Smoke billowed above the pine trees that lined the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Passengers and baggage were strewn all across the middle corridor,'' said
passenger Robert Ulriksen.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of eight Britons and a Dutch couple on board all survived the crash
without serious injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Four rescue helicopters, at least 20 ambulances and up to 200 rescuers
quickly arrive at the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second serious public transport accident in Norway in just over a
month. On Nov. 26, 16 people drowned when a high-speed ferry ran aground and
sank.

<HEADLINE> More Threats to Abortion Clinics  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SEEWER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- About 20 threatening letters claiming to contain
anthrax have been sent to abortion clinics nationwide in the past few days,
including one that caused police to shut down a 10-block area of Toledo on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said there was little reason to believe the threat sent to a
Planned Parenthood clinic here was credible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of them have had any credible threat behind them,'' said fire Capt.
Greg Locher.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI said an apparent anthrax threat Monday at an abortion clinic in Fort
Wayne, Ind., was a hoax. Federal investigators in Birmingham, Ala., said tests
on a threatening letter sent to an abortion clinic there Monday show it was not
contaminated with anthrax bacteria either.
</P>
<P>
	   A letter received Tuesday at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Portland, Maine,
was also believed to be a hoax.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI was testing a letter received Tuesday by a Planned Parenthood clinic
in Roanoke, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're cautiously optimistic it was a hoax,'' David Nova, president of
Planned Parenthood of the Blue Ridge, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthrax is a usually harmless bacteria that can be fatal to humans in
certain forms. It can be manufactured as a biological weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Sporadic threats of contamination with anthrax have affected almost every
region of the nation over the last several years. The FBI said a spate of
letters last year contained only a sticky substance or dark powder.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Makes Offer on Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has asked Cuba to let Elian
Gonzalez's father escort him back to the island if U.S. officials decide the boy
should return to Cuba, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said the request is a contingency plan and does not signal a
decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to resolve the
politically charged issue by sending Elian back to his homeland. The official,
asking not to be identified, said Cuba is considering the request.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was retrieved from an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25.
He had been aboard a Florida-bound boat that capsized, killing 10 other
passengers, including his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   A tug of war has developed over Elian. The Cuban government wants him
returned to Cuba to be raised by his father, while his relatives in Miami and
many Cuban exiles insist he would have a better life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   As controversy continued to swirl around the boy, he began attending classes
at the private Lincoln-Marti School in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. He
wore the school uniform of a white dress shirt and blue pants, and carried a
book bag.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, told U.S. National Council of
Churches officials in Cuba, ``I should be in charge of my child's education,
where he goes to school and what kind of schooling he receives.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Havana, Fidel Castro's point man on U.S. affairs, Ricardo Alarcon, said
the Cuban government would not stop Gonzalez from retreiving his son in Miami if
he wanted to. But Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, said he would
recommend that the father not go unless U.S. officials formally decide to allow
the boy to return to the island and not waste a lot of time there in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a free man,'' Alarcon told reporters after meeting with the Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell, the National Council of Churches leader who went to Cuba in
hopes of helping reunite the father and son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He should do whatever he wants. And we will help him,'' Alarcon said.
``But if I were him I would ask, for what reason: to finally return the boy, or
to delay and delay'' the case even longer.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, said a decision by the father to
apply for a non-immigrant visa would be welcome. But for Gonzalez to make the
trip, he also would need travel documents from the Cuban government, Rubin
noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The other U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said there were two
main reasons for suggesting as a contingency plan that the father be allowed to
travel to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said it would make more sense for the father to escort the boy
back to Cuba than anyone else. Secondly, if the father were in Miami, it would
ease concerns among Cuban-Americans that he currently is not free to speak his
mind because of Cuba's tight controls over its citizenry.
</P>
<P>
	   But the free speech issue still would not be resolved, contended Spencer
Eig, a Miami attorney representing Elian's great-uncle who, along with his
great-aunt, have been caring for the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel that if Juan Miguel Gonzalez comes alone, leaving his new wife and
child under the control of the Cuban government, then he'll still be under
duress,'' said Eig. ``This case should be settled by a fair and impartial
decision maker with Elian Gonzalez's best interest as the sole issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two days after the boy was rescued, Cuban President Fidel Castro demanded
that the boy be returned to Cuba within 72 hours. He relented on that demand and
also has backed off his insistence that no meeting between the father and INS
officials would be allowed except to inform him of the date of Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   INS officials have had two meetings in Cuba with the father, including one
on New Year's Eve. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the father denied
to the INS officials that he was speaking under duress. There were no Cuban
officials present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has set a Jan. 21 hearing on the case but INS officials said this
does not preclude an earlier decision.
</P>
<P>
	   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said Tuesday in Washington that the agency has
told Cuban officials it is interested in resolving the issue quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Another INS spokesman, Russ Bergeron, said Cuba would have no assurances
that Juan Miguel Gonzalez would return to the island if he got the green light
to travel to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anyone who is physically in the United States can ask for asylum,''
Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another regulation, however, allows the State Department to issue a
non-immigrant visa only if it is convinced that the applicant does not intend to
remain in the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Licensing Ruling Appealed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The state on Tuesday appealed a federal judge's order
that blocked expansion of licensing requirements for doctors who perform
abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a political issue, it's a public health issue,'' said Attorney
General John Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
	   Cornyn filed the state's appeal in federal court in Houston.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John Rainey in Houston last week issued a temporary
injunction to prevent the state from enforcing the licensing requirements that
took effect Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   In his order, Rainey said changes to the Abortion Facility Reporting and
Licensing Act violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution and are
too vague.
</P>
<P>
	   Passed by the Legislature in the spring, the law requires doctors' offices
to be licensed if the physician performs more than 300 abortions a year. It also
increases the criminal liability of doctors who operate abortion clinics without
licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion rights activists have said the requirement is an attempt to limit
the number of abortions performed by making them appear dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty in King Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, Maine (AP) -- The motorist who hit horror writer Stephen King pleaded
guilty Tuesday to lesser charges under a plea agreement that will keep him out
of jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan Smith pleaded guilty to driving to endanger, and a more serious
charged of aggravated assault was dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith's license had been suspended for six months after the incident, and
that will be extended to a year. Smith was also given a suspended six-month jail
sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who has a history of driving offenses, did not address the court. He
has said he was distracted by his dog when his van veered off a road and hit
King on June 19 in Lovell, where King has a vacation home.
</P>
<P>
	   King, 52, underwent five operations to set the broken bones in his right leg
and hip. He also suffered broken ribs, a punctured lung and a skull laceration.
</P>
<P>
	   He chided prosecutors for not trying Smith on the more serious charge and
called the plea agreement ``irresponsible public business.'' He said he did not
believe a license suspension would keep Smith off the road because it did not in
the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What he took from me, my time, my peace of mind and my ease of body, are
simply gone and no court can bring them back,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
	   King has said he was angered that Smith was allowed to keep his license for
three months after the crash. It was suspended after Smith was indicted.
</P>
<P>
	   State records show Smith was convicted of driving to endanger and failing to
stop upon the signal of a police officer in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   He was also convicted of failing to produce evidence of insurance in 1991,
driving while intoxicated in 1989 and four speeding violations since 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   King has kept his sense of humor. In September, King bought the 1985 Dodge
Caravan that hit him for $1,500 cash and said he planned to ``beat the hell out
of it'' with a sledgehammer.

	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton brought top Israeli and
Syrian officials together today for face-to-face peace talks. Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa met for an
hour. It is the first time in four years Israel and Syria have met directly on
issues of substance. Meanwhile, Israel and the Palestinians ended weeks of
deadlock and signed an agreement that will pull Israeli troops out of 5 percent
of the West Bank before the weekend. It clears the air for crucial talks on a

Sen. Kennedy To Endorse Gore

	   SOMERSWORTH, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. Edward Kennedy will endorse Al Gore for
president tomorrow in a move the Gore campaign hopes will help with voters in
New Hampshire, next door to Kennedy's Massachusetts, and with wavering Democrats
nationwide. Kennedy normally does not endorse candidates before the party's
nominating convention. The decision to act now came after reflection over the
Christmas holiday and a phone call between Kennedy and Gore since New Year's,
according to people in the Kennedy camp. Kennedy sought the presidency himself
in 1980 and has served in the Senate with both Gore and rival Democratic
contender Bill Bradley.

Workplace Rules Protect Home Office

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans who work at home should expect to be covered by
the same safety standards that apply in their companies' offices, says a federal
advisory that outlines how traditional workplace protections affect the growing
number of people who telecommute. The Labor Department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration provided clear examples in an area that had been murky,
even as the number of Americans regularly working at home has swelled to almost
20 million. According to the advisory, employers can be held liable if they know
or should reasonably have known about home workplace hazards.

	   RENA, Norway (AP) -- At least seven people were killed and another 26 are
missing and feared dead after two Norwegian passenger trains crashed head-on
Tuesday about 100 miles north of Oslo. Firefighters battled the fire and thick
smoke for nearly six hours before rescuers could get into the heated wreckage.
No survivors were found. The 26 missing "are probably not alive," district
Police Chief Magnar Lynum said. Police said the other 67 people aboard the
trains were accounted for by late Tuesday, at least 30 of them injured. The

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Plunge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices plunged Wednesday morning, pushed down by
high-technology issues hit by a sharp tumble on Wall Street. The dollar slipped
against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 771.79 points, or 4.06
percent, to 18,231.07 at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the average
closed up 68.52 points, or 0.36 percent to finish at a 28-month high of
19,002.86. The half-day session was the first of the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 102.96 yen, down 0.02 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York level of 103.28 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, share prices dropped after the Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled 359.58 points, or 3.17 percent, to 10,997.93 on Tuesday, its
fourth-worst point loss amid worries about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 229.46 points to 3,901.69,
its worst point loss and eighth-worst percentage decline.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tokyo, high-technology as well as information and telecommunications
shares were among morning losers. Gainers included biotechnology-related issues
and some oil refinery stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Tokyo stock market's fall came as it was about to enter a consolidation
phase following its surge late last year, which was much helped by continued
rallies on Wall Street," said Yoshimasa Kunisawa, an analyst with Okasan
Securities in Tokyo. "We must keep watching how the New York stock market will
move in the next few days."
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 104.12 points, or 6.06 percent, to 1,613.35. The TOPIX closed
down 4.73 points, or 0.27 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo stocks rose about 37 percent in 1999 fueled by growing confidence that
Japan's economy was finally pulling out of a long downturn.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was higher after gaining ground against the
yen the previous day following intervention by Japan's central bank to weaken
the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   But trades remained in a narrow range early Wednesday as investors watched
Tokyo stocks and stayed alert for possible further intervention by the Bank of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, dealers in Tokyo estimated that the bank spent about $3 billion
in greenback purchases. The interventions, though not the amount, were confirmed
by the Ministry of Finance's vice minister for international affairs, Haruhiko
Kuroda.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 105.90 yen, up from 105.72 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unquoted at
late morning. On Tuesday, it settled at 1.7200 percent and its price stood at
101.52.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hijack Victim Returns Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The only American aboard an Indian Airlines jet that was
hijacked en route to India returned to California Tuesday, feeling too ill and
exhausted to meet a small group of family members gathered at the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanne Moore, 53, arrived at Los Angeles International Airport aboard a
Lufthansa flight from Germany around 1 p.m. After clearing customs, security
officials allowed her to leave through a separate exit to bypass reporters and
relatives, including her parents, who waited at least two hours for her arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Her family has her squirreled away for a few days so she can rest because
her health isn't the best,'' George Welch, Moore's brother-in-law, said later
outside his in-laws house in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore suffered pneumonia and stomach problems, Welch said, adding that she
was in good spirits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She's happy to be back in the good old USA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore was the only American among passengers taken hostage when their plane
from Nepal to New Delhi, India was hijacked Christmas Eve. The hijacking ended
when three Kashmiri activists -- at least one of whom was Pakistani -- were
freed from Indian jails in exchange for the 155 passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the plane's passengers was killed shortly after the plane was
hijacked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We did not know what kind of crazy people had a hold of her so we were
worried about her safety,'' her father, Harold Redding, said while he and his
wife, Marie, waited at the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   He described his daughter as an ``achiever,'' and said that the hijacking
probably wouldn't stop her from traveling again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When she wants something, she goes after it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore, a special education teacher in Bakersfield, was expected to remain in
the Los Angeles area for the next few days before returning home to Bakersfield,
Welch said.

	   HASTINGS, Neb. (AP) -- Roy Alleman, former Hastings Tribune farm editor,
died Thursday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
	   Alleman worked at several Nebraska newspapers before he became Tribune farm
editor in 1969. He was the owner of the Grassland News in Thedford and an editor
of the Central Nebraska Farmer/Stockman in Cozad and the Custer County Chief in
Broken Bow.
</P>
<P>
	   After leaving the Hastings Tribune in 1977, Alleman became involved in
agricultural real estate, contributed articles to magazines and farm
publications and wrote two books.
Charles M. Allen
</P>
<P>
	   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Charles M. Allen, the U.S. District Judge who issued
some of the state's most important civil-rights and constitutional decisions,
died Tuesday. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
	   He consistently struck down state laws limiting women's right to abortion.
He also ordered the Jefferson County Jail to release inmates to ease crowding
after finding the population exceeded acceptable limits.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1987, Allen approved a $3.5 million settlement that ended years of
litigation against the city of Louisville by black applicants who said they were
discriminated against when they sought jobs as police officers. In 1982, he
ordered Jefferson County school officials to allow black activist Angela Davis
to speak at one school; then ordered them to allow the Ku Klux Klan to hold a
rally of the white supremacist group at another.
</P>
<P>
	   He was appointed to the federal bench in 1971 by President Richard M. Nixon
after 10 years as a Jefferson Circuit Court judge.

died Thursday. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Denise, who joined Ford's legal staff in 1946, was named vice president of

planning before retiring a year later and joining another Detroit law firm.
Bill Edwards
</P>
<P>
	   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Bill Edwards, a rodeo rider who became an
actor in the 1940s and then turned to painting, died Dec. 21. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Broken bones brought Edwards' riding career to a halt, and the 6-foot 5-inch
Edwards became a model in New York City. An agent brought him to Hollywood in
the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Western films, Edwards had featured roles in ``Our Hearts
Were Young and Gay'' and ``Hail the Conquering Hero,'' both in 1944.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards began drawing horses as a child and continued drawing as he grew up
on a Wyoming ranch. In the 1950s he became a painter and commercial illustrator,
creating hundreds of covers for paperback books and designing paper dolls of
movie stars.

	   GRAND ISLAND, Neb. (AP) -- W.E. Fleming, the man who received acclaim for
making shoes so a footless goose could walk, died Friday. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleming adopted Andy the Goose in 1988 after watching the bird struggle to
walk. The goose had stumps instead of feet and moved by pushing itself along the
ground on its chest.
</P>
<P>
	   He fitted Andy with size 0 baby tennis shoes and, with a leash, taught it to
walk.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleming and Andy made an appearance on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.
He also was featured in People magazine and newspapers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Andy's story had a tragic end. On Oct. 19, 1991, his body was found in a
Hastings park, its neck broken. Although a reward fund topped $7,000, Andy's
killer never was found.
David Mellinkoff
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- David Mellinkoff, a law professor and award-winning
writer who campaigned against confusing legal language, died just 12 weeks after
having a heart attack. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   Mellinkoff wrote about the legal profession and its language in five books,
including ``The Language of the Law'' in 1963, which sparked movements to
control legalese, and ``Mellinkoff's Dictionary of American Legal Usage'' in
1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1963 book earned Mellinkoff the Scribes Award for the book best
conveying the true spirit of the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
	   After joining the UCLA law faculty Mellinkoff wrote ``The Conscience of a
Lawyer,'' ``Lawyers and the System of Justice,'' and ``Legal Writing: Sense and

<HEADLINE> Colombian Refugees Held Hostages  </HEADLINE>
   By MARGARITA MARTINEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Dozens of civil war refugees demanding government
aid bashed their way into the Bogota office of the International Red Cross and
took 37 workers hostage for several hours Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesting refugees released the captives later in the day following
mediation by Colombian Attorney General Jaime Bernal.
</P>
<P>
	   But they said they would continue to occupy the organization's Bogota
headquarters while they held talks with the government on their demands for
jobs, health care and new homes.
</P>
<P>
	   The war refugees said they had no argument with the Red Cross, but were
trying to pressure the government into paying greater attention to their plight.
An estimated 1.5 million Colombians have fled their homes during the past decade
amid escalating violence in the country's 35-year guerrilla conflict. The
government is frequently accused of doing little to address the massive problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Red Cross' Colombia director, Roland Wabre, and three other officials taken
captive earlier volunteered to remain with the refugees as negotiations with the
government proceeded. A first meeting was scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed with sticks but no guns, the refugees used a log Tuesday morning to
break through the front door of the building, located in an upscale Bogota
shopping district.
</P>
<P>
	   Police quickly ringed the area, but no violence was reported during the
tense, daylong standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, the agreement brokered by Bernal defused the situation. Last
month, the same group of refugees staged a peaceful sit-in outside the same
building.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Tuesday's takeover, the Red Cross announced it was temporarily
closing its 16 offices around the country in protest. The order remained in
effect, despite the agreement to release the hostages, Wabre said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, an apparently unrelated group of war refugees staged a
months-long occupation of the Bogota office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Human Rights.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Pilgrim Put in Receivership  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- A judge placed financially strapped Harvard Pilgrim Health
Care into receivership Tuesday after the HMO discovered it had underestimated
1999 losses by tens of millions of dollars because of accounting errors.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Thomas Reilly sought the order after Harvard Pilgrim said
its projected losses for 1999 would total $177 million, above its initial
estimate of $100 million, The Boston Globe reported late Tuesday on its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the order, state insurance commissioner Linda Ruthardt will
temporarily oversee the nonprofit, which is the state's largest health
maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly said he sought the court in order to block the HMO's creditors from
seeking payment from Harvard through federal bankruptcy. Such a move could force
the sale of Harvard's assets and possibly disrupt patient care, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our immediate concern and objective was to prevent a disruption of patient
services," Reilly said. "Patients can be confident tomorrow that their health
care coverage remains in effect."
</P>
<P>
	   The court order approved Tuesday afternoon by the chief justice of the
Supreme Judicial Court allows Harvard Pilgrim to continue to operate and provide
care for its 1.1 million Massachusetts members, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
	   The request for the court order came after Harvard Pilgrim officials met
with the Division of Insurance on Tuesday morning to report the additional
losses, said company spokesman Alan Raymond.
</P>
<P>
	   The accounting errors came to light as the company was preparing for a $147
million state bond deal approved by the Massachusetts Health &AMP; Educational
Facilities Authority, Raymond said. Under terms of the deal, designed to help
the troubled insurer regain financial health, Harvard Pilgrim planned to sell
eight of its properties to an entity set up by the state and lease back the
space.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also alerted Salomon Smith Barney, the investment bankers
handling the offering, because the additional losses would affect the bond sale,
Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bonds had been presold and the company was in the final stages of
completing the transaction, Raymond said. He did not know what effect the latest
developments might have on the bond offering.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvard chief executive Charles D. Baker has insisted the insurer would
regain financial stability despite losing $94 million in 1998. The HMO recently
closed its Rhode Island operations, leaving about 125,000 people scrambling for
new insurance.

president tomorrow in a move the Gore campaign hopes will help with voters in
New Hampshire, next door to Kennedy's Massachusetts, and with wavering Democrats
nationwide. Kennedy normally does not endorse candidates before the party's
nominating convention. The decision to act now came after reflection over the
Christmas holiday and a phone call between Kennedy and Gore since New Year's,
according to people in the Kennedy camp. Kennedy sought the presidency himself
in 1980 and has served in the Senate with both Gore and rival Democratic

<HEADLINE> Dole Endorses Bush in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush picked up the endorsement of former GOP
rival Elizabeth Dole on Tuesday and took dead aim at his leading challenger,
saying John McCain's tax-cut plan would not do as much for lower-income
Americans as his own $483 billion proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a tax gap in this campaign,'' Bush declared. ``His plan doesn't
address the people who live on the outskirts of poverty, working hard to get to
the middle class.'' Bush didn't rule out running television ads critiquing
McCain's tax-cut plans, and aides said the option was under discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're staying flexible'' on ad strategies, the Texas governor told
reporters after shaking hands with Iowa supporters for more than an hour Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, said Bush's tax-cutting plan disproportionately benefits
the rich. His campaign also announced he would begin a round of newspaper ads in
New Hampshire on Wednesday, seeking to reaffirm his commitment to keeping
Internet sales free from taxation and to underscore a difference with Bush on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor supports extending an existing ban on taxing Internet
sales, set to expire in October 2001, at least through 2004, according to Bush's
Web site, and the new ads by McCain will be the senator's way of fending off
Bush's attacks on taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had a quick reply for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is criticism from someone who doesn't talk about helping anybody from
the bottom of the economic spectrum,'' Bush said in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole, joining Bush at presidential primary campaign stops here and in Iowa,
compared him to President Reagan, calling him ``my kind of conservative'' and
saying he would restore trust in a tarnished White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today we rally to another Western governor, just as bold at challenging
the status quo, just as resolved to restore pride in our institutions, just as
determined to be himself,'' Dole said, recalling Reagan's tenure as California
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, in a deadheat with McCain in New Hampshire, according to most polls,
is trying to draw sharper distinctions between his rival ahead of the nation's
first primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how he would do that, Bush pointed to their competing tax-cut plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a difference of attitude. There is a difference of opinion,''
Bush said. ``He's called my plan too big; so has Vice President Gore, and I
believe my plan not only is just right, it's realistic, it can get done and it's
going to make a big difference for the families of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said that under his plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would see
their taxes cut by $2,000 and under Sen. McCain's plan, that same family would
save only $200.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides said Bush was criticizing a compromise tax-cut plan the senator
had proposed in Congress to help end the budget standoff last year. The tax-cut
plan McCain will propose next week will be more generous to lower and middle
income Americans, his campaign said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, asked to respond aboard his campaign bus across town, didn't address
the different figures, but said Bush had characterized his stance wrongly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't view Governor Bush's tax cut as too big, I view it as misplaced,''
said McCain, who in the past has criticized the plan as too hefty. ``Sixty
percent of the tax cut goes to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans. That's
not the kind of tax relief that I think America needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, accused McCain of pitting the rich against
the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's wrong to engage in class warfare,'' Fleischer said. ``That's what the
Democrats like to do and I hope Republicans in the primary do not engage in
class warfare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush planned Wednesday to spotlight the extra tax savings he said his plan
would offer, using Iowa citizens at a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids to
demonstrate how they could save more money.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told reporters that Dole's endorsement and Bush's attack are natural
results of a strong challenge to a front-runner backed by the party's
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's gonna get very, very, very intense,'' McCain said. ``It's gonna get
very tough. When you see a campaign get traction, it gets very tough. I have
every reason to think it's gonna get tougher.''
</P>
<P>
	   The challenges to Bush's front-runner status stretch beyond New Hampshire.
In Iowa, he is leading Steve Forbes, but the campaign is wary that the publisher
could soon unleash an ad blitz similar to the one that Dole's husband, Bob, felt
weakened him in his 1996 race.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's endorsement added to Bush's collection of high-profile backers as he
tries to fend off those challenges and court female voters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Dole and Bush were quick to douse speculation that Bush's kickoff
appearance for the year in New Hampshire was a preview of a Bush-Dole ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First things first,'' Bush told reporters. ``It's important to have a
strong woman like Elizabeth Dole standing by my side to help me win the
primaries and the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dole, too, declined to be drawn into vice presidential speculation. She
said, ``The governor has got to win the nomination and when he does the party is
very fortunate to have a large number of very talented leaders with great
experience from which he can choose.''
</P>
<P>
	   She had pursued the nomination herself until October, when she quit the race
citing a lack of money. By that time, Bush had raised $57 million to her $5
million.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Is Urged To Step Aside  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A leader of Germany's conservative Christian Democrats urged
Helmut Kohl to start retreating from politics, the first such appeal to the
ex-chancellor since he became embroiled in a campaign funding scandal late last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy floor leader in parliament, Michael Luther, suggested in an interview
with the weekly Super Illu magazine that Kohl should give up his seat in the
lower chamber to ``let younger people move in.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other top officials of the party, which Kohl led for 25 years until his 1998
election defeat, distanced themselves Tuesday from Luther's remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't share Mr. Luther's opinion, and I could have done without it,''
party chief Wolfgang Schaeuble, who succeeded Kohl, said on ZDF national
television.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has angered many in his party by admitting he solicited up to $1
million in anonymous political donations in 1993-98 and illegally kept them off
the books. He has refused to name the donors, despite repeated appeals by his
party to help clear up the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors opened a probe against Kohl on Monday to examine whether he
should face criminal charges for financial irregularities. Parliament is
investigating suspicions that payoffs influenced decisions during his 16-year
administration -- something Kohl strongly denies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats' general secretary, Angela Merkel, strongly hinted
last month that Kohl would limit damage to the party if he resigned as member of
parliament and also as honorary party chairman.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs bill requiring hospitals, nursing homes to use safer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey on Tuesday became the fifth state to
make hospitals and nursing homes switch from conventional needles to ones
designed to prevent accidental - and sometimes deadly - infection of health care
workers.
<P>
	   Labor and nurses groups applauded Gov. Christie Whitman's decision to sign
the bill for which they had lobbied for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now we can start the process of getting the hospital and nursing home
industries to gear up to implement the bill," said Jeanne Otersen, policy
director of the Hospital Professionals and Allied Employees union. "There are a
number of hospitals that are already moving forward aggressively to implement
this."
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in November urged
medical facilities to begin using safer needles, saying accidental needle sticks
should no longer be considered an unavoidable job risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, each year an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 nurses, doctors,
paramedics, technicians and other medical workers are accidentally stuck by
needles after use on a patient. About 1,000 each year contract serious
infections, such as the HIV virus or hepatitis B or C; about 100 of those will
die from that infection.
</P>
<P>
	   California, Hawaii, Tennessee and Texas now require safer needles. Maryland
has set up a commission to study the issue, and nearly 20 other states are
considering such bills. One pending in the U.S. House of Representatives has 162
cosponsors, according to the nation's largest health care union, Service
Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are on the way to making 2000 the year when no health care worker has to
fear these preventable injuries," said Andrew Stern, the union president.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 50 types of safe needles and intravenous systems already are
approved by the federal government, but only about 15 percent of hospitals
currently use them. Generally, the safer needle systems retract the needle
before it is removed from a patient's skin, either automatically or by pressing
the syringe plunger an extra time; some intravenous systems have no needle at
all and some vaccine injectors now use pressure instead of needles to get
medicine under the skin.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Jersey, an estimated 2,000 medical workers suffer accidental needle
sticks every month.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state of New Jersey spends $1 million a month on testing" those workers
alone, in addition to the cost of prophylactic medicines intended to prevent
infections from taking hold, said Maryellen Kluxen, coordinator of the Patients
First Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition, including groups representing patients, health care workers,
consumers, elderly residents and labor unions, held a rally and other events to
push for passage of the state law.
</P>
<P>
	   It gives hospitals, nursing homes and state-licensed health clinics one year
to switch from conventional needles and other sharp devices to ones with
integrated safety features that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Those medical facilities also must establish a committee to evaluate and
choose safe needles and intravenous systems, train workers in their use, and
report all needle-stick injuries to the state health department.
</P>
<P>
	   Private doctors' offices don't have to make the switch.
</P>
<P>
	   While standard needles cost significantly less than new, safer systems -
about 6 cents for a standard blood-collection needle vs. 25 cents for a safer
version, for example - using safer needles can save medical facilities money.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because of the high cost of testing workers after accidental needle
sticks and giving them medicines against whatever infectious disease the patient
carried. Testing alone costs about $500 per worker.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, the first state to implement a safer-needles law, Kluxen said
medical facilities saved an estimated $100 million in 1998, when the law took
effect.
</P>
<P>
	   A handful of New Jersey hospitals already have converted to the safer
needles, Kluxen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new state law allows individual medical workers to get a waiver to use a
conventional needle in cases where a safety needle could harm a patient or
jeopardize the success of a specific medical procedure. The law also requires
the state health commissioner to set a date when the requirement will also apply
to syringes pre-filled with medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Jersey State AFL-CIO said the law would "reduce the human cost to
injured workers" and could eventually reduce worker's compensation premiums paid
by hospitals and nursing homes.

U.S. Makes Offer on Cuban Boy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has asked Cuba to let Elian
Gonzalez's father escort him back to the island if U.S. officials decide the boy
should return to Cuba, a U.S. official said today. The official said the request
is a contingency plan and does not signal a decision to resolve the politically
charged issue by sending Elian back to his homeland. Fidel Castro's point man on
U.S. affairs said the Cuban government would not stop Gonzalez from retreiving
his son in Miami if he wanted to. Elian was retrieved from an inner tube off the
coast of Florida on Nov. 25. He had been aboard a Florida-bound boat that
capsized, killing 10 other passengers, including his mother.

	   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- Six weeks after she unofficially announced her
candidacy for New York's U.S. Senate seat, two moving vans arrived at the
Clintons' new $1.7 million Westchester County home this afternoon. Mrs. Clinton
was expected at the house tomorrow to begin emptying the boxes and to spend her
first night there, said Karen Finney, a member of her campaign staff. The first
lady hopes to move in by the end of next week, and President Clinton is planning
to visit here at the same time, Finney said. Mrs. Clinton has said she plans to
cut back on White House duties and spend most of her time in New York state this

Cherica Adams. Carruth and the other three suspects had already been held on the
murder and conspiracy charges. Officials said the indictment will enable
prosecutors to skip a probable cause hearing scheduled for Monday.

<HEADLINE> Blast Near Sri Lanak PM's Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A powerful explosion Wednesday near the Sri Lankan
prime minister's home killed at least one person and wounding several others,
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known if Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was at
home.
</P>
<P>
	   Details were sketchy but initial police reports said that the explosion may
have been carried out by a suicide bomber.
</P>
<P>
	   They said at least one person was killed and several wounded were being
rushed to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Bandaranaike is also the mother of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who was
severely injured in the right eye in a suicide bomb attack last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators have blamed that attack, which killed 23 people, on the
separatist Tamil rebels. The militants have been fighting for 16 years to create
a homeland in northeast Sri Lanka. The fighting has left an estimated 61,000
people dead so far. They say Tamils are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Publisher Ottaway Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MIDDLETOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- James Haller Ottaway Sr., who created The
Middletown Times Herald-Record and a nationwide newspaper chain that bears his
name, died Tuesday. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottaway died in the Arden Hill Hospital in Goshen of pneumonia and
congestive heart failure, the Times Herald-Record reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper, born when Ottaway merged the Times Herald and the Middletown
Record in 1959-1960, became the flagship of the Ottaway Newspapers group.
Ottaway retired as president and chief executive officer in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   He was born July 8, 1911. His father, E.J. Ottaway, was co-owner of the Port
Huron, Mich., Times-Herald.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1936, Ottaway and his wife, Ruth, bought their first newspaper, the
Endicott Bulletin, then a semi-weekly in upstate New York. By 1970, the Ottaway
chain had grown to nine dailies, and Ottaway sold the company to Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
The agreement gave Ottaway a seat on the Dow Jones board of directors from 1970
to 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottaway also served on the board of directors of The Associated Press in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ottaway group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Jones, now includes 19
dailies, and 16 weeklies, plus various other shoppers and publications in 11
states. Annual revenues are about $330 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jim Sr. was a man of enormous enterprise, integrity, generosity and good
humor -- a gentleman in every sense of that word," Dow Jones Chairman Peter Kann
said Tuesday,
</P>
<P>
	   Ottaway is survived by his wife; a daughter, Ruth Ottaway Sherer; two sons,
James H. Ottaway Jr. and David Blackburne Ottaway; eight grandchildren; and
seven great grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Hill, Mourning, Allen on U.S. Team  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Vince Carter's dream of making the Dream Team will have to wait four more
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter lost out to Ray Allen of the Milwaukee Bucks on a 6-3 vote Tuesday as
the nine-man USA Basketball selection committee selected the final three players
for the 12-man roster.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant Hill and Alonzo Mourning got the other spots.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no official announcement, but several NBA sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed the results to The Associated Press. Hill,
Mourning and Allen all have expressed interest in playing for the U.S. team, so
there should be no impediment to finalizing their selections in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, the 22-year-old Toronto forward leading all players in All-Star
balloting, said recently that it was his dream to play for the U.S. team in the
Olympics next summer in Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   But the selection committee, seeking someone who would accept a 12th-man
mentality, went instead with Allen, the better shooter and the more veteran
player.
</P>
<P>
	   "Vince is nobody's 12th man," Raptors coach Butch Carter said. "Evidently he
hasn't shown enough separation between himself and the rest of the talent pool."
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. team also includes Kevin Garnett, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, Steve
Smith, Allan Houston, Tim Hardaway, Vin Baker, Tom Gugliotta and Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
	   The choice of Hill came as no surprise. He was originally chosen for the
team two years ago only to withdraw because the Olympic qualifying tournament,
held last summer in Puerto Rico, conflicted with his wedding.
</P>
<P>
	   Mourning gets the spot that was expected to go to Shaquille O'Neal, who
indicated recently that he preferred to spend more time with his 3-year-old
daughter rather than devote 42 straight days to the national team.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen, a fourth-year guard, beat out Carter for what was widely considered
the only truly wide-open spot available on the roster. No other guards,
including Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant and Eddie Jones, received serious support
during an approximately 30-minute conference by the selection committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter had gained support in recent weeks as his high-flying style of play
and consistently productive scoring led the Raptors into contention for first
place in the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's over. It's not a big deal," Carter said. "Yes, it's a chance of a
lifetime but I'm young. There's another in four years.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll never ever say it was a bad decision because Ray Allen is a great
basketball player also. Obviously he deserves it."
</P>
<P>
	   Carter entered Tuesday night's games ranked fifth in the league in scoring
at 24.3 points per game. Allen ranked 14th, averaging 21.9.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen, however, is the better 3-point shooter, 42.4 percent to Carter's 34.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very disappointed for Vince. He deserves to be on the team," Raptors
general manager Glen Grunwald said. "He's one of the best players in the world
right now."
</P>
<P>
	   "He doesn't understand how mean this business can be, but he got a good
taste of it today and he's got to answer it," Butch Carter said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Gary Payton scored 29 points Tuesday night to help the
Seattle SuperSonics break a five-game losing streak with a 103-96 victory over
the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle clung to an 89-87 lead with just under six minutes remaining when
Payton hit his first of four straight layups. When he made the last one with
3:42 left, the Sonics had extended to a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston and Seattle had stayed close most of the night, but the Rockets
managed just two field goals in the final 6:32.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston rookie Steve Francis scored 27 to tie his career high, which came at
Seattle on Nov. 20. Matt Bullard added a season-high 20 in a rare start.
</P>
<P>
	   For Seattle, Vin Baker had 19 points and 18 rebounds, while Horace Grant had
18 points. Payton had 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton and Francis, who often is compared to the Seattle star, each earned
technical fouls midway through the third period for jawing with one another.
Through Francis has had his two best scoring games against Payton, the Sonics
have prevailed both times.
</P>
<P>
	   Bullard came out firing in the first period, scoring the Rockets' first 12
points to keep them from falling too far behind early. Down by seven midway
through the quarter, Houston rallied to keep it tight throughout the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle led Houston 54-53 at halftime. The Rockets trailed for most of the
second half but remained in striking distance until Payton's late barrage.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Pilgrim Put in Receivership  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- A judge placed financially strapped Harvard Pilgrim Health
Care into receivership Tuesday after the HMO said it underestimated 1999 losses
by tens of millions of dollars because of accounting errors.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Thomas Reilly sought the order after Harvard Pilgrim said
its projected losses for 1999 would total $177 million, above its initial
estimate of $100 million, The Boston Globe reported Tuesday on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the order, state insurance commissioner Linda Ruthardt will
temporarily oversee the nonprofit, which is the state's largest health
maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
	   State regulators have 30 days to come up with a plan to reverse the HMO's
financial slide, the Boston Herald reported on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly said he sought the court in order to block the HMO's creditors from
seeking payment from Harvard through federal bankruptcy. Such a move could force
the sale of Harvard's assets and possibly disrupt patient care, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our immediate concern and objective was to prevent a disruption of patient
services," Reilly said. "Patients can be confident tomorrow that their health
care coverage remains in effect."
</P>
<P>
	   The court order was approved Tuesday by the chief justice of the Supreme
Judicial Court allows Harvard Pilgrim to continue to operate and provide care
for its 1.1 million Massachusetts members, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
	   The request for the court order came after Harvard Pilgrim officials met
with the Division of Insurance on Tuesday morning to report the additional
losses, said company spokesman Alan Raymond.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvard Pilgrim chief executive Charles D. Baker said medical expenses from
different parts of the company weren't recorded in the company's general ledger.
</P>
<P>
	   The past accounting errors came to light as the company was preparing for a
$147 million state bond deal approved by the Massachusetts Health &AMP; Educational
Facilities Authority, Raymond said. Under terms of the deal, designed to help
the insurer regain financial health, Harvard Pilgrim planned to sell eight of
its properties to an entity set up by the state and lease back the space.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Ciolek, head of the Health &AMP; Educational Facilities Authority, said
the state's move halted the bond sale.
</P>
<P>
	   "This stops the financing in its tracks," Ciolek told the Boston Herald.
"It's a shame. We think this was an important element of their turnaround."
</P>
<P>
	   The bonds had been presold and the transaction was to be completed next
week, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker has insisted the insurer would regain financial stability despite
losing $94 million in 1998. The insurer recently closed its Rhode Island
operations, leaving about 125,000 people scrambling for new insurance.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices plunged Wednesday morning, pushed down by
high-technology issues hit by an overnight tumble on Wall Street. The dollar
slipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 771.79 points, or 4.06
percent, to 18,231.07 at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the average
closed up 68.52 points, or 0.36 percent to finish at a 28-month high of
19,002.86. The half-day session was the first of the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 102.96 yen, down 0.02 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
also below than its late New York level of 103.28 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, share prices dropped after the Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled 359.58 points, or 3.17 percent, to 10,997.93 on Tuesday, its
fourth-worst point loss amid worries about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 229.46 points to 3,901.69,
its worst point loss and eighth-worst percentage decline.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tokyo, high-technology as well as information and telecommunications
shares were among morning losers. Gainers included biotechnology-related issues
and some oil refinery stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Tokyo stock market's fall came as it was about to enter a consolidation
phase following its surge late last year, which was much helped by continued
rallies on Wall Street," said Yoshimasa Kunisawa, an analyst with Okasan
Securities in Tokyo. "We must keep watching how the New York stock market will
move in the next few days."
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 104.12 points, or 6.06 percent, to 1,613.35. The TOPIX closed
down 4.73 points, or 0.27 percent, the day before.

<HEADLINE> Ted Turner, Jane Fonda Separating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- After eight years of marriage, media magnate Ted Turner and
two-time Academy Award winner Jane Fonda said Tuesday they are separating
because they need some time apart.
</P>
<P>
	   "While we continue to be committed to the long-term success of our marriage,
we find ourselves at a juncture where we must each take some personal time for
ourselves," they said in a statement. "Therefore, we have mutually decided to
spend some time apart. We ask that you respect this decision."
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Fonda, 62, and Turner, 61, celebrated their eighth wedding anniversary
on Dec. 21. They live in an apartment atop CNN Center.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has happened so quickly that there is a lot we still don't know. It's
possible that we will issue a more detailed announcement in the coming days,"
Turner spokeswoman Caroline Harkleroad said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Fonda, who won best actress for the 1971 "Klute" and the 1978 release
"Coming Home," once said she had given up acting because she wanted to spend as
much time as possible with Turner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't imagine any movie that I ever made or could make in the future that
would be worth giving up three months of being with Ted," Miss Fonda said in an
interview aired on ABC's "PrimeTime Live" in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The two announced their engagement on Dec. 7, 1990, when Miss Fonda
displayed a diamond and opal ring. They were wed on Miss Fonda's 54th birthday
before about 30 family members and friends at Turner's 8,100-acre Avalon
Plantation about 20 miles east of Tallahassee, Fla. Miss Fonda wrote the
couple's vows.
</P>
<P>
	   The marriage was the third for both Miss Fonda and Turner. He has five
children from previous marriages, while she has two.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner founded CNN and owns the Atlanta Braves and the Atlanta Hawks. He
created CNN in 1980 as part of his Turner Broadcasting System Inc. empire. TBS
was swallowed by Time Warner Inc. in 1996 in a $7.57 billion merger, and Turner
is now a vice chairman of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, he established the United Nations Foundation after pledging to give
$1 billion over 10 years to U.N. projects that benefit the environment and women
and children's health.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Turner said he had considered running for president but decided
not do so because Miss Fonda wouldn't let him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought about it a number of times," Turner said in May. "But my wife,
who was married to a politician before, said she would leave me."
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Fonda, an antiwar activist during the Vietnam War, was married to Tom
Hayden, a '60s radical and state senator in California. Her first husband was
director Roger Vadim.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Cliff Robinson scored 30 points and Tom Gugliotta returned
to the lineup for the first time since his life-threatening seizure Dec. 17 as
the Phoenix Suns beat the Charlotte Hornets 86-80 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   All of Robinson's points, including four 3-pointers, came in the first three
quarters for the Suns, who played for the first time in six days. He also had
nine rebounds and five assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Kidd had 11 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds for Phoenix. Todd
Day was the only other Suns player in double figures with 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Derrick Coleman had 14 points and a season-high 19 rebounds for Charlotte
but was 4-for-14 from the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Elden Campbell and David Wesley scored 18 apiece for the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
	   Down 79-65 after Day's driving one-handed shot with 9:12 to play, the
Hornets went on a 10-0 run to cut it to 79-75 on Anthony Mason's 13-footer with
4:06 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliver Miller's three-point play with 3:52 remaining boosted Phoenix's lead
to 82-75, and Charlotte never got closer than five again.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns, 15-3 at home, took charge with an 11-0 run early in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson scored 13 in the third quarter as the Suns led by as many as 14.
Kidd had six assists in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   After falling behind briefly 50-48 to start the second half, Phoenix scored
11 in a row to go up 59-50 on Robinson's drive to the basket with 6:14 left in
the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson sank a 3-pointer, then threw a no-look pass over his head to Oliver
Miller for a layup to put the Suns up 73-59 with 1:36 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix led 73-62 going into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Gugliotta missed seven games after his seizure on the team bus following a
game in Portland. Team doctors suspect the seizure was caused by a supplement
Gugliotta took moments earlier. He scored two points on 1-for-6 shooting but led
the Suns with 10 rebounds in 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson scored 17, including three of four 3-pointers, in the first half as
Phoenix took a 48-45 lead at the break. The Suns led nearly all of the first
half but never by more than seven points.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix was 8-for-15 from 3-point range in the first half but didn't shoot a
free throw, while the Hornets were 13-for-16 at the line.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hijack Victim Returns Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The only American aboard an Indian Airlines jet that was
hijacked en route to India returned to California Tuesday, feeling too ill and
exhausted to meet a small group of family members gathered at the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanne Moore, 53, arrived at Los Angeles International Airport aboard a
Lufthansa flight from Germany around 1 p.m. After clearing customs, security
officials allowed her to leave through a separate exit to bypass reporters and
relatives, including her parents, who waited at least two hours for her arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Her family has her squirreled away for a few days so she can rest because
her health isn't the best,'' George Welch, Moore's brother-in-law, said later
outside his in-laws house in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore suffered pneumonia and stomach problems, Welch said, adding that she
was in good spirits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She's happy to be back in the good old USA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Tuesday, she told ``Good Morning America'' from Germany that the
hostages lived in constant terror of either being killed by the hijackers or
caught in the middle of a commando raid to retake the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was not fun and games all the time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said one hijacker struck her on the head after she made a slight
movement -- to blow a bug off her hand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As bad as you think it is, multiply that by a couple of times and that's
what you've got.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore was the only American among passengers taken hostage when their plane
from Nepal to New Delhi, India was hijacked Christmas Eve. The hijacking ended
when three Kashmiri activists -- at least one of whom was Pakistani -- were
freed from Indian jails in exchange for the 155 passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the plane's passengers was killed shortly after the plane was
hijacked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We did not know what kind of crazy people had a hold of her so we were
worried about her safety,'' her father, Harold Redding, said while he and his
wife, Marie, waited at the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   He described his daughter as an ``achiever,'' and said that the hijacking
probably wouldn't stop her from traveling again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When she wants something, she goes after it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore, a special education teacher in Bakersfield, was expected to remain in
the Los Angeles area for the next few days before returning home to Bakersfield,
Welch said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Blast Kills at Least 6  </HEADLINE>
   By DILSHIKHA JAYAMAHA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A suspected separatist rebel detonated powerful
explosives strapped to her body near the prime minister's office Wednesday,
killing the attacker and five others, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known if Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was in
the building in the midmorning blast in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Four policemen and a civilian were among those killed. Many people were
injured and were being taken to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our people found her (the attacker's) movements suspicious,'' police
spokesman Jagath Jayawardene. ``They tried to check her when she exploded
herself.''
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion damaged the outside the building housing the office of
Bandaranaike, who is also the mother of President Chandrika Kumatatunga. Earlier
police said the blast occurred outside the prime minister's home.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion fell on the
rebels, whose 16-year fight to carve out a homeland in northeast Sri Lanka has
left more than 61,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was the focus of an assassination attempt last month during
the presidential race. A suicide bomber set off explosives strapped to her body
as Kumatatunga was getting into her car. She was injured in the right eye and
reportedly could lose its sight. That blast also killed 23 people and wounded
100.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels have aimed recent attacks on the president and her family because
she has said that her security forces will continue to try and crush the Tamil
uprising.

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech Leads Sugar Bowl 28-14  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Michael Vick's electrifying performance Tuesday night
rallied Virginia Tech to a 29-28 lead over Florida State after three quarters at
the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick turned college football's matchup of the national championship -- and
his one-man duel with Peter Warrick -- into a game of catch-me-if-you-can,
setting up a wild final quarter at the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
	   Down 28-7 late in the first half, second-ranked Virginia Tech struck for two
touchdowns and a field goal in the third period. That was enough to overcome a
pair of long TDs by Warrick, and threaten to send the No. 1 Seminoles to their
third championship defeat in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State (11-0) hoped to give 70-year-old coach Bobby Bowden his first
perfect season and second title, but Vick and the Hokies (11-0) had other plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick ran wildly, leaving swarming defenders and even a game official
sprawled over the field. The freshman quarterback set up 28- and 4-yard TD runs
by Andre Kendrick and a 23-yard field goal by Shayne Graham. The Hokies tried
2-point conversions after each touchdown, but failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick starred in the first half, catching a 64-yard TD pass and scoring on
a 59-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State scored four TDs in a span of just 6:22, once on a blocked punt
return by Jeff Chaney and another on Chris Weinke's 63-yard pass to Ron Dugans.
By the break, Warrick had three catches for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The elusive freshman quarterback fumbled on fourth down when flushed back to
the Florida State 7 on the game's opening possession, then came back with a
49-yard TD pass to Andre Davis with 30 seconds left in the first quarter. Vick
ran for a 3-yard score with 37 seconds left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Showing a crowd of 79,280 why he might be the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft,
Warrick added a 33-yard catch and later accepted congratulations on the sideline
from Minnesota Vikings star receiver Randy Moss, who briefly attended Florida
State.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick was determined to leave college football fans across the nation with
a lasting image -- from on the field, that is. Earlier this season, his Heisman
Trophy were derailed when he was caught in a shopping mall scam.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick also wanted to atone for past bowl performances. He was held to one
catch last season when the Seminoles lost 23-16 to Tennessee in the Fiesta with
the title on the line, and also made only one catch three seasons ago in a 52-20
championship loss to Florida in the Sugar.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles ran off only three players in the first 11 minutes before
showing off an amazing ability to strike quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick beat single coverage and ran past a safety to catch Weinke's pass in
full stride to make it 7-0 with 3:22 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   On Virginia Tech's next possession, Jimmy Kibble had a punt blocked for the
first time in his career. Tommy Polley batted it down and Chaney scooped up the
loose ball for a 6-yard score, the first off a blocked punt in the Sugar Bowl
since Syracuse's Brad Clarke did it against LSU in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick temporarily stopped the Seminoles' momentum, hitting a wide-open Davis.
Vick tapped himself twice on the heart and pointed up after the score.
</P>
<P>
	   But Warrick and the Seminoles had an answer for that.
</P>
<P>
	   First, Dugans sailed clear to pull in a pass from Weinke, the 27-year-old
quarterback who missed last season's Fiesta disappointment because of a neck
injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick followed by fielding a rushed punt on one bounce, juking left and
zipping down the right sideline. Virginia Tech prides itself on its special
teams, but gave a TD on a punt return for the first time since 1988 o while
Warrick celebrated, Kibble punched an end zone wall.
</P>
<P>
	   At that moment, there was this incredible statistic: Florida State led 28-7
despite having the ball for only 3:14, compared to the Hokies' 15:06.

<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- George McCloud hit two 3-pointers in the final 46 seconds and
Antonio McDyess had 27 points and 13 rebounds as the Denver Nuggets beat the
Dallas Mavericks 98-96 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   McCloud scored 17 of his 19 points in the second half. Nick Van Exel added
17, Ron Mercer had 14 and Raef LaFrentz 11 for the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Finely had 28 points and 10 assists and Gary Trent added 20 points
for the Mavericks who lost their fourth straight. Dallas made all 16 of its free
throws.
</P>
<P>
	   McCloud, who was 5-for-9 on 3-pointers, hit a 3-pointer with 46 seconds to
go to put the Nuggets ahead 95-94. After Finley's layup, McCloud hit the
game-winner with 8.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets took a 76-74 lead into the fourth quarter and neither team
scored until a dunk by McDyess nearly three minutes into the period. Trent got
the Mavericks first points of the final quarter with a finger roll layup and
Dirk Nowitzki tied the game at 80 with two free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied five times over the next four minutes, the last time at 92
on a dunk and free throw by McDyess with 1:17 left. Shawn Bradley's jump shot
from the wing with 1:01 left put Dallas ahead 94-92 before McCloud's two
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing 54-45 at halftime, Denver opened the third quarter with a 14-2 run,
with seven points coming from McCloud to take a 59-56 lead. The Mavericks
regained the lead, 60-59, on two free throws by Ceballos and a jumper by Finley.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel scored 11 points and the Nuggets shot 65 percent on 13-for-20
shooting in the first quarter but trailed 31-29. Finley and Nowitzki had eight
points each in a period where the Mavericks hit 14 of 22 shots.

<P>
    INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Rik Smits got Indiana out quickly and the Pacers
weathered a fourth-quarter rally by New Jersey after Reggie Miller was ejected.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller scored 24 points before getting his second technical foul in the
third quarter and Smits added 22 as Indiana beat the Nets 116-111 on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller shot 10-of-14 before being ejected for arguing a no-call with 4:12 to
play in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Smits scored 10 of the Pacers' first 12 points and shot 10-of-20 from the
field for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I like to start like that. Many times, it carries over to the team," Smits
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacers led by as many as 19 points early in the fourth quarter, but
Kerry Kittles and Stephon Marbury fueled a 21-6 rally that brought the Nets to
112-107 with 47 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacers survived by making four free throws in the final 36 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Forwards Austin Croshere and Dale Davis carried the Pacers in the wake of
Miller's ejection. Croshere scored 16 points and grabbed seven rebounds, and
Davis added seven rebounds and four points. Jalen Rose finished with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had a lot of guys step up and help us on offense," Smits said. "Jalen
and Austin did the job tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   Nets coach Don Casey agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were mauled on the inside. Rik (Smits), (Austin) Croshere and (Dale)
Davis were just too strong for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana has won six straight games and 14 of its last 16. The Pacers have
won 10 consecutive games at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Kittles scored 33 points for New Jersey, which lost for the first time in
five games. The Nets are 2-11 on the road. Marbury finished with 26 points and
10 assists and watched the last two minutes from the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   "We went with the guys who were hustling and playing well," Casey said. "The
other guys were just playing much better."
</P>
<P>
	   Pacers backup center Sam Perkins severely sprained his right wrist while
taking a charge from Marbury shortly before the half and did not return after
scoring eight points. He will have it re-examined Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Smits and Jackson got the Pacers started early. Smits scored 10 of his
team's first 12 points, and Jackson notched seven assists in the opening
quarter. Indiana led 8-2 and 17-8 en route to a 30-28 lead after one.
</P>
<P>
	   Perkins hit his second 3-pointer of the game as the Pacers scored 11
straight points for a 54-39 lead 2:24 left in the second. Indiana led 63-45 at

<HEADLINE> Lower Fares Spread to More Airlines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- In a bid to generate air traffic during the usually slow
winter and early spring months, three major airlines are following Southwest
Airlines' lead in slashing ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
	   United Airlines and US Airways joined the fray Tuesday, with reduced prices
for travel throughout their systems into the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   United reduced its fares by up to 30 percent, offering round-trip air fares
of $348 for its Chicago-London route; $274 for New York-Denver and $518 for Los
Angeles-Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   US Airways is charging $338 roundtrip on its New York-San Francisco and Los
Angeles-Philadelphia routes, as well as discounting fares on routes serving
smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Southwest Airlines led the pack with a coast-to-coast fare of
$198. TWA followed suit on Monday when it announced a 50 percent reduction on a
round-trip Boston-Los Angeles trip. The airline also reduced the prices on other
domestic routes and on several of its international routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers who buy tickets on United's and US Airways' Web sites by Jan. 14
can get up to 5 percent off sale fares.
</P>
<P>
	   "What UAL (and the other airlines) are doing is trying to generate leisure
traffic volume," said analyst James Higgins of Donaldson Luftkin &AMP; Jenrette,
adding that airlines regularly reduce fares this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Tom Parson of BestFares.Com, a clearing house for travel deals,
says the reductions are steeper than in the past. He noted that air travel
declined sharply because of public jitters over possible Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are not very many places you can travel where the price is not
discounted," he said, adding that fares to Europe should be particularly
appealing to travelers.
</P>
<P>
	   Restrictions have been placed on all the fares, with United and US Airways
requiring purchases at least 14 days in advance of travel or by Jan. 14.
United's reduced fares are not applicable during the President's Day and Easter
holiday weekends.

	   But the arrival of choice may be a mixed blessing for consumers, as the
enticing new calling plans can be hard to compare.
</P>
<P>
	   While many people are well-versed in comparing long-distance rates, most
have no experience shopping for local service because there's always been just
one place to get it: the local phone monopolies run by AT&AMP;T and the regional
Baby Bells. Likewise, it's been more than 15 years since most people could buy
local and long distance from one company, and back then they had no choice but
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, real competition is heating up in New York and will spread to other
parts of the country in the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last February, MCI Worldcom, AT&AMP;T and Sprint have all introduced local
calling service in New York, preparing for what will finally become a reality
today, when Bell Atlantic becomes the first Baby Bell to sell long-distance
service in the same market where it provides local service.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic, the local phone company for most of the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic, gained clearance for New York last week as the Federal
Communications Commission declared that the company had finally met its
obligation to open the state's local calling market to competition.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC Communications, which serves the Southwest and Midwest, expects FCC
approval to provide long distance service in Texas this year and BellSouth
expects it in Georgia. Bell Atlantic hopes for FCC approval for New Jersey,
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania by year-end.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T is using cable TV lines to deliver bundles of local and long
distance in 13 cities and plans to expand the service rapidly.
</P>
<P>
	   The sudden spurt of competition is expected to bring prices down. But with
four major companies and numerous calling plans to choose from, what's a
consumer to do?
</P>
<P>
	   "There will be confusion," said Samuel Simon, chairman of the
Washington-based Telecommunications Research and Action Center. "The simple
advice is to sit down, catalogue what you're using, and see what it's costing."
</P>
<P>
	   That means weeding through recent phone bills that may compare with the new
offerings like apples to oranges.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic, for example, is offering a local-long distance package for
$19.99 per month, plus 10 cents per minute for long-distance calls and a small
charge for each local call that varies with the time of day. The monthly fee
includes up to eight additional features such as caller ID, call waiting and
3-way calling.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, AT&AMP;T is charging $24.90 for virtually unlimited local service
-- 75 hours -- and long-distance calls for 7 cents a minute. An optional package
of caller ID, call waiting and 3-way calling costs an additional $12.50 per
month.
</P>
<P>
	   For those who live in areas where AT&AMP;T provides phone service via cable TV
lines, the price is about $25 per month, including the three optional services.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprint is charging $35 per month for unlimited local calls and long-distance
rates of either 7 cents per minute all the time or 5 cents per minute from 7
p.m. to 7 a.m. and 10 cents a minute other times.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI still treats local and long distance as separate calling plans, but
offers a $5 monthly discount to customers who take both services.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic's move into long distance comes despite a continued court
fight from AT&AMP;T to overturn the Federal Communications Commission's approval.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, a federal court rejected AT&AMP;T's request to block Bell Atlantic
while it appeals that decision.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T contends that Bell Atlantic still hasn't made it physically and
financially feasible for rivals to sell local service by leasing Bell Atlantic's
phone lines.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Plunge Jolts Asian Traders  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONG KONG (AP) -- Jolted by a big drop on Wall Street, Asian traders threw
stock prices into a tailspin early Wednesday as interest rate fears gripped the
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Red ink splashed through the exchanges as sellers unloaded the blue chips --
although analysts noted many prices were tumbling from dizzying heights they had
reached in recent rallies that set records for some indexes.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped more than 1,000 points -- from above
17,000 to below 16,000 -- in the first minutes of trading. After a few minutes
more, the Hang Seng had bounced back up to 16,208.78 points, still down by
864.04 points, or 5.1 percent, in wild dealings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Euphoria in Hong Kong is ending," said Frank Gong, economist and strategist
with the Bank of America's branch in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng finished 1999 with
a record close before setting yet another one Monday, the first day of trading
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   On Asia's biggest market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average fell 771.79 points, or 4.1 percent, to finish the morning
session at 18,231.07.
</P>
<P>
	   In Seoul, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index was down by 5.7 percent in
the late morning as a selloff gained momentum and losses mounted.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is hurt by the sharp falls in New York and other big markets,"
said Lee Sang-joon, an analyst at KFB Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips were off by 5.4 percent in Singapore, another market that rang
out the old year and rang in the new one with record prices. Philippine blue
chips quickly dropped by 2 percent and Malaysian prices were down by about 3
percent. Indonesian shares lost 2.7 percent in early trading.
</P>
<P>
	   Australian blue chips had fallen by about 2.3 percent by midday, while New
Zealand shares were off by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwanese blue chips showed a quick loss of 1 percent, but bounced back to
almost 1 percent higher later in the morning, bucking the trend as investors
bought into technology companies that are a backbone of the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The selling in other markets was set off by a steep slide in New York, where
the Dow Jones industrial average lost 3.2 percent of its value in its
fourth-biggest point loss ever, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.6
percent -- its worst point drop ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders are concerned the U.S. Federal Reserve might raise interest rates
next month, a move that could weaken U.S. stock prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is just taking the lead from the U.S. market, especially the IT
and e-commerce stocks," said Michael Wong, a dealer at Kim Eng Securities in
Singapore. But Wong said the selloff should be viewed in context -- markets have
recently been showing massive gains that could not go on uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is on a firm base," he said. "There's no problem. There'll be
days when the market pulls back. It's normal."
