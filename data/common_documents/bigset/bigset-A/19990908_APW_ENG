<HEADLINE> Pound Soars, Dollar Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The British pound soared Wednesday after a  
surprise increase in interest rates by the Bank of England. The 
dollar turned in a mixed performance against other major 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The pound shot up to $1.6192 in late New York trading from  
$1.6049 on Tuesday. Earlier Wednesday, it rose to $1.6220 in 
European trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, meantime, rose against the yen in advance of a  
report on economic growth in Japan and fell against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was worth 111.08 yen in New York trading, up from  
Tuesday's 110.81. The euro was worth $1.0595, up from $1.5091. 
</P>
<P>
	The pound got an unexpected lift from the first increase in  
rates by Britain's central bank since June 1998. The base rate -- 
the interest on loans to commercial banks by the Bank of England -- 
was raised to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate hike followed a string of seven interest rate cuts  
aimed at stimulating the economy. The central bank said Wednesday 
that it wanted to pre-empt a return of inflation at a time when 
Britain's economic recovery is speeding up and growing demand for 
housing has sent home prices rising sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in British rates, coupled with that country's continued  
low inflation, made returns more attractive on assets denominated 
in pounds, creating demand for the British currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency traders also were awaiting clues on the course of  
Japan's economy, which has been struggling to recover from a deep 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the government reports on the gross domestic  
product for the second quarter. Japan's economy grew 2 percent in 
the first three months of this year, but some forecasters are 
predicting a slight contraction for the April-June period. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5101 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5094, and 1.4883 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4917. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8458 German 
marks, down from 1.8467; 6.1906 French francs, down from 6.1935; 
and 1,827.36 Italian lire, down from 1,828.22.

<HEADLINE>  With Healthy QB, Patriots Have Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Ted Johnson shuffled through the Patriots  
locker room, his left arm in a sling. Robert Edwards was down in 
Georgia, rehabilitating his ravaged knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Not particularly good signs for a team whose last season was  
ruined by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	There are much better signs, though, on the practice field: Drew  
Bledsoe throwing deep passes again now that his broken right index 
finger is healed. Terry Glenn running under them at full gallop now 
that he's recovered from a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of last year when we had guys on the sidelines, we  
still found ways to scramble around and make enough plays to get 
into the playoffs,'' Bledsoe said. ``We know that when we're 
healthy, we can play with anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Patriots' sake, he'd better be right.  
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots finished fourth in the AFC East with a 9-7 record.  
This year, the division appears to be the best in the NFL. And they 
begin the season Sunday against the defending division champions, 
the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the exhibition season, though, don't bode well.  
The Patriots were 1-3 and Bledsoe wasn't especially sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more fun in preseason to win and it gives you a lighter  
air about your work,'' coach Pete Carroll said. ``We struggled a 
little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also lost middle linebacker Johnson for most, if not all,  
of the season with a ruptured left biceps tendon. Linebacker Todd 
Collins left as a free agent for St. Louis. And the Patriots 
released free safety Willie Clay and gave the job to Chris Carter, 
who hasn't started in his two NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Johnson's replacement, first-round draft pick Andy  
Katzenmoyer, sprained his ankle and was a question mark to play in 
the opener. Still, the Patriots were upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we have bigtime losses or everybody's healthy, I'm  
going to feel the same,'' outside linebacker Tedy Bruschi said. 
``You just have to adjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Clay, the secondary is outstanding with strong  
safety Lawyer Milloy and cornerbacks Ty Law and Steve Israel. Their 
jobs would be easier if pass-rushing end Willie McGinest, sidelined 
for 12 games the last two seasons, can stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards was healthy for all of 1998, when he rushed for 1,115  
yards as a rookie. But his career is in jeopardy after he 
dislocated and did nerve damage in his knee on a Hawaii beach 
during a flag football game held as part of the Pro Bowl 
festivities in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots plan to replace him with second-round pick Kevin  
Faulk and veteran Terry Allen, signed as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It always hurts to lose a player of Robert Edwards' caliber,''  
Bledsoe said, ``but Kevin Faulk has done some good things for us in 
the preseason, and the addition of Terry Allen should be a plus for 
us. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be a good 1-2 punch for us in the running game.''  
</P>
<P>
	Their success will depend on a shuffled offensive line.  
First-round pick Damien Woody replaces Dave Wohlabaugh, who signed 
with Cleveland, as the starting center. Heath Irwin beat out last 
year's starter, Max Lane, at left guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Bledsoe get hurt again, the Patriots will be in much  
better shape to replace him. Last season, Scott Zolak struggled in 
the last three games, including a first-round playoff loss in 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the Patriots have John Friesz, a reliable backup  
with San Diego, Washington and Seattle, and rookie Michael Bishop, 
the seventh-round pick from Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop, with his powerful arm and scrambling ability, was the  
talk of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can be a factor for us,'' Bledsoe said. ``How that happens,  
I don't really know. That will be up to Pete and to our staff. But 
simply the threat of Michael Bishop is going to make teams use some 
practice time to prepare specifically for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Patriots' fortunes rest primarily on the shoulders of  
Bledsoe, now in his seventh NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
	He played three games with his broken finger before missing the  
last three. 
</P>
<P>
	``To play without Drew in games with such impact at the end of  
the season is very difficult,'' Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 16 starters were sidelined last season with injuries.  
Now, aside from Johnson and Edwards, they're relatively healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not really the same club that we played with last  
year,'' Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not the same team that made it to the Super Bowl after  
the 1996 season, when Milloy was a rookie and the future seemed 
rosy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were the team to beat and we pretty much lost that,'' he  
said. ``I really thought we'd be dominant right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But their division got tougher.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's a challenge and I wouldn't want it any other way,'' Law  
said. ``If you get through this division, your chances are a lot 
better in the playoffs, because you beat the best of the best.''

<HEADLINE> Critics Find Cisneros Case Flaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Critics say that former Housing Secretary  
Henry Cisneros' misdemeanor conviction resulting from a four-year, 
$9 million-plus investigation is further proof that the independent 
counsel statute hasn't worked in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who had been indicted on 18 felony counts of  
conspiracy, obstruction and lying to the FBI, pleaded guilty 
Tuesday to a single misdemeanor count of lying to the FBI. Under 
the plea arrangement with Independent Counsel David Barrett, which 
came as jury selection was set to begin, Cisneros immediately paid 
a $10,000 fine but faces no jail time or probation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton talked to Cisneros on Tuesday night, ``to send  
along his best wishes,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the case points out flaws in the independent  
counsel law, which lapsed in June with the Clinton administration's 
blessing. Cisneros is the first member of the Clinton 
administration Cabinet to plead guilty in a case brought by an 
independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a situation where you have an open-ended probe that  
spent an awful lot of money and an awful lot of time and put an 
awful lot of people through a lot,'' for a misdemeanor plea, 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., an author of the post-Watergate  
independent counsel statute, used stronger language Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an investigation looking for a crime, and the outcome  
is a pathetic commentary on Independent Counsel David Barrett's 
judgment in pursuing this matter,'' Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Levin, who has introduced legislation that would  
significantly reshape the 1978 law, ``Mr. Barrett owes an 
explanation to the public for this fiasco where an 18-count felony 
indictment dissolved into one 'mouse-demeanor.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Former federal prosecutor E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., who is now a  
Washington defense lawyer, was equally critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first victim of any independent counsel investigation is  
perspective,'' Barcella said. ``You take otherwise well-trained 
lawyers, you focus them on one person and one alleged crime and the 
crime takes on proportions far out of line to what it ought to -- 
and so does the target.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a classic example where a regular U.S. attorney with a  
full caseload would have been able to evaluate this case in a 
matter of weeks and see what it was worth,'' Barcella said. ``It 
was only ever worth not much more than a misdemeanor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros was indicted in December 1997 -- along with ex-lover  
Linda Jones and two aides -- in a 21-count indictment charging that 
the four conspired during his consideration for a Clinton Cabinet 
post to conceal from the FBI the scope of his financial support for 
Ms. Jones after their extramarital affair ended. All four pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing in court Tuesday, Cisneros admitted he falsely told  
the FBI that he had never paid Ms. Jones more than $2,500 monthly. 
He gave her more than $250,000 between 1989 and 1994, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept responsibility for the conduct as outlined,'' the  
former San Antonio mayor said, later releasing a prepared statement 
in which he added, ``I regret my lack of candor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett declined to discuss the prosecution with reporters. But  
in a statement, he took pains to justify his investigation's 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``This disposition should in no way be viewed as minimizing the  
serious ethical breach by Mr. Cisneros,'' Barrett said. ``However, 
a just disposition of any prosecution must include an evaluation of 
the defendant's overall conduct. In this case, the conduct, while 
egregious, was committed by a person whose life has been otherwise 
dedicated to public service, and this fact must season the final 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The presiding judge, U.S. Stanley Sporkin, defended Barrett's  
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there will be some second-guessing about this plea,''  
he said. ``There will be some who will say that the sanction is not 
tough enough and others who will say here is more evidence of the 
Independent Counsel Act as not serving the public interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``we cannot permit an individual to lie his way into high  
public office,'' Sporkin said. ``The work of the independent 
counsel in this case reaffirms the importance of telling the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett also prosecuted Ms. Jones, whose earlier immunity deal  
was revoked after she was found to have lied to prosecutors. 
Barrett prosecuted two of her family members as well. Ms. Jones was 
sentenced last year to 3 1/2 years in prison, pleading guilty to 
conspiracy, bank fraud, money laundering and obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Barrett decided not to prosecute the two Cisneros  
aides. And Tuesday, he dismissed the two remaining felony counts 
pending against Ms. Jones under the 1997 indictment.

<HEADLINE> Athletes' Injuries May Harm Thinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Teens might have impaired thinking years later if  
they receive two or more significant blows to the head on the 
playing field, a new study indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major public health issue that has been given short  
shrift,'' said Michael W. Collins, a neuropsychologist at Henry 
Ford Health System in Detroit, a lead author of one of six articles 
on brain injury in today's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	A second study revealed that nearly 63,000 high school athletes  
a year suffer mild concussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people still believe that a concussion means getting  
knocked out, Collins said. But a concussion is any alteration in 
mental function after a blow to the head. Signs or symptoms may be 
subtle -- a headache, dizziness, difficulty with balance or memory, 
confusion or a personality change. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of how often such episodes occur among high schoolers  
did not explore the long-term effects, but only the rates of 
concussion in football, wrestling, soccer, basketball, softball, 
baseball, field hockey and volleyball at 235 high schools 
nationwide from 1995-96 through 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 1,219 concussions -- 63 percent of them in football --  
and 99 students suffered two or more, said researchers led by John 
W. Powell, a professor of kinesiology and an athletic trainer at 
Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers estimated that more than 62,800 concussions  
occur among high school students nationwide annually in the sports 
they studied. 
</P>
<P>
	It has long been known that multiple mild concussions are more  
likely than a single episode to lead to long-term problems, and 
Collins tried to measure the difference in his study. 
</P>
<P>
	His research involved 393 college football players and found  
that about one in three had suffered a concussion at some time in 
the past and one in five had suffered two or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who had suffered two or more were significantly more  
likely to report continuing problems with headaches, sleep and 
concentration, and they scored significantly worse on 
paper-and-pencil tests of the ability to learn words, to think 
quickly and to handle complex tasks. A complex task in the real 
world would be cooking a big Thanksgiving dinner, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Players who had learning disorders -- 13.5 percent of the sample  
-- fared even worse if they had two or more concussions, suggesting 
that the disorders make the brain especially vulnerable to jarring 
injuries. About 12 percent of all collegians have learning 
disorders, research has shown. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they have a learning disability, if they have one  
concussion, you should be a lot more cautious in returning them to 
game conditions and practices after their first concussion,'' said 
an expert not involved in the studies, Dr. Jeffrey T. Barth, chief 
of medical psychology and neuropsychology at the University of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the research on the prevalence of concussions among high  
school students confirms previous work but is by far the largest 
study, and it highlights a problem that ``has been kind of ignored 
over the years.'' Most emphasis on managing concussion has been at 
college and pro levels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal research suggests the youthful brain remains vulnerable  
after a first concussion for a longer time than a mature brain 
does, so a high school athlete may need a much longer recovery time 
from a concussion before returning to play than a college player or 
a pro, Barth said. 
</P>
<P>
	A third article in the journal reported that amateur soccer  
players scored lower on tests of memory and planning than other 
amateur athletes did, and that repeated blows to the head may be 
the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	While some research has implicated ``heading'' the ball, Barth  
and other experts believe the more likely explanation is the 
frequent collisions between players and players' heads hitting the 
ground or a goalpost.

<HEADLINE> On The Lam, Frankel Lived Simply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Though he had amassed a fortune, rogue  
financier Martin Frankel didn't live like a millionaire during his 
four months on the lam. Mostly he secluded himself at modest 
European lodgings and watched movie videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Sought by the FBI in an international manhunt, Frankel evaded  
early capture by traveling under an alias with a counterfeit 
British passport. 
</P>
<P>
	But once settled in Rome and later in Hamburg, Frankel didn't  
try too hard to conceal himself, venturing out to eat in local 
restaurants with the women who accompanied him on his flight and 
making numerous phone calls to associates and lawyers back in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, Frankel -- whose casual demeanor charmed investors  
-- was able to slip past authorities chasing him on charges of money 
laundering and wire fraud. The man who was said to have met 
numerous women through personal ads traveled at times with 
companions who didn't even know he was on the run. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke rising from Frankel's Connecticut mansion signaled the  
collapse of his empire, built by allegedly swindling clients out of 
at least $218 million, possibly much more. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time authorities arrived to investigate the flames --  
discovering a fireplace and file cabinet full of burning documents 
-- Frankel had begun his life on the run. That was May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two women who disappeared with Frankel, Mona Kim, said  
they left the country the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim had worked as Frankel's business manager, but at first was  
unaware of the trouble he was in -- or that he was the target of an 
international manhunt, her lawyer Keith Rubenstein contends. 
</P>
<P>
	After two nights in a Rome hotel, Kim said they moved to a small  
apartment in a residential neighborhood. ``The places they stayed 
in were pretty simple,'' said Rubenstein. ``Nothing you'd think 
that a man of his wealth was accustomed to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel didn't visit Rome's attractions; his main form of  
amusement was watching rented videotapes in his hotel room -- 
including ``Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead,'' ``Heat'' and 
``Seven Years in Tibet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Days were spent making phone calls to Frankel's lawyers and  
associates back in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always paranoid, but he would go out in the open,'' Kim  
said by telephone from New York. ``We tried not to go to tourist 
areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much has been made about Frankel's reported food obsessions, but  
Kim said he wasn't strict about his diet and didn't keep Kosher, 
although he has requested Kosher food in his Hamburg jail. The only 
eccentricity he exhibited was an insistence on bottled Evian water. 
</P>
<P>
	Only after she read accounts of the search for Frankel on the  
Internet and in newspapers did Kim decide to return home to a New 
York City suburb, leaving on June 26. She has agreed to cooperate 
with authorities, and has retained Rubenstein to represent her. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sad to see her go, but didn't try to keep her there,''  
Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian police have launched an investigation into any possible  
crimes during Frankel's stay, but police official Giovanna Petrocca 
said they have little information on Frankel's activities in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's next known stop was Hamburg, Germany's second-largest  
city with 1.7 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's German lawyer, Thomas Piplak, said the choice was  
``accidental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He just wanted to be in Europe,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Hamburg, Frankel checked into the stately Hotel Prem along  
the banks of the Alster River. The hotel has the air of seclusion 
in a large city and prides itself on a discreet staff. 
</P>
<P>
	In cosmopolitan Hamburg, an American on holiday would hardly be  
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel brought a new companion to Hamburg, 35-year-old Cynthia  
Allison, who checked the couple into the Prem under her alias Susan 
Kelly for a two-month stay. They reportedly paid cash in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say there are varying reports as to whether  
Frankel ventured out on the town or spent most of his time indoors 
in his fourth-floor suite overlooking a garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple reportedly ordered most of their meals from the  
hotel's La Mer seafood restaurant, a favorite among locals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 135-pound Frankel attracted little attention in the  
neighborhood. However, a clerk at the Feinkost Laeufer grocery 
recalls a woman matching Allison's description -- redheaded and 
heavy-set -- came in three or four times. Her purchases didn't stand 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't champagne or caviar,'' said the clerk, who asked not  
to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	A waitress at the Kajuete restaurant across from the hotel  
recalled a couple matching Frankel's and Allison's descriptions ate 
there frequently in July. On their last visit, they had suitcases 
with them, said the waitress, who also did not want to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the FBI's search -- at first encompassing southeast  
Asia, Brazil and Italy -- was narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've taken us all around the world,'' said FBI Assistant  
Director Tom Pickard. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI and Internal Revenue Service investigators were following  
Frankel through his bank and credit card accounts, and watching the 
behavior of his friends and associates. There were plenty of dead 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, a tip last week placed them in Hamburg, where German  
federal police and an FBI legal assistant arrested Frankel and 
Allison in their room. 
</P>
<P>
	He was found with a ``mountain of records,'' said Pickard, along  
with computer files, fake passports and diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were receipts from his travels. Frankel was the type  
who saved everything, Pickard said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	From a mansion, to modest hotels, to a prison cell, Frankel now  
awaits extradition to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Piplak described his client as nervous and agitated, pacing  
around the room looking out the window during a half-hour visit 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has requested a social worker to talk to about the rules  
in German prisons and his situation in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Piplak said he asked Frankel if he wanted to see a psychiatrist.  
``Will he give me any drugs?'' he said a worried Frankel responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Extradition could be decided next week -- or take months if  
Frankel decides to fight it based on concerns for his security in a 
U.S. prison. Frankel has not yet made a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Piplak said he plans to give Frankel a  
German-English dictionary when he visits Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to know what's around him,'' Piplak said.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 7  
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald, on extra welfare money saved:  
</P>
<P>
	Congress wants to get its hands on the millions that the states  
have saved as their welfare rolls decline. It hasn't said so 
outright, but just wait -- the signs are clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The states, Florida chief among them, have played by the feds'  
rules and created programs that have moved millions of women from 
welfare to work. ... 
</P>
<P>
	There has been an almost-commensurate drop -- 59 percent -- in  
cash-assistance expenditures: In September 1996, the state paid 
$53,347,614 -- that's in one month alone. Last month, it paid out 
$21,931,253. 
</P>
<P>
	Where have the savings gone? The state WAGES Board, which  
oversees Florida's welfare-reform efforts, wisely has put $350 
million in reserves in case these good economic times don't roll 
forever. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress has dollar signs in its eyes. It now has placed  
restraints on how the states can use that money, mandating that all 
of it go for cash assistance -- otherwise they lose it. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It should resist that temptation and trust the states to do the  
right thing. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 3  
</P>
<P>
	The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch, on experiments in alternative  
education: 
</P>
<P>
	Five experiments in alternative education are beginning in  
Columbus and their successes, or even failures, could do much to 
improve the level of learning in central Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	These experiments are charter schools, nonreligious public  
schools that operate independently of the local district. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Ohio lawmakers authorized such schools in an effort to  
open public education to innovative approches and create 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But the five charter schools will be under a microscope the  
moment they open their doors. Opponents will be waiting to leap on 
every problem, big or small, to argue that the experiment is a 
failure. Some of the charter schools may flunk their test. That 
will be a momentary setback for the students enrolled there, but 
good for education in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	From such failures, educators and the public will learn what  
doesn't work, which will help everyone focus in on what does. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 5  
</P>
<P>
	The Duncan (Okla.) Banner, on Bush's stand on schools:  
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is running as GOP candidate for  
president, wants to take money away from the schools that need it 
and give it to the schools that don't. 
</P>
<P>
	His target is the Title I program, which provides $7.7 billion  
to the neediest schools to educate the poor children in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's plan would require these schools to test the students on  
basic academics each year. If no progress is shown after three 
years, the money would be taken away from the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The confiscated Title I money would be matched with other  
federal education money and placed in education accounts -- about 
$1,500 a year for each affected student. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents then get to choose how to spend the money -- for  
example, keep it and their children in the existing school, use it 
to secure the services of a tutor, or send the kids to private 
schools. ... 
</P>
<P>
	On the face of it, this looks like a good idea.  
</P>
<P>
	But a private school recovers its costs through charging tuition  
and other fees. How are poor people going to be able to pay for 
this if they're barely getting by as it is? ... 
</P>
<P>
	It would be more sensible to develop new programs at the at-risk  
schools that actually work -- and provide funding for them. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 7  
</P>
<P>
	Springfield (Mo.) News-Leader, on educational accountability:  
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush offered a new idea on educational  
accountability that is at least worth discussing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's proposal goes well beyond the tired idea of offering  
vouchers to any parent who wants them. That approach favors 
wealthier families who can bridge the difference between the amount 
of the voucher and the cost of a private school. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush instead would tie federal support for schools to their  
performance. If a school receiving Title I money showed improved 
student achievement on test scores, it would continue to get the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	But if students showed no progress over three years, the school  
would lose the money. The federal government would match the Title 
I money with other federal education money and give it to the 
state, which would set up an education account of about $1,500 a 
year for each affected student. Parents could keep the money and 
their child in the original school, or they could use it for a 
private school or tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
	This focuses attention where it needs to be: poor performing  
schools in low-economic areas. A good school can help people rise 
above their circumstances; a bad one sentences them to another 
generation of poverty. Giving those schools an incentive to improve 
simply makes sense. Continuing to fund failure is foolish. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Bush's idea the best incentive? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But at  
least it moves the voucher and accountability debate in the 
direction it needs to go. 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 8  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Times, on Cisneros case:  
</P>
<P>
	Four years and $10 million later, an independent counsel's case  
against former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. 
Cisneros has ended with a misdemeanor plea bargain -- a whimper of a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Cisneros involved accusations that he lied  
to the FBI after his Cabinet nomination in 1992, admitting that he 
had paid money to former lover Linda Jones after their breakup but 
greatly understating the amount. Cisneros should have been fired 
when the discrepancy came to light in a suit filed against him by 
Jones. The payments, though not illegal, could very well have 
affected his confirmation to the Cabinet job. But the $10-million 
taxpayer-financed probe was ridiculous. The case collapsed 
altogether when Jones admitted editing the tapes she had made of 
her phone conversations with Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the failed two-bit bribery investigation of former  
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, the Cisneros case is more proof 
that Congress was right when it allowed the special prosecutor law 
to lapse in June. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 1  
</P>
<P>
	The Herald, Everett, Wash., on outdoor resources:  
</P>
<P>
	When members of Congress return to Washington, D.C. from their  
summer break, they should remember the places where they and so 
many people enjoy the beauty of this land. Senators and 
representatives then should keep a long-standing congressional 
promise by reviving federal support for outdoor recreational 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing couldn't be better. As Congress reconvenes soon, many  
Americans will have just returned from outdoor hikes, camping trips 
or sports activities over Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1964, Congress has earmarked $900 million per year from  
offshore-oil leases for purchasing land for trails and parks. But 
Congress also conveniently has shunted aside increasingly large 
amounts from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to other 
purposes. Worst of all, Congress has let critical federal 
matching-fund support for states' outdoor recreation purchases 
lapse completely. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a tragedy, especially for states like Washington, which  
wisely used its federal help to match local expenditures for 
everything from trails to sports fields. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 4.  
</P>
<P>
	The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on peace in Middle East:  
</P>
<P>
	Once again it has been demonstrated how vital U.S. diplomacy is  
in keeping the Middle East peace process moving. It wasn't until 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright came on the scene ... and 
began a round of intense shuttle diplomacy that stalled 
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians cranked up again. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Without U.S. involvement, Palestinian distrust of Israeli  
intentions -- heightened by former Israel Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu's duplicity -- makes progress toward a final settlement 
extremely difficult. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Undoubtedly, there will be more breakdowns in the future. The  
truly difficult decisions have yet to be tackled. The United States 
will be needed to help reach agreements on the thorny issues 
involving borders, recognition of a Palestinian state, the status 
of Jerusalem, the return of refugees and water rights, as well as 
access to the West Bank and Gaza. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Albright modestly described herself as ``just the  
handmaiden'' of the parties to the Wye agreement. Her role has been 
much more important than that. 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 3  
</P>
<P>
	The Clarksburg (W.Va.) Exponent-Telegram, on father-child  
relationships: 
</P>
<P>
	We're all experts at raising other people's kids. We know just  
exactly what little so-and-so needs and just exactly what his 
parents are doing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to raising our own children, however, even the  
most devoted parents among us have to admit (if we're honest with 
ourselves) that we do many, many things wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	We also have to admit that even with the best of parental  
intentions and the best of parental efforts, children can end up on 
the destructive side of life. 
</P>
<P>
	We cannot guarantee happiness and success for our children. But  
there are things we can do to improve their chances. Specifically, 
there are things fathers can do, as a survey by the National Center 
on Addiction and Substance Abuse found. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the list: Work on having a decent relationship  
with your kids. 
</P>
<P>
	And it will be work. Despite our romantic visions of parenthood,  
raising kids involves conflict after conflict after conflict. 
Parents set limits, kids test them. That's the way it is. How 
parents and kids handle the conflicts is key to whether a family is 
healthy or unhealthy. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Fathers don't have to have a daily heart-to-heart with their  
kids. But they can talk to their kids. Ask them questions. Ask 
their opinion. Eat with them. Keep track of where they are and who 
they're with. In short, they can remember their kids need them. 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 7  
</P>
<P>
	The Guardian, London, on the euro:  
</P>
<P>
	Europe is emerging from recession and the euro has recovered  
some dignity. But it is vital to distinguish cause from effect. The 
economy of euroland is not recovering because of the success of the 
euro. Rather, a long delayed cyclical recovery is providing a 
better environment to be positive about it. ... Barring unforeseen 
circumstances, Europe is embarking on what could be a sustained 
recovery. There is positive evidence in Germany and France (helped 
by employment boosting measures) and even in Italy. Europe as a 
whole has a trade surplus (compared with a U.S. deficit of nearly 
$300 billion), very low inflation and a pool of 10 percent 
unemployed. ... If all goes well, Europe's economy could be 
expanding faster than that of the U.S. in 18 months time. It won't 
have much to do with the euro -- but it will provide fertile ground 
for claims that it has. 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 7  
</P>
<P>
	The Express, London, on East Timor:  
</P>
<P>
	The atrocities being perpetrated in East Timor rank alongside  
those of Kosovo. Hundreds are being killed and thousands forced 
from their homes, yet the world is turning its back. ... Every hour 
the international community stands idly by, more people lose their 
lives. Indonesia hoped a referendum in East Timor would garner 
international support and improve its dismal human rights 
reputation. But its army's passive support for the pro-Jakarta 
militia is less impressive, and more crucially, means no one on the 
ground is holding the violence in check. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the world cannot leave this country to such a fate.  
East Timor desperately needs the calming influence of a 
peacekeeping force and Indonesia clearly isn't about to restore 
order. 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 6  
</P>
<P>
	Die Welt, Hamburg, Germany, on East Timor:  
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations have a choice in East Timor: March in the  
troops or a humanitarian disaster. Tragic that Indonesia's new 
president, who rang in East Timor's freedom, has to pay for the 
militia terror, for an heir of the homogeneous Suharto regime. And 
East Timor is only one conflict among many in a nation of chaos and 
crumbling. The UNO naively handed over the protection for the 
people of East Timor to the state. Now it faces the danger of joint 
responsibility for murders, because it rejected the security of the 
people through neutral troops. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. troops mean a capitulation for Indonesia. Even more. The  
Indonesian faithful fear an Asian Kosovo, the late revenge of the 
Timoren against their Indonesian torturers. ... The UNO awakened 
the hopes of the Timoren, now they must be fulfilled. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 7  
</P>
<P>
	Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Zurich, Switzerland, on East Timor:  
</P>
<P>
	Killing reigns in East Timor. A bloody hunt for those who voted  
for the territory's independence from Indonesia has started up. ... 
</P>
<P>
	What was previously feared has now become brutally clear. The  
conditions necessary for holding a referendum never existed, 
because those who are unprepared to give up East Timor under any 
circumstances have the whip hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's security forces, the still-intact central pillar of  
the Suharto dictatorship, provide the support for their power. 
</P>
<P>
	In its commitment to a referendum, the United Nations too  
willingly let itself be led by its expectation that a new 
democratic Indonesia could quickly be built from the ruins of the 
collapsed autocratic order. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign military intervention and the deployment of an  
international peacekeeping force are at the moment probably the 
only practical answer to the referendum debacle. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 7  
</P>
<P>
	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on East Timor:  
</P>
<P>
	The bloodshed is not the result of clashes between pro- and  
anti-independence militia. Instead, pro-Indonesia thugs are 
indiscriminately attacking residents who yearn for independence and 
peace. The situation is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Do pro-Indonesia forces plan to promote anarchy in East Timor in  
the interim so that the National Assembly will reject autonomy? Or 
are the armed gunmen trying to provoke pro-autonomy military forces 
in East Timor to start a civil war as a ploy to convince 
Indonesia's presidential candidates to renounce independence for 
East Timor? 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. announcement of the referendum results signifies that  
the process leading to East Timorese independence is irreversible. 
The focus has now shifted to finding a way to make the transition 
period as smooth as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Many immigrants from Indonesia will remain in East Timor after  
the island acquires autonomy, and East Timor's geographical and 
economic ties to Indonesia will not be severed. Therefore, it is in 
Indonesia's interest to maintain friendly relations with East 
Timor. The Indonesian government must immediately suppress the 
reign of terror in East Timor and close the curtains on its more 
than two decades of rule there. 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 8  
</P>
<P>
	Haaretz, Tel Aviv, Israel, on car bombings:  
</P>
<P>
	Two car bombs that exploded in (the northern Israeli cities of)  
Haifa and Tiberias aimed to kill large numbers of Jews just after 
the signing of the Sharm el Sheikh (Israeli-Palestinian peace) 
agreement. The identity of those perpetrators (as Israeli Arabs), 
along with the suspicion that the attacks were plotted by an 
Israeli Arab group just one week after the murder of two hikers 
near Megiddo by an Israeli Arab ... may direct an accusing finger 
... at the nation's entire Arab population. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arab minority's leadership ... has condemned the car  
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	The two attacks, along with the killing near Megiddo, do not  
constitute a phenomenon, but ... the Arab leadership in Israel is 
not exempt from investigating how and why the ground was paved for 
these attacks to be planned in Israeli Arab communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab society in Israel is not on trial for these attacks and it  
need not speak in the killers' names. But it certainly must ensure 
that such killers do not find a supportive environment in its 
midst. 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 6  
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan Times, Amman, on Palestinian-Israeli agreement:  
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians and Israelis have finally succeeded in  
stitching together a new agreement that would outline the framework 
for the implementation of the `old' Wye River memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
	In essence, the new accord is a new version of Wye and purports  
to pin down the exact procedure and detailed mechanics for the 
faithful implementation of the revised Wye River pact and lay the 
groundwork for the final status talks. 
</P>
<P>
	With the signing of this new deal in Sharm El Sheikh ... in the  
presence of King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and 
Secretary Albright, both Barak, Arafat are now more committed than 
ever to proceed at full speed to bring the entire Palestine-Israel 
negotiations to early fruition. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the region is entering a new era thanks in no small part  
to the determined and persistent efforts of Washington, with 
Albright removing the remaining knots and the vital involvement of 
Mubarak in all the phases of talks between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Still there is no certainty of the future since the parties have  
signed so many accords only to see them frozen. Let's hope that 
this time Israel puts its money where its mouth is. 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 8  
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times, Singapore, on Palestinian-Israeli agreement:  
</P>
<P>
	The new peace deal between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and  
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat revises the Wye River 
land-for-security accord which had stalled as a result of the 
obstinacy of the previous Israeli premier. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Mr. Barak's predecessor, progress on the Wye accord  
remained impossible; by contrast, the new Premier has used his 
power to move decisively on the details, which are what matter 
ultimately. 
</P>
<P>
	The car bomb explosions in Israel that greeted the signing of  
the accord were the latest in a long string of expressions of 
defiance by opponents of the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of adopting the previous government's hawkish stand on  
acts of violence committed by Arabs, he (Barak) refused to accuse 
the Palestinian Authority of failing to curb anti-Israeli attacks 
and insisted, instead, that peacemaking would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Barak is strengthened by his victory sufficiently not to  
need to play up public insecurities. In him, Israel has a leader 
who is secure enough to look for peace with security.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Trust Counts in Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leo Duroucher may have thought that ``nice  
guys finish last,'' but Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
begs to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without mutual trust and market participants abiding by a rule  
of law, no economy can prosper. Our system works fundamentally on 
individual fair dealing,'' Greenspan said in a speech in Grand 
Rapids, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Fed, returning to a theme he first raised in  
a commencement address in June at Harvard, stressed that the need 
for integrity in business dealings might appear to run counter to 
popularly held opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not deny that many in our society appear to have  
succeeded in a material way by cutting corners and manipulating 
associates, both in their professional lives and personal lives,'' 
Greenspan said in a speech to the Gerald R. Ford Foundation.

	But he said no economy can function properly if dishonesty is  
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trust is at the root of any economic system based on mutually  
beneficial exchange,'' Greenspan said in his remarks, which were 
released in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``In virtually all transactions, we rely on the word of those  
with whom we do business,'' Greenspan said. ``If a significant 
number of business people violated the trust upon which our 
interactions are based, our court system and our economy would be 
swamped into immobility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his Harvard address, Greenspan told the graduates that ``your  
success in life and the success of our country is going to depend 
on integrity and other qualities of character.'' He urged them to 
resist the temptation to cut corners in their professional lives. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks in Michigan, Greenspan said, ``It is decidedly  
not true that 'nice guys finish last,' as that highly original 
baseball philosopher, Leo Durocher, was once alleged to have 
said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said it is critically important that ``all Americans  
believe that they are part of a system they perceive as fair and 
worthy of their support.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Russian Financial Scandals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here is a partial list of recent financial scandals involving  
Russia: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Several Russians have been linked to an alleged  
money-laundering scheme at the Bank of New York, where $10 billion 
or more may have passed through accounts illegally, according to 
U.S. newspaper reports. The bank has fired two employees and 
suspended a third, all of Russian origin, but so far no one has 
been charged with a crime. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Swiss and Russian prosecutors have been investigating whether  
the Swiss firm Mabetex paid millions of dollars in kickbacks in 
connection with a contract to renovate the Kremlin. According to 
newspaper reports, a senior Kremlin official received more than $1 
million, and subsequently made the money available to President 
Boris Yeltsin and his family. The Kremlin has said that Yeltsin did 
nothing wrong. Swiss prosecutors have asked Swiss banks to freeze 
assets of more than 20 people suspected in the case, including 
several members of Yeltsin's administration. No one has been 
charged. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Russia's Central Bank moved large sums to a secret bank  
account on Britain's Channel Islands in the mid-1990s. The bank 
said it wanted to hide the money from foreign creditors who might 
try to seize Russian assets. The bank says no money was 
misappropriated, but critics say there's no information on what 
happened to the profits from the investments. No one has been 
charged. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Swiss prosecutors have also been investigating Russian tycoon  
Boris Berezovsky and his involvement in the finances of the Russian 
airline Aeroflot, headed by Yeltsin's son-in-law, Valery Okulov. 
Russian prosecutors issued a warrant for Berezovsky's arrest in 
April on charges of hiding Aeroflot's hard currency earnings in 
Swiss firms. The warrant was dropped, but Russian officials said 
they are still investigating.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Up Slightly / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices edged higher Wednesday but  
interest rate jitters persisted in credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were unsettled by a surprise interest rate increase by  
Britain's central bank and by comments from Laurence Meyer, a 
Federal Reserve governor, repeating warnings that a tight labor 
market poses an inflationary threat. But there was relief in bond 
markets when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made no 
comments about interest rates during a speech in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32  
point, or 93 3/4 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, slipped just below Tuesday's late 
rate of 6.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up 1/32 point, and  
intermediate maturities were up 1/32 point to 1/8 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.81 percent as the  
discount fell 0.04 percentage point from Tuesday's auction to 4.68 
percent. Six-month yields were 5.14 percent, as the discount fell 
0.01 percentage point from the weekly auction to 4.94 percent. 
One-year yields were 5.24 percent as the discount rose by 0.01 
percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.98 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.12 1/2 percent from 5.31 1/4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/16 to 114 3/32. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged at 5.80 percent.

<HEADLINE> Congress Returns to Full Work Load </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Congress returned to  
work on Wednesday, tugged by conflicting forces of compromise and 
confrontation with the White House on tax cuts, spending, health 
care, gun control and other issues likely to dominate the final 
months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any indication the president wants to work with  
us,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. told reporters 
after smilingly predicting an ``action-packed'' September and 
October. ``What the president wants is more spending, more 
spending, more spending for everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle sounded only slightly less  
pessimistic about the prospects for compromise. He said he had 
talked with Lott and he expressed the hope they could work 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he quickly added, ``Clearly we (Democrats) will fight and  
we will aggressively pursue'' an agenda that include gun control, 
education, legislation relating to HMOs, an increase in the minimum 
wage and money for hard-hit farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides immediately began jockeying for position on  
education. Daschle, D-S.D., listed the issue as part of the 
Democrats' fall agenda, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert traveled 
to an elementary school to underscore Republican support. There, he 
issued a call to President Clinton to ``work together in education. 
Let's take steps today that will make our nation's schools 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, too, talked of compromise during the day, at the same  
time he prodded Republicans to move legislation on health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since we've had this divided government, we normally have  
to wait till the 11th hour for really good things to happen. ... As 
I said a couple of days ago, it is now 10:30, we're ready for the 
11th hour,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like students returning from a long summer break, lawmakers were  
slow to settle down to their duties -- and there was a surprise or 
two. Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., arguably the Senate most liberal 
lawmaker, was indisputably the only bearded one after a month away 
from Washington spent letting his whiskers grow. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate both spent the day debating routine  
spending measures during the day, preludes to larger clashes 
looming just over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said that tax cut legislation approved before Congress'  
break would go to the White House next week for its threatened 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's rejection of the measure will present Republicans with  
an important decision: whether to set the issue aside until next 
year's election campaign or attempt to work out a compromise that 
also would cover issues as diverse as spending and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert has not signaled a firm view on the issue, but key  
senators have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can wait 14 months, get a new president and then do a tax  
cut,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, who 
opposes attempting to work out a compromise with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat, Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana, spoke out in favor  
of bipartisanship. ``I don't see why there isn't room for 
compromise. If the president can get a real Medicare reform bill 
with a strong prescription drug ingredient, hopefully there would 
be flexibility for some kind of targeted tax cut,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no doubt that compromise eventually would emerge on  
spending measures because Congress must provide money for federal 
agencies and programs for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Only 
one of the 13 required bills has passed, and Republicans also must 
decide how to squeeze the votes out for passage of the measures, 
given the constraints imposed by spending caps set in the 1997 
balanced budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the prospect was for confrontation this fall, with  
an uncertain outcome: 
</P>
<P>
	--The health care measure that Clinton campaigned for during the  
day enjoyed bipartisan support in the House, with debate expected 
by the end of the month. The GOP leadership opposes its provision 
granting patients the right to sue their insurance companies. The 
Senate has passed its own version of the measure that Clinton has 
rejected as too weak. 
</P>
<P>
	--Several months after the shootings at Columbine High School in  
Colorado, gun control issues were being thrashed out in compromise 
talks between the House and Senate. The Senate approved provisions 
to expand background checks for sales at gun shows, to ban certain 
high capacity ammunition clips and to require the sale of safety 
decides with handguns. The House killed all three provisions, and 
given the differences, prospects for a legislation on the issue 
seemed dim. 
</P>
<P>
	--Senate Democrats are eager to try and attach a minimum wage  
increase to legislation that Republicans have crafted to overhaul 
the nation's bankruptcy laws, and the issue appears to enjoy 
substantial support. But one Republican aide, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said it was possible a GOP senator might 
try to pre-empt the Democrats and bring up the issue first. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Republicans favor so-called ``lockbox'' legislation to  
safeguard Social Security receipts. Senate Democrats have 
objections to the measure as drafted, and Lott indicated during the 
day he would bring the issue up on the Senate floor in the next 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The House is scheduled to debate campaign finance legislation  
next week that would ban the use of so-called soft money, which are 
unlimited campain donations sought by both political parties. The 
measure is likely to pass, setting the stage for a GOP filibuster 
when the issue comes up in the Senate next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Spain, Norway and Sweden celebrated gaining places  
in next summer's European Championship finals on Wednesday, World 
Cup champion France clung onto hopes of qualifying and England 
looked down and out. 
</P>
<P>
	Upset 3-2 by Cyprus a year ago, the Spaniards made sure of  
gaining a place in the 16 qualifiers by racing to a 5-0 halftime 
lead on the way to an 8-0 victory. Ismael Urzaiz and Julen Guerrero 
had three goals apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway crushed second-place Slovenia 4-0 to clinch the top spot  
in Group 2 while Sweden did the bare minimum, a 1-0 victory at 
Luxembourg, to clinch Group 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Romania tied Portugal 1-1 and, with a game against Liechtenstein  
to come, is almost certain to qualify as Group 7 winner. Even with 
a loss, it would likely make it as the best runnerup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic had already qualified to join co-hosts  
Belgium and the Netherlands and made it a championship-record nine 
straight victories by downing Bosnia 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy lost 3-2 at home to Denmark, blowing a 2-0 lead after 34  
minutes. Instead of qualifying, Italy now must fight it out for the 
top spot. If the teams finish even, Denmark would advance by virtue 
of its victory and Italy would go into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's 4-0 victory over Northern Ireland made it the likely  
winner of Group 3. Turkey, Germany's biggest rival, managed only a 
1-1 tie with Moldova and needs to beat the Germans in Munich Oct. 9 
to top the group. 
</P>
<P>
	France stayed in contention with a 3-2 victory over lightly  
regarded Armenia. The Armenians stunned the mighty Frenchman, who 
are fourth in Group 4, by going ahead 1-0. A penalty kick by Youri 
Djorkaeff and goals by Zinedine Zidane and Lilian Laslandes turned 
the game around for France. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine, which won 1-0 at Iceland, and Russia, which downed  
Andorra 2-1, lead the group. 
</P>
<P>
	England had David Batty sent off near the end in a grim 0-0 tie  
with Poland in Warsaw, its final game. Poland needs only a tie in 
its final game against Sweden to clinch a playoff spot and put 
England out. Niclas Alexandersson scored the only goal for Sweden 
in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia leads Group 8 after a 4-2 victory over Macedonia  
helped by a goal after only 12 seconds by Savo Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland, which downed Malta 3-2, and idle Croatia, which slipped  
from first to third with one game to play, are a point behind 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel stayed in contention for a spot behind Spain with an 8-0  
defeat of San Marino. The result followed a 3-2 upset loss to 
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE>  McEnroe Appointed Davis Cup Captain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John McEnroe's campaign to lead the Davis Cup  
team finally succeeded today when he was appointed captain by the 
U.S. Tennis Association. 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeds Tom Gullikson, who held the post for six years and  
took much of the blame for the loss to Australia in the Davis Cup 
quarterfinals in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted to do it for a long time,'' McEnroe said.  
``Everybody knows that. This time it feels right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	USTA president Judy Levering said she had consulted with Pete  
Sampras, Andre Agassi and other top American players before making 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all said they would like to play for John McEnroe,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, an ardent Davis Cup fan, played on championship teams  
in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1992. He said that as captain, and 
despite being 40 years old, he would still consider playing Davis 
Cup doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be easier to be picked than to pick yourself,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe said he hoped Sampras and Agassi, who came into the U.S.  
Open ranked Nos. 1 and 2, would lead the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson was criticized for using Jim Courier and Todd Martin  
in singles while Sampras was relegated to doubles against the 
Australians. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe had wanted to play doubles this year against the  
Australians in Brookline, Mass., but Gullikson did not place him on 
the team.

<HEADLINE> Affleck Refutes Rumors He's Gay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ben Affleck says there is absolutely no truth to  
tabloid gossip that he and Matt Damon are more than friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to think that if I were gay I would be out. Rupert  
Everett-style,'' Affleck said in the October issue of Vanity Fair. 
Everett is an openly gay actor. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie ``Good Will Hunting,'' which boyhood buddies Affleck  
and Damon co-wrote and starred in, probably helped fuel the rumors, 
he said. Affleck said he also has a limited capacity for compromise 
and for now lacks the willingness to put his energy into a romantic 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I'm single is because I wouldn't want to be with  
anybody right now who would be willing to be with me,'' Affleck 
told the magazine.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, Softbank Invest in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Global Crossing took another step in its plan to  
build a worldwide fiber-optic network, announcing a new venture in 
Asia with support from global technology giants Microsoft Corp. and 
Softbank. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11,000-mile web of land and undersea cables will connect in  
Japan to Global Crossing's trans-Pacific links with the United 
States and its fiber networks in the Americas and Europe, creating 
an Asian network for high-speed Internet, voice and video 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and Softbank, an early investor in Yahoo! and other  
hugely successful Internet ventures, will each contribute $175 
million in cash to the $1.28 billion project. The companies also 
committed to buy a combined $200 million worth of network capacity 
from Global Crossing over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing's stock has lost more than half of its value  
since May, hit hard by a blowout in Wall Street's Internet rally 
and concerns about how much a price war in long distance rates will 
hurt merger partner Frontier Corp. Global Crossing was forced to 
renegotiate that merger last week, increasing the amount of stock 
it will pay for Frontier, which also owns a fiber-optic network in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment by Microsoft, meanwhile, was the latest bid by  
the software maker to ensure its place as the Internet becomes a 
venue for telephone calls and television in addition to data 
traffic, e-mail and Web surfing. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Microsoft invested $5 billion in AT&AMP;T, which  
plans to provide various telecommunications services over the cable 
TV networks it recently acquired. As part of the deal, Microsoft 
will provide software for set-top boxes deployed in parts of the 
AT&AMP;T cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference Wednesday, Global Crossing officials  
repeatedly stressed the growth potential of the Asian economy, 
which has been recovering from last year's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asia has half of the world's population and is the fastest  
growing region in the world, but it's telecom infrastructure has 
just not kept up,'' said Gary Winnick, founder and co-chairman of 
Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to capitalize on an early start in such a huge market and  
Wall Street's hearty appetite for Internet-related ventures, the 
partners said they would likely sell stock in Asia Global Crossing 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bermuda-based Global Crossing will initially hold a 93 percent  
stake in the venture. Microsoft and Softbank will each own an 
initial stake of 3.5 percent, but those stakes will expand if the 
market value of Asia Global Crossing exceeds $5 billion, reaching 
as much as 19 percent if the venture's worth tops $7.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing will give the new venture its development rights  
in the Asia-Pacific region and its 57.75 percent share of Pacific 
Crossing 1, a separate partnership that's building a 13,000-mile 
network under the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Scanlon, vice chairman of Global Crossing, will be chief  
executive of Asia Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Asian network, which will be built in two phases, would  
connect Japan, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, 
Malaysia and the Philippine. The first 6,300 miles of cable are 
expected to be ready by December 2000, and the remainder about a 
half year later. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners hope to expand the network to Thailand and  
Indonesia down the road.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Could Turn to Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- After centuries of colonial misrule  
and 25 years of Indonesian corruption, East Timor is one of the 
poorest parts of Southeast Asia. But with proven oil and gas 
reserves, a growing coffee industry and strong tourism potential, 
it could be an economically viable independent nation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. companies like Starbucks Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co.  
already have an interest in the region, but experts say East 
Timor's war-devastated economy will be dependent on foreign aid for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The future of independence is threatened by violence and the  
half-island territory is in disarray.	   ''Reconstruction efforts will require foreign assistance for a 
number of years,'' predicted Jacqueline Pomeroy, a World Bank 
specialist on East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no estimates are available of the damage done to East  
Timor's economic infrastructure by rampaging anti-independence 
militias and Indonesian army troops, it is likely to run in the 
hundreds of millions of dollars. More than half of this year's 
bumper coffee crop may not get to market. 
</P>
<P>
	At the best of times, East Timor's per capita gross national  
product -- about $150 a year -- was among the lowest in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of its 850,000 people are involved in some way  
in agriculture, most of them as subsistence farmers in the coastal 
plains that surround the central mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
	Although rice and corn are grown, and the province is largely  
self-sufficient in beef and fruits and vegetables, the only real 
export is coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of organically grown Arabica beans to the United States  
and other Western countries were soaring and some estimates pegged 
exports at more than $30 million this year, a substantial sum in an 
economy generating only $130 million a year. Production of the 
mild-flavored, low-acidity coffee has rapidly risen from 5,000 tons 
in 1995 to an expected 12,000 tons this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the current crisis, tons of beans either are failing to  
reach the processing plant or are being left on trees, said George 
H. Willekes, president of Sparta, N.J.-based Holland Coffee Inc.. 
</P>
<P>
	The coffee bean wholesale business is a unit of a privately held  
Dutch holding company, the Holland Coffee Beheer BV, and had 
doubled its purchases of coffee beans from East Timor to close to 
$5 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Willekes said Wednesday that he had expected a bumper crop of  
$20 million to $25 million, but has since cut his estimate to $10 
million to $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The beans from East Timor are increasingly in demand. That's  
because the trees have not been exposed to pesticides or 
fertilizers as a result of years of neglect, said David Ray, an 
Indonesia expert at the Centre for Strategic Economic Studies at 
Australia's Victoria University. ``It now commands a premium on 
international markets as an organic coffee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Gulick, a spokesman for the Seattle-based Starbucks, said  
Timor coffee had improved significantly over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very stringent quality standards. One of the things,  
in every developing country that we do business in -- whenever we 
see high-quality coffee production like this we gladly support 
it,'' he said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray said there also is evidence of significant deposits of gold,  
manganese and marble in East Timor, although Indonesia has 
conducted little exploration during its rule. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ray predicted that tourism eventually would become East  
Timor's biggest earner of foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The territory offers stunning mountain vistas and a coastline  
with pristine beaches. In the past, human rights abuses by the 
Indonesian military have kept away foreign investments. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor's pro-independence leaders already have said they  
would seek to attract foreign investments and pledged to respect 
foreign ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor's greatest potential asset is a stretch of  
international waters between it and Australia known as the Timor 
Gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian officials say the region is one of the richest new  
energy-producing areas. East Timor would take over Indonesia's 
rights to the zone, now administered jointly by Canberra, 
Australia, and Jakarta, where royalties are split 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
	The area's major resource is natural gas. While East Timor would  
obviously profit from the willingness of companies to invest in its 
exploitation, serious difficulties have to be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The deposits lie so deep that it is questionable whether  
production would be economically justified. With prices low on 
international markets because of an oversupply of natural gas, 
there may not be an incentive for exploration and production soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips Oil Co. Australia, a unit of Bartlesville, Okla.-based  
Phillips Petroleum, now pumps 33,000 barrels of oil daily in the 
region and has a 50.3 percent interest in a natural gas field under 
development. Other investors in the gas project include Oklahoma 
City-based Kerr McGee Corp., at 11.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Weighs CBS-Viacom Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top communications regulator said  
Wednesday that consumer impact will be a principle concern when the 
proposed powerhouse merger between CBS and Viacom reaches federal 
regulators. Some lawmakers said they may hold hearings on the deal 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Bill Kennard and other Federal Communications  
Commission officials held court with the chief executives from the 
two companies, who were in town to sell the deal they announced 
Tuesday. The company officials also started to touch base with 
legislators on Capitol Hill to discuss the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard and the other FCC commissioners met with CBS President  
Mel Karmazin and Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone Wednesday morning. 
They were joined by several other company executives and lawyers, 
including attorney Dick Wiley, a former FCC chairman, commission 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, in a statement following the meetings, stressed that  
the proposed merger is not yet before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once it is, the essential question will be: How will this  
merger accelerate delivery of digital age services to all 
consumers?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC staff said the meetings mainly enabled the executives to  
brief regulators on their planned deal. According to one FCC 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, the executives did 
not make any specific requests or filing that dealt with federal 
restrictions that could make it difficult for the merger to go 
through without the company selling off some assets. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC regulations prevent broadcasters from operating television  
stations that reach more than 35 percent of the nation's home. CBS 
comes close to hitting this cap now, and company officials say the 
deal would give the new Viacom about 41 percent of the national 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Current FCC rules also forbid companies from owning two or more  
networks in certain combinations, a regulation that the CBS and 
Viacom, with its half-interest in the UPN television network, would 
fall under. 
</P>
<P>
	Two antitrust lawmakers said they are considering holding  
hearings on the matter, that may take place sometime this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, chairman of the Judiciary antitrust  
subcommittee, and its top Democrat, Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, 
said they need to look carefully at the merger, which would greatly 
bolster the new company's ``ability to influence the information 
delivered to consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kohl spokesman Todd Glass said members of the subcommittee and  
company officials have expressed their mutual interest in talking 
with each other in the near future, although no official meeting 
has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives also had requested an audience with Rep. Billy  
Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce telecommunications 
subcommittee, to brief him on the merger. Tauzin spokesman Ken 
Johnson said it was likely the congressman would talk with them 
soon, if not on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin believes the new company may have to spin off some of its  
television stations to satisfy federal ownership rules. He also 
predicted that regulatory obstacles limiting TV ownership would 
fall eventually, but not until local affiliates -- some of which 
oppose changing the rules -- and networks come together on a plan, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., expressed his concern that company  
leaders were meeting quietly with regulators and said that an issue 
of this magnitude merits an open meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``These issues are too important to be decided behind closed  
doors without meaningful public input,'' Wellstone said.

<HEADLINE> One's Weed Is Another's Wildflower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- A reader writes: ``I was weeding in my  
garden when it suddenly occurred to me that this is 90 percent of 
gardening -- weeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take weeds out by hand, I take them out chemically, I say  
nasty incantations over them, but they always win. I would love to 
know what works best. I'm interested in EXTERMINATION!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question, not an easy one, goes to the very core of  
gardening and its differing philosophies. There are people who even 
like weeding, relishing both the outdoor exercise and the result -- 
what seems to them a better-looking garden with each weed they zap. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are also those who like weeds, consider them  
ecologically important and love the butterflies and birds some of 
them attract. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the dandelion. Is it a weed? Is it a wildflower? Is it a  
vegetable? 
</P>
<P>
	To the devotee of velvety green lawns dandelions are an  
excrescence and he or she will go after them by hand, by herbicide, 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
	But others love the yellow blossoms brightening the landscape in  
early spring. In ``To the Dandelion,'' the 19th-century American 
poet, James Russell Lowell, said, ``Thou are more dear to me than 
all the prouder summer blooms may be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And to the salad lover, dandelions are a springtime delicacy  
packing an awesome powerhouse of vitamins, minerals, protein, 
fiber. And there is dandelion wine, too. 
</P>
<P>
	What is a weed? Author Jack Sanders, an expert on the subject,  
defines them ``not as pests, but as the most successful 
wildflowers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says ``weeds that are exceedingly common in field, lawn or  
garden are simply wildflowers that are able to adapt and survive 
better than others. Often, they are among the most highly evolved 
plants on the evolutionary scale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Be all that as it may, what are good ways of getting rid of  
plants you don't want in your garden? 
</P>
<P>
	Pulling them up by hand is clearly a good way, depending on the  
size of the area you're weeding. Or you can hoe them out, the 
scuffle hoe being the favored tool. It has a horizontal blade 
enabling you to cut the weeds just below the surface of the soil. 
</P>
<P>
	Smothering unwanted vegetation by mulching has become  
increasingly popular in both the flower garden and the vegetable 
garden. In my own asparagus patch, for example, I have kept weeds 
out for many years with an annual mulch of salt hay. The hay, 
available in bales at nurseries, decomposes with time and adds to 
soil fertility. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulching takes many forms, one of the most drastic being to lay  
down heavy layers of newspapers, building paper or both where you 
seek to eradicate unwanted growth. Black plastic may also serve. It 
takes several weeks to kill everything, provided no light leaks in. 
</P>
<P>
	Dead leaves make good mulches in flower beds or among vegetables  
as do wood chips. You can make your own chips with gasoline-driven 
or electric chippers and you can also buy bags of them. Sometimes a 
road crew will give you a big mound of them when they cut down tree 
limbs and put them through big chippers on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	In our environmentally conscious era, many gardeners think twice  
before resorting to chemical weed killers, called herbicides, 
because of real or feared harmful effects. But, when properly used, 
herbicides do a fine job. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are selective, meaning they're aimed at killing specific  
plants, while others, nonselective, will kill a broad range of 
plants. An extensive list of herbicides, with descriptions of what 
they do, is contained in the latest edition of the encyclopedic 
``America's Garden Book'' (Macmillan 1996), available in libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	Over several years, I eliminated stubborn growths of wild  
raspberry canes that kept coming up between the crevices of about 
50 feet of stone fence. The herbicide I used was glyphosate, a 
spray with the trade name of Roundup. You apply it to the leaves of 
the plant and it kills the root. But being nonselective, it will 
kill most plants it hits, so you must carefully direct the jet at 
your target. 
</P>
<P>
	I used a selective herbicide, fluazifop-butyl with the trade  
name Ormanec, to eliminate undesirable grasses from an area where I 
wanted to start a wildflower garden. This was also successful in 
eliminating wild grasses that had invaded the perimeter of my 
vegetable garden.

<HEADLINE>  Marines Introduce New Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps' first production MV-22  
Osprey left its mark at the Pentagon -- two big burn spots on the 
carefully manicured lawn -- as it showed up the helicopter it will 
replace by flying in on fixed wings and landing on a patch of 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen welcomed the tiltrotor aircraft  
Wednesday as a revolutionary aircraft for combat and peacetime use. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to change the way in which we approach everything  
from assault operations to disaster relief to humanitarian aid and 
peacekeeping,'' Cohen told a crowd of Pentagon officers, members of 
Congress, diplomats and other guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of Congress flew in on the aircraft and other  
guests climbed aboard before it departed, its two propjet turbines 
burning into the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking oddly old-fashioned as a fixed-wing plane, with two  
hugely oversized propellers, the V-22s magically morph into 
helicopters of the future. It takes 20 seconds for the Osprey to 
make that conversion, offering new capabilities for troop 
deployment, interdiction and search and rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the revolution in military affairs,'' said Cohen,  
describing the aircraft as the ``epitome of what our forces will 
need and what they will become in the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vertical-lift aircraft, also known as a convertiplane, flies  
at twice the speed, has four times the range and carries twice the 
payload of the aging CH-46 helicopters it will replace. A 
Vietnam-era CH-46 landed alongside the Osprey, which was also 
joined by a sleek tiltrotor test prototype, the XV-15, a potential 
civilian version. 
</P>
<P>
	``The V-22 is going to cut our response time from weeks down to  
days and days down to hours,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines plan to have 360 of the MV-22s by 2013. The Air  
Force is expected to order 50 of another version, the CV-22, and 
the Navy is acquiring 48 HV-22Bs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jointly produced by Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort Worth,  
Texas, and Boeing Co., in Ridley Park, Pa., the aircraft can 
achieve speeds over 400 mph and an altitude of 25,000 feet. It is 
designed to carry up to 24 troops or external loads of 15,000 
pounds. It can fly 2,000 miles and land on a dime. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., who flew in on the V-22, said the  
program has strong bipartisan support in Congress, which rejected 
Bush administration efforts to kill it. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have assailed its high cost and safety. The House has  
approved $856 million to buy 11 next year -- one of the biggest 
items in the defense budget. Early safety concerns plagued the 
innovative aircraft, but builders say modifications from the 
original design have made it lighter and safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only major program canceled and completely  
restored,'' Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Military planners see the aircraft as a means of getting more  
U.S. troops and pilots safely out of danger zones and enhancing 
drug interdiction, humanitarian and civilian rescue capabilities.

<HEADLINE> Children's Mall Closes Abruptly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- A mall built exclusively for  
children, featuring a movie theater with car-shaped seats and a 
food court with 50 kinds of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, has 
closed after 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Developers of Mackie's World shut down the mall Tuesday, saying  
the Grand Rapids area does not have enough of a population to keep 
the venture afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time we either give up our concept or stay here.  
It makes no sense to keep pouring money into it,'' said Pete 
Colvin, who started the venture with his wife Deb as a tribute to 
their 3-year-old son Mackie. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy died in 1995 of a rare intestinal disorder.  
</P>
<P>
	The mall had shoe, clothing and music stores geared toward  
children, as well as a learning center, the theater and food court. 
</P>
<P>
	For older children, there was a sports city with miniature golf,  
basketball games and a racetrack. For the youngest, the mall 
provided yellow cab-style strollers so their parents could taxi 
them around. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colvins told The Grand Rapids Press that they have a buyer  
for the building, which has remained largely empty since opening. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked how many customers visited Mackie's World, Colvin  
said, ``Not enough. Less than the break-even point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colvins say they've been thinking about opening another  
Mackie's World in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not blaming Grand Rapids,'' Mrs. Colvin said. ``We love  
Grand Rapids. We just know the opportunity is elsewhere.''

<HEADLINE> Emirates Threatens Disney Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- The United Arab Emirates said  
Wednesday it will boycott all Disney products if an upcoming 
exhibit on Israel depicts Jerusalem as the political capital of the 
Jewish nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab culture ministers want to send a committee of  
Arab-Americans and Muslims to see the exhibit before it opens Oct. 
1 at Disney's Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla. -- something Disney says 
it cannot allow because of an agreement with the exhibitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Disney to either accept receiving the committee or deal  
with the consequences,'' said Emirates Information and Culture 
Minister Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who heads the 
executive committee of Arab culture ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will boycott Walt Disney even if we are the only country to  
do so, but I know we won't be alone,'' Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed 
al-Nahyan told The Associated Press by telephone from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit is part of the theme park's 15-month millennium  
celebration that is to feature exhibits from more than 35 nations, 
the United Nations and the World Bank. Two Arab countries to be 
represented at the Millennium Village -- Morocco and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, Arabs  
have considered it occupied territory and objected to Israelis' 
claim that Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish state. Resolving 
Jerusalem's status is to be taken up in final peace negotiations 
over the next year between the Palestinians and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney World spokesman Bill Warren refused to say if the exhibit  
designates Jerusalem as Israel's capital, claiming to do so before 
the exhibit's official opening would violate an agreement with the 
exhibitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``No exhibitor is invited to present a political message.  
They're invited to tell a story about their country,'' Warren said 
Wednesday in Orlando. ``The idea is to celebrate diversity and not 
generate political debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, an Arab-American group called on Disney to guarantee  
that the exhibit won't cite Jerusalem as Israel's political capital 
and remove any references from the exhibit that politically link 
East Jerusalem -- the location of holy sites for Islam, Christianity 
and Judaism -- with the state of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney officials turned down an Emirates request to see the  
exhibit in advance, Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To rollout the details now would undermine the promotional  
opportunities for later this month,'' Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,400-square-foot exhibit will offer a presentation called  
``Inspired by Israel,'' which showcases the nation's agricultural, 
energy and high-tech industries. It will includes a movie called 
``Journey to Jerusalem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors can also walk through a pathway lined with white  
Jerusalem stones and enter a huge stone structure built as a copy 
of the walls of Jerusalem's old city. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney World Corp. Vice President George Kalogridis  
traveled to Jerusalem last month to announce that the Israel 
Pavilion would be at the center of the millennium celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney said in a statement that presentations will highlight  
Jerusalem's importance to Judaism, Islam and Christianity ``while 
at the same time emphasizing the centrality'' of the disputed city 
to the Jewish people. There was no indication it would be presented 
as Israel's political capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's Foreign Ministry contributed $1.8 million to the  
project.

<HEADLINE> Perspectives on Starting a Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- It's not uncommon for people who have spent their  
adult life working for others to get a little restless and begin 
thinking about what it would be like to run their own business. 
</P>
<P>
	They may have accumulated sufficient personal savings or have a  
retirement account or lump sum from a pension to help fund a 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	If starting your own business sounds appealing, there are some  
things to consider before you jump in, according to a 
small-business expert at the College for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing is to find something you really have an  
interest in and want to spend a lot of time in,'' says Bryan 
Schmitt, an academic associate at the college. ``If you don't have 
a lot of background in whatever it is, you better be willing to 
learn a great deal about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt outlines three ways to own your own business -- starting  
from scratch, buying an existing business, or buying a franchise -- 
along with the advantages and disadvantages of each method. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Starting from scratch: Starting a business from the ground up  
is probably the most psychologically, and sometimes the most 
financially, rewarding of the three methods. First, it's your 
business, not someone else's on whom you've piggy-backed. You can 
shape it however you like, and you can change it to meet market 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	However, this method also presents the biggest challenges,  
Schmitt notes. The time involved to get a business up and running 
will likely be all-consuming, especially early on. Unlike buying an 
existing business or a franchise, you won't have a built-in 
customer or supplier base, or a ready-to-run operation, You'll have 
longer learning and income curves. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt says that, while the start-up costs may actually be less  
than the cost of buying into an existing business or franchise, it 
may be tougher to get financing because lenders won't have a track 
record to judge. One key to getting financing is to develop a good 
business and marketing plan. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Buying an existing business: A big advantage with this option  
is that you're buying an established operation, tupically with 
established customers, suppliers and employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owner may even agree to stick around for a while on a  
consulting basis, so you're not reinventing the wheel,'' Schmitt 
says. Just be very clear in the contract so the former owner 
doesn't become a nuisance instead of a benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Financing is easier to get because the lender can review  
existing tax returns, business statements and so on. However, 
you'll probably pay a higher price for the business than if you had 
started from scratch, in particular because you're buying 
``goodwill'' -- the reputation, customers and so on the business has 
already established. 
</P>
<P>
	You'll want to bring in experts, such as an attorney, CPA or  
financial planner, to review the various financial statements. 
``The main thing you're looking for is cash flow,'' Schmitt says. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Buying a franchise: As with an established business, buying a  
franchise provides an up-and-running operation. The franchisor has 
a ``blueprint'' for its franchisees, which shows them how to 
operate the business. The franchisor may supply its franchises with 
product and cooperative advertising. ``If it's an established 
franchise, you'll have sales from day one,'' Schmitt says. You are 
less likely to have that advantage with a brand-new business. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, a franchisee pays for that blueprint and established  
reputation. A franchise owner tends to have less flexibility than 
other business owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt cautions anyone considering buying a franchise to get  
expert advice to carefully examine the blueprint and the contract, 
with an eye on not only the franchise fee but on such issues as 
royalties. You want to be sure you have a realistic opportunity to 
make a profit, not merely work as a glorified manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of what type of business you start from scratch or  
buy into, it's important to look at the overall return of the 
business,'' Schmitt advises. A business should pay the owner not 
merely a salary but profit on top of that. Otherwise, you might as 
well work for others for salary, without the investment risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Compare the business's potential with alternative investments,  
Schmitt says. For example, if you pull money out of a retirement 
plan to buy the business, you'll be paying income taxes on the 
withdrawal and possibly early-withdrawal penalties.

	The business you invest in needs to cover those costs and then  
some. Could you do better with your money elsewhere? A business 
that only doubles in value over 10 years wouldn't be considered a 
very strong investment these days. ``The ends need to be justified 
by the risks you take,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt also emphasizes that buyers consider how they will leave  
the business before they even buy it. Will they sell it, or pass it 
on to the children? This is especially important if you're buying a 
business in your pre-retirement years, when you may foresee owning 
the business for only 10 or 15 years before retiring.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Rips Bush's Education Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Gary Bauer called Wednesday for more local  
control over schools and said the education plan unveiled by 
Republican presidential rival George W. Bush would have the 
opposite result. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing at a suburban school, Bauer said he would flesh out  
his own education proposals this fall. He said they would be far 
more conservative than the Texas governor's and give more 
flexibility to local school officials, but gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typical of big-government conservatives, Mr. Bush borrows  
liberally from ideas held dear by Democrats,'' said Bauer, at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Bush's proposal, federal funds would be confiscated from  
schools that don't perform up to standards set by the states and 
made available to parents for private education, tutoring or other 
educational choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bush approach would lead inexorably to national education  
standards in the name of fairness and federal control of the 
schools, notwithstanding his disclaimers to the contrary,'' said 
Bauer, who worked in the Department of Education from 1982 to 1987 
under then-President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides rejected the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush's proposal ensures that federal money will no  
longer follow failure,'' said spokesman Eric Woolson. ``His 
proposal will make sure that children in our schools are being 
educated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer is seeking the GOP presidential nomination by courting the  
backing of social conservatives, while Bush offers a more moderate 
package. Bauer was hammering at precisely that difference in his 
latest campaign swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He runs as a Bush Republican and I run as a Reagan Republican  
and I think there's a difference between the two,'' said Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls have shown education high atop the list of concerns  
of voters, and Bauer said it would be one of the first major issues 
he addresses. Bush, he said, offers an education package that 
differs little from what Democrats would propose. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a prescription to increase the power of the federal  
bureaucracy,'' said Bauer. ``This is the old worn-out liberal 
tactic of using the power of the federal purse to coerce the states 
into obeying the arbitrary dictates of Washington bureaucrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolson countered that Bush routinely argues for letting local  
officials run schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of its core principles is state and local control,'' said  
Woolson.

<HEADLINE> Man Must Stay Away From Rep. Bono </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man accused of stalking Mary Bono was  
ordered to stay away from the Republican congresswoman for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard A. Paez ordered Steven Howard  
Sanberg to stay at least 100 yards from her, her staff and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanberg earlier was served a 10-day temporary restraining order  
barring contact with Sonny Bono's widow. Sanberg wasn't in court 
when the yearlong injunction was issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanberg was described in court documents as ``mentally unstable,  
obsessed with congresswoman Bono and members of her staff, and is a 
danger to them and to others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has repeatedly contacted Mrs. Bono and her employees by  
telephone and fax and has shown up at her office, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leaf Gardens May Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Maple Leaf Gardens, one of Canada's landmark  
arenas, will be fixed up or sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd., which owns the Toronto  
Maple Leafs, the NBA's Raptors and the Air Canada Centre, said 
Wednesday it will do something with the 68-year-old building, 
although it is not sure what. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to explore, develop or sell,'' said Richard  
Peddie, president and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. 
``All we know is that it can't exist in its present form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peddie said the Gardens will lose more than $1 million this  
year, mostly because the Maple Leafs left the building on Feb. 13. 
Only about 40 events have been held since the NHL team moved to the 
Air Canada Centre, mostly Toronto Rock lacrosse matches and St. 
Michael's Majors junior hockey games.

<HEADLINE>  Marines Introduce New Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps' first production MV-22  
Osprey left its mark at the Pentagon -- two big burn spots on the 
carefully manicured lawn -- as it showed up the helicopter it will 
replace by flying in on fixed wings and landing on a patch of 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen welcomed the tiltrotor aircraft  
Wednesday as a revolutionary aircraft for combat and peacetime use. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to change the way in which we approach everything  
from assault operations to disaster relief to humanitarian aid and 
peacekeeping,'' Cohen told a crowd of Pentagon officers, members of 
Congress, diplomats and other guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of Congress flew in on the aircraft and other  
guests climbed aboard before it departed, its two propjet turbines 
burning into the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking oddly old-fashioned as a fixed-wing plane, with two  
hugely oversized propellers, the V-22s magically morph into 
helicopters of the future. It takes 20 seconds for the Osprey to 
make that conversion, offering new capabilities for troop 
deployment, interdiction and search and rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the revolution in military affairs,'' said Cohen,  
describing the aircraft as the ``epitome of what our forces will 
need and what they will become in the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vertical-lift aircraft, also known as a convertiplane, flies  
at twice the speed, has four times the range and carries twice the 
payload of the aging CH-46 helicopters it will replace. A 
Vietnam-era CH-46 landed alongside the Osprey, which was also 
joined by a sleek tiltrotor test prototype, the XV-15, a potential 
civilian version. 
</P>
<P>
	``The V-22 is going to cut our response time from weeks down to  
days and days down to hours,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines plan to have 360 of the MV-22s by 2013. The Air  
Force is expected to order 50 of another version, the CV-22, and 
the Navy is acquiring 48 HV-22Bs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jointly produced by Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort Worth,  
Texas, and Boeing Co., in Ridley Park, Pa., the aircraft can 
achieve speeds over 400 mph and an altitude of 25,000 feet. It is 
designed to carry up to 24 troops or external loads of 15,000 
pounds. It can fly 2,000 miles and land on a dime. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., who flew in on the V-22, said the  
program has strong bipartisan support in Congress, which rejected 
Bush administration efforts to kill it. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have assailed its high cost and safety. The House has  
approved $856 million to buy 11 next year -- one of the biggest 
items in the defense budget. Early safety concerns plagued the 
innovative aircraft, but builders say modifications from the 
original design have made it lighter and safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only major program canceled and completely  
restored,'' Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Military planners see the aircraft as a means of getting more  
U.S. troops and pilots safely out of danger zones and enhancing 
drug interdiction, humanitarian and civilian rescue capabilities.

<HEADLINE> 6-Year Old Found Chained to Bed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORCO, Calif. (AP) -- A 6-year-old girl wearing only a diaper was  
found chained to a bed in a filthy home, and her mother and 
grandfather were arrested, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting on a tip from an anonymous caller, Riverside County  
sheriff's deputies found the girl Tuesday in a house filled to the 
ceiling with trash and feces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officers stepped into the house and were immediately overcome  
by the stench of trash from the floor to ceiling,'' Sgt. Perri 
Feinstein-Portales said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies found the emaciated girl in a filthy bedroom, wearing a  
diaper and tethered to a bedpost by a thick chain attached to a 
harness around her waist. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl curled up and cowered in a corner when deputies opened  
the bedroom door, Ms. Feinstein-Portales said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The child was not able to speak ... she was able to moan and  
make small sounds,'' Ms. Feinstein-Portales said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's mother, Cindi Sue Topper, told authorities her  
daughter had been chained to the bed off and on for five years, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, whose name was withheld, was taken to Loma Linda  
University Medical Center for treatment of malnourishment and was 
in serious but stable condition today, nursing supervisor Brook 
Stuck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Topper, 39, and the girl's grandfather, Loren Bess, 76, were  
arrested and booked for one count of felony child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are seeking to place the girl in the custody of  
child protective services, Ms. Feinstein-Portales said.

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Shannon Curfman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STILLWATER, Minn. (AP) -- With nearby paddle boats lending a  
Mississippi Delta feel, Shannon Curfman and her band mates run 
through a set as scorching as the summer night. 
</P>
<P>
	Her bracelets and long red hair swinging, Shannon, in her  
paisley hip-huggers and playing a fire-red guitar, leans into the 
microphone for a soulful version of legendary bluesman Robert 
Johnson's ``Stop Breaking Down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Stuff I got's gonna bust your brains out,'' she sings in her  
husky voice, ``make you lose your mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She gets cheers and applause from the crowd at Lumberjack Days,  
a music festival in this historic St. Croix River town east of the 
Twin Cities. And few seem to notice -- or care -- that the singer of 
lowdown songs is only 13 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon, who turned 14 on July 31, has already signed a record  
deal after fronting her own band for three years. Arista Records is 
scheduled to release her debut album, ``Loud Guitars, Big 
Suspicions,'' on Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Is she excited?  
</P>
<P>
	``No, not at all,'' she deadpans during an interview at her  
suburban Minneapolis home. Then she bursts out laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course. It's definitely what I've been aiming for. This is  
my ultimate goal. Didn't know it would come this soon, but it 
did,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering Shannon's room is like stepping back to the early  
1970s. There is a strobe light, a lava lamp, a peace sign, a poster 
of Jimi Hendrix. Her decor reflects her musical tastes, a Who's Who 
of '60s rock and soul: Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, Sly and the 
Family Stone, James Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love listening to, like, the kind of roots, to different  
kinds of music,'' Shannon says as she prepares to strum her 
acoustic guitar for a photo shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I like the old, original blues stuff like Robert Johnson  
and stuff like that, where you can barely hear what they're doing 
in a recording because it's so distorted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No Backstreet Boys or 'N Sync sounds for Shannon Curfman.  
Instead of sweet pop, she cooks up a smoky blend of funk and blues 
that sounds more like Little Feat or Bonnie Raitt. 
</P>
<P>
	As for singing about heartbreak or men who don't do right,  
Shannon says, ``It's more of just telling a story, not that you 
went through it or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon first began singing in public at 7 in a school talent  
show in her hometown of Fargo, N.D., then added a guitar at 10. 
Fargo is also the hometown of Jonny Lang, the 18-year-old 
blues-rock guitarist who broke big with his 1997 debut, ``Lie to 
Me,'' and who has opened for the Rolling Stones and Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon says she's a ``huge fan'' of Lang's and used to attend  
his performances in Fargo. ``I had him sign, like, everything I 
own,'' she says. She even consulted him about amplifiers when she 
was starting out and still looks to him for advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Lang's admiration for Shannon appears mutual.  
</P>
<P>
	``As far as young guitarists go, there's this girl in  
Minneapolis named Shannon Curfman,'' he told Rolling Stone 
magazine. ``She does the old Chaka Khan funky blues kind of stuff. 
She's only 14 or 15, and she scares me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Lang, Shannon made the move from Fargo, a town of 86,700  
about 215 miles northwest of Minneapolis, to the Twin Cities music 
scene. She and her parents, Mary and Terry Curfman, moved last 
November to a split-level home in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon keeps in touch with friends in Fargo by phone and  
e-mail. She says many of them are matter-of-fact about her record 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're like, `Oh, cool, all right, so anyways, ...''' she  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last three years, Shannon has been taught at home by her  
mother. She spends her mornings doing coursework and takes her 
laptop computer on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``She works very hard, but she loves it,'' Mrs. Curfman says.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt personally there was a lot of wasted time (in school)  
where I was just like, `I could be playing guitar right now' or `I 
could be singing right now,' but instead I'm stuck in class, I have 
to be quiet,'' Shannon says. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1998 she met manager Jake Walesch, who saw Shannon  
perform at Bunkers, a bar in the Minneapolis Warehouse District. 
She eventually recorded her first album, ``Loud Guitars, Big 
Suspicions,'' for his independent Pop Sense label. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon co-wrote six of the album's 11 songs with Lang  
collaborator Kevin Bowe. Lang co-wrote one of the songs and plays 
guitar on three tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon sells the album at her concerts and on her Web site.  
It's also available at Best Buy, Sam Goody, Media Play and Target 
stores as well as on the Internet at CDNow and Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loud Guitars, Big Suspicions'' (its title taken from a Sheryl  
Crow song that Shannon performs) has sold 4,600 copies in the four 
months since its release last April, according to SoundScan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 12, less than three weeks before her 14th birthday,  
Shannon signed a guaranteed three-record deal with Arista Records, 
home of Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and Sarah McLachlan. 
Arista plans a nationwide release of ``Loud Guitars, Big 
Suspicions,'' with new artwork and three new songs. Among the new 
songs is a version of The Band's ``The Weight,'' a concert favorite 
of Shannon's. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon's confidence, talent and personality impressed Peter  
Ganbarg, Arista's senior director of artist and repertoire. He says 
the label is not worried about taking its chances on a 14-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at artists who are truly gifted, and age should not  
matter,'' Ganbarg says. ``If you're doing this at 14, imagine what 
the artist is going to be doing at 19, 20, 22.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her four band mates -- all men ranging in age from 29 to 55 --  
don't see her age as a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girl is so mature, so together. Her professionalism is  
what really impressed (me),'' says keyboardist Kevin Murphy, 55, 
who played with the '70s funk band Rufus featuring Chaka Khan. ``I 
just know this kid's going to be a big star. She's got everything 
it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guitarist Randy Casey, 36, says when Shannon is playing he  
doesn't see her as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once in a while she gets kind of squirrelly and you can tell  
she's a teen-age girl,'' he adds. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon also says age doesn't matter. And she doesn't mind if  
some fans are intrigued by the novelty of seeing a teen belt out 
bluesy rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever gets them there. The ultimate goal is having people  
there for the music,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> GDP Revision Paint Healthy Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy will look a little healthier --  
growth has been even better than previously thought and Americans 
haven't been as free-spending -- as the government changes the way 
it takes the pulse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis announced  
the planned changes Wednesday as part of an effort undertaken about 
every five years to adjust the gross domestic product to better 
reflect changes in the economy and new sources of data. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Moulton, a government economist overseeing the project,  
said the effects of the change ``will be modest, on the order of 
tenths of percentage points. We're not going to have a wholesale 
change in picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think the directions are pretty clear, that the changes  
... will modestly increase the real growth rate and modestly reduce 
the inflation rate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists said the changes should give the Federal  
Reserve and other policy-makers a more accurate picture of the 
economy but would not result in any policy shift. 
</P>
<P>
	``The changes will show that the economy is probably doing  
better than the government previously thought and that's getting 
closer to reality,'' said Mark Zandi, an economist with Regional 
Financial Associates. ``But I don't think it will change Fed policy 
because they have already incorporated a lot of this into their 
thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's briefing laid out changes in the way the government  
calculates gross domestic product -- the country's total output of 
goods and services. That report also includes information on 
inflation and Americans' personal savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual numbers showing the impact of these changes on past  
GDP estimates, dating back to 1929, won't be released by the 
government until late October. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest change involves how the government classifies  
business investments in computer software. Under the new 
methodology, purchases of software programs will be treated as 
``private fixed investments,'' meaning they will add to the value 
of the GDP. Such purchases currently are classified as 
``intermediate input'' -- a material used in production, such as an 
automaker's purchase of steel -- and isn't included in the GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	Government purchases of computer software also will be treated  
as an investment, which would add to GDP, rather than as an 
expenditure, which has no effect on GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of these changes, GDP in 1996 will be around $115  
billion higher than the government originally estimated, Moulton 
said. In 1996, total GDP was pegged at $7.662 trillion, government 
economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new methodology, savings associated with a worker's  
government pension plan will be counted as personal savings, rather 
than as government savings. That won't affect the GDP, but it will 
boost the nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage 
of disposable income -- by an estimated 1.5 to 2 percentage points, 
or around $100 billion in extra savings, for the 1990s, Moulton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And personal contributions to government pension plans will no  
longer be deducted from personal income, a change that will boost 
personal income estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also will revise the way it measures productivity  
in the banking sector to take into account not only hours worked by 
bank employees but also ATM transactions, the number of checks 
cleared, electronic fund transfers and other factors. The change is 
expected to show improved banking productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	To better gauge consumer spending, the government will consider  
changes in buying behavior during sales. 
</P>
<P>
	That banking productivity and consumer spending changes are  
expected to show that an inflation gauge tied to the GDP is even 
lower than previously estimated.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Court Addresses 'Shield Law' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a test case for California's ``shield  
law'' for journalists, a news media lawyer asked the state Supreme 
Court on Wednesday to keep prosecutors' hands off television 
outtakes and reporters' unpublished notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, added to the state Constitution by voters in 1980,  
protects reporters from being held in contempt from refusing to 
disclose confidential sources or unpublished material. 
</P>
<P>
	California courts have recognized an exception for evidence  
vitally needed by criminal defendants, who have a constitutional 
right to a fair trial. The question before the court -- brought by a 
TV news director who faces jail for refusing to surrender a 
videotape -- is whether prosecutors are entitled to equal 
disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	Charity Kenyon, lawyer for KOVR-TV news director Ellen Miller,  
argued that allowing prosecutors to see unpublished material would 
make the media ``a direct conduit of information to the 
government.'' She also said prosecutors weren't entitled to the 
same constitutional protection as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Deputy Attorney General Susan Orton said barring disclosure  
to prosecutors in all cases would allow ``media domination of what 
shall be released to the prosecutor, whose obligation is to 
determine the truth.'' She said disclosure would be required only 
in exceptional cases, when the evidence couldn't be found 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotape contained a jailhouse interview with a man who  
allegedly tortured and murdered a cellmate. His description of some 
of the events of the killing was paraphrased by a KOVR reporter in 
a voice-over. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney sought the entire tape, but KOVR provided  
only the part that was broadcast, arguing that the shield law 
protected the outtakes.

<HEADLINE> UPN Beats WB in Ratings Again / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The UPN network's future may have suddenly been  
thrown into flux because of Viacom's pending purchase of CBS, but 
its present is looking better than it has in many months. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN narrowly beat mini-network rival, the WB, in the ratings for  
the second straight week -- the only two times it has done so since 
April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not quite a fair fight, since UPN has gotten a jump on the  
fall season by premiering a handful of its shows while the WB is 
airing mostly reruns. But UPN's new Thursday night wrestling series 
had higher ratings than anything on either network last week and 
Jaleel White's new sitcom, ``Grown Ups,'' shows signs of being a 
modest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN is half-owned by Viacom and, under current federal  
regulations, the company would not be allowed to own more than 33 
percent of it. So UPN will likely be sold, shut down or folded into 
CBS if the rules can't be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's chairman, Sumner Redstone, would not tip his hand on  
UPN's future but indicated he was happy at the company's efforts to 
turn around by concentrating on a young male demographic. 
</P>
<P>
	``UPN is doing a lot better than it was,'' Redstone said.  
</P>
<P>
	CBS won the Nielsen Media Research prime-time ratings crown  
during a lackluster week, where the most popular show was an 
exhibition football game. CBS had a 6.4 rating and 12 share, NBC 
had a 6.0 rating and 11 share, ABC had a 5.8 rating and 11 share, 
and Fox was at 4.2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN had a 2.3 rating and 4 share, the WB had a 2.2 rating and 4  
share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``NBC Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with  
a 6.9 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.7 
rating and 15 share and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 6.0 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Aug. 30-Sept. 5, the top 10 shows, their  
networks and ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``NFL Pre-Season Football: San Francisco at Oakland,'' ABC, 9.1;  
``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 9.0; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 8.5; 
``ER,'' NBC, 8.5; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 8.5; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.3; ``Frasier'' special, NBC, 8.2; ``Friends,'' 
NBC, 8.1; ``The King of Queens'' special, CBS, 7.9; ``48 
Hours-Monday,'' CBS, 7.7; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 7.7.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Web Site To Help Fight Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three world leaders clicked on their computer  
controls today to launch a new Internet site that aims to fight 
hunger and poverty worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The NetAid site from the United Nations was designed to make it  
easier for donors to contribute time or money and learn more about 
conditions that foster poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The launching of this Web site represents a truly new front in  
the struggle against poverty,'' President Clinton said in a 
satellite appearance from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Former South African President Nelson Mandela, speaking from  
Johannesburg, said most of the developed world ``has the economic 
capacity to solve the problems of poverty, yet the gap between rich 
and poor is growing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Internet should help poorer communities gain  
knowledge and resources to improve their conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	From London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged Web  
visitors to pay special attention to helping refugees in light of 
turmoil in East Timor and other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Three rock concerts on Oct. 9 in London, Geneva and East  
Rutherford, N.J., will boost the U.N. fund-raising effort. Unlike 
the 1985 Live Aid concert to fight famine in Ethiopia, organizers 
say, the Web site will encourage giving long after microphones go 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the NetAid technology that really makes a difference,''  
NetAid spokesman Bob Chlopak said. ``It empowers people to 
participate and contribute in many ways besides contributing 
funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U2's Bono, David Bowie, George Michael, Counting Crows and Jewel  
are among the musicians scheduled to perform. VH1 and MTV cable 
networks will broadcast in the United States, while British 
Broadcasting Corp. will carry the concerts in the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the U.N. concerts, visitors to the site can make  
donations and register to help at www.netaid.org. Ultimately, 
organizers expect to offer such features as online pen pals, 
discussion groups and direct links to organizations that fight 
hunger and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Development Program will run the site.

<HEADLINE> Armored Car Company Robbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAZELWOOD, Mo. (AP) -- Without uttering a word, three masked  
gunmen ambushed the co-owner of an armored car company and stole up 
to $1 million in cash in what investigators suspect was an inside 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	The robbery took place Tuesday at U.S. Armed Car Services.  
</P>
<P>
	A gunman confronted Diane Livingston, co-owner of the company,  
as she was getting out of her vehicle early Tuesday. He locked her 
German shepherd guard dog in the vehicle. Another car pulled up 
with two more gunmen, and they directed Ms. Livingston to open the 
vaults. 
</P>
<P>
	They took three 40-pound bags and one carton of cash believed to  
contain a total of $750,000 to $1 million, then locked Ms. 
Livingston in a fenced storage area and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
	The robbers used only gestures to communicate with Ms.  
Livingston and one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say that because the robbers apparently didn't  
want to be recognized by their voices and seemed to know where 
everything was, the holdup was probably an inside job. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were checking the records of current and former  
employees.

<HEADLINE> Closing Arguments in Jim Brown Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Brown's wife sat with her eyes on the  
jury Wednesday as a prosecutor told them to believe the terror in 
her voice on a 911 tape and reject testimony in which she recanted 
domestic violence claims against her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her testimony about what happened makes no sense at all,''  
Deputy City Attorney Grace Kim Lee said. ``What really happened is 
what she told the 911 operator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors heard again the tape in which a tearful Monique Brown  
calls for help, saying her husband has smashed the windows on her 
car with a shovel, has a gun in the house and has threatened her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really happened is he was enraged. ... He threatened to  
kill her by snapping her neck,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	A defense lawyer was to deliver his closing argument later in  
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a 63-year-old Hall of Fame football great, could face 18  
months in jail if he is convicted of misdemeanor counts of making 
terrorist threats and vandalism. He has a long history of arrests 
for alleged attacks on women but never has been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Judge Dale Fischer told jurors they could consider  
Brown's history of domestic violence in their deliberations but 
could not use it as the sole basis for convicting him. 
</P>
<P>
	In her jury instructions, given before final arguments, the  
judge explained the elements of making a terrorist threat, 
including the fact that the victim must be in fear for their 
immediate safety. 
</P>
<P>
	On the night of June 15, Monique Brown fled her home and ran  
down the hillside to a neighbor's house about four doors away. The 
25-year-old woman asked to use the phone and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said the distance she ran showed how frightened she was. On  
that night, at the police station, Lee noted, Monique Brown told 
officers, ``She didn't want the defendant arrested but she wanted 
to make a record in case something happened to her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee reminded jurors that Monique Brown had told police of prior  
domestic violence incidents in which her husband blackened her eye, 
choked her and stood over her with a metal spear threatening her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	She took the stand during the trial and denied all of it. Her  
husband's defense called a psychiatrist who testified that his wife 
had a ``borderline personality disorder'' that would have caused 
her to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	On the night in question, Lee said, Jim Brown took a shovel and  
beat on her car out of anger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is he beating her car? He was sending her a clear  
message,'' Lee said. ``When she saw the defendant beating on the 
windows of her car, she knows that she's next. And she starts 
running.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska May Be Missile Defense Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has selected Alaska  
as the likely first site for its proposed anti-ballistic missile 
defense network. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Rubin, who announced the  
decision Wednesday, said the administration won't decide whether to 
deploy a missile defense until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin spoke as U.S. and Russian officials in Moscow opened two  
days of negotiations on the terms under which a missile defense 
could be established. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed in the  
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty not to construct a national defense 
against such missiles. The theory was that leaving both sides 
vulnerable deterred nuclear attacks because either country would 
face deadly retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Wednesday began two  
days of talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov 
on reducing nuclear stockpiles and possibly changing the treaty. 
Defense Secretary William Cohen also is expected to discuss the 
issue with his Russian counterpart on a trip to Moscow next Monday 
and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, hard pressed financially to create its own anti-missile  
defense, is reluctant to make the change. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United States wants to modify the treaty so it can build  
a limited defense against attack by rogue states, such as North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has made some decisions that will enable us to  
begin engaging Russia now on changes on the ABM treaty that would 
be necessary if we seek to deploy a limited national missile 
defense system,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin agreed in June to discuss ABM  
modifications, but Russian officials continue to insist that an 
anti-missile defense system in the United States would tilt the 
strategic balance and start a new arms race. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington argues the system would not upset strategic stability  
because it would not be effective against a massive attack of the 
kind Russia is capable of launching.

<HEADLINE> Gadhafi Hosts African Unity Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *BY DONNA ABU-NASR   	
</P>
<P>
	SIRTE, Libya (AP) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday  
called for greater African power in the U.N. Security Council and 
for Western countries return stolen treasures to the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	At a summit of the Organization of African Unity, host Gadhafi  
urged the 53 member states to unite. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to achieve African unity by consensus, peace and  
love'' Gadhafi said. ``Africa, this continent that was considered a 
village for slaves, a mine and a backyard ... now imposes its 
respect and prestige.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gadhafi walked into the meeting in Sirte, about 280 miles  
southeast of Tripoli, with trademark clenched fist raised high, 
prompting other African leaders to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	He addressed 43 African heads of state who showed up for the  
summit to discuss ways of restructuring the OAU's charter to 
strengthen unity among member states. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries that ``insulted Africa and treated Africans as slaves  
should offer an official apology for all the human and material 
losses that they inflicted,'' Gadhafi said. They should also return 
to Africa all the treasures and the profits they made from them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized that Africans should have veto rights in the  
15-member Security Council, where only the five permanent members -- 
Britain, France, Russia, China and the United States -- can block 
resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot remain part of the decoration'' at the United  
Nations, Gadhafi said to applause from participants. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43 heads of state were far more than officials had expected  
would attend. Since last year, Gadhafi has been turning for support 
more to Africa than the Arab world because he believes its leaders 
stood by him when his country was under U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions -- including bans on international flights and arms  
sales and a freeze of Libya's assets abroad -- were suspended in 
April, when Gadhafi turned over two suspects in the 1988 Pan Am 
airliner bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The explosion killed 270 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of Algeria, Tunisia and Sudan were among those who  
attended Wednesday's meeting. But three other Arab leaders -- from 
Egypt, Morocco and Mauritania -- snubbed the Libyan leader, sending 
deputies in their places. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Esmat Abdel Meguid,  
secretary-general of the Arab League, were there as summit 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day OAU summit, which ends Thursday, was called to  
discuss reframing the organization's charter. It also was to 
address Gadhafi's proposal to unite Africa through economic 
cooperation and better transportation links. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's session was opened by Algerian President Abdelaziz  
Bouteflika, whose country is the current chair of the OAU. He 
stressed that there could be no African unity without peace on the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot move forward as long as there are conflicts in  
Africa and as long as there are refugees,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clooney Filming New Movie in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLOUCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Just months out of his surgical scrubs,  
actor George Clooney is donning fishing garb and sailing some rough 
seas. 
</P>
<P>
	The former star of the hit show ``ER'' is starting to film ``The  
Perfect Storm,'' which details the last voyage of the Andrea Gail, 
a fishing boat brought down by a brutal storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Clooney said Tuesday the story was a poignant and important one.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're real people, they're real families involved,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is drawn from the book ``The Perfect Storm,'' in which  
author Sebastian Junger describes how the boat and its crew 
vanished in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, directed by Wolfgang Peterson, also stars Mark  
Wahlberg and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. It was to start shooting 
today in Gloucester for three weeks.

<HEADLINE>  Bradley Spells Out Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Bill Bradley, walking the small-town  
haunts of his boyhood, decried the current day's politics of 
``trifling things'' and asked Americans to follow him toward bigger 
dreams. ``We need a new kind of leadership,'' he declared 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a fall kickoff rally for a presidential campaign that has  
been underway for months, Bradley sought to offer Democrats a 
reason for choosing him over Vice President Al Gore despite an 
economy that has soared during his rival's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed to traditional Democratic sympathies for the  
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need in America is a deeper prosperity,'' Bradley  
argued from the steps of his old high school in this one stoplight 
Mississippi River hamlet. He lamented that one in five children 
live in poverty, and 45 million Americans lack health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Government should not do ``trifling things much of the time for  
some people, but it should be doing some large and essential things 
all of the time for the whole nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stricter gun control, campaign finance reforms, universal health  
insurance and the eradication of child poverty made his list of 
big, essential goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do fewer things, but they will be essential things and  
we will do them more thoroughly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After months of low-profile campaigning, Bradley staged this  
mom-and-apple-pie-event with hopes of more broadly introducing 
himself and what he called the ``small-town boy'' ethos he brings 
to politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Handsewn bicentennial flags were retrieved from the library's  
storage to festoon the oaks along Mississippi Avenue. Sno-cones 
from the elementary school PTA and 5,000 of the local ladies' 
home-baked snickerdoodles, oatmeal clusters and chocolate chip 
cookies stood in for apple pie to complete Bradley's vision of 
perfect Americana. 
</P>
<P>
	He came home buoyed by a weekend poll that showed that he and  
Gore were running neck and neck in New Hampshire, the first primary 
state. But he still has to overcome surveys suggesting he remains 
relatively unknown nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Even here, Kim Casey said she knew little of Bradley, having  
moved to Crystal City from St. Louis three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning the sno-cone table, Casey, a 35-year-old mother and  
grocery clerk, said she was nonetheless sure Bradley would ``set 
the country's standards to where we come from -- family values, 
where everybody sticks together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 35-minute address delivered in a level voice with the  
help of a TelePrompTer, the former New Jersey senator struck themes 
commonly heard from Gore's critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more interested in leadership than polls and politics,''  
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew approving nods and whistles when, in an apparent  
contrast with Gore and Republican front-runner George W. Bush, he 
noted that he grew up ``without a famous family name or great 
wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The adoring hometown crowd stood to applaud Bradley's promise of  
``a new kind of leadership -- a leadership that puts the people 
front and center, not the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Clinton-Gore administration unbudgingly faced off with  
congressional Republicans this week over tax cuts, Bradley also 
sounded a bipartisan note. 
</P>
<P>
	His late father was a Republican, Bradley said with a sly grin,  
but worked with town Democrats to build the high school in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do big jobs again, if we do them together,'' Bradley  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An only child, he remembered his late schoolteacher mother  
organizing youth dances in the family basement and added, with an 
apologetic nod to his wife, Ernestine, ``I still can't get beyond 
the same awkward two-step she taught in our living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradleys' 22-year-old daughter, Theresa Anne, is a college  
student and studying overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley proved his financial viability in the first half of this  
year by amassing some $12 million in campaign donations to Gore's 
$18 million. Now, Bradley hopes to use detailed policy 
announcements -- on child poverty, universal health care, the 
economy and foreign policy -- to overcome other surveys suggesting 
that he remains relatively unknown nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Washington Post-ABC poll put Bradley far behind Gore, 29  
percent to 64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	News cameras from London and Tokyo news outlets were among those  
in the high school gymnasium as a lineup of Bradley's aunt,

<HEADLINE>  Bradley Spells Out Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Bill Bradley, walking the small-town  
haunts of his boyhood, decried the current day's politics of 
``trifling things'' and asked Americans to follow him toward bigger 
dreams. ``We need a new kind of leadership,'' he declared 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a fall kickoff rally for a presidential campaign that has  
been underway for months, Bradley sought to offer Democrats a 
reason for choosing him over Vice President Al Gore despite an 
economy that has soared during his rival's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed to traditional Democratic sympathies for the  
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need in America is a deeper prosperity,'' Bradley  
argued from the steps of his old high school in this one stoplight 
Mississippi River hamlet. He lamented that one in five children 
live in poverty, and 45 million Americans lack health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Government should not do ``trifling things much of the time for  
some people, but it should be doing some large and essential things 
all of the time for the whole nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stricter gun control, campaign finance reforms, universal health  
insurance and the eradication of child poverty made his list of 
big, essential goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do fewer things, but they will be essential things and  
we will do them more thoroughly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After months of low-profile campaigning, Bradley staged this  
mom-and-apple-pie-event with hopes of more broadly introducing 
himself and what he called the ``small-town boy'' ethos he brings 
to politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Handsewn bicentennial flags were retrieved from the library's  
storage to festoon the oaks along Mississippi Avenue. Sno-cones 
from the elementary school PTA and 5,000 of the local ladies' 
home-baked snickerdoodles, oatmeal clusters and chocolate chip 
cookies stood in for apple pie to complete Bradley's vision of 
perfect Americana. 
</P>
<P>
	He came home buoyed by a weekend poll that showed that he and  
Gore were running neck and neck in New Hampshire, the first primary 
state. But he still has to overcome surveys suggesting he remains 
relatively unknown nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Even here, Kim Casey said she knew little of Bradley, having  
moved to Crystal City from St. Louis three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning the sno-cone table, Casey, a 35-year-old mother and  
grocery clerk, said she was nonetheless sure Bradley would ``set 
the country's standards to where we come from -- family values, 
where everybody sticks together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 35-minute address delivered in a level voice with the  
help of a TelePrompTer, the former New Jersey senator struck themes 
commonly heard from Gore's critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more interested in leadership than polls and politics,''  
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew approving nods and whistles when, in an apparent  
contrast with Gore and Republican front-runner George W. Bush, he 
noted that he grew up ``without a famous family name or great 
wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The adoring hometown crowd stood to applaud Bradley's promise of  
``a new kind of leadership -- a leadership that puts the people 
front and center, not the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Clinton-Gore administration unbudgingly faced off with  
congressional Republicans this week over tax cuts, Bradley also 
sounded a bipartisan note. 
</P>
<P>
	His late father was a Republican, Bradley said with a sly grin,  
but worked with town Democrats to build the high school in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do big jobs again, if we do them together,'' Bradley  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An only child, he remembered his late schoolteacher mother  
organizing youth dances in the family basement and added, with an 
apologetic nod to his wife, Ernestine, ``I still can't get beyond 
the same awkward two-step she taught in our living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradleys' 22-year-old daughter, Theresa Anne, is a college  
student and studying overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley proved his financial viability in the first half of this  
year by amassing some $12 million in campaign donations to Gore's 
$18 million. Now, Bradley hopes to use detailed policy 
announcements -- on child poverty, universal health care, the 
economy and foreign policy -- to overcome other surveys suggesting 
that he remains relatively unknown nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Washington Post-ABC poll put Bradley far behind Gore, 29  
percent to 64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	News cameras from London and Tokyo news outlets were among those  
in the high school gymnasium as a lineup of Bradley's aunt, 
second-grade music teacher, Little League teammate and others 
dished up an affectionate version of the old game show ``This is 
Your Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The candidate also lead reporters on a twilight tour of his  
life's landmarks: the old State Bank where his father, the 
president, weathered the Great Depression without foreclosing on a 
single homeowner; the weeded-over lot where the Pittsburgh Plate 
Glass factory shut down the town's lifeblood when it closed in 
1992; the Little League field where Bradley's integrated team 
learned to resist the racial discrimination of visiting teams.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Pleads Guilty to One Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Critics say that former Housing Secretary  
Henry Cisneros' misdemeanor conviction resulting from a four-year, 
$9 million-plus investigation is further proof that the independent 
counsel statute hasn't worked in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who had been indicted on 18 felony counts of  
conspiracy, obstruction and lying to the FBI, pleaded guilty 
Tuesday to a single misdemeanor count of lying to the FBI. Under 
the plea arrangement with Independent Counsel David Barrett, which 
came as jury selection was set to begin, Cisneros immediately paid 
a $10,000 fine but faces no jail time or probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an investigation looking for a crime, and the outcome  
is a pathetic commentary on Independent Counsel David Barrett's 
judgment in pursuing this matter,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., 
an author of the post-Watergate independent counsel statute that 
expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Levin, who has introduced legislation that would  
significantly reshape the 1978 law, ``Mr. Barrett owes an 
explanation to the public for this fiasco where an 18-count felony 
indictment dissolved into one 'mouse-demeanor.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Former federal prosecutor E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., who is now a  
Washington defense lawyer, was equally critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first victim of any independent counsel investigation is  
perspective,'' Barcella said. ``You take otherwise well-trained 
lawyers, you focus them on one person and one alleged crime and the 
crime takes on proportions far out of line to what it ought to -- 
and so does the target.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a classic example where a regular U.S. attorney with a  
full caseload would have been able to evaluate this case in a 
matter of weeks and see what it was worth,'' Barcella said. ``It 
was only ever worth not much more than a misdemeanor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros was indicted in December 1997 -- along with ex-lover  
Linda Jones and two aides -- in a 21-count indictment charging that 
the four conspired during his consideration for a Clinton Cabinet 
post to conceal from the FBI the scope of his financial support for 
Ms. Jones after their extramarital affair ended. All four pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing in court Tuesday, Cisneros admitted he falsely told  
the FBI that he had never paid Ms. Jones more than $2,500 monthly. 
He gave her more than $250,000 between 1989 and 1994, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept responsibility for the conduct as outlined,'' the  
former San Antonio mayor said, later releasing a prepared statement 
in which he added, ``I regret my lack of candor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett declined to discuss the prosecution with reporters. But  
in a statement, he took pains to justify his investigation's 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``This disposition should in no way be viewed as minimizing the  
serious ethical breach by Mr. Cisneros,'' Barrett said. ``However, 
a just disposition of any prosecution must include an evaluation of 
the defendant's overall conduct. In this case, the conduct, while 
egregious, was committed by a person whose life has been otherwise 
dedicated to public service, and this fact must season the final 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The presiding judge, U.S. Stanley Sporkin, defended Barrett's  
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there will be some second-guessing about this plea,''  
he said. ``There will be some who will say that the sanction is not 
tough enough and others who will say here is more evidence of the 
Independent Counsel Act as not serving the public interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``we cannot permit an individual to lie his way into high  
public office,'' Sporkin said. ``The work of the independent 
counsel in this case reaffirms the importance of telling the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett also prosecuted Ms. Jones, whose earlier immunity deal  
was revoked after she was found to have lied to prosecutors. 
Barrett prosecuted two of her family members as well. Ms. Jones was 
sentenced last year to 3 1/2 years in prison, pleading guilty to 
conspiracy, bank fraud, money laundering and obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Barrett decided not to prosecute the two Cisneros  
aides. And Tuesday, he dismissed the two remaining felony counts 
pending against Ms. Jones under the 1997 indictment.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Moore Still Unsigned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Four days before the season opener at  
Philadelphia, the Arizona Cardinals still haven't reached a 
contract agreement with wide receiver Rob Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, there were several broadcast reports, both  
nationally and locally, that a deal was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wednesday came and went without any word that the big-play  
receiver had agreed to a deal, and coach Vince Tobin, obviously 
weary of answering questions about Moore, said the game plan was 
developed assuming he wouldn't be with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not counting him out, but I'm not counting on having him,  
either,'' Tobin said after Wednesday's practice. ``I've got to deal 
with reality, and the reality is he's not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has been at odds with Cardinals management since the team  
designated him their franchise player during the offseason. The 
Arizona Republic and The Tribune of Mesa reported Wednesday that 
the 30-year-old receiver had agreed to a three-year, $15 million 
contract, but that the sides were far apart on how much of that 
should be a signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said Moore wants a $6 million signing bonus, and the  
Cardinals have offered about $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's agent, Gary Wichard, did not return phone calls to his  
office on Wednesday. The Cardinals have had no comment on the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer criticized the  
team's management for its handling of the Moore matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until someone upstairs realizes how important Rob Moore is to  
this whole offense and this season, we're going to have to learn to 
play without him,'' Plummer said. ``Hopefully, they'll realize that 
he's a game-breaker and a guy we have to have out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, entering his 10th NFL season, is 11th among active  
players in receptions with 598 for 8,747 yards and 44 touchdowns. 
He has been working out on his own and, because he knows the 
Arizona offense, wouldn't need much time to get ready. He could 
play against Philadelphia even if he doesn't sign until late in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he could play some,'' offensive coordinator Marc  
Trestman said. ``How much would be relative to how he feels about 
the game plan, his conditioning and everything else. I would think 
he could play a few plays, but I'm not going to count on him 
playing at all.''

<HEADLINE> Bills Will Rely on QB Flutie Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Wade Phillips finally did it. The  
Buffalo Bills coach named Doug Flutie his starting quarterback this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	It shouldn't have been news.  
</P>
<P>
	Flutie came off the bench to carry the Bills to the playoffs  
after a horrid start last year. Looking more like the 1984 Heisman 
Trophy winner than a 36-year-old survivor of eight Canadian 
Football League seasons, Flutie has the Bills humming again. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final exhibition game, he hurried the team to the  
Pittsburgh end zone in three minutes and ran off the field, leaving 
the fans drooling for more. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Buffalo have a good start with Flutie starting? And if so,  
might another Super Bowl be down the road? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say there isn't a chance,'' said receiver  
Andre Reed, one of three remaining Bills who played in four 
straight Super Bowl losses. ``That wouldn't be right to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a reversal of roles, Flutie will take the snaps Sunday at  
Indianapolis while Rob Johnson sits -- and waits. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, last year's starter until going out with a rib injury  
in the fifth game, signed a $25 million contract before last 
season. He was selected as the starter in training camp, but Flutie 
took over and led the Bills to a 10-6 record and a wild-card 
playoff berth after they started the season 0-3. Buffalo rewarded 
Flutie with a $22 million extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently big bucks don't guarantee thick skin. Throughout the  
preseason Phillips handled his two pricey quarterbacks like a pair 
of fragile Little Leaguers, granting them equal status on the depth 
chart as co-starters. But Johnson, the oft-sacked former USC star 
who fires bullets, but sometimes wanders into trouble, knew the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Doug's town and Doug's team,'' Johnson said, ``until  
something happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no doubt in Flutie's mind, either. ``I wasn't  
worried,'' said Flutie, who started three of the four exhibition 
games. ``I considered myself the starter and prepared as the 
starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If this quarterback thing is a problem, Jim Mora would love to  
have it. ``Nobody has a quarterback situation like Buffalo's,'' the 
Colts coach said. ``Nobody. They don't have to worry about losing 
their No. 1 guy, because they have two No. 1 guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie must continue to improvise in order to stay ahead of  
defenders -- and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie's favorite target is Eric Moulds, who broke Reed's team  
record with 1,368 yards receieving and set an NFL playoff record 
with 240 more yards against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed is 35, but if you're throwing into traffic, he's still the  
one you want standing in the middle of it. Tight end Jay Riermersma 
has the team's stickiest hands. He's backed up by two promising 
rookies, Sheldon Jackson of Nebraska and Bobby Collins of North 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Peerless Price, Buffalo's second-round pick, unofficially was  
chosen by Flutie the Bills' most impressive player in training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have cast a cloud over the ground game. Antowain Smith  
looked ready to bust out after a sophomore season in which he 
rushed for a respectable, if not remarkable, 1,124 yards. He 
averaged 3.8 yards a carry, down from his rookie year, and his 
longest carry was only 30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith aggravated a torn groin muscle. While the Bills seek  
to downplay the seriousness of the injury, Smith himself says he's 
about 95 percent. ``It gets sore after games,'' he said. ``It 
doesn't bother me when I'm running the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith struggled, and finished with 48 yards on 21 carries in  
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-round pick Shawn Bryson was lost for the season when he  
tore up his knee in camp. The Bills were excited about the 
fullback's versatility. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurman Thomas, who along with Reed and defensive end Bruce  
Smith is haunted by those lost Super Bowls, is back for a 12th 
season after accepting a reduced role behind Antowain Smith last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at an 11-5 or a 12-4 season,'' Thomas said.  
``We'll be one of the top teams in the AFC, if not the top team. 
But it's going to be tough. Our four losses could be right there in 
our own division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line sputtered early last season, but improved.  
This year there's one worry: right guard Joe Panos has been 
examined twice in the last week for a bulging disc in his neck. 
Panos has been replaced by demoted center Dusty Zeigler, who as 
recently as a few days ago wondered aloud if he would be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Smith returns for a 15th season to bolster a defense that  
ranked sixth in the NFL last season. Smith is the team's career 
leader in sacks with 163 and is second overall behind Reggie White, 
who had 192.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Smith imagine another Super Bowl? ``We have one heck of an  
opportunity here,'' he said. ``The AFC is pretty much wide open. If 
we stay focused, we'll be right where we need to be at the end of 
the season. The most important thing is starting off on the right 
foot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker John Holecek led the team in tackles both in the  
regular season with 133 and in the playoff game at Miami with 22 
last year after replacing Chris Spielman. 
</P>
<P>
	Nose tackle Ted Washington (101 tackles), veteran defensive end  
Phil Hansen (98 tackles) and second-year linebacker Sam Cowart (119 
tackles) are back. Top draft pick Antoine Winfield looks ready at 
cornerback.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Murderer of 3 Executed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VARNER, Ark. (AP) -- An Arkansas man was put to death Wednesday  
night for killing a father, mother and their daughter, who was 
raped before she died. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Gardner, 43, was executed by injection shortly after 8 p.m.  
for the 1985 murders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blessed ... are those who are called to the Lord's supper, a  
never-ending feast awaits me,'' Gardner said when asked if he had 
any last words. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner was the second execution to be held Wednesday night.  
Also scheduled for death was Alan Willett, 52, who killed his 
13-year-old son and his brother in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Wednesday, there had been 19 executions in Arkansas  
since the state resumed the death penalty in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II and Andrew J. McDonald, the Roman Catholic  
bishop of Little Rock, sent letters to Gov. Mike Huckabee asking 
him to spare the men's lives, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner killed Joe and Martha Joyce and their adult daughter,  
Sara McCurdy, in Fort Smith in December 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Willett was condemned in the September 1993 killings of his  
13-year-old son, Eric, and his mentally retarded brother Roger.

<HEADLINE> Pipe Bomb Evacuates GM Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Part of a General Motors Corp. plant was  
evacuated Wednesday after a supervisor found an envelope containing 
a bomb in his mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the Pontiac Service Parts Operations plant was  
evacuated about 4 p.m. after the ``suspicious object'' was 
discovered, said Jill Witzenburg, spokeswoman for GM Service Parts 
Operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pipe bomb with a fuse at one end,'' Pontiac Police  
Lt. Gerald Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb squad dismantled the device, and plant operations were  
cleared to resume Wednesday night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wayne, who works at the plant, said supervisors told  
employees they could leave or work in other areas of the plant. He 
estimated about 90 percent of the 700 second shift employees left 
early as he did. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears whoever left the bomb was more interested in sending  
a message than doing any damage, Hopkins told The Oakland Press of 
Pontiac. The device would have had to be lit manually to explode 
and could not have been detonated from an outside location, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they have no suspects.

<HEADLINE> Modell May Sell One-Third of Ravens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell plans to sell  
up to a third of the debt-ridden team by early next year, a 
newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on the price has ranged from $100 million to $150  
million but Modell told The (Baltimore) Sun Tuesday that the price 
could be even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still putting together the package,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Modell said he plans to attract investors by February or early  
March at the latest. Potential buyers may be asked to make bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell plans to retain control of the franchise formerly known  
as the Cleveland Browns, which he acquired in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Ravens completed what was then a record  
restructuring that required league approval. The team took on $185 
million in loans and other forms of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the team defaulted on $55 million in loans,  
prompting the NFL to bail out the team. The league arranged for $85 
million in credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Repayment is due in August 2000, but the NFL wants Modell to  
have investors lined up by early next year in the event he is 
unable to restructure his finances and the league is forced to sell 
the team, according to the Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens have retained the Baltimore-based investment banking  
firm, Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, to help evaluate proposals and 
negotiate an agreement.

<HEADLINE> Reno Asks Danforth to Probe Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno is negotiating  
with former Republican Sen. John Danforth the possibility of 
heading an independent inquiry into the government's use of force 
at the fiery end of the Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas, 
government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press on Tuesday that the Justice Department was in 
final negotiations over the details of the independent inquiry and 
an announcement could come as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials who spoke with the Justice Department  
Tuesday said they understood Danforth was willing to take the job. 
According to government lawyers and congressional officials, the 
Justice Department was considering appointing a second person to 
assist Danforth in the investigation and help to manage the 
day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, 63, would bring solid Republican credentials as well  
as a background in law enforcement. Before entering the Senate, he 
served as attorney general in Missouri for eight years. He retired 
from the Senate in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth also is an Episcopal priest, and both admirers and  
detractors have noted his moral integrity and his stubborn 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not return a call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Final touches were being put on the scope and nature of the  
investigation, said the sources, who include Republicans on Capitol 
Hill who had discussions Tuesday with Justice Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's decision comes as congressional Republicans have  
increased pressure on her and on FBI Director Louis Freeh to 
explain how evidence about the siege, including videotapes, was 
withheld from the public for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican lawmakers want to know whether the FBI lied  
about using incendiary tear gas canisters during the final raid on 
the compound on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reported today that Texas Rangers had  
found flares that were apparently fired by federal officials. The 
newspaper said the Rangers discovered the expended military 
illumination flares amid tons of evidence recovered Friday from a 
storage facility near Waco. Evidence logs showed more flares were 
recovered in the weeks after the Davidian compound burned following 
the FBI siege. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 sect members died, some of them children, in a fire  
that the government contends was set by sect members. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the committees looking into the raid has found evidence  
that the government was responsible for starting the fire, 
according to several aides familiar with the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP-led committees in Congress have begun  
reinvestigating the Waco matter. Democrats on Capitol Hill have 
asked the GOP to let the independent investigation sought by Reno 
take place before congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are recent revelations by the FBI that it fired several  
potentially flammable tear gas canisters at a storm shelter near 
the main Branch Davidian building hours before the main building 
went up in flames. The FBI and the Justice Department had 
previously denied use of any incendiary devices, and investigations 
will focus on whether this misinformation was the result of a 
bureaucratic slip-up or a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department insists there is no change in conclusions  
that it was David Koresh and his followers who started the fatal 
fire. The department also stresses that military special operations 
officers were on the scene only as observers and advisers, and not 
in an illegal capacity as participants in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have used the revelations to attack the credibility  
of Reno and the Justice Department. The White House has stood 
behind Reno, but President Clinton has declined to give a similar 
vote of confidence to Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know Danforth say he would bring instant credibility  
to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He calls them like he sees them,'' former Sen. Thomas  
Eagleton, a Missouri Democrat who served 10 years with Danforth, 
has said. ``Members of the Senate or House will have full faith in 
his finding.''

<HEADLINE> Water Distillers Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --About 16,000 water distillers are being  
recalled due to fire hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer, West Bend, has received three reports of  
distillers overheating but no injuries have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The distiller, which looks like a large coffee maker, is  
oval-shaped and made of white plastic with a clear, blue collection 
jug. The model number W10120 is labeled on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	The distiller was sold by direct selling dealers and  
door-to-door salesmen from May 1998 through August 1999 for about 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommends customers stop using the distillers  
immediately and call West Bend at 800-377-3038 to get a free pickup 
and repair of the water distiller.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Teachers To Vote on Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With a tentative contract hammered out between  
teachers and leaders of the city's struggling school system, 
parents were waiting to see if their children would be called to 
classrooms this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers gathered this morning at Cobo Center to vote on whether  
to temporarily extend their old contract, which would allow them 
and the district's 180,000 students to return to school as soon as 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers went on strike Aug. 30, one day before classes were to  
begin, after rejecting their union's proposal for a 10-day contract 
extension while talks over the new contract continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board and negotiators for the 11,500-member teachers  
union agreed on a tentative contract Monday. A ratification vote on 
the contract will be conducted by mail over the next week to 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of teachers slowly made their way into the center this  
morning, as dissidents passed out yellow flyers opposing the 
tentative agreement and other teachers expressed support for the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure hope we pass the contract. I'm ready to go back to  
work,'' Lorraine Ward, a teacher at Crockett Technical High School, 
said on her way into the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in Detroit, the nation's 10th-largest city, have been  
beset by mismanagement and chronically low test scores, attendance 
and graduation rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Gov. John Engler called for changes in the district's  
education system, citing poor test scores, high dropout rates and 
neglected buildings. The Legislature voted to remove the elected 
school board, replacing it with a board appointed by Mayor Dennis 
Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	The district's dropout rate for high school students was 26.4  
percent in 1997 and the four-year graduation rate was 29.7 percent 
-- much worse than any other large district in the state. As many as 
108,000 children in the district live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	A Detroit job training program, Focus:HOPE, has said that two  
out of three graduates of Detroit high schools who took an entrance 
exam for one program could not read or do math at an eighth-grade 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	The new school board proposed reforms including a longer school  
day, merit pay, and reduced class sizes. Detroit teachers, unhappy 
with some of the proposals, voted to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The new three-year contract dropped the district's merit pay  
plan, which proposed that teachers receive raises only in those 
schools whose test scores improved. The union argued such a plan 
would be unfair to top teachers in lower-performing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	David Adamany, who was hired as head of the district to help  
advance the reforms, insisted that merit pay still could be imposed 
without union approval. He said the Michigan Employment Relations 
Commission would be asked to decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The district also dropped its proposal to lengthen the school  
day from 6 hours to 8 1/2 hours. Teachers had said making classes 
smaller was a more important reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreement calls for smaller classes -- the goal is  
a maximum of 17 -- in kindergarten to third grade. It also would 
impose more restrictions on unexcused absences of teachers, a board 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract would give all teachers a 2 percent pay raise each  
year for the next three years. Teachers with more seniority and 
education would receive higher raises pegged to keep up with wages 
in suburban districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Whitty, a labor professor at the University of Detroit  
Mercy, said Tuesday the union and administration appeared to be 
``banking on the pay raise'' to ensure ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's close enough for it to go either way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The teachers walked out in defiance of a 1994 Michigan law that  
bars teacher strikes and fines them one day's pay for each day they 
strike. Legislative leaders have said they may move to seek 
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> 11 Vie To Lead Baptists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The nation's largest black denomination  
chooses a new leader from 11 candidates Thursday in an election 
that could indicate how far the organization will go to prevent the 
kind of abuses committed by its imprisoned former president, the 
Rev. Henry J. Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the candidates vying for the presidency of the National  
Baptist Convention USA say the group needs to reduce the power of 
its leader to avoid a repeat of the Lyons episode. He was convicted 
of bilking companies of more than $4 million to live in luxury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason Henry J. Lyons is not on stage with us today but in  
a bunk in a jail cell is the system,'' said the Rev. Jasper 
Williams of Atlanta, who unsuccessfully sought to have Lyons ousted 
in 1997 as he came under state and federal investigation. ``This 
system will corrupt any man no matter how good his intentions 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some, however, said the organization's problems left with Lyons.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Lyons had problems and he did some wrongs,'' said the Rev.  
Roscoe Cooper of Richmond, Va. But he added: ``It's a lie to say 
that our convention is in bad shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 60,000 delegates and guests are expected at the group's  
annual meeting. The convention, which traces its roots to 1880, 
claims 8.5 million members, though at Lyons' trial prosecutors said 
the figure was inflated to attract businesses. They said membership 
is around 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, 57, resigned after he was convicted in February of  
swindling $4 million from businesses and keeping nearly $250,000 
contributed by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith to rebuild 
burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, who was paid $100,000 as president, is serving 5 1/2 years  
in state prison. He also pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion and 
fraud charges and is serving a concurrent sentence of four years, 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	During a forum Tuesday, all but two candidates, one of whom was  
absent, referred to the Lyons scandal. While none said they could 
excuse Lyons' actions, some said they supported him during his 
legal troubles because he was the group's leader. 
</P>
<P>
	During Lyons' tenure, attendance at the convention-operated  
American Baptist College in Nashville, Tenn., declined, and loans 
to settle lawsuits are coming due. Still, Lyons helped reduce the 
group's debt on its Nashville headquarters from $6 million to less 
than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe he gave us the energy to reach higher heights,''  
said the Rev. Edward V. Hill of Los Angeles, a candidate who said 
he always would consider Lyons a friend. ``If you let me, I think I 
can continue the tradition of climbing higher and higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates said the convention's president wields too much  
power. Many board members are appointed by the president, and the 
president also has control of the group's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson of Mount Vernon, N.Y., described  
the presidency as an ``imperialist institution'' and advocated 
dismantling a ``rubber stamp wimp board'' by having board members 
elected to defined terms. Richardson also fought for Lyons' ouster 
during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The convention must change the way we conduct our business,''  
said another candidate, the Rev. A. Russell Awkard of Louisville, 
Ky. ``It is possible for the president to be respected.''

<HEADLINE> Modell Wants To Sell Part of Ravens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell hopes to sell  
a portion of his team by early next year to reduce the financial 
burden created by moving the team from Cleveland three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Modell retained a Baltimore-based investment banking  
firm to help evaluate proposals and negotiate an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to permanently reduce debt through the sale of a  
minority position in the franchise,'' said David Modell, Art's son 
and president of the Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Modell plans to attract investors by February or early  
March. He plans to retain control of the franchise, which he 
acquired in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not as interested in the money as I am in the right guy. I  
want somebody close to David's age, who can grow in the business,'' 
Art Modell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Ravens completed what was then a record  
restructuring that required league approval. The team took on $185 
million in loans and other forms of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the NFL took out a loan on behalf of the  
Ravens, who used the money to pay off creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Repayment is due in August 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are in superb, superb shape,'' Art Modell said last month.  
``It's no secret the NFL gave us a bridge loan to cover some of the 
bank loans, and that loan will be repaid between 60 and 90 days.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-N.C. State Wrestler Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A former North Carolina State wrestler  
received no jail time Tuesday but must make restitution and perform 
community service for a break-in at the home of another student who 
died in a struggle over a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Wake County Superior Court Judge Donald Stephens also sentenced  
former Atlantic Coast Conference heavyweight champion Clyde 
``Billy'' Blunt to 30 months of supervised probation and a 45-day 
suspended jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	One hundred hours of Blunt's community service will be spent  
talking to schoolchildren about the dangers of guns, violence and 
alcohol. Blunt also was ordered to pay a $500 fine and $13,329 in 
restitution to the victim's family. The judge also ordered him to 
undergo a mental health evaluation and to seek therapy if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury last week found Blunt innocent of involuntary  
manslaughter in the death of Neil Davis last November but convicted 
Blunt of misdemeanor breaking and entering. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt, 20, was one of several students who entered a house where  
Davis, 21, lived across the street from the off-campus party the 
students were attending on Nov. 22. Davis fired a gun into the 
party, authorities said, and a bullet fragment struck one of the 
party goers. Blunt and others who entered the house struggled with 
Davis before the gun went off, killing Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	During Blunt's trial defense lawyers claimed his acts were  
lawful because he tried to detain someone he believed had committed 
unlawful acts. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sentencing, Blunt told reporters he deeply regrets the  
death but does not regret his own actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very relieved,'' Blunt said. Jurors ``came out with the  
decision that they felt was just and right, and my condolences go 
out to the Davis family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No member of Davis family was in the courtroom Tuesday, but  
Stephens reviewed a letter from his mother asking him to send Blunt 
to prison for one year among other punishments. She did not attend 
the hearing because she was ill, and her husband has a heart 
condition, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt faced the most serious charge levied against 10 former  
N.C. State athletes related to the death of Davis. Eight athletes 
were disciplined for their roles in the fracas and shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Six besides Blunt were charged with breaking and entering and  
other crimes. One football player, Willie Kinte Wright, was charged 
with felony larceny of a firearm and is waiting for his trial to be 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt, of Modesto, Calif., said he hopes to re-enroll at N.C.  
State in January and wrestle again.

<HEADLINE> IMF Calls World Markets `Fragile' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A stock market plunge in the United States or  
a sudden weakening in the value of the dollar are two of the 
biggest potential threats facing the global economy as it struggles 
to emerge from the Asian economic crisis, the International 
Monetary Fund said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF, issuing its annual report on international capital  
markets, found a number of encouraging signs that the world is 
beginning to recover after nearly two years of economic turmoil. 
But the agency cautioned that global markets remain ``fragile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A key risk -- and one that has heightened in the past 12 months  
-- is the possibility of a large correction in the U.S. equity 
market,'' the IMF said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF report noted that U.S. stock prices have continued  
rising to new highs despite growing uncertainty about the ability 
of American corporations to maintain profit growth in the face of 
higher interest rates and a slowdown in economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also singled out a sudden drop in the value of the  
dollar as another major threat. The agency said such a decline 
could be triggered by growing concern -- by foreigners holding 
dollars -- over the sustainability of America's huge trade deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials, who briefed reporters on the new survey, stressed  
that they were not predicting a plunge in U.S. stock prices or the 
dollar, only highlighting what they see as the greatest risks to 
the global economy at present. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Fed  
policy makers have to pay closer attention to what happens on Wall 
Street because of its impact on economic decisions on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
	That view was echoed Wednesday by Federal Reserve Governor  
Laurence Meyer. Meyer said in a speech in Philadelphia that while 
the Fed was closely watching the rising stock market, ``I honestly 
do not know whether or not equities are fairly valued or 
overvalued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF report said another potential threat to the recovery  
could come from the Year 2000 computer problem if it disrupts 
global capital flows. 
</P>
<P>
	Many market interest rates have already been driven up by as  
much as a half-percentage point because of increased borrowing by 
corporations and some foreign governments to make sure they have 
enough cash on hand to deal with any possible disruptions, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian currency crisis, which began in July 1997, reached a  
peak last fall after Russia's default on billions of dollars worth 
of foreign debt sent shockwaves through global markets. Central 
banks, led by the Federal Reserve, rushed to the rescue with 
interest rate cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF noted a number of favorable developments this year have  
lessened the risks of a worldwide recession. These include 
``surprisingly robust'' growth in the United States and signs that 
Japan, which has been struggling with its worst recession in 50 
years, was beginning ``to take important measures to stabilize its 
economy,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IMF cautioned: ``Conditions in financial markets remain  
fragile, as evidenced by continued high levels of volatility ... 
and capital flows to the emerging markets that are running well 
below the rates during the boom years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF estimated that total net private capital flows to  
emerging markets plunged by 57 percent last year, dropping from 
$149.2 billion in 1997 to $64.3 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on capital markets and a companion economic forecast  
will serve as talking points when finance ministers and central 
bank presidents gather in Washington later this month for the 
annual meetings of the 182-nation IMF and its sister lending 
agency, the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary economic forecast was released prematurely in a  
Dutch finance ministry report on the ministry's Web site Tuesday. 
It showed the IMF believed the world economy would expand 2.8 
percent this year and 3.4 percent in the year 2000, representing 
upward revisions from IMF projections made in the spring.	   The Dutch report also said the IMF was close to abandoning 
efforts to sell 10 percent of its gold reserves on the open market 
to fund debt relief for poor nations because of strong objections 
by members of Congress that such sales would further depress the 
price of gold. 
</P>
<P>
	As an alternative, the IMF is considering selling gold to a  
group of central banks at higher market prices and then buying the 
gold back in a circular transaction that would allow the IMF to 
value the repurchased gold on its books at sharply higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, chairman of the House Banking Committee, said  
Wednesday that the new proposal is ``preferable to the original 
plan of selling gold on the open market.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Fight Orlin Norris in Oct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Orlin Norris, who despite a winning record and  
world title has boxed in the shadow of brother Terry, will be Mike 
Tyson's first opponent since his release from a Maryland jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-round fight Oct. 23 is signed for the MGM Grand in Las  
Vegas and will be televised on Showtime, a source close to Tyson, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the second bout of the year for Tyson, who was  
released May 24 from a Maryland jail, where he had served 3 1/2 months 
for assaulting two motorists over a fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris was a second choice to fight the 33-year-old former  
undisputed heavyweight champion. James ``Buster'' Douglas, who 
knocked out Tyson in a shocking upset in 1990, appeared to be the 
first choice but was ruled out for not being in good physical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris is the 33-year-old brother of Terry Norris, who was  
considered one of the best fighters in the world when he was a 
super middleweight champion early in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson already is training in Las Vegas for what will be his  
first bout since he knocked out Francois Botha with a right to the 
jaw in the fifth round Jan. 16 in the MGM Grand. Tyson was trailing 
on all three cards after four rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be only the second time in his 10 fights since 1990 that  
Tyson has not fought on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who was a WBA cruiserweight champion in 1993-95, has  
posted a 50-5 record since turning pro in 1986. He has 27 knockouts 
but he is known more as a crafty boxer than a banger. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris figures to give Tyson some rounds, which Tyson needs. He  
doesn't figure to have the power or strength to beat him. In two of 
his losses, Norris was stopped in the eighth round by Bert Cooper 
in 1990 and he was knocked out in the eight round by Nate Miller 
when he lost the cruiserweight title in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last fight, Norris stopped Pele Reid in the first round  
in England. In three fights before that, he lost a 12-round 
decision to Henry Akinwande and won 12-round decisions over Adolpho 
Washington and Nate Miller for the fringe IBA heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tyson-Norris fight is being billed as something called the  
WBC international heavyweight title.

<HEADLINE> Navy To Rethink Officer's Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is convening a special board to  
reconsider the promotion of a naval intelligence officer who claims 
he improperly was denied advancement after a laser beam damaged his 
eye as he flew over a Russian cargo ship in a helicopter in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
Wednesday the decision to reconsider Lt. John Daly's promotion to 
lieutenant commander was based on findings by the Navy's inspector 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Daly told a House Armed Services Committee hearing  
that he and the pilot of a Canadian surveillance helicopter 
suffered irreparable eye damage and that he believes the laser beam 
came from a Russian vessel, the Kapitan Man, that was sailing in 
the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy denied Daly's promotion in August. But on Wednesday the  
Navy decided it would convene a special board to reconsider that 
decision. It also said one document from Daly's personnel file 
would be removed and not included among the material considered by 
the promotion board. Officials declined to say anything more about 
the document, citing privacy concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon investigated Daly's claim of having been hit with a  
Russian laser and concluded from medical examinations that the 
injuries to his eye were consistent with retinal damage from a 
low-power laser device. But it said there was ``no evidence'' to 
prove it was a laser. No laser was found on the ship and the 
Russian captain denied having any such equipment.

<HEADLINE> Liabilities, Threats Burden Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Confronting everything from gym accidents to  
weapons bans, the nation's principals are worried about the 
lawsuits these incidents might bring. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why, they say, they've been forced to change sports  
equipment, complete stacks of paperwork, and generally cut back on 
long-distance field trips and other events where students might be 
difficult to supervise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever we plan for anything in a school today, our first  
consideration is how to avoid a lawsuit,'' said Vincent L. 
Ferradino, executive director of the National Association of 
Elementary School Principals. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say recent Supreme Court decisions holding schools  
accountable for student-to-student sexual harassment and making 
schools responsible for providing full-time nurses for disabled 
students have left schools open to more legal action. Educators 
also say they've been left vulnerable to liability over the strict 
bookbag bans, dress codes and crackdowns on bullying imposed in the 
wake of last April's deadly shooting at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tell our principals to err on the side of safety, but they  
say we have lawyers looking over our shoulders ready to pounce on 
us,'' said Gerald N. Tirozzi, executive director of the National 
Association of Secondary School Principals, which represents 45,000 
school leaders in middle, junior high and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The principals groups gathered Wednesday to announce an  
unofficial survey of principals by the American Tort Reform 
Association, which has criticized increased lawsuit judgments. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 523 principals who responded to a survey mailed to 5,000,  
nearly two-thirds said they had seen more school lawsuits in the 
last 10 years. About that many also said they expected litigation 
to increase in the wake of Littleton and the Supreme Court decision 
on sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The principal's responsible for the school,'' said Principal  
Joseph Pizza, who removed metal swings and monkey bars from the 
playground at Silver Bay Elementary School in Toms River, N.J. 
``Though you may not be in direct supervision of the child at the 
time, in essence you're carrying the bag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Definite numbers on lawsuits against schools and school boards  
are hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Law Association -- a Dayton, Ohio,-based group of  
lawyers and educators -- estimated about 930 school and college 
cases in state and federal courts in 1998. Stephen Yurek, general 
counsel for the secondary school principals' group, said members 
report nearly 300 lawsuits a year, up from fewer than 200 annually 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a Lehigh University education law professor said  
school-related lawsuits have decreased slightly since they peaked 
during the 1970s. Perry Zirkel said his research found that 10 
years ago, insurance companies were overcharging school districts 
because the litigation didn't justify the rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're sued, it gets dramatic and you get overly  
paranoid,'' Zirkel said of educators who complain of more lawsuits. 
``The courts are hearing fewer cases in education and increasingly 
courts are giving the benefit of the doubt to schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, smaller districts are spending $5,000 to $15,000 a  
year on routine legal matters, and time-consuming civil cases 
involving sexual harassment or employee dismissal can cost up to 
$50,000 per case, Yurek said. 
</P>
<P>
	For larger districts with 10,000 or more students, annual legal  
costs range from $250,000 to $1 million, and they can spend $50,000 
to $100,000 on a single lawsuit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even threats of lawsuits are costly, said June Million,  
spokeswoman for the elementary school principals. Such matters are 
often settled out of court, with families receiving a few thousand 
dollars, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of win-win for parents and parents' lawyers and  
lose-lose for the school system that's trying to avoid 
litigation,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Peacocks Cooperate To Spread Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Groups of peacocks strut their stuff in hopes of attracting the  
finest peahens, but only a few lucky guys will find a willing mate 
in the wild kingdom's equivalent of a singles bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have long wondered why the unsuccessful peacocks  
stick around the same group year after year when the hens tend to 
select the same few males each breeding season. 
</P>
<P>
	Research published Thursday in the journal Nature suggests a  
sound evolutionary reason: Many of the bird buddies within 
individual groups are brothers. By working together, the brothers 
are increasing the odds that their genes will be passed to another 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``By helping your relatives to attract mates, your genes are  
spread,'' said Marion Petrie, a researcher at Britain's University 
of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. 
</P>
<P>
	The research sheds light on why some peacocks seem unconcerned  
with sex and are content to be hangers-on in the animal singles 
scene: Larger groups of peacocks attract more females, so some of 
the peacocks are there just to make the group bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefits of helping closely related dominants to attract  
more females may outweigh the subordinate males' own meager mating 
opportunities,'' said Cornell University researcher Paul Sherman in 
an accompanying Nature commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie and her colleagues studied about 200 free-ranging peafowl  
in Whipsnade Park north of London. Using DNA fingerprinting, the 
researchers found birds inside the strutting groups are more likely 
to be related to each other than those outside the group. 
</P>
<P>
	But how do the related birds find each other? That's unclear,  
but it is not because the peacock brothers grew up together. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the researchers found that when peacock brothers were  
separated before hatching, and then were released into Whipsnade 
Park when they were yearlings, the brothers still tended to group 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	The mechanism by which the birds found their relatives is  
unclear. It could be by odor, feather patterns or the sounds the 
birds make. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some way in which kin can be associated, which  
doesn't require learning or environmental clues,'' Petrie said. 
``They didn't know their fathers or mothers. They could not 
possibly learn who their brothers were. They had no reference 
points to where they were born, but they still found each other.''

<HEADLINE> Cable Marks 10 Years in Classrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As millions of children head back to school, so  
do more than 40 cable television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	This month marks the 10th year of the Cable in the Classroom  
program, which has quietly wired schools across the country for 
free or low-cost cable TV service and provided programming for 
teachers to supplement their curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 networks participate, most airing educationally  
oriented shows without commercials in pre-dawn hours for teachers 
to tape and use later. Networks, such as CNN, Discovery and The 
Weather Channel produce shows specifically for students. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry estimates it has spent $1 billion on Cable in the  
Classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best use of television,'' said Judith McHale,  
president of Discovery Communications, Inc. ``It is an incredibly 
powerful medium. If used appropriately, it can really enhance a 
child's experience in the classroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The motives aren't entirely altruistic. If a network's  
programming piques a young consumer's interest, it might create a 
fan for life. Free hookups at schools seem a worthwhile investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of 800 teachers surveyed last year said they used  
videos or television programs with their classes, just under the 79 
percent who include computers. Two-thirds said they were aware of 
the cable service, and most of those use it, according to the 
survey paid for by Cable in the Classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Programming from PBS, Discovery, The Learning Channel and CNN  
was among the most widely sampled, the teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``C-SPAN has been popular among some of the teachers I've talked  
to,'' said Kathleen Lyons, a spokeswoman for the National Education 
Association in Washington. ``Many are using the series on the 
American presidents. People like C-SPAN because they view it as 
nonbiased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers union has worked with the cable industry to develop  
guidelines for appropriate programming and, in some cases, 
curriculum material to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television has been another arrow to put in a teacher's  
arsenal of teaching tools,'' Lyons said. ``It's not something that 
should be overused, but it definitely has its place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The programming specifically produced for students includes  
CNN's daily ``Newsroom,'' which discusses current events, and the 
new ``SportsFigures,'' an ESPN2 show in which athletes like Tiger 
Woods, Juwan Howard and Steve Young talk about the relationship of 
math and physics to sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks this month are showing some of their educational  
programming in prime time so parents can see what is being made 
available to schools. While occasionally some of what networks call 
educational seems a stretch -- like VH1's rock star soap opera, 
``Behind the Music'' -- most of it is solid and informative. 
</P>
<P>
	The History Channel, for example, presents a miniseries on ``The  
Great Depression.'' Outdoor Life Network airs a show on the grizzly 
bear and A&AMP;E showcases a biography of P.T. Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the decade, the networks have learned how to tweak their  
shows to make them more classroom-friendly. For example, Discovery 
has cut some programs into shorter segments because students and 
teachers prefer this format, McHale said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, cable companies have wired an estimated 85,000 schools  
across the country for TV service, said Megan Hookey, managing 
director of Cable in the Classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 500 hours of programming cable networks offer  
to the schools, Cable in the Classroom also offers teacher training 
in how best to incorporate this video into the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest barrier we have,'' Hookey said, ``is that not  
enough teachers know that it is available.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Prices Slip / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures were lower Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, slipping on technical factors after a 
recent run-up of prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures gave back a little over half of the gains  
obtained in Tuesday trading on ideas the market is overbought. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also reacted to the U.S. Agriculture Department's  
crop condition report, released after Tuesday's trading, showing 
that as of Sunday, 46 percent of the soybean crop was in the 
good-to-excellent range. That is down 1 percentage point from last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A lack of interest in U.S. soybeans by the foreign market also  
put pressure on futures. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in soybean prices was limited by continued concern  
that the crop will be smaller than the last estimate made the USDA 
of 2.87 billion bushels. The next crop estimate will be released 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures was pushed lower by the weakness in the soybean  
market and on fears the recent rise in prices may have scared away 
foreign buyers of U.S. wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell in league with soybean prices and on weak  
farmer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was 6 3/4 cents lower at $2.86 a  
bushel; December corn was 4 1/4 cents lower at $2.21 a bushel; 
December oats were 1 1/4 cents lower at $1.15 3/4 a bushel; November 
soybeans were 12 1/4 cents lower at $5.08 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures and hog futures prices were lower in trading on  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Lean hog futures were weakened by lagging consumer purchases and  
large meatpacker inventories, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle were .35 cent lower at 67.37 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle were .20 cent lower at 79.27 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs were .85 cent lower at 45.30 cents a pound; 
February frozen pork bellies were 1.25 cents lower at 54.30 cents a 
pound.

newswoman who put her life at risk during the war in Kosovo, as 
winners of its 1999 Gramling Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards are in their sixth year and given for work and  
initiative that contribute significantly to the news report and to 
the overall success of the world's oldest news service. The four 
award categories are journalism, achievement, spirit and 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year's winners exemplify the finest of AP reporting and  
dedicated service to newspapers and broadcasters around the 
world,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, AP president and chief executive 
officer. ``We take pride in their achievements and we celebrate 
their dedication and commitment to the AP.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nominations are made by the AP staff.  
</P>
<P>
	The judges, made up of a committee from various AP departments,  
issued a special statement honoring APTN producer Myles Tierney,

West Africa bureau chief Ian Stewart, who was critically wounded in 
the same incident; and Hrvoje Hranjski of Nairobi, who on Aug. 17 
was shot in Kisangani, Congo. The judges said they exemplified the 
courage, skill and spirit of the finest correspondents of the AP. 
``Their sacrifices remind us that our colleagues often stand in 
harm's way, dedicated despite the dangers to fair and compelling 
reporting,'' the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards are named after the late AP newsman and executive  
Oliver S. Gramling, who in 1941 developed the first AP radio wire. 
Gramling, who died in 1992 at age 87, directed that his estate be 
used to provide cash awards honoring the AP staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Gramling Award winners are:

communications in Washington, for being the backbone of AP 
communications in the nation's capital for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	--$3,000 Gramling Scholarship: George Garties, Los Angeles  
assistant bureau chief, to pursue studies of new tools for online 
news gathering; and Chris O'Hearn, output controller at APTN's 
London headquarters, to pursue management studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Formed in 1848, The Associated Press is the world's oldest and  
largest newsgathering organization, serving more than 15,000 news 
organizations worldwide with news, photos, graphics, audio and

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Randolph Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Looking absolutely gorgeous at a star-studded  
event or awards show can do more for a star's career than landing a 
plum role. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the look isn't stunning, watch out! Being ridiculed as a  
candidate for Mr. Blackwell's worst-dressed list is not the 
publicity most celebrities crave. 
</P>
<P>
	The red carpet is also the opportunity for designers to show  
their best. They send their dresses and accessories to the stars' 
personal stylists, hoping their design will be the one that 
television viewers will see on Emmy or Oscar night. 
</P>
<P>
	Randolph Duke, who has dressed Sharon Stone, Celine Dion and  
Cindy Crawford, knows what it takes to make a celebrity look great 
as she steps from the limo into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	He goes through dozens of designs to match the star with just  
the right outfit. Then he photographs each client wearing several 
different designs, letting the pictures steer her toward the right 
dress and away from the wrong one. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnie Driver knows the value of wearing the right dress. The  
garnet-red, full-length gown she wore to the 1998 Oscars got 
Tinseltown buzzing. It was THE dress everyone remembered when Duke 
parted company with Halston International last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Driver wore Randolph Duke at this year's Oscars, as did Kim  
Basinger, Geena Davis, Lisa Kudrow and Rita Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their endorsement is great, but the endorsement is only great  
if you flatter and make them look great or even better,'' Duke 
said. ``And I work with some pretty great beauties, so that's a 
challenge to make them look even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While television viewers watch the preshows for the hottest  
fashion trends, Duke has these words of caution: ``I don't go by 
this `abandon your wardrobe every season for the trendy and become 
a fashion victim' thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said every woman should remember that being stylish is about  
looking and feeling good, not about wearing the latest style. 
</P>
<P>
	As to the question of what is fashionable and what isn't, Duke  
has this response: ``Today it is hard to say what is good taste. If 
someone like Cher is good taste or bad taste, it's fabulous 
whatever it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke was set to debut his spring 2000 designs during New York  
Fashion Week (Sept. 11-17), an event that draws media and buyers 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm trying to bring to the eveningwear area is the  
sensibility of American sportswear, not literally that you should 
be wearing a turtleneck and jeans at night, but the idea that you 
can mix and match separates like you do your day clothes,'' the 
41-year-old designer said. 
</P>
<P>
	1. How did you approach your first collection for the new  
millennium? 
</P>
<P>
	Duke: I didn't think about the whole 21st century thing too  
much. I tried to put it on the back burner in the back of my mind. 
Trying too hard can often lead to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection is like a breath of fresh air -- a breeze. It has  
a somewhat underlying seafaring quality in feeling, the 
timelessness you feel when you are traveling or on the water. 
There's a lot of blue. Sky blue, chiffon painted to look like 
clouds, light and airy organza, beading that looks like it's 
reflecting water. 
</P>
<P>
	2. When women clean out their closets, what should be the first  
thing they toss? 
</P>
<P>
	Duke: With fashion being as cyclical as it is and everything  
coming back, I think there is a moment where you regret everything 
you throw out unless it is just darn right not flattering -- and 
unflattering is the in the eye of the beholder. Throw out things 
that don't make you feel good, don't lift your spirit. Those are 
the things to let go of. 
</P>
<P>
	3. What should they hold on to?  
</P>
<P>
	Duke: The things to hold on to are, even if they're old, things  
that have some kind of sentimental value, or you remember a time 
when you did feel great in it. You hold on to the really valuable 
classics that you can always work with new pieces that come into 
your wardrobe -- a great turtleneck sweater, a great-fitting pant -- 
a pant that really flatters your figure type. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Is there a signature or common theme to your designs?  
</P>
<P>
	Duke: No matter what the style is, there is some element of  
sexiness. But I want to be specific about that word. Sexy does not 
mean pushed-up breasts and a bustier and showing every inch of skin 
you can show on the body without being obscene. What is sexy to me? 
It's a certain confidence and not being afraid to play a little bit 
and have fun with it. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Do you lead a glamorous life?  
</P>
<P>
	Duke: I garden, exercise, ride bikes, run on the beach. I wear a  
sarong all weekend long in the summer. I don't think I'm brave 
enough to wear a sarong to the office yet but when I do, I'll be 
done. I will know I have come full circle.

<HEADLINE> CSX Offers Early Retirement Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- CSX Corp. is offering an early retirement  
and buyout program for non-union workers that the railroad company 
predicted would produce $75 million in annual savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Eligible employees who want to retire will be allowed to add  
three years to both their age and years of service for calculating 
pension benefits, CSX said Wednesday. Eligible employees who want 
to quit would get severance pay up to a year's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects 800 employees to apply and is anticipating a  
$55 million to $75 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 
1999 to fund the program. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX said a significant portion of that charge will come from the  
CSX pension plan, which the company says is overfunded. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond-based CSX Corp. operates the largest rail network in  
the eastern United States.

<HEADLINE> Watson Ready for Senior PGA Debut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Before Tom Watson could make his debut on  
the Senior PGA tour, he had to accept that age had slowed his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A year and a half ago, when I won the Colonial, it was, `Hey!  
I can still play with these guys,' '' Watson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, he made the cut in just seven of the 13 PGA  
events in which he competed, finishing no higher than 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who turned 50 Sunday, will make his seniors debut in the  
Comfort Classic at the Brickyard. The 54-hole tournament begins 
Friday on the grounds of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching other aging golfers such as Lee Trevino and Hale Irwin  
struggle to keep up with younger players helped convince Watson to 
change gears. His 1998 divorce from his wife of 25 years also 
affected his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was time to pass the baton, but it is hard to let go of it  
when you have to pass it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson remarried again last week, and believes his focus and his  
game are getting back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here because this is the first tournament I'm eligible  
for,'' said Watson, who will play a minimal fall schedule before 
competing in earnest next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My game is a little sporadic. My driver isn't going where I  
want it to go. But it isn't exactly out of control,'' he said. ``If 
I can shoot between 12- and 16-under, I should have a chance to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving from the rigors of competing against younger players over  
longer courses doesn't guarantee success on the seniors tour, said 
Watson, who had been the leading active winner on the PGA tour with 
34 professional victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Baiocchi won last year's Comfort Classic with a  
tournament-record 196, 20-under. Watson shot 68 during Wednesday's 
pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to be right on here to shoot the type of scores  
Hugh Baiocchi shot here last year,'' Watson said. ``The greens are 
holding much better than the greens on the regular tour. And these 
guys can flat play. I've been watching their scores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson said he's looking forward to playing against many of his  
old friends now competing on the seniors tour. But he won't see 
them all just yet. The tour's top four money-winners, Hale Irwin, 
Bruce Fleisher, Allen Doyle and Larry Nelson, are skipping this 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Watson expects the adrenalin to flow when he tees off  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is I will be in competition and I will be nervous,  
anxious and nervous,'' he said. ``I hope the first tee ball is a 
good one.''

<HEADLINE> Fuel Efficiency Rules Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The proliferation of gas-guzzling sport  
utility vehicles has increased the need to reconsider national fuel 
efficiency standards, some senators say in opposing a House-backed 
freeze on those standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, for the fifth straight year, passed a transportation  
spending bill in June that bars the government from even studying 
changes in the 1975 ``corporate average fuel economy,'' or CAFE, 
standards for new passenger cars and light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	That standard, set at 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 20.7  
miles per gallon for light trucks -- including pickups, minivans and 
SUVs -- has saved the nation 3 million barrels of oil a day and 
saved new car owners $3,000 at the gas pump over the life of the 
vehicle, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	But the auto industry strongly opposes efforts to further  
strengthen the standards, and for the past four years the Senate 
has acquiesced to House language in the transportation bill that 
effectively freezes the standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is expected to take up its version of the  
transportation bill in the next few weeks, and for the first time 
some senators are actively challenging the House provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Current CAFE standards have stagnated for nearly a decade,''  
wrote Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and 
Richard Bryan, D-Nev., in a letter to their colleagues seeking 
support for a nonbinding resolution putting the Senate on record as 
supporting improved fuel efficiency standards. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the average fuel economy of new passenger cars is at  
the lowest point since 1980 because of the sharp rise in sales of 
SUVs, which must meet only the more lenient light truck standards. 
</P>
<P>
	An SUV which averages 14 mpg emits 70 tons of carbon dioxide  
over its lifetime, compared with 38 tons for a car getting 27.5 
mpg, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators got 31 signatures on a letter to President Clinton  
seeking his help in raising CAFE standards. A rival letter backing 
a continued freeze got the signatures of 37 senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in a statement, strongly opposed the House  
restrictions, saying they deprive policy-makers of information that 
directly affects the environment. But it has never threatened a 
veto over the CAFE issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The auto industry says it is working to improve fuel efficiency  
without government interference and CAFE standards don't work when 
consumers aren't interested in smaller, more fuel-efficient 
vehicles. The industry also argues that tougher standards will 
drive up the costs of new vehicles, leading to more people staying 
with their older, less fuel-efficient cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers are working on technology to improve efficiency, said  
Greg Dana of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers at a news 
conference Wednesday. ``We are opposed to an absolute mandate that 
is being imposed on us by the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Mark of the Union of Concerned Scientists said automakers  
have the technology today to increase an SUV's fuel economy by 50 
percent. He said any extra technology cost would pay for itself 
within two years through reduced fuel costs.

<HEADLINE> New Fuel Efficiency Rules Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in five years, some  
senators are actively challenging a House-backed freeze on raising 
fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, in particular 
sports utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-one senators wrote President Clinton earlier this year  
seeking his help in improving fuel economy standards, saying new 
standards could dramatically cut air pollution and save American 
consumers millions of dollars at the gas pump. 
</P>
<P>
	Three senators, Slade Gorton, R-Wash., Dianne Feinstein,  
D-Calif., and Richard Bryan, D-Nev., may offer a non-binding 
resolution that would put the Senate on record as supporting a new 
government look at the standards. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Congress set the ``Corporate Average Fuel Economy'' or  
``CAFE'' standard at 20.7 miles per gallon for new passenger cars 
and 27.5 miles per gallon for light trucks -- new pickups, minivans 
and SUVs. A manufacturer's CAFE for autos would be the average fuel 
economy for all of its cars, from the tiniest subcompacts to 
full-size sedans. 
</P>
<P>
	CAFE supporters say the current standards save the country more  
than 3 million barrels of oil per day and the owner of an average 
new car $3,000 at the gas pump. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also argue that the average fuel economy of new  
passenger vehicles is now at the lowest point since 1980 because of 
the popularity of SUVs, which are subject to less stringent light 
truck standards. 
</P>
<P>
	For five straight years, however, the House has passed a  
Transportation Department spending bill with language banning 
government studies on changing the standards. It passed its 
transportation bill for fiscal 2000 last June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, which hasn't finished work on this year's bill, has  
never included such a provision in its transportation bill, but in 
the end has always gone along with the House version. 
</P>
<P>
	The auto industry opposes the CAFE standards, saying the  
industry will improve fuel efficiency without government 
interference and today's consumers aren't interested in smaller, 
more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers are working on technology to improve efficiency, said  
Greg Dana of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers at a news 
conference Wednesday. ``We are opposed to an absolute mandate that 
is being imposed on us by the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Mark of the Union of Concerned Scientists said automakers  
have the technology today to increase an SUV's fuel economy by 50 
percent. He said any extra technology cost would pay for itself 
within two years through reduced fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology that would achieve more fuel economy is being  
denied to the American public,'' said Dan Becker of the Sierra 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in a statement, strongly opposed the House  
restrictions, saying they deprive policymakers of information that 
directly affects the nation's environment. But it has never 
threatened a veto over the CAFE issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker said their hope was that enough senators would vote  
against the CAFE research ban to show the administration that 
Congress would back the president if he vetoed the spending bill 
over the CAFE issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But while 31 senators signed the letter supporting improved fuel  
efficiency, 37 have signed a rival letter backing the freeze.

<HEADLINE> Plummer Says He'll Start Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Jake Plummer said on Wednesday that his sore  
right thumb is improving daily and he expects to start Sunday in 
the Arizona Cardinals' season opener in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing,'' he said after the Cardinals worked out in  
107-degree heat on Wednesday. ``I'm starting and playing the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he hedged a little, giving himself a some wiggle room  
should his thumb worsen in the next day or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I come out here tomorrow morning and I can't move it and I  
can't even grip the ball, then I'm probably not going to go,'' 
Plummer said. ``But from what it's been doing, it's been healing 
and getting better every day, so I'm looking for tomorrow to be 
that much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin wasn't quite ready to pronounce Plummer the  
starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jake is taking some snaps. He did a lot more today than he did  
Monday,'' Tobin said. ``But this is only Wednesday, and we've got a 
long way to go. Hopefully, he'll be ready to go but right now I 
can't pronounce anything other than to say we've listed him as 
questionable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer sprained the thumb on his throwing hand when he was  
sacked on the first series in the exhibition game against Tennessee 
on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this week, he was able only to watch as the Cardinals  
worked out with backup Dave Brown at quarterback. The only passes 
he had thrown were with his Nintendo game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have one but I actually got one the other day,''  
Plummer said. ``I hate the game because I'm a good quarterback but 
I can't throw the ball at all in that stupid game. But it is good 
therapy for my thumb a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Including the playoffs, Plummer has started the last 27 games  
for the Cardinals. Entering his third NFL season, he already has 
thrown for 5,940 yards and 32 touchdowns. The injury was the first 
he's had of any consequence since his freshman season at Arizona 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been tough. It's been hard,'' he said. ``I've stayed in  
the mental side of it and tried to keep up on the offense. But it's 
tough to know you've got to come out here and stand around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During training camp, he said, he was throwing the ball better  
than ever, so the setback has been frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at least it's getting better,'' Plummer said. ``The more  
positive thoughts I give it, hopefully, the quicker it will heal. 
It just feels good to be in the huddle calling plays and have my 
teammates looking at me in the eye instead of walking by me and 
asking how my thumb's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer based his optimism on the daily progress he's made.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every morning it's been feeling better,'' he said. ``I've got  
four more days. I'm probably 85 percent now. If I'm 90-95 percent 
as far as being able to throw the ball with velocity, then I'm 
ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Tobin has continued to prepare his team for playing  
with or without its star quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he threw the ball better today. He looked more  
comfortable,'' Tobin said. ``We're trying to take it slow but also 
make sure he's getting enough work so if he's physically ready to 
go, he'll be mentally ready to go for the game.''

<P>
	Text of the anonymous letter received by about 25 umpires who  
oppose union head Richie Phillips, which was provided Wednesday to 
The Associated Press. The letter was postmarked Aug. 31 at Santa 
Ana, Calif. 

</P>
<P>
	How could you jump out of the foxhole in the midst of battle and  
desert your friends for your own selfishness? 
</P>
<P>
	How could you pledge your allegience to the ``intelligence'' of  
Joe Brinkman, Mark Hirschbeck and John Hirschbeck? 
</P>
<P>
	How could you forget that all you have is due to collective  
bargaining, done by Richie Phillips for you? 
</P>
<P>
	If you didn't agree with the resignation idea, why didn't you  
have the courage to oppose it at the July 14th meeting? 
</P>
<P>
	Remember -- you abandoned the ship! You sunk the ship!  
</P>
<P>
	Now you have to look at yourself in the mirror every day forever

<HEADLINE> 'King Lear' Delivers Great Acting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``King Lear'': the ultimate fierce family  
drama and Shakespeare's most demanding play. Not even ``Hamlet'' 
can match the exhausting challenges, both mental and physical, that 
``Lear'' makes on its lead actor. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, in Ted van Griethuysen, the Shakespeare Theater has  
found a yeoman performer who can handle the titanic struggles of a 
tormented monarch, blinded by pride and driven to grief and 
madness. For the most part, the rest of the cast matches him 
anguish for anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	A solid, almost beefy man, van Griethuysen at first plays Lear  
with the myopic confidence of a man used to getting his own way. 
This king has no trouble ordering servants about (they seem to 
always be pulling off his massive boots) or, in one of director 
Michael Kahn's more provocative conceits, listening with ego 
exposed as they and family members sing ``Happy Birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lear's initial robust appearance makes his fall all the more  
painful, particularly when he realizes the person he has hurt the 
most is his youngest daughter, the loyal Cordelia. Van 
Griethuysen's Lear crumbles with a swiftness that is astonishingly 
steep. 
</P>
<P>
	But then ``Lear'' is a play about physical and mental decline,  
too. Van Griethuysen is unsparing and unnerving in this rapid 
descent. Affecting, too. The king faces his own mortality, 
discovering what is important in life just as his begins to slip 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn has put together an intelligent, clear-headed version, even  
though the costumes are vaguely modern, or, at least, located 
somewhere in the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Audiences coming to ``Lear'' for the first time will have no  
trouble following the plot. When ``Lear'' decides to divide his 
kingdom among his three daughters, Kahn has the monarch slice a 
large, white birthday cake. The shares, of course, are inequitable, 
leaving out dutiful daughter Cordelia, the one who has the courage 
to speak the truth. The others, Goneril and Regan, lie, scheme -- 
and get the entire dessert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lear'' is Shakespeare at his most pessimistic about the ties  
that bind. Lear's disastrous family life is mirrored in the 
tribulations of the Earl of Gloucester, whose illegitimate son, 
Edmund, battles for control of his father's name and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Long's terrific Edmund sneers with style, snaking his way  
through the play with a sense of humor that never quite hides just 
how ambitious and evil this villain is. As Gloucester's dutiful son 
Edgar, Cameron Folmar can't quite compete. Folmar's portrayal of 
goodness just isn't as interesting, despite Edgar's decision to 
flee and feign madness. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Harmon (Regan) and Tana Hicken (Goneril) make worthy --  
and fashionable -- opponents. In the opening scene, Harmon, wearing 
an expansive feathery hat, stiletto heels and a tight black dress, 
looks as if she stepped out of the pages of a 1950s issue of 
Harper's Bazaar. Furs are big in this production, too, including 
one full-length number that could rile animal rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sabin's big bear Gloucester is plainspoken and direct. His  
reconciliation with his wronged son Edgar is one of the most 
touching in the play. Yet, deservedly so, the most heartbreaking 
moments involve Lear and Cordelia, here played by deaf actress 
Monique Holt, who signs her speeches. They are spoken most often by 
the Fool, the bespectacled Floyd King. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fool, the wisest person in the play, is a difficult role,  
hard to make funny without seeming to be silly. King accomplishes 
the task. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt's interaction with King and later with van Griethuysen are  
gentle and sweet, particularly in the play's final scenes when a 
dying Lear tries haltingly to communicate with his daughter in sign 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	Set designer Georgi Alexi-Meskhishvili has placed the play in an  
almost primitive netherworld, with oil cans scattered across a 
stage that has all the warmth of dark cave. Its gloom is initially 
pierced by ominous music and cone-shaped shafts of light that 
rarely appear during the rest of the play. Not an inviting place. 
</P>
<P>
	But then ``King Lear'' unfolds during unsettled times. That  
dislocation comes through here. Even if the times are uncertain, 
Kahn's production, which opened Tuesday, anchored by van 
Griethuysen's powerful and affecting performance, is not. 
</P>
<P>
	``King Lear'' runs through Oct. 24.

<HEADLINE> High Court Getting Minority Clerks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court will start its 1999-2000  
term next month with the most minority law clerks in recent memory, 
but they were chosen before the justices' hiring practices came 
under fire from civil rights groups and some members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new class of 35 law clerks at work for the highest  
court's nine justices are five minority clerks -- two blacks and 
three Asian-Americans. Last year's class included one, a Hispanic. 
Court employees could not remember any recent term in which the 
justices employed more than three minority clerks. 
</P>
<P>
	Each justice hires three or four recent law school graduates to  
help with screening new cases and researching and drafting 
opinions. The one-year jobs are prizes for young lawyers, most 
often leading to high-paying posts in law firms or law schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999-2000 law clerk class includes 23 men and 12 women, all  
of whom previously worked for federal appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today reported in March 1998 that blacks comprised fewer  
than 2 percent of the law clerks hired by the courts current 
justices during their tenures, and that fewer than 25 percent of 
their law clerks had been women. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, three members of Congress urged the justices to  
participate in ``a dialogue with minority bar associations 
regarding the hiring process.'' But Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist told Reps. Danny Davis of Illinois, Elijah Cummings of 
Maryland and Gregory Meeks of New York, all Democrats, that such a 
dialogue would be ``inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,  
National Organization for Women and the predominantly black 
National Bar Association also criticized what they perceived to be 
the court's lack of commitment to racial and gender diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP President Kweisi Mfume was among 18 people arrested in  
October for carrying a protest demonstration onto court property. 
</P>
<P>
	The court routinely chooses law clerks a full year before they  
begin work. All 35 current law clerks were chosen by last summer, 
court sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before a House appropriations subcommittee in March,  
Justices David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas, the court's only 
black member, defended the court's collective hiring record. Both 
said the justices rely on recommendations from law schools and 
federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivy League law schools for years have provided the bulk of  
Supreme Court law clerks, and some federal appeals court judges 
have earned reputations as ``feeders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current 35 law clerks include four who previously worked for  
J. Harvie Wilkinson III, chief judge of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals, and three who worked for his conservative 4th Circuit 
colleague, J. Michael Luttig. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia hired three of those clerks. The others  
are working for Thomas, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the new law clerks spent last year working for Judge  
Michael Boudin, a liberal member of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals. They were hired by Souter, John Paul Stevens and Stephen 
G. Breyer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Questioned in Herman Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was questioned under oath  
for an hour today in the federal investigation of 
influence-peddling allegations against Labor Secretary Alexis 
Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview was conducted by Independent Counsel Ralph  
Lancaster and two associates, John Kotelly and David Barry. Also 
present were the president's two personal attorneys, David Kendall 
and Nicole Seligman, and three representatives of the White House 
counsel's office, Beth Nolan, Cheryl Mills and Karl Racine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consistent with prior practice, no further statement about the  
interview will be made,'' Nolan said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation centers on allegations that Herman, before  
joining the Cabinet, engaged in influence-peddling and solicited 
$250,000 in illegal campaign contributions. She has denied the 
allegations, and Clinton has said he is confident that 
investigators will conclude that Herman did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman's accuser is Laurent Yene, a Cameroon citizen doing  
business in the United States. He told the Justice Department that 
Herman, while a White House aide, had an agreement to receive a 10 
percent kickback for aiding the clients of International 
Investments and Business Development, a company co-owned by 
Herman's close friend, Vanessa Weaver, and by Yene, according to 
information released earlier by Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	He also claimed Herman directed Weaver to solicit campaign  
contributions to the Democratic National Committee from the 
company's clients, one of whom was a foreign national and thus 
barred from contributing to U.S. election campaigns. These 
donations were allegedly to facilitate favorable government action 
on the clients' business. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing numerous bank-account and other documents and  
more than 100 interviews, including some with Herman, Reno said her 
investigators ``uncovered financial transactions potentially 
corroborative of Yene's allegations which require further 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has described Herman as fully cooperative with the  
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Raises Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England increased its base lending  
rate for the first time in more than a year, following a string of 
seven cuts, in a move that surprised economists and homeowners and 
angered industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's increase to 5.25 percent from 5 percent was the first  
since June 1998. It followed growing evidence that Britain's 
economic recovery is speeding up and amid fears that the housing 
market is heading for an '80s-style boom. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's Monetary Policy Committee said it had considered both  
the housing and labor markets in making its decision to raise the 
interest the central bank charges on loans to commercial banks by 
one-quarter point. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rise in interest rates was necessary to keep inflation on  
track further ahead,'' it said in a statement. ``An early move 
could lower the level at which interest rates might otherwise need 
to be set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee added that it expects inflation to remain below  
the target of 2.5 percent in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
	The Halifax Bank reacted to the increase by immediately  
announcing an increase in its standard variable mortgage rate to 
6.99 percent from 6.85 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And the British Chamber of Commerce said the move threatened to  
derail Britain's economic recovery by making it more expensive for 
companies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (committee) has yielded to the panic calls of the prophets  
of boom and this decision will shock and infuriate business,'' said 
Ian Peters, the chamber's deputy director general. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Parker, senior economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, called  
the move ``unwarranted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going for a pre-emptive strike,'' he said. ``There  
are signs in the housing market of rapid inflation, but that has 
not spread into other parts of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House prices have jumped by almost 10 percent in the last year.  
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Bank of England raised the base rate was June  
4, 1998, when it was increased to 7.50 percent from 7.25 percent.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British pound rose against the dollar in  
Europe this morning after the Bank of England announced a 
quarter-point interest increase in a key interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The pound was quoted at $1.6218 in afternoon trading, up sharply  
from $1.6070 just prior to the Bank of England's mid-day 
announcement that it was raising its base interest rate -- at which 
it lends money to banks -- by one-quarter of a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0579, down from  
$1.0595. The dollar was quoted at 110.98 Japanese yen, up from 
110.79; 1.5102 Swiss francs, up from 1.5085; and 1.4886 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4884. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth: 1.8488 German marks, up from 1.8460; 
6.2006 French francs, up from 6.1912; 2.0831 Dutch guilders, up 
from 2.0800; and 1,830.30 Italian lire, up from 1,827.53.

<P>
	Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $256 bid per  
troy ounce at midmorning, up from $255.60 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich the bid price was $255.75, down from $255.95.

<P>
	Gold rose 90 cents in Hong Kong to close at $256.15.

<HEADLINE> Art Schlichter Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- Art Schlichter's gambling addiction could  
send him back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Released last week after serving less than half of a prison  
sentence of more than four years, the former Ohio State and NFL 
quarterback pleaded innocent Tuesday to new charges that he used 
prison pay phones to bet on football and hockey games through a Las 
Vegas bookmaker last November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been out of prison for five days. I've done everything  
they've asked me to do. I feel good,'' Schlichter said after his 
preliminary hearing in Anderson City Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter was transferred from the Correctional Industrial  
Facility to another state prison after prosecutor Rodney Cummings 
issued warrants on four misdemeanor counts of illegal gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an additional count of check deception from an  
incident in 1995 that had been pending,'' Cummings said Tuesday 
after the initial hearing in Anderson City Court. ``I suspect it 
was because he was incarcerated, so there are five counts, not just 
the four for unlawful gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A trial date was set for Nov. 17.  
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter admitted to an Indiana State police investigator that  
he ``had a relapse and needed help,'' according to a report 
published Aug. 26 in the Herald Bulletin of Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter, now living in Indianapolis, said he sees this time  
in his life as an opportunity to show others he can overcome his 
addiction and perhaps be considered a role model to others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long battle. Jail's a difficult place to be in  
recovery,'' he said. ``Prison's tough. I wouldn't recommend it. 
It's difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter won early release through good behavior and by  
earning two college degrees while in jail, spokesman Randy Koester 
of the Indiana Department of Correction said today. He remains on 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter avoided transfer to the Madison County Jail by  
posting $5,000 bond, Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge of check deception carries a maximum sentence of one  
year. Each of the four gambling charges could add 180 days. If 
convicted, Schlichter could be ordered to serve consecutive 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Schlichter was sentenced to more than four years in  
prison on charges of theft, forgery and fraud in connection with 
the theft of $800,000 to support his gambling habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Before beginning his Indiana prison term, Schlichter served a  
federal sentence in Kentucky for a probation violation. He 
surrendered to Indiana authorities Jan. 26, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter, a first-round draft by the then-Baltimore Colts in  
1981, was suspended by the NFL in 1983 when it was learned that 
bookies had threatened him over $150,000 in gambling debts. 
Schlichter returned in 1984 to the Colts, who by then had relocated 
to Indianapolis, and was released following the 1985 season.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Star Blast, Black Hole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have found some of the best evidence yet to support  
the theory that the cataclysmic explosions of giant stars can lead 
to black holes, some of the strangest and least understood objects 
in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers analyzed the gases near a star that wobbles around a  
suspected black hole, and concluded that the chemicals could have 
originated only in the blast of a neighboring supernova. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Black holes are massive celestial objects whose gravity is so  
powerful that nothing -- not even light -- can escape from one. 
Scientists cannot actually see a black hole, but they can infer its 
existence from the effects on the orbits of nearby stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Black holes are believed to form in two different ways: when a  
star runs out of fuel and collapses, or when a dying star explodes. 
The debris from such a blast falls back onto itself to create a 
black hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to establish the physical conditions of the star  
that ended in a supernova and provide a connection between the 
supernova and black hole formation,'' said Rafael Rebolo, study 
co-author and researcher at the Institute of Astrophysics of the 
Canary Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers have long suspected that a black hole and a visible  
star existed side-by-side in the constellation Scorpius about 
10,000 light-years from Earth. Large bursts of X-rays -- evidence of 
matter swirling around a black hole -- were detected nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebolo and his colleagues analyzed the spectrum of the visible  
star to try to decipher its chemical composition. They found an 
overabundance of oxygen, magnesium, silicon and sulfur -- elements 
that could not have been produced by the visible star. Instead, the 
researches speculated that the elements were spewed during the 
explosion of its now-dark neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way you can produce an excess of these elements is  
through several billions of degrees,'' Rebolo said. ``The only way 
to reach these temperatures is when a star goes to a supernova 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former star was probably about 40 times more massive than  
the sun before it exploded an estimated 1 million years ago, he 
said. Such a blast might have been visible from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers said the Spanish researchers are the first ever to  
offer convincing evidence of the birth of a black hole from a 
supernova explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The explanation offered by the researchers is the most  
straightforward and logical one,'' said John Cowan, professor at 
the University of Oklahoma in Norman. ``There could be some other 
explanation, but it would have to be more convoluted.''

<HEADLINE> Delta, Pilots Union Open Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines pilots, trying to get an early  
start on contract negotiations, said Wednesday they want a bigger 
piece of the airline's profits, which have soared to billion-dollar 
levels since the last contract was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents Delta's 9,200  
pilots, exchanged its proposal with the company about six months 
before the current contract's ``amendable date'' of May 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side disclosed salary specifics, which are expected to  
dominate the talks. To help push the nation's third-largest carrier 
back to profitability, pilots offered Delta substantial wage 
concessions during the last contract negotiations in 1996 and are 
seeking to recoup them in the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Delta posted a record $1 billion profit in 1998  
for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta contract talks come at a time of increased airline  
industry profitability -- and labor strife. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Northwest pilots went on a 15-day strike before  
reaching a contract with the airline. And American Airlines pilots 
staged an illegal job action in February over the integration of 
Reno Airlines into the airline's operations, disrupting hundreds of 
thousands of flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks won't be easy or short, said Julius Maldutis, an  
analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	``After six consecutive years of profit, it's not surprising  
that (airline) labor in general has grown much more militant,'' 
said Maldutis, who predicted the Delta talks will lead to federal 
mediation. ``The pilots are saying, 'We want it back, plus some.' 
'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Chuck Giambusso, chairman of the Delta pilots' union,  
called the pilots' proposal ``ambitious, but fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to our company and to achieving a timely and  
superior agreement,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides salary raises, the pilots are seeking better training  
pay, codification of rest rules, reduction in the amount of 
regional jet flying performed by Delta subsidiaries, growth in the 
number of pilot jobs and better vacation and retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots also want a voting member on Delta's board of  
directors, instead of the nonvoting seat they now hold, and 
elimination of a lower pay scale for pilots who fly for Delta 
Express, Delta's low-cost unit based in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta was pleased by the pilots' invitation to begin the  
negotiations early, Delta spokesman John Kennedy said Wednesday. 
Under federal law, pilot contracts do not expire, but have dates at 
which they can be altered. 
</P>
<P>
	We recognize there are significant issues to address and are  
looking forward to working with ALPA on these,'' Kennedy said. 
``We're happy that it's started early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Andy Deane, a 727 pilot and union spokesman, described the  
proposals as ``wish lists'' that will be studied by the opposing 
side for several weeks. Direct negotiations are scheduled to begin 
next month.

<HEADLINE> UPN Beats WB in Ratings Again / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At a time when its future is the subject of new  
questions, the UPN television network can take comfort in some 
small victories. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN narrowly beat its mini-network rival, the WB, in the ratings  
for the second straight week -- the only two times it has done so 
since April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not quite a fair fight, since UPN has gotten a jump on the  
fall season by premiering a handful of its shows while the WB is 
airing mostly reruns. But UPN's new Thursday night wrestling series 
had higher ratings than anything on either network last week and 
Jaleel White's new sitcom, ``Grown Ups,'' shows signs of being a 
modest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN is half-owned by Viacom, which announced its plans to  
purchase CBS this week. Under current federal regulations, Viacom 
would not be allowed to own more than 33 percent of UPN. So the 
young network will likely be sold, shut down or folded into CBS if 
the rules can't be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's chairman, Sumner Redstone, would not tip his hand on  
UPN's future but indicated he was happy at the company's efforts to 
turn around by concentrating on a young male demographic. 
</P>
<P>
	``UPN is doing a lot better than it was,'' Redstone said.  
</P>
<P>
	CBS won the Nielsen Media Research prime-time ratings crown  
during a lackluster week, where the most popular show was an 
exhibition football game. CBS had a 6.4 rating and 12 share, NBC 
had a 6.0 rating and 11 share, ABC had a 5.8 rating and 11 share, 
and Fox was at 4.2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN had a 2.3 rating and 4 share, the WB had a 2.2 rating and 4  
share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``NBC Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with  
a 6.9 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.7 
rating and 15 share and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 6.0 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.

<HEADLINE> Ferraro Starts Over With Thrashers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- This is training camp, a time when 15-year  
veterans like Ray Ferraro are supposed to be working themselves 
into shape at a leisurely pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Atlanta Thrashers center is scooting around the ice  
during a scrimmage like it's Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final minute of a game that doesn't count, he wins the  
faceoff, charges toward the net and runs over the opposing goalie 
in an unsuccessful attempt to the jam the puck in for the tying 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	A few seconds later, his squad having lost 2-1, Ferraro heads  
off the ice, head down and rocking back and forth, clearly angry 
that he didn't convert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win, absolutely,'' he said. ``I had a couple of  
chances to score and I didn't score. I don't like that. I don't 
care what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazingly, Ferraro has managed to keep that attitude even though  
he's never come close to his ultimate goal: winning a Stanley Cup. 
At age 35, after a career spent mostly with mediocre teams like the 
Hartford Whalers, New York Islanders and Los Angeles Kings, Ferraro 
seemed to accept his fate when he signed with the expansion 
Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he won't change the way he plays this game or anything  
else in life. He refuses to let his kids -- ages 11 and 8 -- win at 
checkers. He gets upset when he shoots a bad round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fortunate to still be playing,'' said Ferraro, who had 13  
goals and 18 assists for the Los Angeles Kings last season. ``But 
when I look around and see all these young guys, I say to myself, 
`There's no way in hell I'm going to let them take my job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferraro was on the verge of retiring after operations on each  
knee in the space of two years. The game had lost its appeal, his 
knees aching and the losses piling up during his final season with 
the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't scoring goals and I wasn't playing,'' he  
remembered. ``It kind of sucks the life out of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the final 25 games last season, Ferraro's knees began to feel  
better and he showed he would still find his way to the net, 
boosting his career totals to 346 goals and 395 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told years ago that I wasn't big enough or quick enough  
to play this game,'' the 5-foot-9 Ferraro said. ``I like proving 
people wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He insists that his knees feel better than they have in years.  
Once again, he's able to do things in the weight room -- squats and 
other leg exercises -- that used to cause excruciating pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers, woefully lacking in goal scorers, really had  
nothing to lose when they signed Ferraro to a two-year contract 
that will pay him around $1 million this season, with the 
second-year salary based largely on what he does in 1999-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason why he can't get into the mid-20s again,''  
general manager Don Waddell said, referring to Ferraro's 
goal-scoring potential. ``And his competitive nature really stands 
out. Some old guys lose that. Not him. He's a competitive son of a 
gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compete all he likes, Ferraro is smart enough to realize the  
Thrashers are years away from contending for a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, when I came to an expansion team, I knew there was  
some work to do here,'' he said. ``Whether I get a chance to play 
for the Cup, who knows? But I want to compete and I'm excited about 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He attributes his strong work ethic to his late father. Starting  
out with virtually nothing, Ed Ferraro helped start a concrete 
company in western Canada in 1947, then spent the rest of his life 
going to work early and getting home late. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be embarrassed not to give a full effort,'' Ray  
Ferraro said. ``I saw my dad put in lots and lots of hours. He 
didn't sit in the office wearing a suit. He was out there working 
hard every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is his son.

<HEADLINE> Women, Men Differ on Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans favor tougher gun laws, though  
sentiment for gun control has dropped somewhat in the four months 
since the deadly Littleton school shootings boosted support for 
such restrictions, an Associated Press poll suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong backing for tougher gun laws by women is a major reason  
for the majority support, according to the poll by ICR of Media, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	American women say stricter weapon laws would curb violence,  
while men want better enforcement of existing laws, the poll finds. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey found that 56 percent of American adults  
favored stricter gun laws and 39 percent opposed them. Sixty-six 
percent of women favored the tougher laws, compared with 45 percent 
of men. Thirty percent of women and 49 percent of men were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Theresa Flippin, a 24-year-old factory worker from Yellville,  
Ark., believes people should be able to own guns and use them for 
hunting. But she wants tougher gun restrictions on people who have 
criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last five years, it's really gotten out of control,''  
she said, ``the school shootings, the drive-by shootings, the 
road-rage shootings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-April, just before the Colorado shootings, 55 percent of  
adults favored tougher gun laws. When the question was repeated in 
an AP poll a week after the shootings, the proportion jumped to 63 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But while a majority favors stricter gun laws, only 43 percent  
in the latest poll said new laws would be more effective in 
reducing gun violence than better enforcement of existing laws. 
Those numbers are statistically unchanged from the poll taken 
before the shootings, but represent a sharp shift in opinion as 
measured in the post-shooting poll, when 51 percent chose tougher 
gun laws and 39 percent picked better enforcement of existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion on this question is fluid, evidenced by the  
shifts in the AP polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have found divisions in their own ranks. The Senate,  
with the help of some Republicans, agreed to legislation that 
requires background checks at all gun shows, outlaws the importing 
of large-capacity ammunition clips and requires the sale of safety 
locks with handguns. House Republicans initially stripped out that 
language, but later asked for a compromise version that would 
require background checks for firearms sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of Americans say recent shootings in the news  
have made them worry more about their own safety. Almost two-thirds 
of women said they were likely to feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry about my daughter when she goes to school,'' said  
47-year-old Karen Cloud, a nurse from Lexington, Ky. Several women 
in the poll, when asked in interviews later how recent violence 
affects them, mentioned school shootings first. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cloud said she wasn't surprised there is a gender gap on the  
gun control issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of men are just fascinated with guns and want to  
have them,'' she said. ``I dated a guy who insisted that I learn 
how to shoot this rifle. It was so heavy, I couldn't even hold it. 
I went out and shot cans with it, but there was no point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Rowe, a 73-year-old semiretired contractor and gun  
enthusiast from San Diego, also attributes the differences in 
opinion to gender. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women have the mother instinct and don't want guns around,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,026 people taken Aug. 27-31 indicated that blacks  
were far more likely than whites, by 83 percent to 52 percent, to 
support tougher gun controls. The poll had an error margin of plus 
or minus 3 percentage points, larger for subgroups like men and 
women. Democrats were far more likely than Republicans to support 
more restrictions, by 71 percent to 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democratic candidates for president, Vice President Al Gore  
and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, have suggested stringent 
steps to control access to guns. GOP front-runner George W. Bush, 
the governor of Texas, said recently that he agrees with some gun 
control steps, such as raising the age of gun ownership to 21 and 
banning large ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the men interviewed in the poll, 54 percent, said  
they felt that recent shootings in the news were random acts of 
violence that don't affect them personally, while 41 percent said 
they felt threatened. Some of that may be attributed to the 
difference in how men and women view guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see all the shootings,'' said Rowe, the San Diego  
contractor. ``I have guns of my own, about 18 guns, rifles, pistols 
... 
</P>
<P>
	``I just like to look at them,'' said the World War II veteran.  
``I buy them just like a woman would buy a diamond.''

<HEADLINE> Giants Looking To Rebound This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- In years past, seeing New York  
Giants' defensive players inch from the bench toward the sidelines 
meant only one thing -- another three-and-out series for one of the 
NFL's worst offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been an adjustment during the preseason.  
</P>
<P>
	The defensive players were getting closer to get a better look  
at Kent Graham and the West Coast offense. For the Giants are 
heading into the 1999 season with something they haven't had in 
more than a decade -- an offense seemingly capable of making big 
plays and scoring that could, if it continues, make people forget 
last season's 8-8 record one year after winning the NFC East in Jim 
Fassel's rookie season as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	It will all start on Sunday in Tampa against another team that  
was a disappointing .500. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offense has an air of confidence about them that is  
encouraging,'' safety Percy Ellsworth said. ``We're feeding off it, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	The offense, which ranked 29th in the league last season, has a  
lot more weapons this year, starting with Graham, the eighth-year 
journeyman quarterback who led the team to a 5-1 record after 
replacing Danny Kanell as the starter last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing only limited action in exhibitions, he hit 40 of 62  
passes for 609 yards, five touchdowns and one interception. Graham 
played so well that Kerry Collins, signed to a $16.9 million 
contract in the offseason, never challenged for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of center Brian Williams, who missed two seasons with  
an eye injury, has solidified the offensive line that will have 
first-round draft pick Luke Petitgout starting at left guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing of free agent Pete Mitchell has given the team its  
first legitimate pass-catching tight end since Mark Bavaro, while 
receivers Amani Toomer, David Patten and Joe Jurevicius all 
contributed big plays in a preseason in which the Giants averaged 
24.3 points. New York had only six pass plays of 40 yards or more 
all last season. They had eight in four preseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without a doubt, the biggest difference is the functioning of  
the quarterback and we've got some receivers making plays,'' Fassel 
said. ``Our offense has shown vast improvement in some areas we 
needed to improve. We need to continue that in the regular season, 
and the play of Kent Graham is crucial to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants will be without leading rusher Gary Brown for the  
first month because of a knee injury. That will put the ball in the 
hands of surprising rookie Sean Bennett; LeShon Johnson, who missed 
last season recovering from cancer, and fullback Charles Way. 
</P>
<P>
	It might also give Fassel an excuse to throw more.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really anxious to see our offense go to work in the  
regular season,'' said Michael Strahan, the two-time All-Pro end 
who signed a $32 million contract in training camp, making him the 
league's second-highest paid defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	If the offense performs, it will take pressure off a defense  
that has some question marks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedric Jones, who has yet to live up to his billing after being  
taken with the fifth pick overall in the 1996 draft, will start at 
right end in place of Chad Bratzke, who signed with Indianapolis 
after an .11-sack season. 
</P>
<P>
	The other concern is at right cornerback, where it appears  
veteran Jeremy Lincoln will open the season. The spot originally 
has been seen as one of the Giants' strengths, with Jason Sehorn 
and Conrad Hamilton battling for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	However, both have been injured throughout training camp.  
Sehorn, who missed all of last season with a knee injury, has been 
plagued by a hamstring problem, while Hamilton injured a knee and 
ankle a week into camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The other change is Ryan Phillips replacing Marcus Buckley at  
strongside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that Pro Bowl linebacker Jessie Armstead is  
healthy. He played all of last season with a badly sprained ankle 
that limited his mobility. Armstead is still haunted by last 
season, when the Giants lost seven of their first 10 games and then 
just miss after a late run that included a win that ended Denver's 
13-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst feeling is sitting at home with the playoffs are  
going on and you're saying: `If we were out there we could compete 
against these guys,''' Armstead said. ``I don't want to have that 
same feeling this year. This is our time to make our statement. We 
got to make our statement come Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, the Giants need performances from both offense and  
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan, who had 15 of New York's 54 sacks last season, doesn't  
hesitate to say the Giants will go to the playoffs if they get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of teams in this league that are playoff  
teams,'' he said. ``We have to prove we want it more than they do. 
But if we go out and play like we are capable we are definitely a 
playoff-type team.''

<HEADLINE> Oregon Plant Explosion Injures Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ore. (AP) -- An explosion at a titanium manufacturing  
plant, so powerful it was felt 10 miles away, left one worker 
critically burned and four others injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night's blast at the Oremet-Wah Chang plant, about 65  
miles south of Portland, occurred during the titanium melting 
process in one of the plant's buildings, said fire department 
spokeswoman Wanda Omdahl. 
</P>
<P>
	It was apparently sparked when water seeped into a containment  
vessel and came in contact with the molten metal. 
</P>
<P>
	No toxic chemicals were released, Omdahl said.  
</P>
<P>
	One worker was in critical condition at Legacy Emanuel Hospital  
in Portland, and the others were treated at Albany General 
Hospital, Albany General spokeswoman Kim Sass said.

<HEADLINE> Charges Against Mich. Teen Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- A judge ruled a statement a 13-year-old  
boy made to police about an alleged school massacre plot could not 
be used as evidence, so prosecutors dropped the charges and let him 
go home Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan McDonald, 13, was one of boys who prosecutors said  
plotted to steal firearms, seize the school office and call an 
assembly in the gym where they would massacre students and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge James P. Adair ruled that the statement could not be used  
as evidence because police did not first advise the boy of his 
right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	A charge of conspiracy to commit murder was dropped and McDonald  
was released from a juvenile center where he has been the past 119 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Fick, 13, and 14-year-olds Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah  
``David'' Zinzo have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder 
and could face life in prison if convicted as adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the boys in mid-May after classmates at Holland  
Woods Middle School came forward to tell administrators they 
overheard conversations about a shooting spree.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Heirs Buy NHL's Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Don't look for an immediate spending spree on  
players by the Wal-Mart heirs who purchased the St. Louis Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill and Nancy Laurie of Columbia, Mo., got a bargain price of  
$100 million for the NHL team and the 5-year-old Kiel Center. The 
deal includes $96 million of debt service on the building, meaning 
that Clark Enterprises walks away with almost nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Bill Laurie said Tuesday, he'll let the front office alone  
to do its job. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can have a lot of fun, and not have to open up the bank,  
as they say,'' Laurie said. ``You don't necessarily have to go out 
and get carried away with your bank account.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie said his goal is a Stanley Cup, but the Blues haven't  
made it past the second round of the NHL playoffs since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	That might not sit well with Laurie, a front-row fixture at  
Missouri basketball games and an avid sports fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this team is very, very close to being a Stanley Cup  
winner,'' Laurie said. ``We'll do what it takes to get us where we 
want to be. Nobody on the earth loves to win more than I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries took the Blues and the Kiel center off the hands of  
Clark Enterprises, a group of 19 prominent local businessmen who 
were tired of pumping money into the franchise. The team had been 
for sale for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries, who raise quarter horses and Appaloosas, had been  
prepared to spend a lot more money to get into sports franchise 
ownership. In March, they unsuccessfully bid $400 million for the 
NHL's Colorado Avalanche, the NBA's Denver Nuggets and their new 
home, the Pepsi Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver deal fell through when shareholders of Ascent  
Entertainment Group, which owned the sports properties, filed suit, 
claiming the sale price was as much as $150 million too low. An 
out-of-court settlement resulted in an auction. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Blues' price tag, the 20,000-seat Kiel Center alone  
cost $135 million, and the team's worth has been estimated at more 
than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But owners were saddled by debt service on the Kiel Center,  
which was privately financed. They also had to pay for ill-advised 
signings and other excesses of the expensive 2 1/2-year reign of 
former coach and general manager Mike Keenan from 1994-1996. Owners 
said they had spent nearly $70 million the past four years to cover 
shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not only washing your hands of it, but finding the right  
kind of people to do this with,'' said Jerry Ritter, Clark 
Enterprises chairman of the board. ``And it was done to avoid 
future losses that might be incurred that this group is not willing 
to withstand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale awaits approval by the NHL Board of Governors and is  
expected to be completed by the end of September. No problems are 
anticipated, since the Lauries had been tentatively approved for 
the Denver purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie wasn't ruling out pursuing an NBA franchise for the city  
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's go one thing at a time,'' he said. ``I guess if an NBA  
possibility came along, we would take a look at it. But I can 
honestly tell you today our focus is on hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale coincided with the opening of the Blues' training camp  
on Monday. Bill Laurie met with the team Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm like everybody else,'' general manager Larry Pleau said.  
``We're all excited about this and we're ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries are the second Columbia entry into the St. Louis  
sports market in recent years; Stan Kroenke is a minority owner of 
the NFL's St. Louis Rams. The Lauries and Kroenkes are in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Walton Laurie is the daughter of the late Bud Walton, who  
with his late brother Sam co-founded Wal-Mart. The Lauries own 
Crown Center Farms in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple made the largest single donation to the University of  
Missouri in its history in 1996, offering $10 million toward the 
construction of a new basketball arena. The donation was withdrawn 
a year later after the Lauries felt the university wasn't making 
enough progress toward construction.

<HEADLINE> IMF Calls World Markets `Fragile' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A stock market plunge in the United States or  
a sudden weakening in the value of the dollar are two of the 
biggest potential threats facing the global economy as it struggles 
to emerge from the Asian economic crisis, the International 
Monetary Fund said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF, issuing its annual report on international capital  
markets, found a number of encouraging signs that the world is 
beginning to recover after nearly two years of economic turmoil. 
But the agency cautioned that global markets remain ``fragile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A key risk -- and one that has heightened in the past 12 months  
-- is the possibility of a large correction in the U.S. equity 
market,'' the IMF said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF report noted that U.S. stock prices have continued  
rising to new highs despite growing uncertainty about the ability 
of American corporations to maintain profit growth in the face of 
higher interest rates and a slowdown in economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also singled out a sudden drop in the value of the  
dollar as another major threat. The agency said such a decline 
could be triggered by growing concern -- by foreigners holding 
dollars -- over the sustainability of America's huge trade deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials, who briefed reporters on the new survey, stressed  
that they were not predicting a plunge in U.S. stock prices or the 
dollar, only highlighting what they see as the greatest risks to 
the global economy at present. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Fed  
policy makers have to pay closer attention to what happens on Wall 
Street because of its impact on economic decisions on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
	That view was echoed Wednesday by Federal Reserve Governor  
Laurence Meyer. Meyer said in a speech in Philadelphia that while 
the Fed was closely watching the rising stock market, ``I honestly 
do not know whether or not equities are fairly valued or 
overvalued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF report said another potential threat to the recovery  
could come from the Year 2000 computer problem if it disrupts 
global capital flows. 
</P>
<P>
	Many market interest rates have already been driven up by as  
much as a half-percentage point because of increased borrowing by 
corporations and some foreign governments to make sure they have 
enough cash on hand to deal with any possible disruptions, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian currency crisis, which began in July 1997, reached a  
peak last fall after Russia's default on billions of dollars worth 
of foreign debt sent shockwaves through global markets. Central 
banks, led by the Federal Reserve, rushed to the rescue with 
interest rate cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF noted a number of favorable developments this year have  
lessened the risks of a worldwide recession. These include 
``surprisingly robust'' growth in the United States and signs that 
Japan, which has been struggling with its worst recession in 50 
years, was beginning ``to take important measures to stabilize its 
economy,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IMF cautioned: ``Conditions in financial markets remain  
fragile, as evidenced by continued high levels of volatility ... 
and capital flows to the emerging markets that are running well 
below the rates during the boom years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF estimated that total net private capital flows to  
emerging markets plunged by 57 percent last year, dropping from 
$149.2 billion in 1997 to $64.3 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on capital markets and a companion economic forecast  
will serve as talking points when finance ministers and central 
bank presidents gather in Washington later this month for the 
annual meetings of the 182-nation IMF and its sister lending 
agency, the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary economic forecast was released prematurely in a  
Dutch finance ministry report on the ministry's Web site Tuesday. 
It showed the IMF believed the world economy would expand 2.8 
percent this year and 3.4 percent in the year 2000, representing 
upward revisions from IMF projections made in the spring.	   The Dutch report also said the IMF was close to abandoning 
efforts to sell 10 percent of its gold reserves on the open market 
to fund debt relief for poor nations because of strong objections 
by members of Congress that such sales would further depress the 
price of gold. 
</P>
<P>
	As an alternative, the IMF is considering selling gold to a  
group of central banks at higher market prices and then buying the 
gold back in a circular transaction that would allow the IMF to 
value the repurchased gold on its books at sharply higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, chairman of the House Banking Committee, said  
Wednesday that the new proposal is ``preferable to the original 
plan of selling gold on the open market.''

<HEADLINE> Emory U. Displays Malcolm X Letters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The only known collection of Malcolm X's personal  
letters and notes are on display at Emory University, and many 
offer a glimpse of him as a typical teen-ager who liked to 
jitterbug, admired pretty girls and wanted to be a lawyer someday. 
</P>
<P>
	The writings differ from the public view of Malcolm X as a fiery  
orator and advocate of black nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are quite unique,''James H. Cone of Union Theological  
Seminary in New York said Tuesday. Cone is the author of a 1992 
book about Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other known personal letters written by Malcolm X are  
in FBI files. 
</P>
<P>
	The Emory collection -- mostly letters and school notebooks  
written from 1938 to 1955, when Malcolm X was a teen-ager and young 
adult -- is on long-term loan to the library. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not a large collection, the letters and notes could  
change the accepted view of Malcolm X's early years. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speeches and in his autobiography, the civil rights  
leader described himself as a smalltime hood who could barely read 
before he was converted to the Nation of Islam in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	But the early papers paint a much different picture. They show  
the 13- to 15-year-old Malcolm to be an articulate student who 
rarely misspelled words and usually used correct grammar. In one 
assignment, he wrote that he wanted to be a lawyer, a district 
attorney or a politician. 
</P>
<P>
	One piece on display is a letter he wrote while in prison to  
half-sister Ella Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``This being Easter, I thought it would be nice of me if I tried  
to write you a charming letter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another letter, 16-year-old Malcolm wrote from Boston to a  
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sorry I haven't gotten around to writing you sooner but I have  
been very busy. You know how we traveling men are. How is 
everything in Jackson. Boston's fine. The place is really 
`jumpin.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy Davis, a professor of African-American studies at Emory,  
said: ``Just to see Malcolm's actual handwriting set off 
trembles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malcolm X was born Malcolm ``Harpy'' Little in Omaha, Neb., in  
1925. He spent a few years in a foster home in the Lansing, Mich., 
area after his father was murdered and his mother was put in a 
mental institution. After moving to Boston at age 16, he got mixed 
up in smalltime street crime. He was sent to prison for burglary in 
1946 at age 21. 
</P>
<P>
	During his six-year prison term, he became a disciple of Elijah  
Muhammad, head of the Nation of Islam. After getting out of prison, 
Malcolm adopted ``X'' as his last name. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1960s he advocated black nationalism and was often  
followed by government agents suspicious of his motives and 
provocative views. 
</P>
<P>
	As the leading spokesman for the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X  
called for a rigid separation of whites and blacks. But in 1964, he 
broke with the Nation of Islam, made a pilgrimage to Mecca and 
declared himself an orthodox Muslim. He was shot and killed a year 
later in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis Star Columnist Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- An Indianapolis Star and News television  
columnist suspended for plagiarism last month was fired after 
editors said they found more examples of his work similar to 
material from other publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Hall's dismissal was announced Tuesday on the Star's Web  
site by Executive Editor Frank Caperton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took this action after an internal review of Hall's work  
disclosed additional examples of plagiarizing work by writers for 
other publications. In these cases, stories published under Hall's 
byline were similar to stories that had appeared in other 
publications,'' Caperton said in the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hall had been warned at the time of his suspension that he  
would be dismissed if further lapses came to light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall did not return calls from The Associated Press. He told  
WRTV, an Indianapolis TV station, that he wishes the newspaper had 
handled the situation differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's unfortunate that I'm being fired over  
similarities in a handful of stories considering that I wrote more 
than 5,200 stories during the 12 years I worked for the Star,'' 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caperton declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 27, Hall was suspended for three weeks without pay and  
reassigned after editors at the paper noticed a story he had 
submitted for publication was similar to one published in a 
different newspaper. Hall's story was never published. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall apologized in a statement that was run on the front page of  
the newspaper the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of time pressures, I made a stupid mistake and  
violated a sacred law of our profession,'' he said in the 
statement. ``I apologize to our readers and my family, co-workers 
and friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newsroom staffs of the Star and News merged in 1995 and the  
News is due to close Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Media Gets Story of Columbine Teen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Her daughter's life cut short in a burst  
of gunfire at Columbine High School, Misty Bernall searched for the 
best way to tell the world what it had just lost. 
</P>
<P>
	She found inspiration in the slain teen's own example.  
</P>
<P>
	Rather than lock up a book deal with a publishing colossus, Mrs.  
Bernall turned to Plough Publishing House, an obscure, nonprofit 
publisher with an annual average of 10 titles and revenue of $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bernall and her husband, Brad, initiated talks with Plough  
in part because their daughter, Cassie, had been reading one of the 
publishing house's books, ``Seeking Peace'' by Johann Christoph 
Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassie, who had recently renewed her faith with God, had  
underlined a quotation she hoped to discuss with Christian teens 
the same day Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold stormed through 
Columbine, killing 12 students and a teacher before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The passage, from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr, seemed oddly  
prescient: ``If a man hasn't found something he will die for, he 
isn't fit to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bernalls said they weren't concerned with sales or  
profits, they wanted to bring dignity to Cassie's life,'' said Dave 
McPherson, the family's pastor. ``I knew Plough would do that. I 
knew they wouldn't sensationalize the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result, Mrs. Bernall's ``She Said Yes: The Unlikely  
Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall,'' hits bookstores Friday. Plough also 
plans a video and is negotiating movie and television rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The title comes from Cassie's confrontation with Harris and  
Klebold during the April 20 rampage. With her eyes closed and her 
hands clasped in prayer, one of the gunmen pointed a shotgun at her 
and asked if she believed in God. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, she said -- and he killed her.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bernall declined comment until the book is released, but  
McPherson said she and her husband wanted to show 17-year-old 
Cassie as ``someone everyone can relate to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Farmington, Pa., Plough has fewer than 40 employees. It  
is owned by the Bruderhof community, a religious sect formed in 
Germany in the 1920s and expelled during the Nazi regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the group, which aims to live as much like first century  
Christians as possible, has about 2,500 members in eight 
communities in the United States and Southern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 160-page book about Cassie, with a list price of $17, will  
have an initial print run of 100,000, with three other runs 
planned. Proceeds will go to a fund set up in Cassie's name to help 
troubled youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to handle distribution on its own, Plough has split up  
rights of the books. 
</P>
<P>
	Word Publishing, a unit of the Nashville, Tenn., publisher  
Thomas Nelson, will have the rights to sell the book in Christian 
bookstores and major discount chain stores. Doubleday Direct, a 
unit of Bertelsmann AG, has the book club rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not feel we could do justice to the story by trying to  
cover it all ourselves,'' said Johann Huleatt, who is doing 
publicity for the project. ``This is a story that needs to be made 
available to the broadest audience possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassie's affirmation of faith has been recounted in Sunday  
school classes and at church youth gatherings across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't always a straitlaced teen. Several years ago, Cassie  
fell in with the wrong crowd, experimented with drugs, dabbled in 
the occult and even contemplated suicide, McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bernalls transferred their daughter to a Christian school  
and put her in McPherson's youth group. Gradually Cassie's anger 
dissipated and, two years ago, she became deeply religious. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassie became involved in helping cancer victims, street gang  
members and drug addicts, he said. She also transferred to 
Columbine High, where she felt she could make more of a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really remarkable what happened in her life up to that  
point, and that is what her mother would like to share, to round 
out and complete the picture of who this young woman was,'' said 
Charles Moore, an editor at Plough.

<HEADLINE> Webb Aims for LPGA Victory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPLE GROVE, Minn. (AP) -- Karrie Webb has already established  
herself as a dominant force on the LPGA Tour. Now she hopes to add 
the World Championship of Women's Golf to her impressive list of 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian sensation is seeking her seventh victory of the  
year in the tournament, scheduled Thursday through Sunday on the 
par-72, 6,493-yard Rush Creek Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	After a wind-swept pro-am Wednesday, which followed a day of  
rain, Webb said the soft greens won't necessarily favor her game, 
known for long hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much survival of the fittest right now,'' Webb  
said. ``I mean you just have to play shot for shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb downplayed the significance of competing in the  
invitation-only tournament that features the 20 top LPGA players, 
since those players are typically found at all LPGA events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you get 20 of the best players in the world, it's  
going to be a good tournament,'' she said. ``But you're always 
going to see these top 20 players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A benefit of playing in a tournament with just 20 players is  
that golfers will spend less time on the course, allowing them to 
conserve energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good thing is we play in twosomes for the whole four days,  
so it's generally a lot quicker, the pace of play,'' Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, 24, is the LPGA's leading money winner this year with  
$1,301,360. In just her fourth year on the tour, Webb has a career 
total of $3,953,174. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb's most recent victory was the du Maurier Classic in August,  
in which she rallied from five strokes behind Laura Davies entering 
the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	After that event, she dropped to 38th in the Women's British  
Open, her second-worst finish this year, and then took third in the 
Oldsmobile Classic two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb is leading the LPGA in six statistical categories. If the  
season ended now, Webb would be the player of the year and would 
receive the Vare Trophy for low scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
	She has finished in the top 10 in 18 of her 20 tournaments and  
has played 76.4 percent of her rounds under par. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's World Championship, held in The Villages, Fla.,  
Webb finished eighth, 13 strokes behind winner Juli Inkster, who 
also won the event in 1997 in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb said her spectacular year has left her feeling tired.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just hitting the wall a little bit. Obviously with the  
year that I've had, I'm a little bit mentally drained and 
physically drained,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster is among the favorites in the tournament. Although she's  
coming off a disappointing 35th in the Firstar LPGA Classic, 
Inkster won the U.S. Women's Open and the LPGA Championship this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	She has four victories and has kept pace with Webb in most  
statistical categories. She has won $1,118,847 this year, her 17th 
on the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Championship has a $700,000 purse. The winner takes  
home $150,000.

<HEADLINE> French Farmers Protest U.S. Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEAUVILLE, France (AP) -- Movie stars arriving at the annual  
American Film Festival in this Normandy resort town over the 
weekend heard more than the usual squealing of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	On the chic beach boardwalk, cow mooed and pigs grunted. The  
impetus behind the display: 200 French farmers, all of whom 
gathered here with their livestock to protest American trade muscle 
and what they see as the creeping threat of U.S.-driven 
globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers, carrying signs saying ``Vive le Camembert'' and  
``Hormone Beef Go Home,'' singled out the film festival because of 
its American connections. The protest was only one of a wave of 
anti-American demonstrations that have hit McDonald's restaurants 
and other symbols of U.S. influence over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests range from farmers trashing McDonald's franchises  
to 100 percent ``taxes'' on Coca-Cola in certain towns. 
</P>
<P>
	They reflect a simmering French hostility toward U.S. global  
influence. France has long sought to preserve its cultural and 
political identity, whether by remaining outside of NATO's military 
command or limiting the number of American shows on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans came to help us 50 years ago,'' said Hilaire  
Taillecours, 62, who raises cows and grows wheat on his 125-acre 
Normandy farm. ``But that doesn't mean they can tell us what to eat 
and how to film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outcry against the spread of globalization -- the buzzword  
for the American model of a free-market driven, borderless world 
economy -- comes as France itself is bowing to economic pressures by 
selling off state assets and supporting corporate megamergers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the French are increasingly accepting the rule of market  
forces, and eagerly flocking to American movies and chain stores, 
the current dispute hits them where they are the most sensitive: 
the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``In France, food equals identity,'' said Guillaume Parmentier,  
who heads the French Center on the United States, a new, private 
Paris think tank. ``There is a growing fear of being taken over by 
new types of technology and a general ambivalence toward 
globalization, of which McDonald's has become a symbol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans fear that American marketing muscle will gradually  
lead to a worldwide standardization of food, stamping out old 
culinary traditions. And the protests come after several food 
crises -- from mad cow disease to dioxin-tainted chicken -- have 
shaken consumer confidence in industrialized agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest protests follow U.S. sanctions on a slew of products  
ranging from Roquefort cheese to foie gras. The tariffs were 
slapped on European goods in retaliation to the European Union's 
decision to ban imports of U.S. hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	In France, the protests have been spearheaded by the radical  
Farmers' Confederation, a left-wing union that represents a vocal 
minority of French farmers. Union leader Jose Bove, a sheep farmer 
from southwestern France, quickly became the movement's poster boy 
after he was arrested and jailed for vandalizing a McDonald's under 
construction in southern France. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's France dropped its damages claim against Bove, who  
was released on bail this week. And the company has launched a 
nationwide ad campaign to repair its tattered image with the slogan 
``Born in USA, made in France,'' emphasizing that a Big Mac here is 
actually made from native beef and produce. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government, meanwhile, is taking special care not to  
further rile the farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac regularly espouses free-market  
principles. But he showed subtle support for the farmers' movement 
in recent days, saying France would continue to oppose genetically 
modified foods and hormone-treated beef at World Trade Organization 
talks set for Nov. 30 in Seattle.

<HEADLINE>  Marines Introduce New Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a plane. It's a helicopter. And judging  
by the cheers from Pentagon brass and members of Congress, it could 
be something of a Superman of military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking oddly old-fashioned as a fixed-wing plane, with two  
oversized propellers, the Marines' MV-22 Osprey transforms itself 
into the helicopter of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	After a swift pass up the Potomac River past the Washington  
Monument on Wednesday, the rotors on the first production model 
smoothly tilted up, setting it down easily on a patch of grass at 
the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, the Osprey converts from a helicopter into a speedy  
fixed-wing plane in 20 seconds, offering new capabilities for troop 
deployment, drug interdiction and search and rescue, including 
hostage rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to change the way in which we approach everything  
from assault operations to disaster relief to humanitarian aid and 
peacekeeping,'' said Defense Secretary William Cohen, welcoming the 
Osprey before a crowd of Pentagon officers, members of Congress, 
diplomats and other guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The V-22 is going to cut our response time from weeks down to  
days and days down to hours,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-turbine, vertical-lift, tiltrotor aircraft, also known  
as a convertiplane, had its first test flight a decade ago, but is 
being touted by the military as a key warfare and peacetime 
military technology for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the revolution in military affairs,'' said Cohen,  
describing the aircraft as the ``epitome of what our forces will 
need and what they will become in the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen compared the potential impact of the tiltrotor with that  
of the aircraft carrier in World War II and the use of modern 
bombers and jet fighters in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft flies at twice the speed, has four times the range  
and carries twice the payload of the aging CH-46 helicopters it 
will replace. A CH-46 landed alongside the Osprey and a sleek 
tiltrotor test prototype, the XV-15. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines have plans for 360 of the MV-22s by 2013. The Air  
Force is expected to order 50 of another version, the CV-22, and 
the Navy 48 HV-22Bs for combat, special warfare, logistics support 
and search and rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jointly produced by Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort Worth,  
Texas, and Boeing Co., in Ridley Park, Pa., the world's first 
production model tiltrotor aircraft can achieve speeds over 400 
miles per hour and an altitude of 25,000 feet. It is designed to 
carry up to 24 troops or external loads of 15,000 pounds. It can 
fly 2,000 miles and land on a dime. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., who with several other members of  
Congress flew in on the V-22, said the program has strong 
bipartisan support. Lawmakers rejected efforts by the Bush 
administration to kill the plane, criticized for its high cost and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has approved $856 million to buy 11 next year -- one of  
the biggest items in the defense budget. Early safety concerns 
plagued the innovative aircraft, but builders say modifications 
from the original design have made it lighter and safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the Osprey production schedule is ``on time and  
within budget.''

peacekeeping,'' said Defense Secretary William Cohen, welcoming the 
Osprey before a crowd of Pentagon officers, members of Congress, 
diplomats and other guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The V-22 is going to cut our response time from weeks down to  
days and days down to hours,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-turbine, vertical-lift, tiltrotor aircraft, also known  
as a convertiplane, had its first test flight a decade ago, but is 
being touted by the military as a key warfare and peacetime 
military technology for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the revolution in military affairs,'' said Cohen,  
describing the aircraft as the ``epitome of what our forces will 
need and what they will become in the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen compared the potential impact of the tiltrotor with that  
of the aircraft carrier in World War II and the use of modern 
bombers and jet fighters in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft flies at twice the speed, has four times the range  
and carries twice the payload of the aging CH-46 helicopters it 
will replace. A CH-46 landed alongside the Osprey and a sleek 
tiltrotor test prototype, the XV-15. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines have plans for 360 of the MV-22s by 2013. The Air  
Force is expected to order 50 of another version, the CV-22, and 
the Navy 48 HV-22Bs for combat, special warfare, logistics support 
and search and rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jointly produced by Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort Worth,  
Texas, and Boeing Co., in Ridley Park, Pa., the world's first 
production model tiltrotor aircraft can achieve speeds over 400 
miles per hour and an altitude of 25,000 feet. It is designed to 
carry up to 24 troops or external loads of 15,000 pounds. It can 
fly 2,000 miles and land on a dime. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., who with several other members of  
Congress flew in on the V-22, said the program has strong 
bipartisan support. Lawmakers rejected efforts by the Bush 
administration to kill the plane, criticized for its high cost and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has approved $856 million to buy 11 next year -- one of  
the biggest items in the defense budget. Early safety concerns 
plagued the innovative aircraft, but builders say modifications 
from the original design have made it lighter and safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the Osprey production schedule is ``on time and  
within budget.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australia is pressing ahead with  
plans to assemble a U.N. peacekeeping force of up to 7,000 troops 
to go to East Timor, Prime Minister John Howard said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking after an emergency Cabinet meeting to discuss the  
deepening crisis in the Indonesian province, Howard said he had 
spoken twice during the day to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that unless the security situation is restored to a  
proper level, international pressure should still be applied to 
allow a peacekeeping force into East Timor,'' he said. ``Australia 
is willing to play a leading role in that force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, some 200 people rallied in front of the Australian  
Embassy to protest the burning of the Indonesian flags in several 
cities in Australia in recent days by members of the East Timorese 
community who were mourning the carnage in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight demonstrators managed to scale the embassy gate  
and enter the compound. They pulled down the Australian flag and 
burned it, replacing it with the Indonesian flag. They did not 
enter the building. 
</P>
<P>
	International pressure is mounting by the hour on Indonesia to  
allow peacekeepers into East Timor, where pro-Jakarta militias are 
running amok, killing and deporting independence supporters as 
Indonesian police and army sent to stop them look on. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence in East Timor has spiraled out of control since  
Saturday's announcement that the province had voted overwhelmingly 
for independence from Indonesia. Martial law imposed Tuesday has 
done nothing to stop the bloodshed and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our judgment is that the situation on the ground is extremely  
bad,'' Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said. 
``There are quite clearly militias roaming around, out of any form 
of apparent control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australia is at the forefront of nations calling for an armed  
peacekeepers to be sent to East Timor. Canberra has offered to lead 
the force and contribute 2,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
	But Howard insists such a force can only enter East Timor armed  
with a U.N. mandate and Jakarta's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia is anxious for U.S. troops to join any multinational  
force for East Timor but the Clinton administration, which already 
has committed troops to peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and 
Kosovo, has so far offered only logistical support.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mostly lower  
Wednesday, with several markets dragged down ahead of the release 
of key Japanese economic data and others rocked by escalating 
violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, share prices slipped ahead of Thursday's release of  
Japan's April-June gross domestic product figures, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 66.12 points,  
or 0.37 percent, to 17,641.38. On Tuesday, the average fell 49.01 
points, or 0.28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall in prices was limited by expectations that the Japanese  
government might come up with a large supplementary budget to 
support the economy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the  
yen amid concerns about a slowdown in Japan's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 110.95 yen in the late afternoon in Tokyo, up  
0.15 yen from its level of 110.80 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and 
also above its late New York level of 110.81 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares plunged 4.5 percent as foreign investors  
dumped their holdings amid threats by international lenders to 
suspend loans amid escalating violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark JSX Composite Index ended down 24.73 points at  
520.621. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Singapore, shares also fell on worries about East  
Timor and Japan's economic prospects, dealers said. Singapore's 
economy is closely linked to Indonesia's. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Straits Times Index fell 8.02 points, or 0.4  
percent, to end at 2,097.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks fell slightly, also on concerns of a slowing  
recovery in Japan and the direction of U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 39.46 points, or 0.3 percent,  
closing at 13,356.63. On Tuesday, the index rose 10.93 points, or 
0.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were sidelined ahead of a speech by U.S. Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan later Wednesday, which was expected 
to give clues to whether the Fed would raise interest rates. Hong 
Kong interest rates usually track U.S. rates to maintain its 
currency link to the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares fell as the weakening Thai baht, which hit  
a new 11-month low, triggered massive selling of local shares. The 
SET index shed 5.19 points, or 1.2 percent, to 421.56. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares ended mixed, as buyers cautiously  
awaited earnings results from two leading blue chips. The Composite 
Index inched up 2.32 points, or 0.3 percent, to 755.06. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares ended mixed as profit-taking was  
countered by renewed buying interest in select blue chip issues. 
The Philippine Stock Exchange Index gained 5.79 points, or 0.3 
percent, at 2,165.58. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares closed lower as investors cashed in  
on recent gains. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index slipped 6.99 
points, or 0.7 percent, to 936.93. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed higher, supported by higher  
base metal and gold prices. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 
3,000.7, up 7.1 points, or 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended mixed, as late buying in chipmakers'  
shares offset selling in most non-electronics sectors. The Weighted 
Price Index closed up 27.54 points, or 0.35 percent, to 7,973.30. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed sharply lower, dragged  
down by a fall in market heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand. 
The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 27.93 points, or 1.3 percent, to 
2,113.61.

</P>
<P>
	Disney, which owns ABC, announced Wednesday that Bornstein was

<P>
	Bornstein was an executive with sports network ESPN ``when cable  
was a nascent industry, much like the Internet today,'' Disney 
chairman Michael Eisner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a television executive in the age of media convergence, he  
also saw the value of creating ESPN.com,'' the network's sports Web

<HEADLINE> Danforth To Head Waco Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Republican Sen. John Danforth agreed  
Wednesday to oversee an independent review of the 1993 government 
standoff with the Branch Davidians, government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno was to announce the appointment  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's decision on Danforth came as the top Republican in the  
Senate said he now has doubts about who started the fire that ended 
the fatal siege in Waco, Texas, and believes it is time for Reno to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said new revelations that the  
government withheld evidence about its use of force in the raid add 
to a ``pattern'' of refusing to cooperate with congressional 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are doubts because questions have been raised,'' Lott  
told reporters. Those new question and what Lott called a history 
of Reno not cooperating with Congress ``... leads me to conclude 
that the attorney general should resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments fueled a new GOP campaign against Reno that began  
two weeks ago with the belated revelation that the FBI fired 
incendiary tear gas grenades at the Davidian compound on the day a 
fire killed 80 members of the sect. The government continues to 
maintain the fire was started by sect members, not federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, nonetheless, moved forward with her plans to launch an  
independent inquiry headed by Danforth, who left the Senate in 1995 
and is respected by members of both parties for his stubborn 
independence and reputation for integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno selected Danforth and he accepted the offer during several  
days of negotiations, according to government officials, who spoke 
only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Justice Department official said Reno would introduce  
Danforth at her weekly news conference Thursday. Danforth spent 
about five hours at the Justice Department on Wednesday, but was 
unavailable to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, 63, is an Episopal priest with solid Republican  
credentials -- he successfully shepherded the troubled nomination of 
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas through the Senate. He also 
has a background in law enforcement. Before entering the Senate, he 
served as attorney general in Missouri for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	As Republicans continued their assault, the attorney general  
received a strong endorsement from Senate Democratic Leader Tom 
Daschle. He said Reno ``deserves commendation rather than 
criticism,'' and that ``under no circumstances'' should she resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth's independent probe could clash with multiple hearings  
that Republicans on Capitol Hill were preparing even before 
Congress returned Wednesday from its August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators for a Senate subcommittee chaired by Sen. Charles  
Grassley, R-Iowa, are trying to interview a retired CIA official, 
Gene Cullen, who claims he has information that members of the 
elite Delta Force military team were actively involved in the Waco 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have acknowledged members of the military  
were at Waco in an advisory capacity but have maintained that they 
never participated in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Dan  
Burton, R-Ind., has issued subpoenas in his own re-examination of 
the tragedy. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah, also plans hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	One lawmaker, however, has deferred to Danforth.  
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said Wednesday he  
would withhold his planned legislation to establish a five-member 
commission to first see if Danforth gets the full cooperation of 
the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should events prove otherwise, we will reconsider this  
decision,'' Hyde, R-Ill., said. Meanwhile, Hyde's panel will 
examine the agency's structure during hearings, possibly this fall, 
on Justice Department programs, according to a GOP official close 
to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	While senators of both parties expressed their respect for  
Danforth's integrity, some warned that the multiple committee 
probes could hamper his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd begin to get in the way of Sen. Danforth unless they  
fed into'' that inquiry, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers have increased pressure on Reno and FBI  
Director Louis Freeh to explain how evidence about the siege, 
including videotapes, was withheld from the public for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that Texas Rangers  
had found flares that were apparently fired by federal officials 
during the 51-day siege. The newspaper said the Rangers discovered 
the expended military illumination flares amid tons of evidence 
recovered Friday from a storage facility near Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, an FBI official said that ``we believe we used''  
two illumination rounds in late February or early March 1993 at a 
time when people were ``sneaking into the compound at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 100 percent sure that no illumination rounds were used  
on April 19, FBI spokesman John Collingwood said Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> Instant Replay Returns to NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The only thing more maddening than seeing referees blow a call  
once is having to wait around to watch them do it twice. 
</P>
<P>
	History does repeat itself, though rarely the way we'd like it  
to. That's why the return of instant replay to the NFL after an 
8-year hiatus reminds us of something Mychal Thompson said about 
Vlade Divac when the two were teammates with the Los Angeles Lakers 
a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a quick learner,'' Thompson said, ``but he forgets quick,  
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instant replay was the law of the turf from 1986-91, when league  
executives were again convinced to shut off the VCR. It wasn't 
foolproof, it delayed games unnecessarily, intimidated referees, 
and the NFL's own study only confirmed what everybody should have 
known: The calls on the field were almost always right. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 216,540 plays and 376 reversals during a 5-year span.  
Of those reversals, 38 were later judged to be wrong -- roughly 10 
percent. What that meant was that one call was correctly reversed 
for every 641 plays -- roughly once every four games. Exactly one 
game in those five years was decided by a replay call in the final 
minute, resulting in a 14-13 win by the Packers over the Bears in 
1989, and the league wound up conceding the replay official didn't 
have enough evidence to overturn the original call. 
</P>
<P>
	Anybody who bought a VCR in the last few years can attest to the  
fact that they're easier to operate. But even though the league 
spent $10 million on its men and machines, it faces the same 
dilemma people face at home, one that former NFL broadcasting head 
Val Pinchbeck framed this way in a recent interview with The 
Orlando Sentinel: ``Can humans do it properly?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the preseason experiment is any indication, the answer in too  
many cases is still ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through 34 exhibition games, coaches asked to have 30 plays  
reviewed. Three were overturned and NFL supervisor of officials 
Mike Pereira admitted that replay officials got two of them wrong. 
Some improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	And that wasn't the worst of it.  
</P>
<P>
	For a while, the push-button devices given coaches to signal  
their challenges were so sensitive that Rams coach Dick Vermeil 
buzzed the referee nearly every time he bent over. In one game, a 
computerized system failed, causing a 4-minute delay while 
officials switched to a backup. In another, Broncos coach Mike 
Shanahan signaled a challenge, found out from his assistants in the 
press box that the call was correct and told the ref he hit his 
buzzer by mistake. In yet another, a TV technician crossed the 
wrong wires; a definitive replay made it to the stadium JumboTron, 
but not to the official who needed it in time to make the right 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell used to rail about the  
deliberate way his fellow owners went about the business of the 
league. ``The U.S. Congress,'' he said, ``can declare war with a 
simple majority, but we need a three-fourths majority to go to the 
john.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reason instant replay was banished for the intervening years  
is because six teams refused to cave in and bring it back. Now they 
might regret it. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson finally switched sides after a  
terrible pass-interference call at the end of a game cost his team 
a game against New England in late November. It came at a 
particularly bad time, just a few days after referee Phil Luckett 
screwed up a coin toss in the now-infamous Thanksgiving Day game 
between Pittsburgh and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wilson followed longtime Lions owner William Clay Ford Jr.,  
by taking off after the officials, commissioner Paul Tagliabue had 
a real problem on his hands. Wilson got slapped with a $50,000 
fine, but he and Ford were old-guard ownership, and their rumblings 
gave the campaign to restore instant replay the credibility it had 
been lacking in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help, either, that the officiating went downhill from  
that point on pretty much through the end of the season. In a 
sense, the refs made the predictions come true. The more the 
replays of blown calls were shown, the more heft the calls picked 
up, almost like a snowball rolling downhill. Late in the year, 
officials spent more time looking over their shoulders, more 
hesitant than ever to make calls. 
</P>
<P>
	It got so bad at one point that when an officiating crew visited  
Children's Hospital in Boston, Bob McElwee said a 21-year-old 
cancer patient pulled him off to the side and said, ``You've got to 
have replay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now we do, at least until the phrase ``after further review'' is  
replayed often enough to remind us why the VCR got thrown into the 
closet the first time. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	TV Guide Online, a subsidiary of TV Guide, will supply AOL, the  
nation's largest online service, with TV listings and synopses of 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide, based in Tulsa, Okla., will receive prominent

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Blast in US Area of Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DONJA BUDRIGA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Explosions rocked the American  
sector of eastern Kosovo, killing two people and injuring four, 
NATO said today. A private Serb news agency described the incident 
as a mortar attack on two Serb villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight to 10 blasts occurred Tuesday evening near Donja Budriga  
village, according to Pfc. William Patterson of the U.S. military 
press office in eastern Kosovo. He did not say whether the victims 
were Serbs or ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said one critically injured victim was taken to an  
American military clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, several mortars were fired at another Serb village  
in the area but caused no casualties, U.S. soldiers said. They said 
American investigators found empty casings from 
Chinese-manufactured 81-mm mortars nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese-manufactured weapons were favored by the Kosovo  
Liberation Army during the ethnic fighting against Serb-led 
Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, the private Beta news agency  
quoted local residents as saying 15 mortars were fired Tuesday 
evening at the adjacent Serb villages of Donja Budriga and Partesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Steve Hicks, however, said at least seven projectiles,  
either large mortars or small artillery, exploded in Donja Budriga. 
He said American troops on patrol saw the flashes from the weapons 
firing from an ethnic Albanian settlement and a car speeding away. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle got away. One elderly woman and an elderly man --  
both Serbs -- were killed, he said. Hicks said the shelling was the 
first in the area in about two weeks. ``Everything we've seen so 
far has been against purely Serb villages,'' Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in bed last night when I heard a big bang and the house  
started to shake,'' said Zivka Sentic, whose home was damaged by 
the blasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack occurred one day after Russian soldiers patrolling  
the American sector shot and killed three Serbs after they 
disregarded orders to stop beating two wounded Albanians and 
instead opened fire on the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those incidents have raised tensions in Kosovo in the runup to  
the scheduled Sept. 19 demilitarization of the KLA, whose attacks 
against Serbs triggered the 18-month crackdown that led to the 
78-day NATO bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO stopped its air bombardment on Yugoslavia after President  
Slobodan Milosevic accepted a U.N.-sanctioned peace agreement, 
which provided for 40,000 NATO and Russian peacekeepers to maintain 
security in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, a Yugoslav army general who served in Kosovo  
threatened to recapture the province by force if peacekeepers fail 
to protect non-Albanian civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The refusal of the international community to fulfill its  
obligations according to the (peace) agreement implies that we 
would have to retake our territory by force,'' Col. Gen. Vladimir 
Lazarevic told the independent weekly Nedeljni Telegraf. ``This 
state has a right to protect its legal territory and people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As tensions in the province increase, Russia is stepping up its  
criticism of NATO's role in Kosovo. In a statement Tuesday to the 
ITAR-Tass news agency, Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov accused NATO of 
failing ``to ensure the security of people of different 
nationalities residing in the territory, primarily non-Albanians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivashov said Moscow was dissatisfied with the pace of disarming  
the KLA. The United States, however, has offered the KLA a new role 
as the ``Kosovo Corps,'' a lightly armed force that would respond 
to natural disasters and assist in security missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's complaints are expected to figure in talks in Moscow  
next week between Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and U.S. 
Defense Secretary William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	International attempts to bring peace to Kosovo have been  
confounded by a wave of violence by ethnic Albanians seeking 
revenge against Serbs for the 18-month crackdown that left 10,000 
dead and hundreds of thousands displaced before NATO intervened. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the more than 200,000 Kosovo Serbs have fled since NATO  
troops replaced Serb forces in the province.

<HEADLINE> Panel Faults Lockheed Martin Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- An independent review of launch failures that  
have cost Lockheed Martin Corp. billions of dollars blamed the 
mishaps on cost-cutting, lack of quality control and the loss of 
experienced personnel, the defense giant said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found too much emphasis on cost. Mission success needs to  
be reestablished as the most important performance criteria for all 
employees,'' said A. Thomas Young, the former Martin Marietta and 
NASA executive who co-chaired the review panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin suffered four launch failures between August  
1998 and this April. More than $2 billion in military and private 
satellites were either destroyed or placed in useless orbits. 
Boeing has also suffered a number of failures, prompting President 
Clinton to order a separate government investigation into the 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four failures involved Lockheed's Titan IV rockets,  
and company officials said they were placing special priority on 
the successful launch of the remaining 11 Titan launches before the 
model is retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed president and chief operating officer Peter B. Teets  
said the company has already implemented an incentive plan to 
retain experienced employees and make sure the remaining Titans 
``fly out with 100 percent mission success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bethesda-based defense giant reported a second-quarter loss  
of $41 million in July due in part to the satellite failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Young found in interviews with Lockheed customers, in many cases  
government and military officials, that the failures resulted in a 
loss of confidence in Lockheed's launch ability. Customers had 
noted many of the problems the panel found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also believe the customer would concur ... that the problems  
are not only fixable, but readily fixable,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teets said implementing the changes will not cost the company  
anything because of the savings they will create. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the launch failures, the company appointed the  
independent panel, headed by Young and former Vice Chief of Staff 
of the U.S. Air Force Thomas Moorman. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was charged with examining three sectors within the  
company's space and strategic missiles sector: Astronautics in 
Denver; Missiles and Space in Sunnyvale, Calif.; and Michoud Space 
Systems in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed's Denver unit, which builds Titan rockets used to  
launch satellites, and its Sunnyvale plant have both had 
large-scale cuts in staff over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel recommended improved training, mentoring, and the use  
of qualified retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four failures occurred in April.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lockheed-made Ikonos I satellite was launched April 27. The  
satellite, which was being launched for Space Imaging, Inc., a 
private company half-owned by Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Corp., 
failed to reach its proper orbit. The Athena II rocket used to 
launch the satellite was also made by Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not release the loss amounts.  
</P>
<P>
	On April 23, a $433 million Titan IV rocket also failed to lift  
an $800 million military satellite into the correct orbit. On April 
9, a $250 million military satellite being propelled by a Titan IV 
rocket failed to reach its proper orbit when an upper stage rocket 
made by Boeing Co. failed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 12, 1998, another Titan rocket and its military  
satellite blew up shortly after being launched from Cape Canaveral 
in Florida. The military did not release the cost of the satellite, 
but the launch cost $344 million, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Whitman Rules Out Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- When veteran Democratic Sen. Frank  
Lautenberg announced his retirement, New Jersey Republicans thought 
they had the perfect candidate to grab his seat: Gov. Christie 
Whitman. 
</P>
<P>
	But after her stunning announcement Tuesday that she was  
abandoning a promising senate campaign, GOP leaders are scrambling 
to find someone who will have enough name recognition -- and cash -- 
to beat the Democrats in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the political equivalent of the San Andreas fault in New  
Jersey,'' said Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker. 
``It not only rearranges the furniture, it rearranges the 
landscape. The only thing that would have surprised me more is if 
Hillary (Clinton) would have decided not to run in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's decision reverberated in Washington, where the  
Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee was banking on the 
governor to use her name recognition to take Lautenberg's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also felt in the state capital of Trenton, where Senate  
President Donald DiFrancesco was ready to fill Whitman's final term 
as governor if she won the Senate race -- and get a leg up on the 
2001 gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman said she was walking away from the race because she felt  
she simply couldn't be a good governor and a good U.S. Senate 
candidate at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor, barred by the state Constitution from  
running for a third consecutive term, had raised $2.23 million for 
the Senate bid. Now she's offering donors their money back. The 
money could also be used for charity -- or for a political action 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certainly going to be times where I'm going to  
regret not having the opportunity to serve the people of New Jersey 
in the U.S. Senate,'' Whitman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Politically, Whitman has been dogged by several pressing issues  
this year, including charges that the State Police pulled over 
minority motorists based on their race. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's decision shocked Candace Straight and Lewis Eisenberg,  
the leaders of her fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to talk her out of it,'' said Straight. ``I hope she  
doesn't close the door on ever running for the U.S. Senate. I hope 
she runs for elective office again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's departure buoyed Republican candidate Murray Sabrin,  
who ran as a Libertarian for governor in 1997. Others are now 
expected to jump in, including Rep. Robert Franks and U.S. Rep. 
Frank LoBiondo. Franks immediately announced he would form an 
exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats who have formed exploratory committees include former  
Gov. Jim Florio, whom Whitman narrowly defeated in 1993; Jon 
Corzine, wealthy former chairman of Goldman Sachs and a target of a 
courtship by Democratic campaign officials in Washington; and 
former state party chairman Tom Byrne. Radio talk show host Bob 
Grant has also made rumblings about running as an independent.

<HEADLINE> Penn State's Harris Healthy Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Aaron Harris' smile said it all.  
</P>
<P>
	After nearly two years rehabilitating a blown-out knee, Penn  
State's most experienced runner -- once considered as tough as 
Curtis Enis -- was finally back. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' smile showed the pleasure of his first big-time run in a  
while. Bursting off the right tackle in the Nittany Lions' opener, 
he lowered a shoulder and pounded Arizona defensive back Leland 
Gayles into the end zone from one yard out. 
</P>
<P>
	The grin showed the satisfaction of getting his NFL hopes back  
on track, and the happiness of a guy who can run the way he did 
when he was a kid -- without knee braces and worries of a crippling 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, he wasn't sure he ever would.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wondered about it,'' said Harris, a fifth-year senior for  
the No. 2 Lions. The bulky knee brace he wore through his sub-par 
1998 made him ponder the prospect more and more. 
</P>
<P>
	``You knew you have a leg that wasn't up to par. The whole  
feeling of it. Cutting your pants so it would fit. You knew it was 
there. It was a constant reminder,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished 1998 with only 112 yards on 44 carries. His 2.5  
yards-per-carry average was down from 5.6 yards in 1996 (for 587 
yards) and 6.2 yards in five games in 1997 (for 261 yards) before 
his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He looked nothing like the rough-and-tumble back who had made  
his mark as Enis' lead blocker his first two seasons. By the time 
Harris bounced off three tacklers for a 51-yard TD in Penn State's 
31-27 victory over Ohio State, he was considered nearly as talented 
Enis, who would be the fifth pick in the 1998 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The week after that run, Harris planted his foot on a cut and  
his knee popped. The doctor said rehabilitation would take a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it took a lot longer.  
</P>
<P>
	His knee was all right, but he never got in the workouts he  
needed to get back into shape. His speed suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris didn't feel 100 percent until summer drills, when he was  
cutting and running without even thinking about the knee. The 
clincher came during preseason conditioning, when he had to run 14 
timed sprints. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was going to be impossible for me to run those  
40s in a certain time, but I ran with four other guys and we all 
blew it out,'' he said. ``That's when I knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State's defense knew, too, after preseason drills.  
</P>
<P>
	``A healthy Aaron Harris is the toughest person that I've ever  
had to bring down,'' linebacker Brandon Short said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not only fast, he's powerful,'' defensive tackle David  
Fleischhauer said. ``If you don't hit him square, he's just going 
to bounce off you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And by the opener, everyone in Beaver Stadium knew. Sharing time  
with just about every other back in Penn state's two blowouts, 
Harris has only 82 yards -- but his average carry is up to 8.2 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	His only drawback now is that coach Joe Paterno has the luxury  
of a deep backfield, with a solid five tailbacks and a fierce 
fullback in Mike Cerimele. Paterno has a long memory, though. In a 
clutch situation, he probably will turn to Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have any kind of big-time back who has been in a  
lot of tough football games -- as Aaron has -- and has made big plays 
in tough football games,'' Paterno said. ``Aaron being able to do 
things on the field, obviously, is a big, big plus for us.''

<HEADLINE> Canadian Open a Ryder Cup Primer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- Only after he left Glen Abbey Golf Club  
did Billy Andrade began to realize how special -- and bizarre -- his 
victory was in the Canadian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Andrade ended seven lean seasons on the PGA Tour by  
winning the Canadian Open on the first playoff hole against Bob 
Friend. He flew to St. Louis that night for a corporate outing and 
ran into Senior Tour players like Bob Goalby and Dale Douglass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had everyone come up to me and tell me that this tournament,  
when they played ... if you didn't win the four majors, the 
Canadian Open was a huge tournament to win,'' Andrade said. 
``There's a lot of great champions on that trophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed there are.  
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Palmer's first professional victory was the 1955 Canadian  
Open. Walter Hagen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson and Bobby Locke are 
among the 28 major champions who count a Canadian Open among their 
trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest name missing from the list of champions is Jack  
Nicklaus, although it wasn't from a lack of effort. Nicklaus played 
the Canadian Open 25 times and was runner-up in seven of them, 
equaling his number of second-place finishes in the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the British Open and U.S. Open have a longer history.  
</P>
<P>
	``Being a national open, it's really an important tournament to  
win, and it really made me feel great,'' Andrade said. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's another piece of history for Andrade to consider when the  
90th Canadian Open gets under way today at Glen Abbey Golf Club: 
The last player to successfully defend his title was Jim Ferrier in 
1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, one piece of history Andrade might want to avoid is  
the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading by one stroke on the 18th, Andrade went for the green on  
the par-5 and dumped it in the water, then had to make a breaking, 
30-foot par putt just to get into a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	His approach on the playoff hole flew the green and landed next  
to a woman's purse. When he saw Friend, who also sailed the green, 
chip back into the water, Andrade purposely played into a bunker 
and then saved par from 5 feet to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is anyone that does not remember, if  
they're a golf fan, the hellaciousness of the last hole,'' Andrade 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was late arriving in St. Louis and was reminded of that right  
away by the new chief of the company for whom he was doing the 
corporate outing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I walk in. I haven't won in seven years,'' Andrade said. ``The  
new CEO comes up to me says, 'I can't believe you hit it in the 
water.' I said, 'Listen, I won the tournament.' Who cares how many 
times I hit in the water. The bottom line is I won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrade hasn't won since then, but he's not alone in that  
aspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Open will serve as a final tune-up for four players  
on the U.S. Ryder Cup team, and none of them has won this year, 
either -- Hal Sutton, Mark O'Meara, Justin Leonard and Jim Furyk. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, nine Americans who will try to win back the Ryder Cup  
on Sept. 24-26 at The Country Club have yet to win this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Not than any of them are particularly worried.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing as well as I did last year,'' said Sutton, coming  
off his first multiple-win season in 12 years. ``Having been there 
before, I know I'm playing well enough to make a contribution to 
the team. Just because I haven't won a tournament this year I 
shouldn't be questioning myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard has gone longer without winning than any of the top 10  
who qualified for the Ryder Cup team. His last victory was The 
Players Championship a year ago, a span of 41 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Sutton, he is far from concerned. Leonard notes that while  
only three U.S. Ryder Cup players have won on tour this year, Tiger 
Woods, David Duval and Jeff Maggert account for 10 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my goals this year was to play more consistently, and I  
felt like I've done that,'' Leonard said. ``I've had a couple of 
good chances. Probably the only disappointment is not winning. But 
I've got some tournaments left, and I feel like I'm doing the 
rights things with my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard was in the three-way playoff at the British Open, then  
finished third the next week at Hartford. Sutton has been on the 
verge of winning a couple of times this year, most notably at the 
Houston Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III was the runner-up at the Masters, Phil Mickelson  
a runner-up at the U.S. Open and at the NEC Invitational two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are going to win, and I would suspect that two or  
three of us win by the end of the year,'' Leonard said of the nine 
U.S. Ryder Cup players who have yet to win this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Four have a chance to win by the end of the week.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Coach Won't Trade Galloway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Mike Holmgren has some words of advice  
for holdout Seahawks receiver Joey Galloway: 
</P>
<P>
	You're stuck in Seattle so live with it.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to trade him,'' the Seahawks coach-general  
manager said Wednesday. ``I want him here. I want him to be a part 
of this and he knows that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway, the team's leading receiver in each of the last three  
seasons, missed all of the Seahawks' training camp and their four 
exhibition games. The Seahawks open their season on Sunday in the 
Kingdome against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway has one season left on a five-year contract for $1.6  
million. He signed the contract after Seattle made him the eighth 
overall pick in the 1995 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Galloway sat out this season, he would remain the  
property of the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway has turned down a seven-year contract offer for $35  
million, including a $7 million signing bonus. He is seeking a 
five-year deal worth about $25 million with a $10 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams are seeking to acquire Galloway in a trade, Holmgren  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been approached in casual conversations by about 15  
teams,'' he said. ``I've told them all the same thing: 'I am not 
trading him. He's here. I want him here.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren doesn't sound like he's ready to give an inch, or a  
dollar, in the stalemate. Negotiations broke off two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope he'd walk in the door and say, 'OK, I'm ready to  
play,''' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Galloway missing and Michael Pritchard out with a knee  
injury, Sean Dawkins and Charles Jordan will be Seattle's starting 
receivers for the Lions' game. Derrick Mayes will be the third 
receiver. All are new this season. Quarterback Jon Kitna will be 
starting his seventh NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawkins and Jordan signed with the Seahawks as free agents and  
Mayes was acquired by Seattle in a trade with Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thin there in this first game certainly,'' Holmgren said  
of his receiving corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Galloway caught 65 passes for 1,047 yards and 10  
touchdowns while Pritchard made 58 receptions for 742 yards and 
three TDs. Pritchard is expected back for Seattle's second game in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway, who is at his home in Columbus, Ohio, told KIRO Radio  
Tuesday night, ``I would love to be there right now playing, but at 
the same time I can't accept playing for something that's way below 
market value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren also announced that former Pro Bowl offensive tackle  
Howard Ballard, who retired last Sunday after playing 11 seasons in 
the NFL, will remain with the team as an assistant coach this 
season. He will help offensive line coach Tom Lovat. 
</P>
<P>
	After this season, Holmgren and Ballard will sit down again to  
decide Ballard's coaching future. A lot will depend on how much 
Ballard likes the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not quite as glamorous as being a player,'' Holmgren  
said. ``You have to eat on paper plates and have long hours. You 
don't get to go home at 5 o'clock at night. A lot of players want 
to stay in the game. Then they realize they want to stay in the 
game doing something else.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were lower in  
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the market lower as traders reacted to yesterday's  
U.S. Agriculture Department crop condition report. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA is reporting that 46 percent of the soybean crop is  
rated good or excellent, down from 47 percent last week. It was the 
eighth consecutive week of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvesting of the soybean crop begins this month. The last USDA  
estimate put the soybean crop at 2.87 billion bushels. The 
department will release a new estimate this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices were pushed lower by a slight improvement in  
the U.S. corn crop rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were lower on concerns the rally in the  
market is making U.S. wheat less competitive in overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was 1 3/4 cents lower at $2.91 a  
bushel; December corn was 2 1/4 cents lower at $2.23 a bushel; 
December oats were 3/4 cent lower at $1.16 1/4 a bushel; November 
soybeans were 7 cents lower at $5.13 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures prices were mixed and hog futures prices lower in  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle were .15 cent lower at 67.57 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle were .08 cent higher at 79.55 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs were .45 cent lower at 45.70 cents a pound; 
February frozen pork bellies were .20 cent lower at 55.35 cents a 
pound.

<HEADLINE> Former Economist for Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Herbert Stein, an economist who served as  
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Nixon 
administration, died Wednesday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein died at Washington Hospital Center after several months of  
illness, said Christopher DeMuth, president of the American 
Enterprise Institute, where Stein was a senior fellow. No cause of 
death was given. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein was one of the key architects of Richard Nixon's economic  
policies, including efforts to fight inflation with wage and price 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Nixon administration as a member of the Council of  
Economic Advisers in 1969 and was appointed chairman of the council 
by Nixon in January 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stein stepped down as CEA chairman in August 1974 to be  
succeeded by Alan Greenpan, he continued to be an active player in 
economic policy debates in Washington for the rest of his life, 
writing books, testifying before Congress and contributing opinion 
pieces to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been a senior fellow of the American Enterprise  
Institute, a conservative think tank, since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein often employed his wry sense of humor to help make dense  
economic issues understandable to the average reader. Among his 
books were ``The Illustrated Guide to the American Economy'' and 
``What I Think; Essays on Economics, Politics and Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stein stressed pragmatism above rigid adherence to any one  
doctrine in economics. He once called himself ``a conservative's 
liberal and a liberal's conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Nixon administration, Stein had served for 22  
years with the Committee for Economic Development, which had been 
organized during World War II to study economic issues. During the 
war, Stein had served as head of economic analysis at the War 
Production Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a daughter, Rachel Epstein, and a son, actor  
Ben Stein, who gained fame playing an economics teacher in the 
movie ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' and is currently the host of the 
Comedy Central quiz show ``Win Ben Stein's Money.''

<HEADLINE> Daughter of Civil War Vet Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Few people can say, My daddy fought at  
Gettysburg. Or Manassas. Or Antietam. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Florence Caston received so much attention at a  
gathering of the Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War, 
which recently held its annual convention in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	At 95, Caston is one of only a handful of surviving women whose  
fathers fought in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization counts only 18 members in this elite group, but  
there are others like Caston who aren't members. And the numbers 
continue to drop with the passing of time, said Joyce Johnson of 
Escondido, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have some who used to go (to the annual meeting)  
regularly, faithfully, but not too many are able any more,'' said 
Johnson, who is responsible for keeping track of the dwindling 
ranks of ``real daughters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United Daughters of the Confederacy in Richmond, Va.,  
reports 178 ``real daughters'' among its 21,500 members, according 
to figures from 1998, the most current available. 
</P>
<P>
	Caston's father, Samuel Hoffman, was a sailmaker from  
Damariscotta who joined the 21st Maine Volunteer Regiment in 1862. 
State archives indicate he was a sergeant in the unit that saw 
action in Hudson, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he joined the 2nd Maine Calvary Regiment, which saw action  
in Alabama, Florida and Louisiana, before leaving the Union Army to 
join the Navy, according to reports by the Maine adjutant general. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no record of him being wounded, but enemy bullets were  
not to be feared as much as disease. Only 37 died from wounds but 
479 died from disease in his Army units, according to state 
archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Caston, who will turn 96 on Oct. 9, doesn't know much about her  
father's service in the Union Army because she was only 2 when he 
died on Oct. 23, 1905. Hoffman apparently didn't talk much about 
his wartime exploits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a senseless war,'' she said, hastening to add that she  
was proud that her father fought for the cause that ended of 
slavery. ``I'm proud of him. I'm proud he helped free the slaves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Caston, her father's biggest mark on history came after the  
war, when he joined a club only to discover later that its members 
hated Roman Catholics and planned to burn down a church in 
Damariscotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman tipped off others about the plan, and the mob was  
stopped, Caston said. Her father then quit the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to his actions, St. Patrick's Church, described as the  
oldest surviving Catholic church in New England, still stands. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, Hoffman married his third wife, Ida Grover, when  
he was 65 and she was about 20. Caston was the youngest of nine 
children, and her father was in his 80s when she was conceived. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have asked how a man his age could be so virile,''  
Caston mused. ``The one thing I heard was that he ate six 
soft-boiled eggs and three boiled potatoes every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having an older father is typical for the surviving ``real  
daughters,'' said Johnson. In the 1800s, women often died during 
childbirth, so the men remarried and continued fathering children. 
</P>
<P>
	For Caston, life became hard after the death of her father,  
whose Civil War pension amounted to $9.29 a month. And a few years 
later, when Caston was 6, her mother died from tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Caston lived in a Bath orphanage for the children of Civil War  
veterans before being taken in by a sister and her husband. Caston 
later married, but her husband died in 1945. They had no children. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she has thought about joining the Daughters of Union  
Veterans of the Civil War, whose ranks of about 3,200 women 
includes granddaughters and great-granddaughters and whose youngest 
member is 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members met her at St. Joseph's Manor, a nursing home in  
Portland, and took her to the Doubletree Hotel, where she told her 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, about 125 members registered for the convention, which  
included a visit to the Brunswick home of Gen. Joshua Chamberlain, 
whose 20th Maine Regiment led a heroic bayonet charge at 
Gettysburg's Little Round Top.

<HEADLINE> Man Must Stay Away From Mary Bono </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man accused of stalking Mary Bono was  
ordered to stay away from the Republican congresswoman for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard A. Paez ordered Steven Howard  
Sanberg to stay at least 100 yards from her, her staff and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanberg earlier was served a 10-day temporary restraining order  
barring contact with Sonny Bono's widow. Sanberg wasn't in court 
Tuesday when the yearlong injunction was issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanberg was described in court documents as ``mentally unstable,  
obsessed with congresswoman Bono and members of her staff, and is a 
danger to them and to others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has repeatedly contacted Mrs. Bono and her employees by  
telephone and fax and has shown up at her office, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> Peacocks Cooperate To Spread Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Why do peacocks looking for mates hang out together like buddies  
at a singles bar, even when many are never lucky enough to find the 
perfect peahen? 
</P>
<P>
	For sound evolutionary reasons, according to research published  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have long wondered why the unsuccessful peacocks  
stick around the same group year after year when the hens tend to 
select the same few males each breeding season. 
</P>
<P>
	Research published in the journal Nature suggests an  
evolutionary reason: Many of the bird buddies within individual 
groups are brothers. By working together, they increase the odds 
that their genes will be passed to another generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``By helping your relatives to attract mates, your genes are  
spread,'' said Marion Petrie, a researcher at Britain's University 
of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. 
</P>
<P>
	The research sheds light on why some peacocks seem unconcerned  
with sex and are content to be hangers-on in the animal singles 
scene: Larger groups of peacocks attract more females, so some of 
the peacocks are there just to make the group bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefits of helping closely related dominants to attract  
more females may outweigh the subordinate males' own meager mating 
opportunities,'' said Cornell University researcher Paul Sherman in 
an accompanying Nature commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie and her colleagues studied about 200 free-ranging peafowl  
in Whipsnade Park north of London. Using DNA fingerprinting, the 
researchers found birds inside the strutting groups are more likely 
to be related to each other than those outside the group. 
</P>
<P>
	But how do the related birds find each other? That's unclear,  
but it is not because the peacock brothers grew up together. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the researchers found that when peacock brothers were  
separated before hatching and then were released into Whipsnade 
Park when they were yearlings, the brothers still tended to group 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	The mechanism by which the birds found their relatives is  
unknown. It could be by odor, feather patterns or the sounds the 
birds make. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some way in which kin can be associated, which  
doesn't require learning or environmental clues,'' Petrie said. 
``They didn't know their fathers or mothers. They could not 
possibly learn who their brothers were. They had no reference 
points to where they were born, but they still found each other.''

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Prepares for Brees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Clifford Jefferson knows Drew Brees will  
pick on Notre Dame's secondary. He says bring it on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to step up our game to show the whole NCAA  
that we're high-caliber team,'' the cornerback said as the 
16th-ranked Irish prepare for No. 20 Purdue. ``Some teams, they 
don't respect our secondary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And for good reason. Irish defensive backs have been shaky at  
times, not a good sign with pass-happy Purdue waiting in West 
Lafayette on Saturday. Don't expect Jefferson or any of his fellow 
defensive backs to be intimidated on Saturday. They know they can't 
afford to with Brees likely to put up 50-60 passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a secondary's dream,'' said Jefferson, the least  
experienced starter in the Irish secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees still hasn't forgotten the two interceptions he threw last  
year to hand Notre Dame a 31-30 last-minute victory. The more 
damaging came on third-and-long from deep in Purdue territory with 
less than two minutes to go. Rather than take a sack, he threw 
across the middle, where Tony Driver intercepted the ball and 
returned it to the Purdue 5 to set up the game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some mistakes in that game that I made that cost us  
the game toward the end,'' Brees said. ``What I learned from that 
was don't throw late across the middle ever again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brees might not want to give up on the middle just yet. Though  
the Irish didn't give up gaudy numbers to Michigan's passing game 
(237 yards on 20 completions), quarterback Tom Brady had few 
problems throwing quick slants to his receivers or longer routes 
over the middle in the Wolverines' 26-22 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	During Michigan's final two scoring drives, Brady had five  
completions of 14 yards or more, including a 28-yarder over the 
middle to open the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that we will probably see a little more nickel  
coverage out of Notre Dame than what Michigan saw,'' Purdue coach 
Joe Tiller said. ``We felt like, yes, Michigan made a couple of big 
plays against them, but they made some big plays against Michigan's 
offense, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson said Notre Dame will have to play more bump-and-run if  
it hopes to throw off Purdue's four- and five-wideout scheme that 
largely relies on three-step quarterback drops and quick timing 
patterns. If the Irish can't do that, then Brees will likely do 
what he always does -- throw and throw and throw until a defense has 
a moment of weakness that turns into six points for the 
Boilermakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has got a good presence. He is one of those guys when he  
gets flushed out of there, he doesn't panic,'' Irish coach Bob 
Davie said of Brees. ``He looks for open receivers on the run. You 
have got to contain him on those bootlegs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson said that, while every Brees pass is a potential  
touchdown, it's also an opportunity for the Irish defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to get at least two interceptions,'' Jefferson said  
with just a touch of brashness. ``Maybe I can get more.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs 2 Judicial Nominations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate confirmed three judicial  
nominations Wednesday, filling federal court vacancies in Florida, 
Kansas and Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	By identical votes of 93-1, lawmakers approved:  
</P>
<P>
	--Adalberto Jose Jordan to be a U.S. district judge for the  
Southern District of Florida. A native of Cuba who fled to the 
United States at a young age, Jordan has been an assistant U.S. 
attorney in Miami since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	--Marsha J. Pechman to be a U.S. district judge for the Western  
District of Washington state. She has been a judge for 11 years in 
King County, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Later the Senate by unanimous consent approved the nomination of  
Carlos Murguia of Kansas City, Kan., to be a U.S. district judge in 
Kansas. Murguia for 10 years has been a judge in Wyandotte County, 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, an independent, voted against  
Jordan and Pechman. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes brought the number of President Clinton's judicial  
nominees approved this year to 14, a total criticized as inadequate 
by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate 
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	At this time last year, the Senate had confirmed 39 judges; and  
in 1994, 58 judicial nominees had been approved by this point, 
Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more than 60 vacancies on the federal judiciary,  
according to Senate aides and the Senate Judiciary Committee's Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's votes left a total of 46 nominations pending either  
in the judiciary committee, which clears judicial nominees, or 
before the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the nominations pending is that of U.S. District Judge  
Richard Paez of Los Angeles for a seat on the 9th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals, who was first nominated in January 1996, Leahy 
said. That nomination and a subsequent nomination expired with no 
Senate action, and he was renominated again at the beginning of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not doing our job. We are not being responsible,''  
Leahy said in a floor speech. ``We are really being dishonest and 
condescending and arrogant toward the judiciary ... and it deserves 
better.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Urges Toughness on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said Wednesday that rich rivals  
George W. Bush and Steve Forbes will ``basically emasculate'' 
Watergate-era reforms with unlimited and unprecedented spending in 
the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, the  
former Navy pilot and Vietnam-era prisoner of war said President 
Clinton should warn China that the United States is prepared to 
``counter acts of aggression''' against Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd make it clear that the price of aggression would be far  
higher than any short-term gain,'' the Arizona senator said as 
Clinton prepares to meet with Chinese leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain fashions himself as a champion of campaign finance  
reform, a blunt-speaking maverick with a rich personal history. He 
begins a national tour this week to promote ``Faith of my 
Fathers,'' a poignant memoir about his war hero father and 
grandfather -- and his 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
	Departing from his party leadership, McCain also said Congress'  
tax-cut package caters to special interests more than taxpayers. 
And he said there is no hue and cry among voters for lowering 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tax cuts certainly don't seem to be anything that's got a  
great deal of steam,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he refused say whether he would veto the $792 billion,  
10-year tax-cut bill, which he reluctantly voted for in the Senate. 
If he were president, McCain said, Congress would have known to 
strip special interest provisions from the measure before sending 
it to his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said:  
</P>
<P>
	--The United States has ``no compelling national interest'' for  
sending troops to East Timor as part of a United Nations force. 
Pro-Indonesia militiamen have led a bloody rampage in the aftermath 
of an overwhelming vote to seek independence for the territory. The 
Clinton administration and the United Nations are considering 
whether to intervene 
</P>
<P>
	--He has not decided whether to compete in the Iowa caucuses,  
though his strategy for now is focused on the New Hampshire and 
South Carolina primaries that follow. ``The argument against going 
(to Iowa) is I don't have enough time and money to build the 
organization which is critical in a caucus state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton was wrong to grant clemency to Puerto Rican  
nationalists. He said he didn't know whether the president's action 
was tied to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's likely campaign for 
a New York Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain lags far behind Bush in polls, and will probably be  
outspent five-to-one by the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	On pace to raise more than $50 million by the end of the month,  
Bush has decided to forgo federal matching money made available to 
presidential candidates under Watergate-era reforms. Forbes, 
dipping into his personal fortune to finance his campaign, also has 
rejected the matching money. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the field will accept the federal funds and be  
subjected to spending limits that McCain said were designed to 
reduce the influence of money in presidential politics. It may be 
time to change the laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to look at the presidential campaign financing system  
because now that both Governor Bush and Mr. Forbes have said they 
will forgo matching funds, I think that you are see a precedent 
that will basically emasculate the law,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't chastise Bush as much as Forbes, who spent millions of  
dollars in 1996 to criticize eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole. McCain 
said Bush is understandably afraid he will be Forbes' next victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed,'' McCain said of Bush, ``but I understand  
why he's doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokesman Mindy Tucker said the governor supports ``full  
and instant'' disclosure of campaign contributions and would seek 
to raise the individual contribution limit from $1,000 -- a level 
unchanged since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Dal Col, political director for Forbes, said his boss wants  
to eliminate the limit on donations, wipe out political action 
committee contributions, impose term limits on lawmakers and 
eliminate the federal income tax code. ``Those would be the best 
campaign finance reforms,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain accused Clinton of engaging in ``feckless photo-op''  
foreign policy, particularly with China. The president meets with 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he would tell the Chinese leader that the United  
States was prepared to develop and deploy a sea-based missile 
defense system ``and that we will continue our right to move our 
Navy around in international waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Chinese are ``pragmatic people'' who likely realize  
that peace is in their best interests. ``But we also must be 
prepared to counter acts of aggression if they decide to exert 
hegemony in the region and reverse what has been their policy since 
1973 -- and that is to welcome U.S. military presence as a 
stabilizing factor in the region,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that meant he would be prepared to go to war to protect  
Tawain, McCain said: ``It means that we have a variety of options. 
We are the world's superpower and we will examine all those options 
and deploy those that are most effective,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he opposes abortion, but that the party must welcome  
abortion-rights backers. He supports scientific research using 
fetal tissues and opposes federal funding of abortions except in 
cases of rape, incest and when the mother's life is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked his position on abortion-inducing drugs like the French  
pill RU-486, McCain passed. ``I have to take a look at it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He angered anti-abortion activists last month by suggesting in  
an interview that the Supreme Court case legalizing abortion should 
not be overturned.

<HEADLINE> Pound Surges, Dollar Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British pound surged today in European trading  
after the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time 
in more than a year, a move that caught traders by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was mixed against other major currencies. Gold  
rose in London but fell in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.6220 in late trading after  
the Bank of England announced it was raising its base interest rate 
-- at which it lends money to commercial banks -- to 5.25 percent 
from 5 percent. The pound was quoted at $1.6070 just before to the 
central bank's midday announcement and had closed Tuesday in Europe 
at $1.6063. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in afternoon trading in New York, the pound was worth  
$1.6174. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England's rate increase followed a string of seven  
cuts and was a pre-emptive move to head off a resurgence of 
inflation in Britain. There have been worries that Britain's 
economic recovery is overheating and amid that the housing market 
is heading for an '80s-style boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising rates in Britain make returns more attractive on new  
interest-earning investments denominated in pounds, but hurt 
British stocks by making it more costly for businesses to borrow 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	On the interest rate hike, the FTSE 100 stock index, London's  
main stock gauge, fell 55.9 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 
6,253.6. 
</P>
<P>
	In other late European trading today, the euro edged down to  
$1.0594 from $1.0595 Tuesday. Later, in New York, the euro traded 
at $1.0572. 
</P>
<P>
	Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday,  
included 110.76 Japanese yen, down from 110.79; 1.5095 Swiss 
francs, up from 1.5085; 1.4898 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4884. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth: 1.8462 German marks, up from 1.8460; 
6.1918 French francs, up from 6.1912; 2.0801 Dutch guilders, up 
from 2.0800; and 1,827.70 Italian lire, up from 1,827.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $255.50 bid per troy ounce, down from  
$255.60 on Tuesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $255.60, down from 
$255.95. Gold rose 90 cents in Hong Kong to close at $256.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver closed in London at $5.17 bid per troy ounce, up from  
$5.16.

<HEADLINE> 12 Puerto Rico Dissidents OK Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Ricans are hailing the  
imminent release of 12 nationalists imprisoned for weapons 
possession and sedition -- but their freedom isn't expected to 
bolster the cause of Puerto Rican independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationalists, members of pro-independence guerrilla groups  
that carried out a wave of bombings in the United States in the 
1970s and 1980s, on Tuesday accepted a clemency deal offered by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the deal, however, requires the jailed Puerto Ricans to  
renounce violence and refrain from associating with convicted 
felons, a stipulation that would technically bar two prisoners -- 
sisters Alicia and Ida Luz Rodriguez -- from seeing each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists expressed indignation at the conditions and pledged to  
continue pursuing independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fear there will continue to be more political prisoners as  
long as Puerto Rico remains a colony,'' said Luis Nieves Falcon, a 
spokesman for the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Susler, a lawyer for the prisoners, emphasized that his  
clients would not abandon their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These men and women went to prison for the same thing that  
Nelson Mandela went to prison for,'' Susler said in Chicago. ``They 
are political people who intend to become involved in the 
political, nonviolent process to shape the future of their 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, despite widespread support for the unapologetic  
militants -- widely regarded by Puerto Ricans as political prisoners 
-- it seems unlikely that the clemency deal will lead to a renewal 
of violence or greater support for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 3 percent voted for independence in a referendum on  
Puerto Rico's political status nine months ago. Fifty percent 
supported the position of the commonwealth party, while 46 percent 
voted for U.S. statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationalists believe support for independence could grow if  
Washington withdrew support for Puerto Rico's commonwealth status. 
</P>
<P>
	As a U.S. commonwealth, Puerto Rico's 3.8 million islanders are  
U.S. citizens. They can serve in the military and receive billions 
from Washington but pay no federal taxes, cannot vote for president 
and have only a nonvoting delegate in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Cancel Miranda -- pardoned in 1979 by President Jimmy  
Carter for a 1954 shooting attack on the U.S. Congress -- said a 
century of U.S. colonialism has imbued islanders with a fear of 
independence, but ``that deep-seated fear would disappear if'' 
Washington would transfer power. 
</P>
<P>
	He said support of the prisoners was proof of an undercurrent of  
strong nationalism in the Spanish-speaking island. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, when the prisoners come home, they'll find their beloved  
island a cauldron of American consumerism -- brimming with 
U.S.-style malls, cinemas playing U.S. films, Kentucky Fried 
Chickens and a hybrid culture. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the prisoner release could lend momentum to an  
anti-American atmosphere that has intensified in recent months, 
especially around the issue of the U.S. Navy's bombing exercises on 
the populated, outlying Vieques Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Although independence leaders have championed the cause of  
removing the Navy from the island, support for that cause has grown 
to encompass all political parties -- including pro-statehood Gov. 
Pedro Rossello -- since an April 19 accident killed a civilian 
security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment on the clemency deal from  
Rossello, who supported Clinton's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the prisoners belonged to the Armed Forces for National  
Liberation, known by the Spanish acronym FALN. Several belonged to 
the Macheteros, a Puerto Rico-based guerrilla group. The FALN was 
involved in some 130 bombings in the United States that killed six 
and wounded dozens from 1974 to 1983. The Macheteros targeted U.S. 
property on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The imprisoned nationalists were not convicted in any of the  
bombings but were found guilty of seditious conspiracy and 
possession of weapons and explosives. Eleven were serving sentences 
ranging from 35 to 90 years. The Clinton administration said the 
sentences were too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's announcement capped a stormy three weeks since  
Clinton's offer drew charges that it projected softness on 
terrorism. Some critics even claimed it was aimed at helping 
would-be U.S. senatorial candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton's chances 
among New York voters of Puerto Rican descent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said the 12  
prisoners informed the White House on Tuesday that they would 
accept the month-old offer. One prisoner rejected it and three 
others -- two not in jail but who still have outstanding fines -- 
have until Sept. 10 to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Zenaida Lopez of Chicago said she stood by the decision of her  
brother, FALN member Oscar Lopez, to serve out the remaining 25 
years of his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels that renouncing violence, accepting what they are  
offering, is like a prison without a prison,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the decision is hard for Lopez's 28-year-old daughter,  
Clarissa. For the last 19 years, she has only seen her father once 
a year at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind. They talk by 
telephone once a month or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been hard ... but I respect his courage and his  
principles,'' she said. ``I have an 8-year-old daughter, and I'm 
hoping that someday he'll be able to do the things with her that he 
wasn't able to do with me.''

<HEADLINE> Gases Could Show How Body Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *LAURAN NEERGAARD   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Know that trick where you inhale helium and it  
turns your voice into a high-pitched squeak? Well, doctors are onto 
a better reason to breath in helium -- a new technology that 
provides a dramatically different way to peer at patients' organs. 
</P>
<P>
	Using specially treated gases, doctors can watch, for the first  
time, how air flows through the lungs. But the experimental 
technology isn't just for lungs -- it promises to light up other 
organs now difficult to see with conventional medical scanners. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are poised to try the technology as a colon cancer  
test, and say it might also offer better images of the brain or a 
woman's reproductive tract, without the discomfort or radiation of 
some of today's tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really looks like it's going to help people,'' said UVA  
radiology professor James R. Brookeman. 
</P>
<P>
	These so-called hyperpolarized gases are still experimental,  
experts caution. But radiologists compare the black blob produced 
by an MRI test of a lung with the brightly lit image of 
helium-filled lungs, and say the need is great. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new idea and a new technique'' that provides ``very  
striking'' images, said James MacFall, a Duke University medical 
physicist who also has tested the gases. 
</P>
<P>
	Scanning techniques like magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,  
provide incredible illumination of parts of the body. But they 
don't image some organs well. They don't picture airflow through 
the lungs, for instance. Tracking airflow could help treat 
emphysema, cystic fibrosis, asthma, even monitor how well a 
transplanted lung is adapting. 
</P>
<P>
	But inhale a hyperpolarized gas into the lungs, and an MRI shows  
a bright image of plump lungs. Where there's an obstruction -- 
damage or disease -- the image is dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Tom Daniel, a UVA lung surgeon, is experimenting with  
hyperpolarized helium to help perform a tricky emphysema surgery: 
slicing away dead portions of lung so the remaining good lung 
tissue moves and breathes more freely. It's called lung reduction 
surgery, and picking just which spot to cut is difficult but key. 
</P>
<P>
	``It told me with a lot more confidence what part of her lung  
was not getting oxygen,'' Daniel said in describing a woman he 
operated on last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas provides ``a very beautiful picture of the abnormal  
pathology in emphysema. It was just a no-brainer'' to try, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Molecules of substances like gas normally spin randomly. Fire a  
laser at certain gases and the molecules temporarily spin in the 
same direction, called hyperpolarization. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Princeton University physicists were researching  
hyperpolarized gases for the military when one of them needed an 
MRI -- and wondered if the research might also help medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Experiments showed the lined-up molecules of hyperpolarized  
helium-3 produced an MRI signal thousands of times stronger than 
existing technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Helium itself is benign -- divers routinely breathe it, and a  
helium-induced high-pitched voice is an old comedian's trick. The 
isotope helium-3, a byproduct of the tritium used in hydrogen 
bombs, is the version that can be hyperpolarized. Patients simply 
gulp a lungful and hold their breath for 10 seconds while the MRI 
scans. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey-based Nycomed Amersham Imaging is preparing clinical  
trials necessary to prove to the Food and Drug Administration that 
hyperpolarized helium lung scans are safe and useful. In addition 
to UVA's ongoing study, Nycomed hopes to begin other studies by 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Helium's not the only choice. Xenon-129 also can be  
hyperpolarized. It can penetrate the brain -- giving it an 
anesthetic effect -- and thus might give better brain scans. It's 
also more abundant than helium-3, which Nycomed now must buy from 
the former Soviet Union because the Defense Department won't sell 
its supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential uses:  
</P>
<P>
	--Brookeman plans next year to study inflating people's colons  
with helium to hunt colon cancer. Everyone over age 50 now is 
supposed to have a fiber-optic tube threaded through the intestine, 
called a colonoscopy. Using helium to light up precancerous colon 
polyps instead promises to be less uncomfortable, says Brookeman, 
who has successfully tried the experiment in dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	--A common test to check for infertility is to inject an oily  
substance into a woman's fallopian tubes and then X-ray her 
abdomen. An early animal experiment suggests helium could tell if 
the fallopian tubes are blocked without an X-ray's radiation, 
Brookeman said.

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Tribunal Head Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Judge Antonio Cassese of Italy,  
the first president of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, will leave 
the U.N. court by February to resume teaching at Florence 
University, the tribunal said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassese is the third prominent figure to leave the court. Chief  
Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada is leaving next week, and the 
tribunal's current president, Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United 
States, plans to leave in October. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the U.N. Security Council read to reporters  
Wednesday, McDonald praised Cassese for his ``distinguished 
service'' and ``critical leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The United Nations has been most fortunate to have the benefit  
of Judge Cassese's extensive knowledge of international law,'' she 
said. ``He will be sorely missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassese hasn't explained why he decided to leave only midway  
through his current four-year term. McDonald also hasn't detailed 
her reasons for leaving. Arbour is resigning to take a seat on the 
Canadian Supreme Court, and will be succeeded next week by Carla 
del Ponte, Switzerland's former federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassese was elected as the tribunal's first president in 1993,  
shortly after the Security Council established the court to bring 
to justice those suspected of atrocities in the wars that followed 
the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	He served a second term as president until McDonald took over in  
1997, then took up a seat as presiding judge in one of the court's 
three trial chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal said a successor would be appointed to serve out  
the remainder of his current term, which runs through Nov. 17, 
2001.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Vote on Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Setting up an autumn showdown, President  
Clinton urged Congress on Wednesday to schedule a vote on his 
health care package -- and said he would begin writing parts of it 
into law himself if need be. ``We should not delay this any more,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president gathered health care advocates in the White House  
East Room and, in a 23-minute speech, enumerated an eight-point 
list of health care concerns that he wants addressed before 
Congress adjourns at year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a laundry list. They are like eight panels for  
protective umbrella for America's future,'' Clinton said. ``I don't 
expect them to agree with everything I want to do. What I want them 
to do is sit down and talk with me, and let's agree on the 
objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the Ways and Means  
health subcommittee, said lawmakers planned to act in coming weeks 
on at least three issues: patient privacy, HMO reform and 
strengthening Medicare. In turn, he called on Clinton to approve 
the GOP tax cut package. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans in Congress have made tremendous progress on those  
issues, but we have the opportunity to do that and so much more 
with the president's help,'' Thomas said. ``If the president is 
really serious about addressing the health needs of our nation's 
uninsure, he should stop threatening to veto Congress' efforts to 
make health care more affordable and he should sign the Republican 
tax relief plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's list included the politically charged issues of  
Medicare and patients' rights under managed care plans, as well as 
others that enjoy broad bipartisan support, such as a plan to 
remove obstacles to health coverage for disabled people who want to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acknowledged a ``new and increasingly bipartisan  
consensus'' emerging on Medicare, patient privacy protections, 
curbing teen smoking, expanding health coverage for uninsured 
children and adults with disabilities. But he said that consensus 
``will amount to little'' if GOP leaders refuse to schedule a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing can stop it unless the votes aren't scheduled or we  
decide not to talk,'' Clinton said. ``And all of you know I'm 
always willing to talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that if Congress does not pass legislation to  
protect the privacy of patients' records, he would do so through 
executive action, as he promised during his State of the Union 
address this year. ``If need be, I will issue these new protections 
this fall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also appealed for compromise on the proposed Work  
Incentive Improvement Act, which is before the House. The 
legislation would allow disabled people to keep their health 
coverage when they join the work force. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the case of a New Hampshire man who wanted to accept a  
job that paid $28,000 per year but could not because of 
disabilities that create about $40,000 per year in health bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wouldn't you rather have the man making $28,000 and giving  
some of it back in taxes as a productive citizen?'' Clinton asked. 
``This is foolish. It's time to schedule a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said deep disagreements over funding the proposal  
should not be allowed to ruin the bill's prospects for passage. He 
noted it has 231 co-sponsors in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't like the way I want to pay for it,'' Clinton said.  
``OK. It's a big government. There are lots of options. But any way 
to pay for this within reason is better than letting one more year 
go by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke a day after Vice President Al Gore laid out  
his health agenda for his presidential bid next year. Clinton said 
he appreciated one of Gore's proposals -- ensuring affordable health 
care for all eligible children by 2005. ``(That's) something that I 
still believe needs to be done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced that child health insurance programs were  
approved for Wyoming and Washington state, meaning all 50 states 
now have approved plans. Still, he said, he wants Congress to fully 
fund his child health initiative in order to ensure that immigrant 
and foster children are covered as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The health insurance program for children, approved in 1997, is  
one of Clinton's strongest achievements in health. It provides $24 
billion over five years and is expected to help insure about 2.5 
million of the nation's 11 million uninsured kids once it is fully 
implemented.

<HEADLINE> Leyland Confirms He'll Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Colorado manager Jim Leyland ended speculation  
about his managerial future Tuesday night and confirmed that he was 
retiring from managing at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to talk about this every day for the rest of the  
season,'' Leyland told the Denver Post following the Rockies 4-1 
loss to Montreal. ``I'm retiring as manager, and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland told the Denver Rocky Mountain News: ``I will not manage  
a professional baseball team again. I can only do things one way, 
at 110 miles per hour. I can't do it at 75 miles per hour. I've got 
to approach it hell bent for leather, with every bit of energy. As 
far as a manager's position, I don't have the energy to do it 
anymore. I'm not going to steal money. I never have and I never 
will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, who managed the Florida Marlins to a World Series title  
in 1997, joined the Rockies in the offseason after managing the 
Marlins for two years. He had said earlier he was 99 percent sure 
he was retiring after this season, his 15th as a major league 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado has not performed up to expectations this season and  
was 62-78 after Tuesday's 4-1 loss to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it from 7:05 to 10:00,'' Leyland said. ``The rest of  
it, I don't feel like I'm getting the job done. And contrary to 
what anyone else thinks or what anyone else sarcastically writes, I 
am not going to manage anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland established himself as one of the premier managers in  
the majors during his first 11 years with Pittsburgh, leading the 
Pirates to three straight NL East Division titles from 1990-92. 
</P>
<P>
	He addressed his players prior to the Rockies' 5-3 win over the  
Expos Monday and advised them of his decision at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice to hear it from him and not hear it through the  
grapevine,'' Colorado closer Dave Veres said. ``I think a lot of us 
were hoping we could change his mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland has a 1,058-1,117 record as a major league manager,  
including two games as interim manager of the Chicago White Sox in 
1985.

<HEADLINE> LA Bans Gun Sales on County Grounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The county board of supervisors has given  
final approval to a law banning the sale of guns and ammunition on 
county property, a move that could bring an end to the nation's 
largest gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	The county began work on the ordinance on Aug. 24, two weeks  
after five people were wounded in a shooting rampage at a Jewish 
community center in Granada Hills and the related slaying of a 
letter carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a historic day for Los Angeles County and for other  
counties and jurisdictions around the country that want to do 
something about the proliferation of illegal weaponry,'' Supervisor 
Zev Yaroslavsky said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinance would hit the Great Western Gun Show, which boasts  
as many as 5,300 vendor tables and draws up to 35,000 people to 
each of its four annual events at the Los Angeles County 
fairgrounds in Pomona. They contribute an estimated $9 million to 
the county's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Seger, the show's manager, said promoters plan to file a  
lawsuit against the ban, arguing the county has violated their 
civil rights and does not have jurisdiction over the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Supervisor Don Knabe voted against the ordinance, which will  
take effect in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have is a situation where because of one-tenth of 1  
percent, we are going to penalize 99.9 percent of these people who 
do not break the law,'' Knabe said.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Out of Davis Cup Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Pat Rafter will miss Australia's Davis  
Cup match against Russia because of the shoulder injury that 
sidelined his U.S. Open tennis defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat saw the doctor yesterday. ... He feels that Pat should  
take at least 6-8 weeks off,'' Davis Cup captain John Newcombe said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does come back and play Davis Cup, even in doubles, he  
risks further injury to the arm and it will take even longer to 
repair. What we're hoping is that we can win this semifinal and Pat 
will be 100 percent fit for the final in early December.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter's absence and the likelihood that Mark Philippoussis  
(ankle and knee) will also be missing against Russia means Lleyton 
Hewitt will assume the No. 1 singles position. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Arthurs, Mark Woodforde, Andrew Ilie and Jason Stoltenberg  
will fight for the other singles berth during a week of trials 
before the Sept. 24-26 match in Brisbane.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, Softbank Invest in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft and Softbank of Japan are investing in  
a venture with Global Crossing to build a fiber-optic network in 
Asia for high-speed Internet, voice and video communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11,000-mile web of land and undersea cables will connect in  
Japan to Global Crossing's trans-Pacific links with the United 
States and its fiber networks in the Americas and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and Softbank, an early investor in Yahoo! and other  
hugely successful Internet ventures, will each contribute $175 
million in cash to the $1.28 billion project. The companies also 
committed to buy a combined $200 million worth of network capacity 
from Global Crossing over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	For Global Crossing, the investments by shrewd technology  
players like Microsoft and Softbank gave a much-needed vote of 
confidence to Global Crossing's plan to build a worldwide 
fiber-optic network. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into Wednesday, Global Crossing's stock had lost  
two-thirds of its value since May, hit hard by a blowout in Wall 
Street's Internet rally and concerns about how much a price war in 
long distance rates will hurt merger partner Frontier Corp. Global 
Crossing was forced to renegotiate that merger last week, 
increasing the amount of stock it will pay for Frontier, which also 
owns a fiber-optic network in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	After Wednesday's venture was announced, Global Crossing's stock  
jumped 26 percent, rising $5.31 1/4 to $25.62 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment by Microsoft, meanwhile, was the latest bid by  
the software maker to ensure its place as the Internet becomes a 
venue for telephone calls and television in addition to data 
traffic, e-mail and Web surfing. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Microsoft invested $5 billion in AT&AMP;T, which  
plans to provide various telecommunications services over the cable 
TV networks it recently acquired. As part of the deal, Microsoft 
will provide software for set-top boxes deployed in parts of the 
AT&AMP;T cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference Wednesday, Global Crossing officials  
repeatedly stressed the growth potential of the Asian economy, 
which has been recovering from last year's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asia has half of the world's population and is the fastest  
growing region in the world, but it's telecom infrastructure has 
just not kept up,'' said Gary Winnick, founder and co-chairman of 
Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to capitalize on an early start in such a huge market and  
Wall Street's hearty appetite for Internet-related ventures, the 
partners said they would likely sell stock in Asia Global Crossing 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bermuda-based Global Crossing will initially hold a 93 percent  
stake in the venture. Microsoft and Softbank will each own an 
initial stake of 3.5 percent, but those stakes will expand if the 
market value of Asia Global Crossing exceeds $5 billion, reaching 
as much as 19 percent if the venture's worth tops $7.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing will give the new venture its development rights  
in the Asia-Pacific region and its 57.75 percent share of Pacific 
Crossing 1, a separate partnership that's building a 13,000-mile 
network under the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Scanlon, vice chairman of Global Crossing, will be chief  
executive of Asia Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Asian network, which will be built in two phases, would  
connect Japan, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, 
Malaysia and the Philippine. The first 6,300 miles of cable are 
expected to be ready by December 2000, and the remainder about a 
half year later. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners hope to expand the network to Thailand and  
Indonesia down the road.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Hatch Spar Over Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore offered veterans a  
pledge Wednesday that he would work to keep the military strong, 
but Sen. Orrin Hatch, another presidential candidate, said the 
armed forces have been weakened during the Clinton-Gore 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The two presidential candidates addressed 3,000 veterans and  
their families at the 81st annual American Legion National 
Convention, and each assured their listeners that a strong military 
was a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing we do for our veterans after the battle will matter if  
we don't back them up while they're in the trenches and on the 
front lines, fighting for us,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is a Vietnam War veteran and member of the American Legion.  
He wore his legion cap as he addressed the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have this iron-clad commitment from me: As long as I am in  
a position to do something about it, America will be the strongest 
force for peace and freedom in the entire world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he supports a military pay increase and planned to  
``do right by our troops'' by upgrading and replacing aging 
equipment, barracks and family housing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, he said, is ``fighting for the first  
long-term, sustained increase in defense spending in a decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hatch, R-Utah, who was an ROTC student briefly and is not a  
veteran, painted a portrait of a military that has been ``seriously 
eroded'' due to aging equipment and staff shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed the Clinton administration, which he said has not  
spent enough money on the military. 
</P>
<P>
	And without mentioning any specific examples, he suggested that  
Clinton has led the country into conflicts where it does not 
belong. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of this administration's policies, we could have  
aging equipment being put into battle by troops whose military 
operational training is badly distorted by limited-value 
missions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leave peacemaking to the United Nations. Leave nation-building  
to suitably trained civilian organizers,'' said Hatch, who 
supported sending U.S. ground troops into Kosovo earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> National Grasslands Plan Criticized / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDORA, N.D. (AP) -- Shoppers found more than souvenirs on  
counter fronts during the last big weekend of the tourism season. 
Posted beside cash registers were petitions calling for more study 
of a federal grasslands management proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Store owners are joining ranchers in criticizing the U.S. Forest  
Service's national grasslands plan. They want the agency to be more 
considerate of their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers say the plan would threaten their livelihoods by  
reducing the number of cattle they can graze on federal land. Store 
owners who depend on ranchers for business also see it as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they go belly up, we might be right behind them,'' said  
Karen Putnam, who owns the Medora Convenience Store. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Fitzwilliams, the Medora district ranger for the Forest  
Service, says some ranchers and business owners misunderstand the 
plan, which is aimed at encouraging many uses of federal land and 
protecting it against overgrazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Medora has a real bright future,'' Fitzwilliams said.  
</P>
<P>
	Putnam's shop is one of the only ones that will stay open after  
the summer tourism season comes to a close this week in Medora, a 
tourist town of about 100 people on the edge of the North Dakota 
Badlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Putnam worries she may not be able to stay open all year if  
ranching conditions worsen. She has collected hundreds of 
signatures on the grassland petitions. Many are from ranchers who 
regularly stop in; some have come from sympathetic tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Forest Service estimates that grazing could be cut  
10 percent to 15 percent under the management proposal. But some 
ranchers could be affected more than others, depending on the 
condition of the land. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some ranchers, or for some areas that are in bad shape, it  
could be 30 to 40 percent,'' Fitzwilliams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservation groups contend that the grasslands need the extra  
protection after years of overgrazing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzwilliams says tourism could thrive with a longer season in  
future years as mountain biking, dude ranching and guided tours 
become more popular. 
</P>
<P>
	He has encouraging letters from North Dakotans who support the  
plan, and the Forest Service plans to work harder to emphasize its 
benefits to the grasslands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to better explain how we're going to get to  
these conditions, what it means to individual ranchers,'' 
Fitzwilliams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some merchants are hoping a strong showing by those opposing the  
Forest Service plan will encourage the agency to make changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service revises its grasslands management plan every  
10 years. It has spent more than three years developing the most 
recent proposal, which would affect 2.9 million acres of grasslands 
in North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	But many ranchers and shop owners say they only learned about  
planned grazing reduction this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kind of kept us in the dark out here,'' said Mel Mayher,  
who owns the Little Missouri Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Ed Schafer, who plans to meet with ranchers later this  
month, believes both sides in the debate have legitimate concerns, 
spokeswoman Julie Liffrig said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thinks there needs to be a compromise between them,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The public comment period on the Forest Service plan was  
extended earlier this month by 45 days, until Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Missouri is the largest national grassland in the nation,  
making up more than 25 percent of all national grassland acres.

<HEADLINE> GTE Sells Phone Lines to Hispanics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- GTE has agreed to sell about 400,000 phone  
lines to a group of prominent Hispanic investors for up to $1.4 
billion in a move that would create one of the nation's largest 
Hispanic-owned telecommunications companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, dba Communications, includes former New Mexico Gov.  
Toney Anaya, former U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and 10 
other Hispanic businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The closely held telephone company, based in Washington, D.C.,  
would be among the 20 largest local exchange companies in the 
United States as measured by access lines, GTE spokesman Bill Kula 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 GTE employees in the two states will become  
employees of dba Communications if federal and state regulators 
approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is part of GTE's overall repositioning plan to  
sell about 1.6 million access lines in 10 states as well as two 
divisions of the company.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Choosing Next Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Many candidates to succeed the Rev. Henry  
Lyons as president of the National Baptist Convention USA believe 
the powers of his office contributed to his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The election today of his successor could signal how far one of  
the nation's largest black church groups will go to prevent the 
kind of abuses that put Lyons in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60,000 delegates and visitors to the group's annual  
meeting were expected to gather for the election of the replacement 
for Lyons, the St. Petersburg minister currently serving 5 1/2 years 
for racketeering and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, who also pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion and fraud  
charges, resigned after swindling $4 million from businesses and 
failing to distribute nearly $250,000 contributed by the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith to help rebuild burned black 
churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention, which traces its roots to 1880, claims 8.5  
million members, though at Lyons' trial prosecutors said the figure 
was inflated. They said membership is around 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the scandal, many of the 11 candidates say the  
president's powers should be reduced. A good number of the 
convention's board of directors are appointed by the president 
rather than being elected. And the president also has control of 
the group's checkbook, giving the executive broad control over the 
group's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	During a candidates' forum Tuesday, the Rev. W. Franklyn  
Richardson, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., described the presidency as an 
``imperialist institution'' and advocated dismantling a ``rubber 
stamp wimp board'' by having board members elected to fixed terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, along with candidates the Rev. Jasper Williams of  
Atlanta and the Rev. William Shaw of Philadelphia, was among a 
group of ministers who unsuccessfully sought to have Lyons ousted 
in 1997 as he came under state and federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Those candidates blamed the group's political structure for  
helping lead to Lyons' downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason Henry J. Lyons is not on stage with us today but in  
a bunk in a jail cell is the system,'' Williams said. ``This system 
will corrupt any man no matter how good his intentions are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Lyons' tenure, attendance at the convention-operated  
American Baptist College in Nashville, Tenn., declined, and loans 
to settle lawsuits are coming due. Still, Lyons helped reduce the 
group's debt on its Nashville headquarters from $6 million to less 
than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Edward V. Hill, a Los Angeles minister who supported  
Lyons and is running for president, said he always would consider 
him a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe he gave us the energy ... to reach higher  
heights,'' Hill said. ``If you let me, I think I can continue the 
tradition of climbing higher and higher.''

<HEADLINE> Shakespeare Exhibit To Open in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Shakespeare Theater and the Folger  
Shakespeare Library have come up with a new way of looking at the 
Bard, via the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fooles and Fricassees: Food in Shakespeare's England,'' is the  
exhibit opening Friday at the library. Cooks of Shakespeare's time 
made a ``foole'' of fruit, mace and cream. It resembled what 
today's Britons call trifle, and Italians call ``English soup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the theater's modern-dress production of ``King  
Lear,'' which opened last week, begins with a chorus of ``Happy 
Birthday'' as two maids in caps and short skirts bring in a huge 
white cake with candles -- director Michael Kahn's new version of 
the play's beginning. Two characters -- brothers Edgar and Edmund -- 
are seen eating a piece of the cake. 
</P>
<P>
	It's fun, but purists may complain that the play Shakespeare  
wrote includes none of this. The text gives no indication that the 
king, who is 80 or more, is celebrating a birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in those days didn't celebrate birthdays much,'' said  
Rachel Doggett, the library's curator of books. ``It was more 
name-days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did bake big cakes, though.  
</P>
<P>
	The library exhibit includes a manuscript from about 1610 -- two  
years after the first printing of ``King Lear'' -- is entitled, 
``Mrs. Sarah Longe Her Receipt Book.'' In it, she instructs her 
staff on how ``To make a Cake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Take halfe a bushell of flower, 8 pound of Currence  
(currants), and 5 pound of butter, and boyle it by it selfe, and 
skim it, 3 pints of Creame, and boyle it, 3 quarters of a pound of 
sugar....'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little is known of Mrs. Longe, but she must have been a cook of  
some reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``King James and his Queene have eaten with much liking,'' she  
boasts of her biscuit recipe. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit also includes examples of kitchenware and cutlery of  
the period -- round spoons and big knives but no forks. Forks came 
into use from Italy only some years after Shakespeare. A 
reconstructed place setting for a family table includes a trencher, 
the round or square wooden plate used by people no longer so poor 
as to eat their food off a slice of dry bread, but not wealthy 
enough for porcelain plates. 
</P>
<P>
	There's part of a rare set of watercolors depicting life in King  
James' court. One shows five elaborately dressed gentlemen wearing 
hats and seated at a table loaded with food. They are devoting more 
attention, though, to large glasses of wine being poured by a young 
man in a bright red jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	On the wall, a printed proclamation by the king forbids anyone  
to import pepper except from the recently formed East India 
Company.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Ends Jury Duty With Rejection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ended his jury service  
Tuesday by awarding nothing to a man who claimed he was scalded in 
the shower. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said his fellow jurors gave him no special treatment  
and that his presence had no improper influence on the case. He and 
his fellow jurors deliberated less than one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, the foreman during the four-day civil trial, replied  
``No'' when asked whether a landlord had been negligent. A tenant 
had sued for $7 million, claiming he was badly scalded while taking 
a shower. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't treat me like the mayor,'' he said, chuckling at  
the suggestion that the jurors were swayed by him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I was the foreperson, it seemed to me that the best  
thing was to let the other jurors express themselves first, and 
they did,'' said Giuliani, the first sitting mayor ever to serve on 
jury duty in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Justice Elliott Wilk, whom Giuliani has criticized  
harshly for past rulings, the mayor praised his handling of the 
case.

<HEADLINE> Bush School Trip Out for Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARWICK, R.I. (AP) -- Presidential hopeful George W. Bush, who  
has made education his top campaign issue, canceled a scheduled 
visit to a new elementary school in a heavily Democratic community 
today in order to accommodate a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry,'' Bush said at a brief news conference held at T.F.  
Green Airport. ``Had the fund-raiser been first and the school 
second, I would have been at the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told reporters he wouldn't be able to visit the Ella Risk  
School in Central Falls as planned because bad weather delayed the 
arrival of his chartered jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather prevented me from going and people shouldn't read  
any message into the fact that I wasn't able to make it to the 
school because education has been my top priority as governor of 
Texas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was to visit the school in the morning, and then go to the  
fund-raiser in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he went just to the fund-raiser.  
</P>
<P>
	The decision disappointed fourth and fifth graders at the  
school, who had been eagerly anticipating their promised ``kiddie 
press conference'' with prepared questions in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry, I really am. I love to go to schools,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the press conference, Bush also detailed some of his  
education proposals, including a goal to set high standards for 
schools and ``blow the whistle on failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He scorned the federal government's involvement in education,  
asserting that the states should be able to make their own 
decisions about schools. ``As the governor of Texas, I didn't 
particularly care for ... people coming into our state and telling 
us what to do,'' he said, with Republican Gov. Lincoln Almond at 
his side. 
</P>
<P>
	If federal investments don't show results, he said, parents  
should be able to choose how to educate their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Title I schools don't meet standards -- in other words,  
if the children remain locked in failed schools, we ought to give 
the parents options,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the conference, Bush, left the airport to attend his  
private fund-raiser at the Rhode Island Convention Center. He was 
scheduled to make another campaign stop in Kansas City, Mo. later 
in the day.

<HEADLINE>  Moss Says Vikings Have Lost Feeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Randy Moss sounded the alarm. The  
star receiver says the Minnesota Vikings don't have that special 
feeling they did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He sees evidence everywhere -- from the mood in the locker room  
to the play on the field. Things just aren't the same for this new 
cast of Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably something we probably could recapture,''  
Moss said Wednesday. ``But last year, it was something special. It 
was something inside that knew the '98 Minnesota Vikings were 
something special. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this year, we lost a lot of guys on defense. We have our  
whole offense back (but) we lost our offensive coordinator. ... So, 
there's a lot of things that we have to get used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss's worries stem from a lackluster exhibition season in which  
the Vikings looked nothing like the team that went 15-1 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost eight free agents in the offseason and failed on draft  
day to shore up the holes left by the departures of defensive stars 
Jerry Ball, Derrick Alexander and Corey Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite returning all 11 starters, the offense, under new  
coordinator Ray Sherman, has yet to get untracked. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss, who set a rookie record with 17 TD catches last season,  
alternately proclaimed his team ready to put its troubles behind 
and bemoaned its many inadequacies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hard. It's going to be a struggle this  
year,'' he said. ``You know there's a lot of high expectations this 
year for us to go out here and try to duplicate last season and I 
don't think there's any way possible -- well, I wouldn't say any way 
possible that we can do that again -- but it's going to be very hard 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss said he was shocked by the shoddy preseason play of the  
veteran offensive line that was so integral to last season's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Vikings lost to the New York Jets last week, coach  
Dennis Green assailed the pass protection and said he counted three 
mental mistakes from the first-team offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of shocked me, to be honest with you, to see as far as  
the veteran group of guys we got playing the offensive line. ... 
You know it kinds of hurts when it's third-and-short and then it 
ends up third-and-long,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive line coach Mike Tice said he is hardly depressed over  
his unit's play. He said the game films show easily correctable 
lapses. 
</P>
<P>
	And Moss added that nobody can stop the Vikings if Todd  
Steussie, Randall McDaniel, Jeff Christy, David Dixon and Korey 
Stringer keep Randall Cunningham upright. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put 60 points up on that board, 50, 60  
points,'' Moss said. ``We're capable of that if everybody's on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upon reflection, Moss acknowledged he didn't get that special  
feeling about last year's squad until Week 5, when the Vikings beat 
Green Bay 37-24 at Lambeau Field. He said the feeling grew stronger 
after the Vikings won the rematch with the Packers at the 
Metrodome, then flew to Dallas and routed the Cowboys on 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this year it's like we're going to need a gut check for us  
to see where we are we're going,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday is as good a time as any.  
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings visit the Georgia Dome to face the Falcons, who  
upset them in the NFC championship by holding Cunningham, Moss and 
the most productive offensive machine in league history to just one 
touchdown during the final 42 minutes in the thunderous Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, that loss to Atlanta's probably going to always be  
in the back of my mind,'' Moss said. ``Probably until the day I 
die.''

<HEADLINE> Showdown Set for Browns, Steelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Many have heard about the Steelers-Browns  
rivalry or watched it on TV. Some even felt it as they were whacked 
in the back of the neck by an errant bone tossed from the Dawg 
Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though the Cleveland Browns were absent from the NFL  
for only three seasons, not many Pittsburgh Steelers have played 
against them in a game that counts. At least in a Steelers uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 11 of the current 53 Steelers -- or about one-fifth of their  
roster -- were on the team that beat Cleveland 20-17 on Nov. 26, 
1995, the last Steelers-Browns game. 
</P>
<P>
	Or at least the last one until Sunday night in Cleveland.  
</P>
<P>
	No wonder that some experienced Steelers, such as Dermontti  
Dawson, Levon Kirkland and Joel Steed, are helping their younger 
teammates this week not only with their playbooks, but their 
history books. 
</P>
<P>
	They're telling them that this won't be like any other game they  
will play this season. And that even when one team is doing well 
and the other isn't, it's a game that commands the attention of 
both cities. And that when one team returns to the NFL after a 
three-year absence by opening at home against the other, it is a 
really big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Something special. Something to be remembered. Something not to  
lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great that football is back in Cleveland, it really is,''  
said Steelers coach Bill Cowher, a former Browns player and 
assistant coach. ``It belongs there. It's like if you would take 
football out of Pittsburgh, something wouldn't seem right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't seemed right that the Jacksonville Jaguars, not the  
Browns, were the Steelers' biggest rivals the last three years. 
Jacksonville might still be the team to beat in the AFC Central, 
but the Browns are the team that Steelers fans most like to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when we played them three times in 1994, those  
games were really intense,'' Kirkland said Tuesday. ``It's going to 
be especially intense because this is our first game. But I think 
it's fun. I love it the way it is in Cleveland, with all of their 
fans booing us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland realizes that Browns fans will be whipped to a  
playoff-like pitch Sunday night. But he believes that crowd noise 
can motivate an opposing team to try to show up those clamorous 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to shut 'em down and not let them get into the  
game,'' Kirkland said. ``They've got one of the great fan bases 
there is, and they're going to be happy to get their franchise 
back. I think they have the best road atmosphere in the league, 
with the Dawg Pound and those masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I love being the bad guy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Earl Holmes, who plays alongside Kirkland, has never  
played in a Steelers-Browns game and is as curious as anyone to 
experience one. 
</P>
<P>
	``The older guys on the team have been telling me about it,  
telling me about the fans,'' he said. ``Their fans go crazy and 
Pittsburgh is not too far away, so I'm sure we'll have some of our 
fans there, too. They're going to be rowdy and they're going to go 
at it the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher just wishes it weren't the first game of the season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like going up there on Sunday night, but it's the  
right thing to do,'' he said. ``There's so much tradition in this 
football game with these cities that are so identical, with the 
people and the passion and the way they identify with their sports 
teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Steelers don't know is if they'll have running back  
Jerome Bettis (sore left knee) for even part of the game. He talked 
optimistically again Tuesday about playing, but didn't sound 
totally convincing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll play as much as coach wants me to play,'' Bettis said.  
``I want to get out there.''

<HEADLINE> Broadway in Need of a Musical Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Broadway is looking for a few good musicals.  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, one might be enough, preferably a hit as big as ``The  
Lion King,'' the Disney extravaganza of nearly two years ago that 
raised the visibility of New York theater and helped contribute to 
the revitalization of a still rebounding Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't look for many plays, though, except for several  
high-profile revivals including ``Amadeus,'' starring David Suchet, 
and an obscure Noel Coward comedy called ``Waiting in the Wings,'' 
which will bring Lauren Bacall back to Broadway after an absence of 
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	As the fall begins, musicals are coming off a season where  
confidence faltered as several big-budget shows flopped, with only 
``Fosse'' and probably ``Annie Get Your Gun'' having profitable 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the big guns -- including Disney -- are waiting until  
after Jan. 1 to unveil new shows, but there are enough musicals 
definitely scheduled before Christmas to raise some modest hope. 
</P>
<P>
	First to appear will be ``Saturday Night Fever,'' already  
boasting a $14 million advance and the benefit of a surefire title 
and score audiences know from the 1977 film that featured John 
Travolta and music by the Bee Gees. 
</P>
<P>
	The show comes from London where the musical has been a hit. On  
Broadway, ``Fever'' stars James Carpinello, not exactly a household 
name. Yet if Carpinello can swivel his hips as well as Travolta, a 
big career could be launched. Previews start Sept. 28, with an 
opening set for Oct. 21 at the Minskoff Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Following ``Fever'' will be a revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate,''  
starring Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie, two alums from 
``Ragtime,'' as the battling lovers. Michael Blakemore, who 
supervised such hits as ``Noises Off'' and ``City of Angels,'' 
directs. 
</P>
<P>
	This backstage variation of ``The Taming of the Shrew'' was Cole  
Porter's longest running show, featuring such Porter classics as 
``Wunderbar,'' ``Another Openin', Another Show,'' ``So in Love,'' 
``Too Darn Hot'' and ``Brush Up Your Shakespeare.'' ``Kiss Me, 
Kate'' arrives Nov. 18 at the Martin Beck Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Burnett hasn't been in a musical on Broadway since she did  
``Fade Out, Fade In'' in 1964. That oversight will be corrected 
Nov. 21 when she opens at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in ``Putting 
It Together.'' It is a collection of Stephen Sondheim songs that 
Burnett's good friend Julie Andrews first did off-Broadway in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the revue has been revised and recast with George Hearn,  
Bronson Pinchot, Ruthie Henshall and John Barrowman. Kathy Lee 
Gifford, cheery talk-show goddess, replaces Burnett on Tuesday 
nights only, starting Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Audra McDonald, another ``Ragtime'' veteran and a three-time  
Tony winner, finally gets to star in her own musical. ``Marie 
Christine'' is loosely based on ``Medea,'' but set in New Orleans 
of the 1880s. Anthony Crivello, a Tony winner for ``Kiss of the 
Spider Woman,'' plays her love interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael John LaChiusa, one of the musical theater's bright new  
lights, wrote the score. Look for ``Marie Christine'' at Lincoln 
Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Swing music gets its due on Broadway with another revue, this  
one called, appropriately, ``Swing!'' New and old swing music will 
be featured in the show, which will headline jazz vocalist Ann 
Hampton Callaway. The opening: Dec. 9 at the St. James Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Two high-profile off-Broadway musicals should be mentioned. If  
they succeed, can a transfer to Broadway be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
	The first, ``Contact,'' is a dance musical created by  
choreographer Susan Stroman and writer John Weidman. The show, 
three stories about people who meet through dance, stars Karen 
Ziemba and Boyd Gaines. Stroman has been making a name for herself 
as a choreographer, first with ``Crazy for You'' and then the 
recent, acclaimed London revival of ``Oklahoma!'', expected in New 
York in the fall of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contact,'' which features a variety of classical and pop  
music, opens at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center Oct. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
	There may not be a more stellar cast than the crew Playwrights  
Horizons has assembled for its musical version of ``The Dead,'' 
based on a James Joyce short story. 
</P>
<P>
	Its tiny stage will be home to Christopher Walken, Blair Brown,  
Stephen Spinella, Sally Ann Howes, Marni Nixon and those Siamese 
twins from ``Side Show,'' Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner. The 
highly anticipated opening is Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	New plays seem to be an endangered species on Broadway this  
fall. ``Epic Proportions,'' a comedy by Larry Coen and David Crane 
about the filming of a biblical epic in 1930s Hollywood, is a 
member of this select group. Kristin Chenoweth, Broadway's 
brightest new star, has a leading role as do two other newcomers, 
Alan Tudy and Jeremy Davidson. The laughs officially start Sept. 30 
at the Helen Hayes Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new entry is ``Scent of the Roses,'' starring Julie  
Harris as a South African woman holding on to a prized possession. 
The drama by Lisette Lecat opens Dec. 12 at the Belasco. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Humphries as Dame Edna Everage, modestly billed as  
housewife, megastar, chanteuse, adviser to British royalty, spin 
doctor, grief counselor and icon, arrives Oct. 17 at the Booth 
Theater in ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour.'' This one-man, er, 
one-woman show already has been seen in London and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Dame Edna compete with Bacall? The screen legend stars in  
the Noel Coward's ``Waiting in the Wings,'' with a gaggle of 
theater veterans including Rosemary Harris, Bernard Hughes, Dana 
Ivey, Elizabeth Wilson and Simon Jones. The play opens Dec. 16 -- 
Coward's 100th birthday -- at the Walter Kerr Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, Dec. 15, will see the opening of ``Amadeus,''  
with Suchet portraying the envious composer Salieri and newcomer 
Michael Sheen as Mozart. Sir Peter Hall directs at the Music Box 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roundabout Theater, truly roundabout this season as it  
awaits the completion of its new home on 42nd Street, finds itself 
at the Brooks Atkinson Theater with a revival of ``The Rainmaker.'' 
The N. Richard Nash play concerns a mesmerizing charlatan and his 
effect on a plain unmarried woman. Woody Harrelson plays the con 
man and Jayne Atkinson his willing subject. The opening is set for 
Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	And if none of the above survives, the big guns arrive after New  
Year's -- musicals such as ``The Wild Party,'' ``Martin Guerre,'' 
Disney's ``Aida,'' Stephen Sondheim's ``Wise Guys'' and a revival 
of ``Jesus Christ Superstar.'' Stay tuned for further developments.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves New Loans for Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund approved  
the release of $184 million to the Ukraine from a $2.6 billion aid 
package, the central bank said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds were expected to arrive in a few days, National Bank  
spokesman Dmytro Rikberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Soviet republic is desperate for new loans so that it  
can meet foreign debt obligations of more than $3 billion next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's own revenues are far below target because of  
severe economic problems in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts predict that Ukraine will default on its 2000 debt  
obligations, but government officials have insisted they will meet 
them in full if the IMF continues to disburse aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund, which approved the three-year loan for Ukraine in  
1998, has suspended disbursements several times because the 
government didn't meet its economic reform requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	While agreeing to disburse the latest money, IMF directors  
repeated their long-standing demands that Ukraine speed up 
privatization and approve a realistic budget for 2000 to make debt 
servicing easier.

lost on points to Paulie Ayala on June 26, costing him his WBA 
bantamweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I get back in the ring, he's the first guy I want,'' Tapia  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he's considering retirement, Tapia said: ``No, no, no,  
not at all. I've never been hurt bad, never took a bad punishment 
where I think I should retire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Julio, he said: ``I really do want to fight him, but my  
mind's not there right now. I'm not 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said once he returns to the ring, he would fight anyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never ducked nobody,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he said he couldn't predict Wednesday when he would be back.  
</P>
<P>
	Tapia's wife, Teresa, who is also his manager, said she wouldn't  
be surprised if he's back in the gym after a month, but Tapia said, 
``I don't know if it will be one month, two months, three months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Julio fight, set by Showtime and Frank Warren, was never  
scheduled but the contract is still on the table for him if he 
wants it, Teresa Tapia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapia said he decided last week to take time off and is no  
longer in training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been fighting for 23 years and I never really took a  
vacation,'' he said. ``I've just been fighting, fighting, fighting, 
and I think it's time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His focus wasn't even 100 percent when he fought Ayala on June  
26 in Las Vegas, he said. Tapia said he was distracted by the 
police informing him they had solved the 1975 murder of his mother. 
He said he then had to face it squarely once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just keep on thinking how bad she suffered and why they took  
her away,'' he said. ``Different things are hitting me all at once, 
and I can't handle it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tapia's mother, Virginia Gallegos, was stabbed repeatedly and  
clung to life for days. Police reported in August that they 
believed the assailant had been Richard Espinosa, who was later 
killed in a car crash. Police said Gallegos, 32, had encountered 
Espinosa at a nightclub the evening before she was found crawling 
wounded through a gravel quarry, and that police found her blood on 
Espinosa's shoes. She and Espinosa, who died in 1983, had been 
seeing each other for more than a year. Officers said the case has 
now been closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Tapia said he's focusing on his own wife and son. They might  
travel to London and other points in Europe on their extended 
vacation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His thoughts also go out to his father, he said. Tapia asked  
last month for help in identifying and locating his father, whom he 
has never known. He said Wednesday he still doesn't have that 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he would say to his dad, he said: ``I'd ask him why  
he never came into my life, why was he afraid to call me or talk to 
me. I just want to know who he is and ask him why we couldn't have 
a family together.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Cordero Activated from DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Wil Cordero, who had been on the 60-day  
disabled list since breaking his left wrist in early June, was 
activated by the Cleveland Indians before Wednesday night's game 
against the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero was hitting .325 with four home runs and 23 RBIs when he  
broke his left wrist in two places while making a sliding catch 
June 8 against Milwaukee. He had a screw inserted into the radius 
bone of his wrist the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, who bats right-handed, had been sharing time in the  
outfield and at designated hitter with Richie Sexson, another 
righty. Left-handed hitting Harold Baines has picked up some of the 
DH duties since being acquired Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero wasn't in the starting lineup.  
</P>
<P>
	Cordero is the second Indian to come off the 60-day DL in as  
many days, joining catcher Sandy Alomar. Cleveland still has six 
players on the DL including pitcher Jaret Wright, who is expected 
to start Sunday against Chicago.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Resume WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Negotiations between China and the United States  
on China's bid to join the World Trade Organization have resumed, 
and the two sides will hold high-level talks on the matter in the 
coming days, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Robert Cassidy met with  
China's top WTO negotiator in Beijing this week, embassy spokesman 
Bill Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Cassidy's visit, talks on China's 13-year campaign to  
join the world trade rules-making body were frozen because of the 
NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky will hold  
bilateral discussions with Chinese trade officials in Auckland, New 
Zealand, the site of a Pacific Rim economic summit, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials on both sides are hoping to make progress before a  
meeting Saturday between President Clinton and Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO sets rules for international trade and encourages the  
liberalization of trade. The U.S. has in the past been reluctant to 
admit China, which would have to initiate reforms and reduce 
tariffs to be part of the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's trade and industry minister said Wednesday that China  
should be admitted before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	China is ``a major economic actor on the global stage and  
therefore they ought to part of the WTO and we think that would be 
good for the U.K,'' Richard Caborn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain is ``very pleased that the U.S. has now got back into  
dialogue about the entry of China into the WTO and we hope that's 
going to be successful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strange diplomatic twist, longtime Chinese antagonist  
Taiwan is also lobbying for China's entry. 
</P>
<P>
	China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan, demands that the  
island not be permitted into the WTO first. That has put Taiwanese 
officials in the unusual position of lobbying on behalf of China as 
a means of furthering their own bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Taipei's American Chamber of Commerce will push hard for both  
countries' entry during a trip to Washington next week, Chamber 
President Paul Cassingham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassingham said the topic will top the agenda in meetings  
between a chamber delegation and U.S. officials during the 
chamber's annual lobbying trip.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jane Clayson, an ABC correspondent, has won the  
derby to spend her mornings with Bryant Gumbel at CBS.

</P>
<P>
	The show will go on the air Nov. 1 from a storefront studio CBS

<P>
	``Meeting Bryant was like seeing an old friend,'' Clayson said

<HEADLINE> Eagles Rebuild With New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Nine months ago, Andy Reid peered out at a  
crowded room in a posh downtown hotel like a man surveying his 
predators. He said confidently, with a booming voice, that he was 
the right man to end years of frustration for the Philadelphia 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd never put myself in a bad situation,'' Reid said, his  
words strong enough to carry all the way to this week's season 
opener. ``I feel very confident that this organization can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is almost time to find out about where Reid can lead a team  
that is picked almost unanimously to be the worst in football for 
the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deep wounds of a painful 3-13 season under Ray Rhodes have  
been covered up in the best way possible. There is a new man in 
charge, a revamped coaching staff, more than 20 new players. 
Despite a treacherous exhibition season in which the Eagles were 
1-3 and dreadful as ever on offense, there is hope in the locker 
room that there will be no repeat of the Great Train Wreck of '98. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going through last year was an experience I won't wish on  
anybody,'' said cornerback Troy Vincent, a bright spot on what is 
expected to be a strong defense. ``It was very tough to work all 
week and then go out on Sunday and have so much trouble winning 
football games. I had never been through that before. I hope I'm 
not ever going to go through that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his short time at the helm, Reid has made no secret of his  
willingness to make changes and his distaste for slackers. He 
juggled the offensive line constantly, cut veterans George Hegamin 
and Jerry Crafts and displayed little patience for an offense that 
was painful to watch. The Eagles' first team failed to score a 
touchdown in the exhibition season for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Reid has resisted the temptation to turn the starting  
quarterback job over to Donovan McNabb, the No. 2 overall pick in 
the draft. Starter Doug Pederson was ineffective in four exhibition 
starts, and McNabb had a breakout performance in relief in the 
team's only exhibition win, a 30-17 rout of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a patient guy all my life,'' McNabb said. ``You work  
and prepare, and if the opportunity is there for the taking, you 
have to go out and take advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, a career third-stringer who followed Reid to  
Philadelphia from Green Bay, will start Sunday against Arizona. If 
the offense is as fruitless as in the preseason, the rabble at the 
Vet will waste no time calling for McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can get nasty,'' McNabb said.  
</P>
<P>
	Reid, the second-youngest coach in the league at 41, prefers not  
to rush a young quarterback into duty before his time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't achieve, all of a sudden teammates look at him  
funny, the media looks at him funny, and inevitably the coaches 
might look at him funny,'' Reid said. ``That's not a healthy 
situation. And at the same time, you're asking him to maintain his 
confidence to pull the trigger. That's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind Pederson and McNabb. Johnny Unitas would have a tough  
time playing quarterback for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid has been unhappy with the play of wide receivers Torrance  
Small and Charles Johnson, and the offensive line is in disarray. 
Two rookies -- Doug Brzezinski and John Welbourn -- are listed as 
starters up front. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Asher's season-ending ankle injury left the Eagles  
woefully short at tight end, a vital position in Reid's version of 
the West Coast offense. Rookie Jed Weaver is the starter. His two 
backups, Luther Broughton and Ron Leshinski, both were signed this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I happy with the offense?'' Reid asked. ``No, I am not.''  
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side, the defense performed well beyond  
expectations in the exhibition season under new coordinator Jim 
Johnson. His active, blitzing style suits the Eagles' young talent 
better than the read-and-react schemes of Emmitt Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent and Bobby Taylor are a solid cornerback tandem. Brian  
Dawkins is a rising star at safety, and DE Hugh Douglas is one of 
the league's best pass-rushers. Mike Mamula, the other end, is 
healthy again. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Barry Gardner looks strong at middle linebacker, where he  
will begin the season as Jeremiah Trotter's backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the film, we're in a lot better situation than  
we were at this time last year,'' Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is a positive sign that Reid and director of football  
operations Tom Modrak have a plan, it is going to take patience. 
This word is not in the sports parlance in Philadelphia, which has 
been jaded by too many losing seasons in all sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can't go any place but up,'' Reid said, ``so that's a  
plus.''

<HEADLINE> Miller Park Opening Will Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- It's almost as if the Milwaukee Brewers can't  
believe what's happening to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two months after a 2,100-ton crane collapsed onto a wall  
and killed three workers at Miller Park, the Brewers finally have 
admitted their new stadium's scheduled April 2000 opening will be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we don't have a report (from the stadium builders),  
it's a practical measure for us to acknowledge that October 3 will 
not be the final game at County Stadium,'' vice president of 
corporate affairs Laurel Prieb said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did feel there was a practical priority of taking care of  
54,000 fans who had purchased tickets for October 3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The backhanded acknowledgement came in a press release  
describing alterations in the team's plans for the 1999 season's 
final game on Oct. 3, ``originally targeted to be the final game at 
County Stadium before the July 14 construction accident caused a 
delay for Miller Park's opening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the team and the league apparently have assumed a delay  
would be inevitable. Since last month, major league baseball 
officials in New York have been conducting business under the 
assumption the Brewers will not move into Miller Park until opening 
day 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers have spent the last half-decade planning for the  
move, which will allow them to dramatically increase revenue and 
perhaps even escape baseball's impoverished lower class. With six 
straight losing seasons and a seventh on the way, Miller Park has 
been the beacon of light in the Brewers' dark present. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day this year, no matter whether you were playing good  
or playing bad, you could see workers up there banging on 
something, and it made you feel good because you knew you were 
pushing forward,'' infielder Jeff Cirillo said. ``Now, you don't 
know where your future lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers and the board of directors overseeing the stadium  
claim to be examining the possibility of opening the park in July 
2000, similar to the manner in which the Seattle Mariners opened 
Safeco Field last July. 
</P>
<P>
	But given the months of cleanup work still to be done and the  
logistical problems of doing construction work during a Wisconsin 
winter, an April 2001 opening would seem to be all but certain. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is 63 percent complete and 300 workers currently are  
on the site, according to the board's construction committee. Board 
chairman Frank Busalacchi said Wednesday that a decision on when to 
open Miller Park likely will come soon, possibly during the next 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not leaning anywhere,'' Busalacchi said. ``I'm just  
waiting for an indication from those building the ballpark as to 
what we're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Brewers' moving plans remain up in the air, the team  
is foundering on the field. Entering Wednesday's play, Milwaukee 
had lost 25 of its last 36 games, including 17 of 25 under interim 
manager Jim Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Phil Garner and GM Sal Bando were ousted last month by  
team president Wendy Selig-Prieb. With no general manager to 
impress and no permanent manager to rally the players, morale is 
approaching rock-bottom in the Brewers' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to come out every day and try to hold it  
together,'' third baseman Sean Berry said. ``We try to keep 
fighting, because that's all you can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The delay also will affect the team's finances. The Brewers  
figured to double their revenue in their first year in the 
lucrative ballpark, and a substantial portion of that money was to 
be spent on increasing the team's $39 million payroll, the 
19th-highest among baseball's 30 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that money and the funds which would have been generated  
during the final days at County Stadium and the first year at 
Miller Park, Milwaukee will operate in the red for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Brewers are looking at another full campaign in  
the drafty, smelly old facility slated for demolition as soon as 
Miller Park is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of memories here for some people, but I don't  
have many, especially positive memories,'' All-Star outfielder 
Jeromy Burnitz said. ``I was looking forward to getting in the new 
stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb has steadfastly refused comment on the situation  
until seeing a report from the stadium board. Vice president of 
corporate affairs Laurel Prieb did not return a phone call 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers are trying to make the best of a bad situation,  
however. On Wednesday, the team said those who attend the Oct. 3 
game will be able to purchase comparable tickets to the final game, 
whenever that may be. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also said that after County Stadium is demolished,  
every ticket holder to the Oct. 3 game will be entitled to receive 
a brick from the structure with a letter of authenticity.

<HEADLINE> Liabilities, Threats Burden Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The playground at Silver Bay Elementary School  
in Toms River, N.J., isn't what it used to be. The swings are gone. 
Monkey bars too. The 6-foot metal slide was replaced with a plastic 
4-foot version. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Joseph Pizza knows he took the fun out of recess. But  
the threat of lawsuits is just too much for Pizza, who spends hours 
documenting every accident and every fight for a possible legal 
battle involving his 1,200-student school. One student's family 
sued for $250,000 after a fall in gym class; another sued over an 
accident on school grounds that occurred an hour before the first 
bell rang. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the district prevailed in both cases, Pizza says he  
learned one lesson: ``The principal's responsible for the school 
.... Though you may not be in direct supervision of the child at 
the time, in essence you're carrying the bag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Confronting everything from tumbles in gym to sexually harassed  
middle schoolers to weapons bans, hundreds of principals are forced 
to cut back on programs, change equipment and even cancel field 
trips and events with volunteers to stave off lawsuits and threats 
of lawsuits, principals' groups said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever we plan for anything in a school today, our first  
consideration is how to avoid a lawsuit,'' said Vincent L. 
Ferradino, executive director of the National Association of 
Elementary School Principals. 
</P>
<P>
	He said recent Supreme Court decisions holding schools  
accountable for student-to-student sexual harassment and making 
schools responsible for providing full-time nurses for disabled 
students has left schools open to more legal action. Educators also 
say they've been left vulnerable to liability over the strict 
bookbag bans, dress codes and crackdowns on bullying imposed in the 
wake of last April's deadly shooting at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tell our principals to err on the side of safety, but they  
say we have lawyers looking over our shoulders ready to pounce on 
us,'' Gerald N. Tirozzi, executive director of the National 
Association of Secondary School Principals, which represents 45,000 
school leaders in middle, junior high and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Definite numbers on lawsuits against schools and school boards  
are hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Law Association -- a group of lawyers and educators  
-- estimated there were 930 school and college cases in state and 
federal courts in 1998. Stephen Yurek, general counsel for the 
secondary school principals' group, said members report nearly 300 
lawsuits a year, up from fewer than 200 annually four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a Lehigh University education law professor said  
school-related lawsuits have decreased slightly since the 1970s, 
when they peaked. Perry Zirkel said his research found that 10 
years ago, insurance companies were overcharging school districts 
because the litigation didn't justify the rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're sued, it gets dramatic and you get overly  
paranoid,'' Zirkel said of educators who complain of more lawsuits. 
``The courts are hearing fewer cases in education and increasingly 
courts are giving the benefit of the doubt to schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, smaller districts are spending $5,000 to $15,000 a  
year on routine legal matters, and time-consuming civil cases 
involving sexual harassment or employee dismissal can cost up to 
$50,000 per case, Yurek said. 
</P>
<P>
	For larger districts with 10,000 or more students, annual legal  
costs range from $250,000 to $1 million and they can spend $50,000 
to $100,000 on a single lawsuit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The principals groups gathered Wednesday to announce an  
unofficial survey of principals by the American Tort Reform 
Association, which has criticized increased lawsuit judgments. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 523 principals who responded to a survey mailed to 5,000,  
nearly two-thirds said they had seen more school lawsuits in the 
last 10 years. About that many also said they expected litigation 
to increase in the wake of Littleton and the Supreme Court decision 
on sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly eight of 10 said they had banned staffs from hugging and  
other physical contact with children to avoid misunderstandings or 
possible complaints of teacher-to-student sexual impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when you wouldn't have thought about putting  
an arm around a kid in trouble, but not today, even when one of the 
things school safety prevention literature tells us is that we need 
to have a personal touch,'' Tirozzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Threats of lawsuits can also be damaging, said June Million,  
spokeswoman for the elementary school principals. Such matters are 
often settled out of court, with families receiving a few thousand 
dollars, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of win-win for parents and parents' lawyers and  
lose-lose for the school system that's trying to avoid 
litigation,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Healed But Return Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing's torn Achilles' tendon is  
completely healed but the New York Knicks are unsure when their 
star center will be able to return to the court. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse for the team, backup center Chris Dudley  
sprained ligaments in his right knee playing basketball Tuesday. He 
will begin rehabilitating the knee immediately and can begin 
running again in four to six weeks, a Knicks spokeswoman, Lori 
Hamamoto, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether Ewing or Dudley will be ready for training  
camp, which begins Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing was sidelined with a partially torn Achilles' tendon from  
Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals through the Knicks' run to 
the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old center missed several games during the regular  
season and was hampered during New York's first 11 playoff games by 
Achilles' tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
	He would have risked a career-ending torn Achilles' tendon if he  
continued to play throughout the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Questioned in Herman Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was questioned under oath  
Wednesday at the White House in the influence-peddling 
investigation of Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	The hour-long interview was led by Independent Counsel Ralph  
Lancaster, who was named in May, 1998 to investigate allegations 
dating back to Herman's work as an assistant to Clinton and head of 
the White House Public Liaison Office before she moved to the Labor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	White House counsel Beth Nolan issued a statement revealing the  
interview, once it was over. ``Consistent with prior practice,'' 
she said, ``no further statement about the interview will be 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herman's attorney, Neil Eggleston, said, ``This matter related  
to events that occurred while Secretary Herman was at the White 
House, so I certainly expected that the independent counsel would 
meet with the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation centers on allegations that Herman, before  
joining the Cabinet, engaged in influence-peddling and solicited 
$250,000 in illegal campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	She has denied the allegations, and Clinton has said he is  
confident that investigators will conclude that Herman did nothing 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman's accuser is Laurent Yene, a Cameroon citizen doing  
business in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	According to information released by Attorney General Janet  
Reno, Yene told the Justice Department that Herman, while a White 
House aide, had an agreement to receive a 10 percent kickback for 
aiding the clients of International Investments and Business 
Development, a company co-owned by Herman's close friend, Vanessa 
Weaver, and by Yene, 
</P>
<P>
	He also contended that Herman directed Weaver to solicit  
campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee from 
the company's clients, one of whom was a foreigner and thus barred 
from contributing to U.S. election campaigns. These donations were 
allegedly to facilitate favorable government action on the clients' 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	After a review of bank accounts and other documents and more  
than 100 interviews, including some with Herman, Reno said her 
investigators ``uncovered financial transactions potentially 
corroborative of Yene's allegations which require further 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has described Herman as cooperative with the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Jim Leyland Confirms Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- As he completes his 14th year as a major league  
manager, Jim Leyland has made it official: This season will be his 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am retiring, absolutely,'' Leyland said following the  
Rockies' 5-1 win over Montreal on Wednesday. ``I'm ready to do 
something else in the game and I'm not going to manage any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver-area newspapers reported Wednesday that Leyland had  
announced to his players prior to Monday's series opener his 
intention to retire at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland would not field any questions about his managerial  
status following Tuesday's game. He did, however, reveal his 
decision to reporters who cover the team on a daily basis and 
confirmed the substance of the reports on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've all been accurate,'' Leyland said.  
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, however, declined to discuss his decision any further.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going into that,'' Leyland said. ``I'm not going to go  
through it every day for the rest of the season. That's why I got 
it out. It's over with, we're going to try to win as many games as 
we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Leyland told the Denver Rocky Mountain News: ``I  
will not manage a professional baseball team again. I can only do 
things one way, at 110 miles per hour. I can't do it at 75 miles 
per hour. I've got to approach it hell bent for leather, with every 
bit of energy. As far as a manager's position, I don't have the 
energy to do it anymore. I'm not going to steal money. I never have 
and I never will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, who managed the Florida Marlins to a World Series title  
in 1997, joined the Rockies in the offseason after managing the 
Marlins for two years. He got a three-year, $6 million contract 
from Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland had said earlier he was 99 percent sure he was retiring  
after this season, his 14th as a major league manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado has not performed up to expectations this season and  
was 63-78 after Wednesday's win. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland established himself as one of the premier managers in  
the majors during his first 11 years with Pittsburgh, leading the 
Pirates to three straight NL East Division titles from 1990-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland has a 1,059-1,117 record as a major league manager,  
including two games as interim manager of the Chicago White Sox in 
1985.

<HEADLINE> English Soccer Fans Clash in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A fight in a downtown park between English  
soccer fans and Poles left nine people injured Wednesday, hours 
before the two nations played a crucial qualifying game for the 
2000 European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Police imposed tight security near Legia Stadium, keeping people  
without tickets several hundreds yards from the entrance and 
patrolling streets in vehicles and on horses. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight involving a few dozen people in Saski Garden injured  
nine English fans, who were taken to a Warsaw hospital, police 
spokesman Dariusz Janas said. He said no figures were available for 
the Poles because they had fled when police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report, four English fans were beaten and robbed of  
money, passports, air tickets and backpacks by a gang of Poles, 
police spokesman Leszek Zmuda told the Polish news agency PAP. 
Zmuda said police later arrested the robbers and recovered the 
stolen items. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, a glass-throwing bar fight between English  
fans and Poles left two people hospitalized and several others in 
police custody. 
</P>
<P>
	The reputation for violence by English soccer fans prompted the  
heavy security presence by police. Dozens of police vehicles were 
parked near the stadium and some could be seen driving slowly 
alongside English fans walking to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 English fans have tickets for the game, and hundreds  
more were believed to be in Warsaw without tickets.

<HEADLINE> Baylor Suspends Players for Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- Quarterback Odell James and defensive end  
Charles Foster were suspended for Saturday's game against UNLV, 
Baylor coach Kevin Steele said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele, in his first season, said the players violated team  
policies but wouldn't elaborate. The Baylor athletic department 
didn't return a call from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	James, a 6-foot-3, 226-pound junior, has been competing for the  
starting spot against senior Jermaine Alfred, although Alfred 
started in Saturday's 30-29 season-opening overtime loss at Boston 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, James applauded Baylor's firing of football coach  
Dave Roberts, whose tenure he described as contentious. Baylor 
finished last season with six consecutive losses and its second 
straight 2-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a lot of arguing and fussing in the locker room,''  
James said then. ``It had been like that the whole season. A lot of 
players on the team were down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster is a 6-foot-5, 293-pound senior.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Raises Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A torrid housing market and other signs of a  
fast-recovering economy led the Bank of England to raise a key 
interest rate for the first time in more than a year, in a move 
that unsettled stock markets in Britain and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The base lending rate was increased Wednesday to 5.25 percent  
from 5 percent, surprising analysts and disappointing homeowners. 
The base rate is the interest Britain's central bank charges 
commercial banks for loans and last was raised in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase followed a string of seven rate cuts aimed at  
stimulating the economy. It came amid mounting evidence that the 
country's recovery is speeding up. In addition, fears have grown 
that the demand for housing in many parts of Britain could lead to 
an '80s-style boom and subsequent bust. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of higher returns on British interest-bearing  
investments sent the pound soaring. Britain's currency was worth 
$1.6220 at the close of European trading, compared with $1.6063 
Tuesday. Later in New York, the pound was worth $1.6192. 
</P>
<P>
	But London's FTSE 100 stock index slipped 55.9 points, or 0.9  
percent, finishing the day at 6,253.6 on the prospect that rising 
borrowing costs would cut profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, stocks opened lower, as the Bank of England's  
action added to American interest rate jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average dropped almost 67 points, then  
rebounded to a gain of more than 83 points, only to give up most of 
the gains. It finished the day up 2.21 at 11,036.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice this summer, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds  
rate -- the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans -- in 
an effort to prevent a rekindling of U.S. inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee said it had  
considered both the housing and labor markets in making its 
decision to raise the base rate by a quarter-point. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rise in interest rates was necessary to keep inflation on  
track further ahead,'' it said in a statement. ``An early move 
could lower the level at which interest rates might otherwise need 
to be set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee added that it expects inflation to remain below  
the target of 2.5 percent in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
	The Halifax Bank, a major mortgage lender, reacted to the  
increase by immediately announcing a rise in its standard variable 
mortgage rate to 6.99 percent from 6.85 percent. Halifax raised its 
rate despite having failed to pass on the Bank of England's last 
quarter-point cut to its home loan customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lenders in Britain, where U.S.-style fixed-rate mortgages  
are rare, were expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Chamber of Commerce said the rate hike threatened to  
derail Britain's economic recovery by making it more expensive for 
companies to borrow money. The increase could also cause the 
British pound to increase in value, making the country's exports 
more expensive than goods denominated in other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (committee) has yielded to the panic calls of the prophets  
of boom and this decision will shock and infuriate business,'' said 
Ian Peters, the chamber's deputy director general. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Parker, senior economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, called  
the bank's move ``unwarranted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going for a pre-emptive strike,'' he said. ``There  
are signs in the housing market of rapid inflation, but that has 
not spread into other parts of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House prices have jumped by almost 10 percent in the last year.  
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Bank of England raised the base rate was June  
4, 1998, when it was increased to 7.50 percent from 7.25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Peugeot Profit Rises 60 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French automaker PSA Peugeot-Citroen said Wednesday  
a robust European car market helped its net profits rise by 60 
percent during the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned the equivalent of $576 million, up from $359  
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 7.5 percent to $20 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Peugeot attributed its performance to the success of its new  
models, especially those with a new generation of diesel motors. 
Operating profit for the automobile division rose to $601 million, 
a 32.8 percent jump from the first half of last year, largely due 
to a reduction in production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Peugeot said the strong European market, combined with the  
company's increase in car production capacity and its planned 
introduction of two new models this year, would help it meet its 
1999 goal of selling 2.4 million vehicles, a 5.4 percent increase 
over 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first six months of 1999, Europe's passenger car and  
light commercial vehicle market grew by 8 percent, a higher rate 
than expected, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Cleanup of Calif. Oil Spill Is Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Calif. (AP) -- Coast Guard officials have managed to  
clean up only a small portion of about 2,000 gallons of oil that 
has leaked into Humboldt Bay from a dredging vessel. The oil leak 
from the ruptured fuel tank of The Stuyvesant occurred Monday night 
after rough seas apparently tossed part of the dredging apparatus 
against the vessel. Part of the equipment sliced through the hull, 
cutting a 6-inch to 8-inch-wide hole in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, which had been working about three-fourths of a mile  
offshore, was sent 3 miles out to sea so it would not further 
impact the bay, 225 miles northwest of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	A small amount of oil washed ashore near the Samoa Boat Ramp and  
was cleaned up Tuesday afternoon. Work crews collected a garbage 
bag full of oil-covered rocks and plants, and 14 oil-slicked birds 
also were recovered, said Coast Guard Lt. Richard Teubner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad weather kept cleanup vessels blocked Tuesday, but officials  
were hopeful that clear weather today would allow them to resume 
mopping up the oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The bay is home to a variety of marine life, including sea  
otters and seals. There is an abundance of bird species in the area 
but only a few birds were spotted during an overflight of the 
spill, Teubner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is that with the wind and surf they won't want to be  
out in water,'' Teubner said.

<HEADLINE> Car Rental Agencies Can Be Fickle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I recently tried to reserve a rental car using my debit card,  
but I was turned down. How can this happen? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Although most rental agencies will accept debit cards as  
payment, some won't accept them to guarantee a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Debit cards are basically ATM cards with MasterCard or Visa  
logos. When a debit card is used for a purchase, money is 
immediately subtracted from a bank or brokerage account. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit cards, on the other hand, let you charge purchases and  
pay for them later -- with interest, of course, if the balance is 
not paid in full each month. The card issuer guarantees payment 
based on the borrower's credit limit.. 
</P>
<P>
	``A debit card just shows that you have a checking account. A  
credit card is different in that it shows you have met credit 
worthiness standards of the issuer,'' said Frances Smith, executive 
director of Consumer Alert, a nonprofit consumer information group 
in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Some car rental companies feel more comfortable with a credit  
card. They want to know the car they lend out will be returned in 
good condition or that they'll be reimbursed if it's not, and a 
credit card provides that extra insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the major rental companies, Alamo will accept debit cards  
for reservation and payment. Budget will only accept debit cards at 
select locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis, Enterprise and Hertz do not require a credit card to hold  
a reservation unless you request a luxury car, van or sports 
utility vehicle. However, at Avis and Hertz, you must supply a 
credit card before you drive away with any vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	National's reservation policy is similar. If you're reserving a  
pre-paid or guaranteed rate car you will need a credit card. You'll 
also need a credit card to take possession of the car. Many Dollar 
locations will accept debit cards for reservations and payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies will settle for a hefty cash deposit, usually  
starting around $200. 
</P>
<P>
	Before you make your car reservation, you should familiarize  
yourself with the payment policies of an agency. Many car rental 
agencies will accept debit cards as final payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, check with your bank for debit card terms. For instance,  
you'll need to know transactions limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think of your debit card as a substitute for a check,'' said  
Smith.

	CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. (AP) -- In this trapped-in-time hamlet beside  
the Mississippi River, Bill Bradley gathered today the snapshots of 
his Cinderella youth to show, he said, how his presidency would be 
unlike that of Democratic rival Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a small-town America. It shaped me in a very  
fundamental way,'' Bradley said. ``There is a difference. I think 
we'd be very different kinds of presidents, and I think that flows 
from our life experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley -- the humble banker's son, Sunday school teacher,  
basketball boy wonder, Olympic star and sober New Jersey senator -- 
came home to launch the critical next phase of his presidential 
campaign among neighbors who always believed he belonged in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Bradley  
said a successful presidency must be ``led by your conviction'' and 
unafraid ``to be specific on some big things.'' His would reflect 
his upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every president sets a tone. ... He sets some values out  
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Bradley criticized Gore, a Tennessee senator's son  
who spent much of his childhood in Washington, for not being 
specific in his latest policy announcement on health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's main event -- a speech that aides said would be a highly  
personal account of how Bradley has lived his life and what he 
envisions for the nation -- was set for the front steps of Crystal 
City High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, 56, posed there Tuesday while aides gauged the best  
angle for news cameras descending on this one-stoplight town 
(population 4,088) from as far away as Germany and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	No highfalutin caterers for this family affair, said Republican  
Mayor Grant S. Johnston. Piled in his office were an odd assortment 
of the 5,000 cookies baked by ``all the grandmas and 
great-grandmas,'' as Lori Grass put it. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the way with Bill!'' read one of the dozens of lawn signs  
produced by a single postal clerk who volunteered eight hours and a 
set of red, blue and black markers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's such a stud,'' said Mike DeClue, a high school senior and  
basketball player, who added that his coach makes the team run laps 
past the lobby's trophy case, or ``Bradley shrine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The candidate promised to lead a twilight tour of his life's  
landmarks: the old State Bank where his father, the president, 
weathered the Great Depression without foreclosing on a single 
homeowner; the weeded-over lot where the Pittsburgh Plate Glass 
factory shut down the town's lifeblood when it closed in 1992; the 
Little League field where Bradley and his integrated team learned 
to field the racial discrimination of visiting teams. 
</P>
<P>
	A spot on the Princeton University basketball team proved to be  
Bradley's ticket out. He went on to captain the gold medal-winning 
U.S. team at the 1964 Olympics, study at Oxford, star for the New 
York Knicks, then in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	At Bradley's side today was his wife of 25 years, Ernestine, 63.  
Their 22-year-old daughter, Theresa Anne, is a college student and 
studying overseas, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's team arrived here buoyed by a weekend poll that showed  
that he and Gore, the favorite of President Clinton and the 
Democratic Party establishment, were running neck and neck in New 
Hampshire for the party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Having already proved his financial viability by amassing in the  
first half of this year some $12 million in campaign donations to 
Gore's $18 million, Bradley hopes to use a series of detailed 
policy announcements this fall -- on child poverty, universal health 
care, the economy and foreign policy -- to overcome other surveys 
suggesting he remains relatively unknown nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In the backyard of the squat, stone Taylor Avenue home he left  
38 years ago but has maintained since his parents died, Bradley 
remembered on Tuesday a time when he was anything but underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to shoot behind here; it was the rule,'' the balding,  
6-foot-5 Bradley said, pointing to the back edge of a 
parking-spot-sized court, far from the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
	His own rule.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of kids were shorter than I. It wouldn't be fair for me  
to pull up. Couldn't take advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His earnestness is for real, agreed Crystal City old-timers, and  
makes him the best man for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew him as a person. He's honest. Honesty's very  
important. It's the main thing, really,'' said Norma Dorsey, 77, as 
she waited her turn at Rosie's Hair Creations on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Down three blocks at Gordon's Stoplight Drive-In, retired  
glassworkers Alvin Rouggly and Bud Sweeney whiled away their 
morning like always -- nursing 89-cent mugs of coffee, trading dirty 
jokes and griping about taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bradley don't have that gift of gab,'' said Sweeney, 85. ``Not  
like Gore. Not like a used-car salesman who promises you the moon 
but they don't deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rouggly, 74, remembers a down-to-earth Bill growing up the son  
of the bank president (``His parents had a Cadillac. He wanted a 
Plymouth.'') and practicing outside shots in the backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day, it was just shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot.  
He's no quitter,'' said Rouggly. 
</P>
<P>
	But can he win this time? Rouggly held up crossed fingers. ``I'm  
hoping Bill will win, I want him to win, but I believe Al Gore will 
beat him because he is the vice president and all that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner and fry cook Curt Grass, 46, said Bradley and Gore ought  
to team up. ``There's a ticket the other side can't beat.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Floyd Says Furor Is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins outfielder Cliff Floyd, benched for  
one game because he arrived two minutes late for a pregame workout, 
says his anger at manager John Boles has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
	The disciplinary move prompted an outburst Tuesday by Floyd, who  
complained that he deserved more respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was back in the lineup Wednesday against the Los Angeles  
Dodgers. He said he wanted to forget the incident but stopped short 
of an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not taking anything I said back,'' he said. ``What I said,  
I said from the heart, and I meant it. At the same time, it made it 
sound like I was being a problem. What happened is over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boles said he also wanted to put the matter in the past.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was a little thing about a player who came late,'' Boles  
said. ``He didn't commit any crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's game was to be Floyd's first after 11 weeks on the  
disabled list. He arrived in Miami shortly after noon from a 
rehabilitation assignment in Triple-A Calgary, and because he 
didn't know the Marlins' batting practice had been moved 20 minutes 
earlier than usual, he walked on the field two minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
	When Floyd found out he was being scratched from the lineup, he  
became livid. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the respect I get,'' he said. ``It's unbelievable. Now  
I see what Sheffield went through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Marlins outfielder Gary Sheffield had frequent run-ins  
with management. He's the only other player to be benched by Boles 
for arriving late. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd said Wednesday he lost his temper in part because he's  
frustrated about an injury-plagued season. After signing a 
four-year, $19 million contract last winter, he has played in just 
47 of Florida's 139 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd also has been bothered by speculation that he may be  
traded. Boles said there have been no discussions with other teams 
regarding Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are interested in him being healthy and being our left  
fielder and No. 3 hitter next year,'' Boles said.

<HEADLINE> Fall Books: Frank McCourt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Once he begins the fall's most anticipated book  
tour, Frank McCourt will try something he never anticipated: 
avoiding the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``You almost become like a dancing clown, available to  
everybody,'' said McCourt, who will soon take to the road in 
support of his memoir, ``'Tis,'' the sequel to his beloved Pulitzer 
Prize-winning ``Angela's Ashes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just three years after the publication of ``Angela Ashes,''  
McCourt has been transformed from retired school teacher to world 
famous writer and raconteur. No author has been less reclusive. He 
has appeared at luncheons, readings and seemingly anything related 
to writing or Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	For reporters, he always had something to say.  
</P>
<P>
	``My wife keeps saying too much is too much,'' McCourt said.  
``I'm very naive about all of this. I have the habit of saying 
'yes' to everything. So now I ask her about it first. And her 
favorite word has become `no.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``'Tis'' covers McCourt's life from his arrival in the United  
States in the 1940s to the death of his parents, in the 1980s. He 
writes of his early years in New York, when he lived in rooming 
houses and did everything from work at the shipyard to sweep floors 
at hotels. He then relates his often exhausting experiences as a 
high school English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``For my next book I'd like to write a novel about teaching,''  
McCourt said. ``Anyone in the high school knows you teach five 
classes and that you have over 150 kids. Not enough is known about 
that. The only novel that comes close is `Up the Down Staircase.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McCourt's new book has a first printing of more than 1 million,  
and will almost surely outsell the dozens of other memoirs coming 
out. The irony is that so many will describe lives far more 
glamorous than his. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the industry has been burned by underselling memoirs  
from the likes of Jay Leno, Whoopi Goldberg and others, the fall 
list is packed with celebrity books. Memoirs are expected from 
Aretha Franklin, Rosemary Clooney, Merle Haggard, Meat Loaf, former 
Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, Dyan Cannon, Eddie Fisher, Gloria Stuart 
and Barry White. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be two biographies on Andy Kaufman, plus a published  
version of the script for the film ``Man on the Moon,'' a fall 
release that stars Jim Carrey as the late comedian. David Crosby 
has collaborated on ``Stand and Be Counted,'' a history of music 
and political activism. In ``The Spectator,'' the first of a 
planned trilogy, Studs Terkel compiles his many radio interviews 
with film and stage artists, from Buster Keaton to Marlon Brando. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of his books before this have been about common people,  
but Studs has also been doing these interviews with artists for 
close to 50 years,'' said Andre Schiffrin, founder and 
editor-in-chief of The New Press, Terkel's publisher. ``In the 
future, we'll have a book on musicians and one on writers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With few major elections, this is an ``off'' year in the  
political world, but not for politicians in the publishing world. 
Senator John McCain, former Senator John Glenn, Marian Wright 
Edelman, Oklahoma Congressman J.C. Watts and former California 
Congressman Ronald V. Dellums are among those with memoirs coming 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Also expected are two authorized biographies: ``Dutch,'' Edmund  
Morris' long-awaited book on former President Reagan, and 
``Mandela,'' the story of the South African president as written by 
journalist and longtime friend Anthony Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Bush has compiled his letters in ``All the  
Best,'' and look for two books about his son, George W. Bush, the 
Texas governor and Republican presidential hopeful. The first, ``A 
Charge to Keep,'' is his autobiography. The other, almost certainly 
less respectful, is ``Shrub,'' by the liberal Texas columnist Molly 
Ivins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not interested in sex or drugs. We're interested in what  
he's done in office -- if anything,'' Ivins said. ``The single 
biggest misconception is that he has run a large state for five 
years. Anyone who understands Texas politics understands the 
governor is probably the fifth most powerful official.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other political books include ``The Rising Fifth Estate,'' a  
critique of the media and the Internet by former Clinton aide Dick 
Morris, and ``Hillary's Choice,'' Gail Sheehy's analysis of First 
Lady Hillary Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall will be a big season for commercial fiction -- Michael  
Crichton, Stephen King and Scott Turow are among those with new 
novels -- but little will be heard from high-profile literary 
writers. Isabel Allende, Roddy Doyle and Pulitzer Prize-winner 
Steven Millhauser are some of the better-known authors with books 
due. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ``new'' fiction writers already have familiar names from  
the movie world. Academy Award-winning actor Gene Hackman has 
co-authored the novel ``Wake of the Perdido Star.'' Wes Craven, 
director of ``Scream,'' debuts as a novelist with ``Fountain 
Society.'' Linn Ullmann's ``Before You Sleep,'' already a best 
seller in Scandinavia, is due shortly in the United States. Ullmann 
is the daughter of filmmaker Ingmar Bergman and actress Liv 
Ullmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Also among fiction titles, look for such emerging authors as  
Chang-rae Lee (``A Gesture Life''), Lily King (``The Pleasing 
Hour'') and Kent Haruf, whose novel ``Plainsong'' is already a 
favorite among booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enthusiasm for `Plainsong' is on a par with the early  
passion for `All the Pretty Horses' and `The English Patient,''' 
said Carl Lennertz, marketing consultant for the American 
Booksellers Association. ``The buzz is about the quality of the 
writing -- pure and simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An unusual story is told in the novel ``Hitler's Niece,'' Ron  
Hansen's re-creation of the relationship between Hitler and the 
young woman he called the love of his life. Another Hitler-related 
book is the biography ``Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius 
XII.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New nonfiction books are due from ``Backlash'' author Susan  
Faludi, sociologist Neil Postman and spiritual advisers Marianne 
Williamson and Iyanla Vanzant. ``Witness to Hope'' is an authorized 
biography of Pope John Paul II, by religious commentator George 
Weigel. ``Ali: Journey of a Holy Man'' is a ``spiritual'' memoir 
from the former boxing champion. ``Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight,'' 
by Howard Bingham and Max Wallace, documents Ali's refusal to be 
inducted during the Vietnam War. Ali contributed a foreword. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Ali books, sports fans can look for ``When Pride  
Still Mattered,'' David Maraniss' extensive biography on the late 
Vince Lombardi; ``Joe Torre's Ground Rules for Winners,'' advice 
from the New York Yankees manager; and ``Bird Watching,'' thoughts 
on basketball from NBA Hall of Famer Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Coach's Life'' is the autobiography of former college  
basketball coach Dean Smith. Roger Kahn, best known for his 
baseball book, ``The Boys of Summer,'' tells the story of boxer 
Jack Dempsey in ``A Flame of Pure Fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An unusual sports journey is documented in ``The Ball: Mark  
McGwire's 70th home run ball and the Marketing of the American 
Dream.'' Daniel Paisner, a novelist and magazine writer, follows a 
single baseball from its creation on an assembly line in Costa Rica 
to its eventual auction after McGwire's final shot of the 1998 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just one ball out of a million, but it ended up with  
all these people grabbing at it -- businessmen and marketers and 
agents and lawyers,'' Paisner said. ``It came to represent what our 
culture stands for at the end of the millennium.''

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Forms in Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Floyd, the sixth named storm this  
season, formed in the Atlantic early today with ominous potential, 
hurricane forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, with winds near 40 mph, was about 755 miles east of  
the Leeward Islands moving west-northwest at nearly 16 mph, 
according to the National Hurricane Center in suburban Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical storm force winds extended up to 85 miles from the  
center of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was expected to strengthen while continuing at the same  
speed through early Thursday, moving well northeast of Puerto Rico 
and the Leeward Islands in the northeastern Caribbean islands. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to be a hurricane by late Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Floyd is a good candidate to ultimately achieve major  
hurricane status,'' forecaster Richard Pasch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd formed from a brief tropical depression that came from a  
disturbance working its way west across the southern North 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical depressions become named storms if their sustained  
circulating winds reach 39 mph. They become hurricanes if the winds 
hit 74 mph.

<HEADLINE> Puff Daddy Must Undergo Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sean ``Puffy'' Combs was ordered Wednesday to  
undergo a day of anger management counseling after he pleaded 
guilty to harassing a recording executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Combs, 29, and an associate were arrested in April on charges of  
assaulting Steven Stoute, who suffered a broken arm, a broken jaw 
and cuts to his head after being hit with a chair and a champagne 
bottle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rap mogul initially was charged with second-degree assault  
and faced up to seven years in prison, but Stoute balked at 
pursuing the prosecution and Combs was allowed to plead guilty to 
the lesser charge of harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Combs blamed Stoute for letting MTV air a video with a scene  
that showed Combs nailed to a cross. His attorney said Combs wanted 
the scene cut because he worried it might be offensive.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 2.21 at 11,036.34 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A barrage of conflicting signals on interest  
rates kept investors off balance Wednesday, leaving the Dow 
industrials little changed while most stocks ended with modest 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended with a gain of 2.21,  
closing at 11,036.34. During the session, the Dow rose 83 points 
and tumbled nearly 67 points from Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 6.30 to 1,344.15, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 28.52 to 
2,808.74. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear of higher interest rates, which has rattled stock and  
bond markets all summer, dominated trading again Wednesday. Stocks 
initially tumbled after the Bank of England increased its base 
lending rate for the first time in more than a year, a surprise 
move that followed a string of seven cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market rebounded as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan delivered a speech to the Gerald R. Ford Foundation in 
Grand Rapids, Mich. While Greenspan discussed a wide range of 
topics, from the benefits of free market economies to the need for 
fairness in business, he did not address U.S. interest rates or 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Greenspan praised the technological advances that have  
contributed to ``the greatest prosperity the world has ever 
experienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's words heartened investors who eagerly parsed his  
words, seeking signs of the Fed's future course on interest rates. 
The Fed has suggested it might be willing to raise rates for a 
third time this year if it determines inflation is accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is trying to guess what the Fed might be thinking,''  
said Tim O'Neill, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal and 
Harris Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a separate appearance Wednesday afternoon, Fed Gov.  
Laurence Meyer ended the burst of optimism. Meyer said he is unsure 
whether the U.S. economy is overheating, although he noted that 
wage pressures are building and said the case for a third rate 
increase is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill said the threat of higher interest rates, which can cut  
into corporate profits and increase the cost of borrowing, 
continues to keep investors on edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets are responding to data events to a greater degree  
than they did in the past,'' O'Neill said, adding that while 
Britain's rate increase may have temporarily stunned the markets, 
it is unlikely to affect the Fed's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's midday boost was helped along by Abby Joseph Cohen,  
the bullish chief market strategist at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. In a 
report to clients, Cohen said strong corporate earnings should help 
S&AMP;P 500 top 1,385 by the end of the year. She also expects the Dow 
to top 11,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen noted, however, that escalating labor costs could threaten  
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain technology companies posted major gains today. Global  
Crossing, the architect of an undersea fiber network, shot up 5 1/4 to 
25 9/16 after the company secured a major investment from Microsoft 
and Softbank. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier Corp., a long-distance provider that Global Crossing  
plans to acquire, rose 8 13/16 to 45 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron, up 1 1/4 to 94 7/16, and Exxon, up 1 11/16 to 81 3/16,  
helped the Dow contain its losses as oil companies continued to 
benefit from rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors moved away from consumer companies like Kodak,  
down 1 1/2 at 72 9/16, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, down 1 5/16 at 100 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Volume of all NYSE-listed shares totaled 
942.24 million shares, compared with 863.50 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.34 to 435.90.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mixed. Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.9  
percent following news of the increase in interest rates. Japan's 
Nikkei stock average fell 0.4 percent, Germany's DAX index gained 
0.2 percent and France's CAC-40 closed up 0.01 percent.

<HEADLINE> Monica Lewinsky Hawks Purses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even after a best-selling book and an Internet  
venture, Monica Lewinsky says she remains in debt from legal 
expenses related to the impeachment scandal and hopes a new line of 
purses she's selling will open an avenue ``to where my future 
goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I went back to something I did in high school, which was  
designing and sewing,'' Ms. Lewinsky said in an interview Wednesday 
with The Associated Press. ``It's been nourishing for me 
emotionally to work with colors and different fabrics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky first started making handbags last year, when she  
was staying in, trying to avoid the news media during the 
impeachment scandal. Now, she's turned her hobby into an Internet 
sales venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Since she started selling them through her Web site last week,  
Ms. Lewinsky has moved several hundred ``Made especially for you by 
Monica'' handbags, which cost between $70 and $130 each, logging 
five-figure sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be one of the first steps to where my future goes. I  
want it to be successful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A dollar from each bag will go toward various charities, and the  
profits will go toward paying off her debts, Ms. Lewinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new business has been a family affair. Ms. Lewinsky's  
stepmother taught her to knit, her mother put her in touch with the 
fashion industry and her brother helped set up the 
www.therealmonicainc.com Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not have gotten through this without my family,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky said by telephone from Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Standoff in S.C. Prison Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISHOPVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Two inmates at a maximum-security  
prison -- one a convicted murderer -- held two prison workers hostage 
for several hours before surrendering and releasing both unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is over, and I'm glad to say that no hostage or  
inmate was injured,'' John Barkley, a spokesman for the state 
Department of Corrections, said early today. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostages were grabbed Tuesday afternoon by convicted killer  
Wesley Floyd, 29, and John New, 20, serving 15 years for grand 
larceny, Barkley said. The pair were armed with a shank, a 
makeshift weapon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Law officers wearing helmets and bulletproof gear poured into  
Lee Correctional Institution, about 60 miles east of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations carried on for almost 13 hours. Barkley did not say  
if the inmates made any demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The first hostage, a secretary at the prison school, was  
released Tuesday night, and the second, a teacher for the 
Department of Corrections, was released early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Each inmate will be charged with two counts of hostage taking  
and possession of a weapon, Barkley said. A hostage charge carries 
a maximum sentence of 20 years.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England increased its base lending  
rate for the first time in more than a year, following a string of 
seven cuts, in a move that surprised economists and homeowners and 
angered industry groups. Today's increase to 5.25 percent from 5 
percent was the first since June 1998. It followed growing evidence 
that Britain's economic recovery is speeding up and amid fears that 
the housing market is heading for an '80s-style boom.

	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Eighteen former and current employees of  
First Union Corp. have filed a $300 million lawsuit against the 
nation's sixth-largest bank, claiming it put profits ahead of its 
employees' best interests in managing their in-house 401(k) 
retirement plans. The lawsuit filed yesterday claims First Union 
employees have lost $100 million by being forced to invest in 
poorly performing, high-fee First Union mutual funds. The suit 
could draw in 100,000 current and former members of First Union's 
401(k) plan if it is certified as a class-action.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 8 percent of full-time workers -- or 6.3  
million Americans -- have used illegal drugs in the last month, the 
government reported today. Workers in restaurants, bars, 
construction and transportation were more likely than others to use 
drugs. Nationwide, seven in 10 drug users were full-time workers in 
1997, according to a new report that officials hope will dispel 
notions that most drug users are burned out and disconnected from 
the mainstream.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. are going to have to  
make their case to regulators if they want to complete a proposed 
$35.89 billion merger. Of particular concern is whether they'll 
have to sell off some television stations. The proposed alliance 
would run up against restrictions on the percentage of the national 
audience that one company may reach through its owned TV stations. 
Another rule prohibits a company from owning more than one TV

its investment banking business. The banking company said it earned 
the equivalent of $1.78 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year 
earlier. The company said its investment bank, Credit Suisse First 
Boston, reported a 4 percent decline in first-half net profit to 
$676 million as it sought to reduce risks after its exposure to 
Russian bonds last year.

	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Northwest Airlines expects to lose  
more than $100 million in Asia this year, but business should 
improve gradually in the next few years, the company said today. 
Martin Gross, general manager for the Philippines and Micronesia, 
said the financial crisis in Asia badly affected the company's 
earnings. But he said that the region's air travel market, led by 
Japan, has started to recover and that the company could break even 
in Asia next year. The airline reported a net loss of $285.5 
million in 1998 after a profit of $596.5 million in 1997.

company. Michael J. Durham, a longtime AMR Corp. executive, had 
been entrusted with Sabre since it was spun off by AMR in 1996. 
Durham resigned to pursue other business opportunities, the company

lawsuit filed against current and former Columbia/HCA Healthcare 
Corp. executives. More than a dozen other plaintiffs, including 
California's $120 billion pension fund, had been added to the

<HEADLINE> Couple Charged in Kids' Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A couple were accused Wednesday of  
leaving their 18-month-old son to die in the wilderness, and are 
also suspected of tossing his 2 1/2-year-old brother to his death in a 
lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother had told police in June that the children had been  
kidnapped by their father. Last week, however, the father told 
police that the couple abandoned their children in a ravine and a 
pond. 
</P>
<P>
	Bones believed be those of the 18-month-old child were  
discovered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no way the child could survive,'' St. Francis County  
Sheriff Dave Parkman said Wednesday. ``It was very cruel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Ware, 33, and Chantilly Harrell, 21, of Memphis, Tenn.,  
were charged with murder and jailed on $250,000 bail. They could 
face execution if convicted in the death of the younger boy, 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they are considering filing murder charges in  
the case of the older boy, K-Von, whose remains have not been 
found, despite a five-day search and the draining of the pond. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a motive, prosecutor Fletcher Long Jr. said: ``There's  
only conjecture at this point. They wanted rid of two children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Commercial Appeal of Memphis reported Wednesday that Ms.  
Harrell told police she left Ware in June because of abuse. She 
told police that Ware kidnapped the children after she left them 
with him for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Venita, told reporters at court on Wednesday that  
her daughter is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware told police the couple left Alexander in a ravine about 35  
miles west of Memphis on June 16, and three days later dumped K-Von 
into a pond nearby, Parkman said. The boy probably suffered from 
the heat, mosquitos and snakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to comprehend a person's state of mind that they  
could dehumanize the children,'' said Memphis police Lt. Sharon Cox 
said. ``All of us are very sad.''

<HEADLINE> 73-Year-Old Retires in the Fast Lane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ONA, W.Va. (AP) -- Retirement for 73-year-old Harvey Simon is the  
stuff kids dream of and his peers fear: bumper-to-bumper traffic at 
more than 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people my age think there's something wrong with me,''  
says Simon, who spends most summer Saturday nights racing his 
$30,000-plus late model stock car around the paved, 5/8-mile track at 
Ona Speedway near Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
	The pudgy, silver-haired man from Cambridge, Ohio, knows he's an  
attraction and doesn't hesitate to play up his age. A caricature of 
him sitting on a wheelchair burning rubber graces a side panel on 
his red race car. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups of fans in Ona's main grandstand along the front straight  
holler for him as he speeds by. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows Harvey and everybody likes him,'' says Steve  
Swann, a 21-year-old driver. ``There are a lot of people who'll 
root for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Simon is no gimmick.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be here if I ever thought I couldn't win,'' he  
says. ``I don't just want to ride around out there. That's dumb. 
I'm looking forward to winning a race before the year's out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His competitors take him seriously. Simon moved up to the late  
model division after winning last year's season points championship 
in what is known as the Charger class of the Legends series. 
</P>
<P>
	Legend cars, compact racing machines encased in 1930s-style Ford  
or Chevrolet bodies, are popular among beginning oval track racers. 
The cars cost about $13,000, and are powered by motorcycle engines 
that pull them down the straights at nearly 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how Simon got started two summers ago, shortly after  
retiring from his job as a helicopter pilot for Marietta Coal Co. 
in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first he couldn't do it very well,'' says Ronnie Herald,  
West Virginia's only Legend car dealer and one of Simon's closest 
friends. ``Once we got him on the right track, the old man was 
really a threat at any race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herald, who races late model cars as well, has been able to keep  
Simon in his rear view mirror so far this season but won't count 
him out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can handle the car ... and I think he could be competitive  
given a little more time,'' Herald says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a lot of people realize what he's done; it looks  
a lot easier than it is,'' Herald says. ``It's really difficult to 
hold on to a car with that power-to-weight ratio and be 
competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late model cars, which weigh about 2,800 pounds, produce 550  
horsepower. Drivers say they can get around a short track faster 
than a NASCAR Winston Cup car, which weighs 3,200 pounds and 
produces about 650 horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a learning year -- a step up in all respects,  
especially with the physical size of the car,'' Simon says. ``You 
can't see out of it. You don't know where your nose is until you 
hit the guy in front of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simon was perhaps better suited to adapt to stock car racing  
than most his age. Not only is he in good health, but in his 
younger days he raced an Austin-Healey in a sports car club near 
Los Angeles, where he grew up and worked his first commercial pilot 
job with Sinclair Oil. 
</P>
<P>
	As he grew older, Simon began yearning for the rush of oval  
track racing -- the roaring engines, the emphasis on raw power and 
the aggressive maneuvering that makes trading paint inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	It was almost as if he were getting younger. And since he's been  
racing at Ona, he feels younger. At his last six-month checkup his 
doctor told him he was in good shape and that his blood pressure 
has dropped to more healthy levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon spends most of his time in his RV, which he drives between  
home and the track. He stores his car at Ona, where he stays toward 
the end of the week as he gets ready for race night. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing is a money pit, swallowing about $15,000 a year in parts  
and tires, which Simon's retirement and investment income easily 
cover, he says. Simon and Herald perform most of the labor 
themselves, which is fine by Simon, who does little else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Racing means about everything to me. I don't know what I'd do  
without it. I have no clue,'' Simon says. 
</P>
<P>
	As he sips red wine and nibbles on cheese in his RV, he reflects  
on his father's death, caused by failing health within a year after 
he sold his Los Angeles-based wholesale paper business. 
</P>
<P>
	While some would say Simon is living dangerously for a man his  
age, he credits racing with sustaining him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing a person can do once they retire is do  
nothing,'' Simon says. ``I'm convinced my dad died because he 
didn't know what to do with himself.''

<HEADLINE> Police Kill Bank Suspect in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- An armed motorist wrote a suicide note,  
robbed a bank, then dared police to kill him Wednesday. Officers 
shot him to death as he waved a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified robber held up Fidelity Federal Bank in Azusa  
shortly before 3 p.m., taking an undisclosed amount of cash, then 
fled in a white sport utility vehicle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spotted the car a short time later and gave chase. The  
driver stopped the car on the freeway in this Los Angeles suburb, 
got out and pointed a handgun at his head, then waved it at police 
officers and urged them to shoot, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. 
Norine Plett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was saying, 'You have a job to do, do it,'' Plett added.  
</P>
<P>
	An Azusa police officer fired two rounds of non-lethal rubber  
bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those knocked him to his knees, but he regained his stance and  
again pointed his gun at the police,'' Plett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers then opened fire with lethal ammunition, she said.  
Officers later discovered a suicide note in his vehicle, according 
to Plett. The contents were not released.

<HEADLINE> Hindus Complain About Kubrick Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Chants used in the ``Eyes Wide Shut''  
orgy scene have been edited out of versions headed for Europe and 
South Africa because of complaints from Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick thought it was generic chanting music,  
but it turned out it features highly religious Hindu scripture, 
Warner Bros. spokeswoman Nancy Kirkpatrick said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindus complained to Warner Bros. and the studio apologized.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know. Mr. Kubrick didn't know,'' Ms. Kirkpatrick  
said. ``We have now taken the lyric part out of the film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Audiences will hear the same music, but the words will be  
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eyes Wide Shut'' opens in Europe and South Africa this month.  
Versions of the film already in France still contain the chant.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Cuba Boxers To Fight Sept. 27 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Fla. (AP) -- Four boxers from the United States squad  
that won eight medals at the Pan American Games this summer are to 
compete as part of a dual meet Sept. 27 against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-man team is led by Jose Navarro of Los Angeles, who won  
the Pan Am silver medal at 112 pounds, and 125-pound bronze 
medalist Aaron Torres of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members of the Pan Am team scheduled to face Cuba at the  
Venice Sports Center are Ron Siler at 106 pounds and Darnell Wilson 
at 156 pounds. Wilson is a three-time national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also won the team title at the World Amateur  
Boxing Championships earlier this month, but no boxers from that 
squad were named for the U.S.-Cuba meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, traditionally the world's deepest stable of boxers, has  
yet to lose in 19 dual meets against the United States. The closest 
any U.S. team has come to knocking off its island neighbors was in 
1991 when each team won six of 12 bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	When the countries last held a dual meet in 1995, the Cubans won  
all but two bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year has been a difficult one for Cuba, which pulled  
out midway through the world championships to protest what it 
called unfair treatment of its fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans were upset when meet officials upheld Russian Timour  
Gaidalov's win over Juan Hernandez in for the welterweight gold 
medal. The Cubans had claimed the Russian illegally put tape on his 
hand wraps. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing the Cuban protest, the International Amateur  
Boxing Association reversed the decision and awarded the gold medal 
to Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	That same night, Cuban heavyweight champion Felix Savon refused  
to enter the ring for his fight and the title was awarded to U.S. 
boxer Michael Bennett.

<HEADLINE> Mother Gets 21 Years For Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A woman was sentenced to 21 years in prison  
Wednesday for suffocating her 7-week-old daughter to get $200,000 
in insurance money so she could gamble on riverboats. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they were stunned that Dina Abdelhaq, an  
admitted gambling addict, did not get the maximum sentence of 35 
years. She was convicted in February of insurance fraud for 
deliberately suffocating her daughter and trying to pass off the 
cause as sudden infant death syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Her sentencing capped an emotional hearing at which Ms.  
Abdelhaq's mother twice leapt out of her seat and shouted at the 
judge and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abdelhaq, 35, tearfully admitted that she bounced checks and  
stole jewelry from her mother to get gambling money while she was 
on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	But she denied killing her daughter. She said her ex-husband had  
once asked her to get an abortion but she couldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could feel a life growing in me,'' she sobbed. ``If I  
couldn't hurt a life inside me, how could I hurt a life outside 
me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors scoffed at her claim.  
</P>
<P>
	``The horror of this crime defies description,'' prosecutor  
Ronald Safer told the court. ``I cannot paint a picture with words 
grotesque enough to describe this crime.''

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Heirs Buy NHL's Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Don't look for an immediate spending spree on  
players by the Wal-Mart heirs who purchased the St. Louis Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill and Nancy Laurie of Columbia, Mo., got a bargain price of  
$100 million for the NHL team and the 5-year-old Kiel Center. The 
deal includes $96 million of debt service on the building, meaning 
that Clark Enterprises walks away with almost nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Bill Laurie said Tuesday, he'll let the front office alone  
to do its job. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can have a lot of fun, and not have to open up the bank,  
as they say,'' Laurie said. ``You don't necessarily have to go out 
and get carried away with your bank account.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie said his goal is a Stanley Cup, but the Blues haven't  
made it past the second round of the NHL playoffs since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	That might not sit well with Laurie, a front-row fixture at  
Missouri basketball games and an avid sports fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this team is very, very close to being a Stanley Cup  
winner,'' Laurie said. ``We'll do what it takes to get us where we 
want to be. Nobody on the earth loves to win more than I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries took the Blues and the Kiel center off the hands of  
Clark Enterprises, a group of 19 prominent local businessmen who 
were tired of pumping money into the franchise. The team had been 
for sale for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries, who raise quarter horses and Appaloosas, had been  
prepared to spend a lot more money to get into sports franchise 
ownership. In March, they unsuccessfully bid $400 million for the 
NHL's Colorado Avalanche, the NBA's Denver Nuggets and their new 
home, the Pepsi Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver deal fell through when shareholders of Ascent  
Entertainment Group, which owned the sports properties, filed suit, 
claiming the sale price was as much as $150 million too low. An 
out-of-court settlement resulted in an auction. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Blues' price tag, the 20,000-seat Kiel Center alone  
cost $135 million, and the team's worth has been estimated at more 
than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But owners were saddled by debt service on the Kiel Center,  
which was privately financed. They also had to pay for ill-advised 
signings and other excesses of the expensive 2 1/2-year reign of 
former coach and general manager Mike Keenan from 1994-1996. Owners 
said they had spent nearly $70 million the past four years to cover 
shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not only washing your hands of it, but finding the right  
kind of people to do this with,'' said Jerry Ritter, Clark 
Enterprises chairman of the board. ``And it was done to avoid 
future losses that might be incurred that this group is not willing 
to withstand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale awaits approval by the NHL Board of Governors and is  
expected to be completed by the end of September. No problems are 
anticipated, since the Lauries had been tentatively approved for 
the Denver purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie wasn't ruling out pursuing an NBA franchise for the city  
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's go one thing at a time,'' he said. ``I guess if an NBA  
possibility came along, we would take a look at it. But I can 
honestly tell you today our focus is on hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale coincided with the opening of the Blues' training camp  
on Monday. Bill Laurie met with the team Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm like everybody else,'' general manager Larry Pleau said.  
``We're all excited about this and we're ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries are the second Columbia entry into the St. Louis  
sports market in recent years; Stan Kroenke is a minority owner of 
the NFL's St. Louis Rams. The Lauries and Kroenkes are in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Walton Laurie is the daughter of the late Bud Walton, who  
with his late brother Sam co-founded Wal-Mart. The Lauries own 
Crown Center Farms in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple made the largest single donation to the University of  
Missouri in its history in 1996, offering $10 million toward the 
construction of a new basketball arena. The donation was withdrawn 
a year later after the Lauries felt the university wasn't making 
enough progress toward construction.

<HEADLINE>  Russian Warplanes Bombard Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian warplanes and artillery today  
bombarded positions held by Islamic militants in two villages amid 
growing criticism of their failure to defeat the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces claimed to have knocked out two rebel mortar  
posts, five trucks and five weapons caches in Karamakhi and retaken 
parts of the village in the southern Russian republic of Dagestan, 
a spokesman with Dagestan's Interior Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Territory in the village has changed hands several times and the  
military appeared no closer to defeating the militants, who took 
over there and in the village of Chabanmakhi a year ago and imposed 
a strict version of Islamic law. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was little change in the western Dagestani  
region of Novolakskoye, where Russian troops were fighting separate 
Islamic militants who invaded from Chechnya over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite heavy fire from helicopters, tanks and artillery, the  
rebels were fortifying positions and establishing protected supply 
lies to ferry ammunition and reinforcements, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's NTV television channel said government forces occupied  
most high ground in the mountainous region, and showed rows of 
tanks and artillery shelling hamlets where the militants were 
believed to be located. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military has failed to defeat militants in the  
region since fighting began in August, drawing criticism Tuesday 
from President Boris Yeltsin that the army was mishandling the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin demanded ``quick and tough action'' against the rebels,  
saying Russia hadn't defeated them so far because of ``military 
sloppiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said repeatedly that it doesn't want to  
repeat the mistakes made in the disastrous 1994-96 war with 
Chechnya, where Russian forces launched an all-out military assault 
that resulted in heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants were able to march straight into the town of  
Novolakskoye from Chechnya on Sunday, apparently without any 
opposition. Russian military officials had said the frontier was 
tightly protected after government forces drove out militants in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Dagestanis also expressed impatience with the military's  
apparent inability to defeat the militants. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is Karamakhi? It's a small plot, the size of a five  
kopeck coin, in a dale,'' said retired Gen. Salikh Khaliloiv, 
chairman of Dagestan's Council of Veterans, referring to the 
fighting in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yet for two weeks now a huge army grouping has been unable to  
suppress separate gun emplacements and to restore constitutional 
order in the region,'' Khaliloiv said.

	14 Dead in Moscow Explosion  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A massive explosion shattered a nine-story  
apartment building in Moscow early Thursday, destroying scores of 
apartments and leaving at least 14 people dead and dozens more 
trapped in the rubble. Thirty-seven people were injured in the 
blast, Minister of Emergency Situations Sergei Shoig said. First 
indications suggested the blast was caused by a natural gas leak, 
but security officials said they could not rule out the possibility 
of a bomb attack. There was a strong smell of gas at the scene 
after the explosion. The Interfax News Agency said up to 300 people 
were feared trapped in the rubble, but the Ministry of Emergency 
Situations put the number of residents trapped at 147.

	Study: Alternative Schools Gain  
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- About one in four U.S. children are going to  
alternative and private schools as choices other than neighborhood 
public schools are increasing across the country, a new study 
found. The percentage attending private school has remained at 10 
percent for years. But with newer options of charter schools, 
magnet schools, open enrollment and voucher programs, the 
alternatives -- including private schools -- account for a full 25 
percent of U.S. students. Researchers said they did not find a 
great deal of evidence that the alternatives improve student 
achievement, according to the study released today by the Policy 
Analysis for California Education.

	U.N. Delays Exit From East Timor

<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- The United Nations heeded the pleas of  
East Timorese refugees Wednesday and delayed the evacuation of its 
mission to the Indonesian province, fearing the withdrawal could 
end in mass bloodshed. As the refugees streamed out of the 
embattled territory to escape rampaging militias, witnesses charged 
that soldiers were looting throughout Dili. Rumors of mass 
slaughters swept through refugee camps. More than 2,000 people have 
crowded into the U.N. compound in Dili. Many said pro-Indonesian 
militias would kill them if the U.N. workers left.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Republican Sen. John Danforth agreed  
today to oversee an independent review of the 1993 federal standoff 
with the Branch Davidians, government officials said. Attorney 
General Janet Reno was to announce the appointment tomorrow. Reno's 
decision on Danforth came as the top Republican in the Senate, 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, said he now has doubts about who 
started the fire that ended the fatal siege in Waco, Texas, and 
believes it is time for Reno to step down.

	Greek Sites Examined After Quake

<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Archaeologists began an examination of  
ancient sites and priceless antiquities Wednesday after a powerful 
quake dislodged pieces from the Parthenon and broke pottery at the 
national museum. The death toll from Tuesday's earthquake in Athens 
rose to 64. At least two of the 2,500-year-old monuments atop the 
Acropolis sustained minor damage. Culture Minister Elisavet Papazoi 
ordered the National Archaeological Museum closed for three days, 
although the extent of the damage caused by quake was not made 
public. The museum holds one of the world's most remarkable 
collections of ancient pottery.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court will begin its 1999-2000  
term next month with the most minority law clerks in recent memory, 
but they were chosen before civil rights groups and some members of 
Congress criticized the justices' hiring practices. Among the new 
class of 35 law clerks are five minority clerks. Last year's class 
included one. USA Today reported in March 1998 that blacks 
comprised less than 2 percent of the law clerks hired by the courts 
current justices during their tenures, and that less than 25 
percent of their law clerks had been women.

trading. In currency dealings, the dollar moved sharply lower after 
the Economic Planning Agency said Japan's real gross domestic 
product grew 0.2 percent in the April-June quarter from the prior 
quarter, or an annual pace of expansion of 0.9 percent. In New York 
on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 2.21 points

beat the San Francisco Giants 7-5 today for their 18th win in 27 
games. The Mets, who began the day 3 1/2 games behind Atlanta in the 
NL East and 3 1/2 ahead of Cincinnati for the wild card, go on the 
road for 13 of their next 16 games. The Giants, who started the day 
6 1/2 games behind Arizona, had won six consecutive series before 
losing two of three at Shea Stadium.

<HEADLINE> New Buddha Chief Thinks Job Is Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Alex Miller, head of the recently revived Buddha  
Records, views his new gig as a five-day extension of his weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like sitting around playing with your record collection --  
except it's one of the oldest collections in the world, and it 
holds a million-plus recordings,'' Miller, head of the new reissue 
label, says cheerfully from his new Manhattan office. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a lot to dabble with.''  
</P>
<P>
	Like what? Try everything released in this century by labels  
like RCA, Arista, (the misspelled) old Buddah and Kama Sutra. Try 
an assortment of rumored but rarely heard live performances by 
artists from Frank Sinatra to Fats Waller. Try everything from 
classical to classic rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Already out: albums by Waylon Jennings, Captain Beefheart and  
his Magic Band, the Flamin' Groovies, Daryl Hall, Harry Nilsson 
(produced by John Lennon), Glenn Miller and Duke Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
	By the year 2000, Buddha will have 60 CDs in the market. One of  
them will be a time capsule disc, released this November, that will 
mingle music with dozens of sound bites dating back to 1908. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my first questions was, `Is there any genre that I  
can't be involved in?''' the 41-year-old Miller recalls. ``And the 
answer was no. Country? Yeah. Jazz? Yeah. Pop? Rock 'n' roll? 
Yeah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's quite a change for Miller, who was hired away earlier  
this year from his job at Sony Classical (where he helped the 
``Titanic'' soundtrack peddle more than 10 million copies). His new 
boss is BMG, which has control over an assortment of labels. 
</P>
<P>
	The job has turned Miller and his four-person staff into musical  
archeologists, poring through the vaults of various labels in 
search of something special. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, they studied catalogues and studio sheets, and  
eventually wound up digging through boxes and carefully handling 
ancient acetates. 
</P>
<P>
	``An old jazz guy once told me, `I was too busy making a living  
to know I was making history,''' Miller relates. ``That's kind of 
the situation we found ourselves in. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were too busy making music for here and now in 1935 to  
think that this Benny Goodman record was so special that 64 years 
later, its release would make history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fruits of those searches include Sinatra as you've never  
heard him before, singing with the Tommy Dorsey band before a live 
audience, and Waller rocking the house in a 1938 radio broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two albums are part of Buddha's ``Stop Time'' series, a  
collection of rare and historic records unearthed by Miller &AMP; Co. 
Glenn Miller and Louis Prima rarities were also in the first wave 
of these releases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how many times we've asked scholars,  
archivists, people in the studio, `Have we heard this before?''' 
says Miller, who was stunned at how often the answer was, ``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To find a new Benny Goodman, a Duke Ellington, early Sinatra  
... what a treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The originals were closer to tragedy than treasure: ancient  
16-inch vinyl records, 15 minutes of music on each side. If 
discovered a decade ago, Miller says, they would have been historic 
but flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology changed all that.  
</P>
<P>
	Engineers were able to keep the music while losing the snaps,  
the crackles, the pops. It was time consuming: Sinatra and the 
Dorsey Band were rescued by a five-day-a-week, 2 1/2-month process to 
save the music while losing everything else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some sleepless nights,'' Miller confessed. But the final  
results were impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	The label will feature two other categories: ``Original  
Masters,'' a series of re-releases (often with bonus tracks), and 
``Compilations,'' collections of like-themed tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of typical ``Original Masters'' releases: Daryl Hall's  
collaboration with guitarist Robert Fripp, 1977's ``Sacred Songs,'' 
and Nilsson's 1974 collaboration with Lennon, ``Pussy Cats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latter, rather infamously, was recorded during Lennon's  
separation from Yoko Ono -- his alcohol-fueled ``lost weekend'' in 
Los Angeles. Who drummer Keith Moon and frequent Rolling Stones 
collaborator Bobby Keys joined in the fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Both new versions come complete with special bonus tracks.  
Fripp, contacted by Miller, agreed to do new liner notes for the 
Hall album. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compilations'' kicked off with several volumes of ``Big 12  
Inches,'' remixes of classic songs from the 1970s, '80s and '90s. 
The first three releases included a cross-section of dance hits, 
from Black Box's ``Everybody, Everybody'' to Vicki Sue Robinson's 
``Turn the Beat Around'' to the Andrea True Connection's ``More, 
More, More.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buddha's first incarnation dates back to the mid-1960s, when the  
label released more than 700 singles and hundreds of albums by The 
Lovin' Spoonful, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Melba Moore and The 
Trammps, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Why resurrect the old name? First, it's an opportunity to spell  
B-U-D-D-H-A the right way. Second, it fits a label that's 
reincarnating music, Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
	He adds that the label's first batch of releases reflected his  
musical tastes more than any marketing program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did what any music fan would do -- we picked our favorite  
records,'' he said with a laugh. ``We're approaching this from a 
music lover's perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A music lover with a very, very large record collection.

<HEADLINE> Skip Holtz Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina offensive coordinator Skip  
Holtz was released from the hospital today following treatment for 
a severe abdominal infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old son of Gamecocks coach Lou Holtz responded to  
several days of intravenous antibiotics, school spokesman Kerry 
Tharp said. It was not clear if Skip Holtz would be at practice 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Holtz said his son developed a fever a week ago and went to  
the doctor Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in great pain Saturday, but he hid it,'' the head coach  
said. ``He's been my son for 30-some years and this is the first 
time I can ever remember him going to a doctor -- ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Holtzes were at North Carolina State on Saturday for the  
Gamecocks' 10-0 loss. On Sunday, Skip complained of abdominal pain 
and went to Lexington Medical Center. He went to the emergency room 
Monday for more tests and antibiotic treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Holtz has missed the past two practices and his father took  
a more active role with the offense. He spent about 30 minutes with 
the offensive linemen after practice. Lou Holtz briefly lined a few 
of them up in three-point stances, but mostly sat on the practice 
field talking to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Skip's hospital time, his father wasn't ready to give up  
on his son making South Carolina's opening Southeastern Conference 
game at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Holtz said there was still time to see if Skip felt well  
enough to travel, ``but I'm counting on him being there.''

<HEADLINE> McCain's Goal Simple: Winning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sen. John McCain describes his strategy as a  
very simple one -- overtaking Gov. George Bush for the Republican 
presidential nomination on the strength of ``the bounce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least it sounds simple.  
</P>
<P>
	Doing it won't be. To gain that kind of boost in the New  
Hampshire and North Carolina primaries next winter, McCain, or any 
other rival, would have to win or come close to it against Bush, 
who holds runaway leads in the public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a crowded field behind him, and McCain would have to  
emerge from it to become the ranking challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	And should McCain ``do well,'' as he puts it, in those opening  
primaries, the compressed calendar would give him little time to 
parlay that into an advantage -- and a fund-raising bonus -- to take 
into the costly big state contests that are likely to anoint a 
nominee on or soon after March 7, when California, New York and 13 
other states hold their primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, that discounts Iowa, where the caucuses open the voting  
season, where McCain will not be competitive and probably won't 
try, and where, he acknowledges, there's also a bounce to be had by 
somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, McCain says he's gaining traction in the 9-candidate  
field, moving from single digits into the mid-teens in polls in 
those first primary states, raising enough money to organize and 
get his message across. He pronounces himself satisfied with his 
campaign adventure so far. 
</P>
<P>
	There is time, and front-runners have faltered before. ``I'm  
convinced that the examination of the candidates hasn't begun,'' 
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's raising what he needs to run the campaign he  
envisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money is coming in -- okay,'' he said, the pause pointing to  
the unprecedented advantage Bush has in that competition, too. The 
Arizona senator is faring second best in the quest for Republican 
campaign donations, but Bush is outraising him 5 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also the problem of defining his message as an  
alternative to Bush, whom he rarely criticizes, although he edged 
toward it in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said Bush, who has raised at least $50 million, and Steve  
Forbes, running largely on his own fortune, have put presidential 
campaign spending limits at risk by opting out of the ceilings that 
go with federal matching funds, which they aren't taking. 
</P>
<P>
	They're the only ones who can afford it; McCain and the rest of  
the Republicans are taking the federal money and the primary state 
spending restraints, as are the Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that you are seeing a precedent that will basically  
emasculate the law,'' McCain said, suggesting that it may have to 
be changed after 2000. He said the law was designed to curb 
spending in presidential campaigns by using matching funds as an 
incentive to accept limits, but ``that now is going to be a thing 
of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was disappointed but didn't blame Bush, given Forbes'  
demonstrated ability to use unfettered spending on TV ads to 
undercut a leader, as he did with Bob Dole in 1996. ``I'm just 
sorry that it's happening.'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for message, McCain's theme so far is that he is the  
straight-talk Republican, candid even when it is impolitic. He was 
a Vietnam pilot, a heroic prisoner of war, a story recounted in his 
new book, ``Faith of Our Fathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain can and does talk around trouble spots.  
</P>
<P>
	Abortion is one. He said at one point that while he is opposed  
to it, he favors steps to reduce and try to end abortion in America 
before acting to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made 
it legal. But reversal is gospel to the anti-abortion right, and 
Republican platforms advocate a constitutional amendment to that 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said his 17-year record of anti-abortion votes in  
Congress are what really matters, not campaign statements on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican tax cut is another. McCain wouldn't say he would  
veto it, as President Clinton will. But he said he wouldn't have 
let the Republicans pass it because it gives tax breaks to special 
interests first, while average taxpayers will have to wait past 
2000. And he called it an insult to the intelligence of the 
American people. 
</P>
<P>
	But he voted for the bill when it passed the Senate, 50 to 49.  
He said he figured it could be a starting point for negotiations on 
a better bill. ``I did not want to be the 50th vote that would 
cause it to fail,'' McCain said.

<HEADLINE> Kent State Protesters Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENT, Ohio (AP) -- Memorials were dedicated Wednesday in a Kent  
State University parking lot where four Vietnam War protesters were 
killed by National Guardsmen in 1970, an event that infuriated 
members of the antiwar movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This milestone commemoration will be and should be cause for  
people around the world to inquire, to learn, to reflect, to wonder 
why the world is still plagued by hate, intolerance and violence,'' 
university President Carol A. Cartwright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students last year asked the school to permanently mark the  
spaces at the dormitory parking lot where Allison Krause, Jeffrey 
Miller, Sandra Scheuer and William Schroeder were shot and killed 
on May 4, 1970. Nine others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy,'' said Doris Krause, whose daughter Allison was  
among those killed. 
</P>
<P>
	She pointed to the hill hundreds of feet away where the  
Guardsmen fired on the students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think she was a threat to them? I don't think so. ...  
People always say the kids rioted. I think the National Guard 
rioted,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For 29 years, the spots where the students fell continued to be  
used for parking. Now they are marked off with granite borders, 
each space surrounded by waist-high lamp posts. Each has a corner 
triangle with the name of a slain student and the date of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The lamps will shine at night, except for the night of each May  
3, when an annual overnight candlelight vigil is held. Cars can 
continue to park on the rest of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings happened two days after the Guard was sent to Kent  
State following student protests and the burning of the campus Army 
ROTC building. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guardsmen first used tear gas to disperse taunting,  
rock-throwing students. About midday, Guardsmen fired at least 61 
shots in a 13-second burst. One of the four killed, Miss Scheuer, 
was walking to a class. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gov. James A. Rhodes, the state and guardsmen in 1978  
settled a lawsuit filed by wounded students and the parents of the 
dead. The state agreed to pay $675,000 and several Guardsmen 
expressed their regret. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reminders of the shootings on campus include a sculpture  
marked by Guard gunfire. A granite plaza stands as a memorial, 
while 51,175 daffodils have been planted in honor of the nation's 
Vietnam War dead.

<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Chris Albright scored less than two  
minutes into his international debut Wednesday night as the United 
States tied Jamaica 2-2 in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came in here and played a very tough opponent, so we're  
obviously happy with the effort of our team today,'' U.S. coach 
Bruce Arena said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaican sub David Johnson capitalized on a defensive error in  
the 79th minute and scored for a 2-1 lead. Less than a minute 
later, Ante Razov was ejected for protesting a vicious Jamaican 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing a man short, the Americans (7-3-2 this year)  
tied it in the 80th when Albright connected on a loose ball after 
Ben Olsen was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. forward Jason Kreis opened the scoring in the fifth minute  
when Ian Goodison's clearing attempt deflected off referee Godfrey 
Bowen and right to the foot of Kreis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Burn star spun and put a right-footed shot into the  
left corner from eight yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica, 0-5-4 against the United States, tied it at 1 in the  
14th minute after Eddie Pope had fouled Ricardo Fuller inside the 
penalty area and Fabian Davis beat goalkeeper Zach Thornton with a 
penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica is unbeaten in 41 home games since losing to the United  
States 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Detroit Teachers To Go Back to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit's striking teachers voted overwhelmingly  
Wednesday to return to work in the morning, ending an extended 
summer vacation for 180,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers approved an extension of their old contract while  
they hold a ratification vote by mail on the new agreement reached 
Monday between the school district and the 11,500-member teachers 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	The students have missed six days of school.  
</P>
<P>
	The teachers went on strike Aug. 30, one day before classes were  
to begin, in a walkout that thwarted one of the nation's most 
ambitious attempts to overhaul a troubled urban school district. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the teachers objected to the school board's  
proposals for merit pay and a longer school day. Ultimately, the 
school board dropped both reform proposals, for the time being at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of teachers debated for about 90 minutes at the Cobo  
Center on Wednesday before ending the strike on a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contract is not to my liking, but when do you go to the  
negotiating table and get everything you want?'' elementary school 
teacher Abdulhaleem Ibnjames said. ``We can still turn down the 
contract, but we still need to go to class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Adamany, the district's chief executive, welcomed the  
teachers back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the return to schools will allow Detroit  
public schools to maintain the momentum that was developed for 
improvements in the school system,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in the nation's 10th-largest city have been beset by  
mismanagement and chronically low test scores, attendance and 
graduation rates, prompting the Legislature earlier this year to 
remove the elected school board and replace it with a board 
appointed by Mayor Dennis Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union argued that giving merit pay to teachers in schools  
whose test scores improved would be unfair to good teachers in poor 
schools. Adamany, however, insisted that merit pay still could be 
imposed without union approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The district also dropped its proposal to lengthen the school  
day from 6 hours to 8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the teachers pushed for and partially got another  
reform: smaller clases, but only in kindergarten through third 
grade. The tentative agreement would also impose more restrictions 
on unexcused absences among teachers, a board priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract would give all teachers a 2 percent raise each year  
for the next three years. Teachers with more seniority and 
education would receive higher raises to keep up with wages in 
suburban districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers walked out in defiance of a 1994 Michigan law that  
bars them from striking and fines them one day's pay for each day 
they are out. Legislative leaders have said they may move to seek 
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Free From Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The nation's largest hospital company is  
free from a lawsuit filed on behalf of New York's $90 billion 
pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed the shareholders' lawsuit  
filed against current and former Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Vice President Vic Campbell said in an internal memo the  
decision ``moves the process of resolving these issues ... and is 
very positive for the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen other plaintiffs, including California's $120  
billion pension fund, had been added to the August 1997 lawsuit 
alleging that mismanagement by Columbia executives devalued their 
stock holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, U.S. District Judge Thomas Higgins ordered all  
the shareholder lawsuits consolidated into one. Twelve were filed 
by retirement funds that managed more than $380 billion and owned 
about 15.3 million Columbia shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a magistrate judge recommended dismissing the  
consolidated lawsuit because plaintiffs had made no demands on the 
corporation before filing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins agreed Tuesday, saying ``there was an unseemly rush to  
the courthouse to litigate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Comptroller H. Carl McCall will decide later whether to  
appeal, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashville-based company has been the target of a federal  
billing fraud investigation for more than two years.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Still Opposes Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton reaffirmed her  
opposition to clemency for 12 jailed Puerto Rican nationalists 
Wednesday but said she hopes they will stick to a key condition to 
renounce future violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand by my statement of Saturday,'' Mrs. Clinton said after  
a ``listening tour'' stop at a Long Island high school. ``Of 
course, since we are moving forward I would hope that it proceeds 
smoothly and that the prisoners, when they're released, abide by 
the terms of the clemency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Mrs. Clinton said she objected to the clemency  
because the prisoners had not responded to the offer quickly 
enough. ``It's been three weeks and their silence speaks volumes. I 
believe the offer of clemency should be withdrawn,'' she said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve jailed Puerto Rican nationalists accepted the clemency  
deal offered by President Clinton on Tuesday. One prisoner rejected 
the offer, and three nationalists -- two not in jail but who still 
have outstanding fines -- have until Friday to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 16 were members of the pro-independence guerrilla  
group FALN, which carried out more than 130 bombings in the United 
States in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups had sought the clemency, contending the  
sentences were too severe. But critics saw it as an attempt by 
Clinton to bolster his wife's political prospects in the Hispanic 
community, and her surprise announcement of opposition infuriated 
several Puerto Rican political leaders, among them Rep. Jose 
Serrano, D-N.Y., who said he could no longer support her. 
</P>
<P>
	Two New York Republicans, Reps. Benjamin Gilman and Vito  
Fossella, introduced a resolution in the House Wednesday denouncing 
the deal. Gilman, chairman of the International Relations 
Committee, said the clemency offer sent the message that the United 
States is soft on terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders planned a House debate Thursday on the non-binding  
measure. And at least three congressional panels are expected to 
examine the clemency offer in hearings as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, the likely Democratic candidate for retiring Sen.  
Daniel Patrick Moynihan's U.S. Senate seat, tried on Wednesday to 
patch up the rift, during a visit to Bay Shore High School on Long 
Island, where she was greeted warmly by the school's 1,400 
returning students. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand by that statement, yet I understand the depth of  
feeling in the Puerto Rican community, and I look forward to 
working with them on other issues that we can make a difference 
on,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton did not reply directly to a reporter's question  
whether a mixup in White House signals had allowed her to formally 
condemn the deal on Saturday, even as the prisoners themselves were 
apparently considering whether to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had not been advised in advance they would do so,  
and Howard Wolfson, her press secretary, said there was no 
indication that even the White House knew on Saturday that an 
agreement was close. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson said Mrs. Clinton also did not know the White House sent  
a letter on Friday to the FALN convicts' lawyers setting a 
seven-day deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton insisted Wednesday that she was never in the loop  
on the FALN issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a decision that had to go through channels, a  
decision that had to be made by the highest levels of 
recommendations to the president and ultimately by the president,'' 
she said. ``It is not surprising to me that I was not lobbied, or 
informed or asked about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton sought to emphasize that she does not and will not  
always toe the expected political line, saying there were times 
that she would disagree with her husband and other policy-makers. 
``I will express that disagreement,'' she said. ``That is what I 
intend to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has not formally declared her candidacy but she and  
her husband have made an offer on a $1.7 million Dutch colonial 
house in Chappaqua, a suburb north of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had a home of our own for nearly 20 years,'' she  
said. ``We have a lot of boxes. We can't imagine what's in some of 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar plunged against the yen early Thursday  
after the Japanese government released surprisingly strong economic 
growth data that sent Tokyo stocks sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.62 yen, down 1.60 yen from late Wednesday  
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 111.08 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 159.76 points,  
or 0.91 percent, to 17,801.14 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Wednesday, the average closed down 66.12 points, or 0.37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved sharply lower after the  
Economic Planning Agency said Japan's real gross domestic product 
grew 0.2 percent in the April-June quarter from the prior quarter, 
or an annual pace of expansion of 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The data exceeded the expectations of economists in Tokyo, who  
had forecast on average a small quarter-on-quarter contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the release of the GDP data, market participants'  
attention was fixed on whether or not the Bank of Japan would buy 
dollars to stem the yen's appreciation against the greenback, 
traders said 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 116.14 yen, down  
from 118.24 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices rebounded sharply in a favorable  
reaction to the GDP figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreign investors will likely buy Japanese stocks actively  
amid expectations for economic recovery,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, 
general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 2.21 points to close at 11,036.34. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 12.39 points, or 0.82 percent, to 1,514.96. 
The TOPIX closed down 2.05 points, or 0.14 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8300  
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8100 percent. Its price fell 
0.17 point to 100.59.

<HEADLINE> Canada Union Selects Ford As Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers has chosen Ford Motor  
Co. as the union's target company in negotiations for a new 
three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	CAW president Buzz Hargrove said Wednesday the union had a  
``clear field'' at Ford because the United Auto Workers was not 
going to choose that company to lead off its U.S. negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said he had spoken with UAW President Stephen Yokich on  
Wednesday morning, and that Yokich told him the UAW was still 
trying to decide whether General Motors Corp. or DaimlerChrysler AG 
would be the lead company. Hargrove said Yokich would make a 
decision in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to worry about getting the attention of the top  
people at Ford,'' Hargrove said. ``We don't have to worry about a 
strike in the U.S. taking away our bargaining power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don McKenzie, vice president of human resources for Ford of  
Canada, said the company is glad to be selected to bargain first 
with the CAW so that other companies don't set the pattern for its 
Canadian contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions concentrate on talks with one company until an  
agreement is reached. That contract then sets the pattern for deals 
with the other two companies. The CAW traditionally chooses a 
different company than the UAW so that each can have an automaker's 
undivided attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW's three-year contracts covering 50,000 workers expire  
Sept. 21. The former Chrysler Corp. led the negotiations in 1993 
and 1996. The company was acquired last year by Daimler-Benz AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said negotiators would focus on wages, job security,  
pensions, and unionizing parts suppliers. He noted that all three 
companies were enjoying profitable years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members are entitled to share in the incredible wealth we  
helped produce with the auto companies,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove also said Ford's plans to spin off its Visteon parts  
unit did not affect the CAW because there are no Visteon plants in 
Canada covered by the union's contract. Visteon has a Canadian 
plant represented by another union. 
</P>
<P>
	Visteon has become a sore point between Ford and UAW leaders  
concerned that a separate company would pay less and hire fewer 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove did say there were several points of dispute between  
his union and GM, including outsourcing. The CAW struck GM's 
Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant during 1996 contract talks, idling 
some U.S. parts and assembly plants.

<HEADLINE> Ali's Daughter Is Ready to Rumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERONA, N.Y. (AP) -- Muhammad Ali's youngest daughter, who  
earlier this year told her famous father that she wanted to follow 
in his footsteps, is finally ready to step into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Laila Ali will make her professional debut Oct. 8 at Turning  
Stone Casino on a card featuring Donovan ``Razor'' Ruddock. The 
opponent in the four-round bout for the 5-foot-10, 160-pound Laila 
Ali has not been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Laila Ali, 21, who operates a nail salon and also models, has  
the best of instructors. NormaLynn Cutler, Laila's publicist, said 
Laila has been getting tips from her father. 
</P>
<P>
	``She won't tell anyone, including me, what they are,'' Cutler  
said. ``She says, 'When I have the greatest boxer of all time as my 
mentor, why would I want to share the secrets he's given me?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's Disease, had told his  
daughter he didn't want her to get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Laila never saw her 57-year-old father box in person, and she  
had few memories of living with him. But by boxing, she believes he 
will gain a greater appreciation for her as his child. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's naturally going to see himself in me,'' Laila said. ``But  
for the first time, I think he actually can see that 'this is my 
child.' ''

<HEADLINE> Heating Bills Expected To Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After several years of modest costs, heating  
bills are expected to take a jump this winter because of higher oil 
and natural gas prices and increased demand, the Energy Department 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers got used to unusually low heating costs during the  
last two winters because of depressed oil prices and mild weather. 
</P>
<P>
	This year is expected to be different, government energy experts  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Residential heating oil prices, like all petroleum product  
prices, are expected to increase by a hefty amount this winter,'' 
the Energy Information Administration said in its latest short-term 
energy outlook report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Residential heating oil on average could be 30 percent higher  
than last winter and residential natural gas prices about 17 
percent higher, the agency projected. 
</P>
<P>
	EIA economist David Costello said the higher prices stem mostly  
from the fact that crude oil prices have increased $7 to $8 a 
barrel since last winter -- up to about $19 in August -- and are 
expected to rise above $20 a barrel throughout the upcoming winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas prices at the producer level, also have increased  
and likely will be about 43 percent higher at the wellhead this 
winter, although they may ease a bit in the second half of the 
winter as supplies increase, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only are we projecting higher crude oil prices this  
winter, but we are also assuming `normal' weather, which would be 
colder than the relatively mild weather of last winter,'' said the 
EIA report. This is expected to create more demand for heating oil 
and natural gas and push up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was one of the cheapest winters ... for heating oil  
that's been around for a while,'' said Costello. ``After last year 
there was a pretty good bet that prices were going to go higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concern about the Y2K computer glitch also may push up heating  
prices as customers -- residential and industrial -- may try to stock 
up to avoid possible shortages in case of a computer problem in the 
supply system, energy analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter, retail residential heating oil prices averaged 80  
cents a gallon. The EIA projected the average for the upcoming 
winter -- October through March -- at $1.04 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail residential natural gas prices averaged $6.09 per  
thousand cubic feet last winter and are expected to rise more than 
$1 to $7.10 per thousand cubic feet, the EIA report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil prices were at a depressed $10.86 a barrel as last  
winter began. Since then, the prices have increased to an average 
of $19.13 a barrel in August and are projected to reach $21 a 
barrel by the first quarter of next year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend toward higher natural gas prices has been attributed  
to a combination of factors including higher demand this past 
summer that led to lower stockpiles, and lower than expected 
production, especially in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies of natural gas are expected pick up later this year  
prompting an easing of wellhead, or producer, prices in the first 
quarter of 2000, the EIA report said.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Man Too Smart To Be a Cop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by a  
man who was deemed too smart to be a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Peter C. Dorsey said the New London Police  
Department's rejection of Robert Jordan because he scored too high 
on an intelligence test did not violate his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's rationale for the long-standing practice is that  
candidates who score too high could soon get bored with police work 
and quit after undergoing costly academy training. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ruling released Tuesday, the judge said there is no  
evidence that a high score is in any way related to job 
satisfaction, performance or turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said: ``The question is not whether a rational basis has  
been shown for the policy chosen by defendants. Plaintiff may have 
been disqualified unwisely, but he was not denied equal 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, 48, has a bachelor's degree in literature and is now a  
state corrections officer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he scored a 33, the equivalent of an IQ of 125. The  
average score nationally for police officers, as well as office 
workers, bank tellers and salespeople, is 21 to 22, the equivalent 
of an IQ of 104. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in New London, population 27,000, interviewed only those  
candidates who scored 20 to 27. 
</P>
<P>
	City manager Richard Brown said the hiring process will remain  
the same. ``There has been nothing to come across my desk that 
would cause me to make a change,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Prudential To Pay New York $1.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Prudential Insurance Co. of America Inc. has  
agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle charges of poor record-keeping 
brought by New York regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	New York found that the nation's largest life insurer did not  
respond to consumer complaints within 15 days and that its 
complaint files did not allow regulators to reconstruct disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York charges are not related to a nationwide scandal  
over Prudential's admittedly deceptive life insurance sales 
practices that led to more than $2.6 billion in settlements with 
consumers and states. 
</P>
<P>
	New York and Newark-based Prudential made the settlement Aug.  
25, but it was disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe any customers were directly affected by any  
of the deficiencies cited,'' Prudential spokesman Bob DeFillippo 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the New York issues have been addressed or will be  
shortly, DeFillippo said. He said the company would not contest the 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York fine came almost two months after the National  
Association of Securities Dealers fined a Prudential subsidiary $20 
million for violating federal securities laws in connection with 
the sales of more than 200,000 life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD Regulation, the regulatory arm of the organization that  
governs the Nasdaq stock market, fined Pruco Securities Corporation 
Inc. for the sales of more than 200,000 variable life insurance 
policies from 1983 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD has jurisdiction because the variable policies, unlike  
conventional life insurance, are invested in securities and are 
considered investment risks for customers.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Pol At Center of Bush Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Three decades ago, Ben Barnes was one of  
the men to see at the Texas Capitol if you wanted something done. 
Today, he is at the heart of a controversy over whether George W. 
Bush got special favors to win a place in the National Guard at the 
height of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes was elected to the 150-member Texas House at age 22. At  
26, he was its speaker. In 1969, at age 30, he presided over the 
Texas Senate as lieutenant governor -- a powerful job in a state 
that sharply limits its governor's authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a very early age, he was intimately involved in the  
ruling class of the Texas Legislature, in every conceivable 
position there was,'' said Chuck McDonald, an Austin political 
consultant who worked for former Gov. Ann Richards. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the guy who knew all the people and knew how the game  
was played,'' recalled Jon Ford, who covered Barnes as a San 
Antonio Express-News reporter and later served as press secretary 
to Gov. Bill Clements. 
</P>
<P>
	Published reports have said Barnes, a Democrat, helped Bush get  
a place in the Texas Air National Guard at the request of Bush's 
father, who was then a congressman. Barnes has denied the reports, 
and Bush has said repeatedly that he did not receive preferential 
treatment. Had his unit been called for Vietnam duty, he says, he 
would have gone to war. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's commanding officer, retired Brig. Gen. Walter B. ``Buck''  
Staudt, also has denied that any influence was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Wednesday how well Bush knows Barnes, spokesman Scott  
McClellan said, ``He recalls a brief exchange in the 1980s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News, in a copyright story published  
Wednesday, said Barnes has told two friends that a Houston oilman 
asked him to help Bush gain a Guard slot. The friends, speaking on 
the condition of anonymity, told the paper that Barnes said the 
request came from Sidney A. Adger, a longtime Bush family 
acquaintance, who died in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in New Hampshire, Bush said that if such contact  
occurred, it was without his knowledge or consent. Why doesn't 
anyone believe Staudt, Bush replied to a question on the issue. 
``They're were no special privileges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign spokesman, Scott McClellan, said, ``Governor Bush  
wanted to be a pilot. There were slots open. He applied, met all 
the requirements and was accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes didn't return calls to his home or office Wednesday. In  
an Associated Press interview six weeks ago, he said, ``I never 
spoke to Congressman Bush about his son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of his career, Barnes has soared to astonishing  
heights and plunged to profound depths. 
</P>
<P>
	At a 1970 fund-raising dinner, former President Lyndon Johnson  
likened Barnes' public service to that of Thomas Jefferson, Andrew 
Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and John F. 
Kennedy. ``I genuinely believe Ben Barnes has what it takes to go 
as far as his vision will carry him,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But two years later, it was over.  
</P>
<P>
	His bid for governor was derailed by a banking scandal, although  
Barnes never was charged with a crime. Dozens of elected officials 
were defeated amid allegations of passing favorable banking 
legislation for quick stock profits, but only one was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1989 interview, Barnes contended he was a political target  
of the Nixon administration. He had been state co-chairman for 
Hubert Humphrey's 1968 presidential campaign when the Democrat 
carried Texas over Republican Nixon. Barnes said he also was seen 
as a threat to then-Sen. John Tower, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	After politics, Barnes turned to business. He became a real  
estate developer and teamed with John Connally, a former governor. 
But their multimillion-dollar partnership ultimately was crushed in 
Texas' mid-1980s crash in real estate values, oil prices and bank 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	He lobbied for Texas TGV, a group that hoped to build a  
French-built, high-speed train linking Dallas, Houston and San 
Antonio. The project never materialized.	   For several years, Barnes was a consultant and lobbyist for 
GTECH. In 1997, the lottery company agreed to pay Barnes and an 
associate some $23 million in a contract termination deal that came 
amid controversy over GTECH's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes has asked a federal judge to prohibit questioning of  
Barnes in a wrongful termination lawsuit filed in Dallas against 
GTECH by Lawrence Littwin, a former state lottery director. A 
deposition had been scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Littwin's lawyers have suggested in court records that GTECH  
kept its state contract in exchange for Barnes' silence on the 
Guard question. GTECH and Bush's office have denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a motion filed Wednesday seeking to halt the deposition,  
Barnes' lawyer Charles Burton called the Littwin allegation a 
``fantastic theoretical chain of events.''

<HEADLINE> Heinz Reports 8.3 Percent Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- H.J. Heinz Co. today reported an 8.3 percent  
increase in profits for the first quarter on increased sales of 
ketchup, sauces, soups, beans and pasta meals. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz said that excluding one-time charges, it earned $236.9  
million, or 65 cents a share, in the quarter ended July 28, 
compared to $223.3 million, or 60 cents a share, in the same period 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met expecations of analysts surveyed by FirstCall.  
</P>
<P>
	The one-time charges included $21.1 million in restructuring  
costs and $20 million set aside for losses in its Ecuadorean tuna 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Including those items, Heinz had net income of $206.7 million,  
or 57 cents per share, compared to $213.8 million, or 58 cents per 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell about 2 percent, from $2.22 billion to $2.18 billion  
due to divestitures, lower prices and unfavorable foreign exchange 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz said sales of ketchup, sauces and condiments jumped 12.7  
percent in the first quarter compared to the same quarter a year 
ago. Sales of soups, beans and pasta meals increased 3 percent 
since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Heinz announced plans to launch Boston Market Home  
Style Meals later this year and predicted the new line of frozen 
food would add $100 million in sales next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it expected to close the sale of its  
Weight Watchers weight control business by the end of September for 
about $735 million or a pretax gain of about $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the proceeds of the Weight Watchers sale would  
be used to retire debt and fund the $29 million launch of the 
Boston Market line of frozen meals. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Heinz fell 31 1/4 cents to $45.12 1/2 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Interests Groups Seeking Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINDSOR HEIGHTS, Iowa (AP) -- Otto Schultz, a courtly retired  
educator from Wisconsin, stood outside a suburban strip mall to 
offer a message certain to send a chill down the spine of anyone 
running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you flip pancakes in Keokuk, we will be there. When you  
drive tractors in Red Oak, we will be there. When you kiss piglets 
in Iowa Falls, we will be there,'' Schultz said Wednesday. ``You 
won't be able to avoid us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'' is the AARP, the nation's largest lobby for older  
American. 
</P>
<P>
	The group and other special interests are setting up operations  
in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates in both parties have put in place aggressive campaign  
organizations ahead of the first-in-the-nation presidential 
caucuses here early next year. Media attention is heavy, and lots 
of groups figure it's a good place to show up and get some 
attention for their issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no better time or place for the public to have their  
concerns addressed in than in Iowa before the caucuses,'' said 
Peggy Huppert, who runs a well-financed group called Iowans for 
Sensible Priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization has just launched an ad campaign seeking to  
convince voters that the nation spends too much on the military. 
The campaign argues that money spent on new fighter planes should 
be diverted instead to educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It's financed by some prominent business leaders, including Ben  
Cohen of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream fame. They have a brightly 
festooned bus that rumbles around the state making the point. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen heads to Iowa this week to perform a rap tune called  
``Move Our Money'' for reporters and an eighth-grade civics class. 
</P>
<P>
	While Huppert campaigns hard to cut defense spending, consultant  
Will Lynch is just as busy trying to draw attention to its campaign 
to increase the size of the Navy fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is called American Sea Power and is led by prominent  
former naval officers. But the goal is a bit more pragmatic because 
it's run by the American Shipbuilder's Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to be in Iowa because the caucuses are here,'' said  
Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups not only seek attention to their issues, but occasionally  
try to get candidates to deal with them as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome the candidates here, but please be prepared to  
answer our questions and discuss our issues,'' the AARP's Schultz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	AARP's campaign eschews subtlety: Its members will collect  
prescription medicine containers and bills from seniors and deposit 
them on the doors of presidential candidates to demand expanded 
Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Environmental Trust was only too happy to share  
with reporters a poll it ran among likely Republican caucus-goers 
showing more of those folks favor ``protecting the environment'' 
than pushing for abortion restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results underscore the importance of the environment as  
an issue to voters,'' the group said in releasing results. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the fray, the National Abortion Rights Action League  
rushed in with a warning that farmers could suffer through an 
effort in Congress to deny women the abortion drug RU-486, with 
that effort linked to farm disaster relief measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's demographics -- it's the third oldest in the nation --  
haven't been lost on nursing home advocates. The Long Term Care 
Project has an office in the state and button-festooned backers are 
regulars at campaign events pestering candidates on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a natural thing to happen in an important state  
like Iowa,'' said GOP presidential candidate Gary Bauer. ``I'd be a 
lot less comfortable if they didn't represent real people in this 
state.''

<HEADLINE> Santana Wants Music To Help People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Carlos Santana talks about a ``spiritual virus'  
when he sits down to discuss ``Supernatural,'' his new album. 
</P>
<P>
	His mandate in making the record, he said, was to help people  
realize their lives are valid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to spread, through these songs, a spiritual virus  
that brings hope and healing and a sense of validation for people's 
existence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to raise people's consciousness; to tap into the  
individual and remind him or her we are multidimensional spirits 
with tremendous possibilities and opportunities. That turns me on 
to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the sound is true and comes from somebody's heart, it  
rearranges the molecular structure of the listener. Your hair 
stands up. You get chills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Santana, 52, is the leader of the band of the same name. Santana  
was formed in the mid-1960s in San Francisco and started performing 
there. By the time the band performed at Woodstock in 1969, Santana 
had signed a contract to record with Columbia. The band's debut 
album ``Santana,'' which was boosted by the Woodstock appearance 
and positive critical response, stayed on the U.S. charts for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The band is best known for Latin rock and has played blues,  
Afro-Cuban and jazz rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Supernatural'' (Arista) was praised by Rolling Stone magazine:  
``It's been too long since Carlos Santana delivered a new studio 
album worthy of his awesome gifts, and for whatever reasons, all 
the high-profile attention he receives here appears to have 
reinvigorated his muse. ... Other tracks, like the opening `(De Le) 
Yaleo,' prove that Santana remains supernaturally graceful without 
too much help from anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guests artists include Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, Dave Matthews,  
Everlast and Eric Clapton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everlast has one of my favorite songs, `Put Your Lights On.'  
He had a heart attack and they opened him up. The first song he 
wrote when he came back was `Put Your Lights On,''' Santana said. 
``Musicians always strive to play music that is completely new and 
totally familiar. That's what that song is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guest artists know his music, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I walked into the studio and as soon as Wyclef saw my face, he  
wrote a song. He kept looking at me. The next thing you know, it's 
like I'm watching this guy channeling. `Maria Maria' sounds like 
something I'd write.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``If you listen to `Supernatural,' even though so many  
people go in and out, it is still one breath. It jells together 
very naturally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Santana went to an analyst at the urging of his  
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Something the analyst said ``liberated'' him from thinking like  
a victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``She point-blank asked me, `What makes you think that the whole  
world wakes up to harm you every morning, noon and night?' 
</P>
<P>
	``I did think that,'' he said. ``I didn't realize the importance  
of somebody going inside your pockets and taking out all the 
garbage you've been carrying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I realized I hadn't validated my existence either.  
Today I'm comfortable in my own skin for the first time in my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Santana said ``something internal'' told him to work toward  
making music that would get radio play and be heard by young 
people. ``I got my instructions, as most people do, in dreams or 
meditations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miles Davis told me the joy is in the process, not in the  
attaining. The joy that went into this CD while we were doing it, I 
have already won the victory, already been rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trusted my inner guidance. We'll set this up with the right  
engineer, musicians and record company, and all we have to do is be 
patient, gracious and grateful.''

<HEADLINE> Designers Get Time in the Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four young designers are getting their chance to  
share the spotlight with some of fashion's brightest stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Parkinson, Alexandra Lind, and twin sisters Angela and  
Sharon Wright will be presenting their collections Sept. 12, at the 
start of women's fashion week. They will use the same runway at the 
tents in Bryant Park that will be used later in the week by Oscar 
de la Renta, Randolph Duke and Badgley Mischka. 
</P>
<P>
	Fashion week for the spring 2000 collections will include some  
90 shows, staged at Bryant Park and at other locations throughout 
the city. The weeklong event will preview the latest by Bill Blass, 
Carolina Herrera, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan, and 
will give lesser-known designers the opportunity to attract 
worldwide attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Parkinson, Lind and the Wrights have small companies with staffs  
that can be counted on one hand, and they sell to only a half-dozen 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	But a panel of fashion industry executives, editors, writers and  
retailers saw promise in their work and selected them for the 
second annual Moet &AMP; Chandon Designer Debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Toby Tucker, InStyle magazine's fashion market editor and one of  
the editors involved in the selection process, said the Moet &AMP; 
Chandon show is like a ``newsflash,'' telling the fashion world to 
keep its eye on these designers. 
</P>
<P>
	Putting on a runway show is usually too costly for new  
designers, Tucker said, but without one, top editors and buyers for 
important stores are not going to see their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This show literally could launch their careers to the moon,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Designer Debut nominations are anonymous. Gregory Parkinson  
was unaware that he was in the running until he received a call 
while showing his collection of ``gently deconstructed'' 
eveningwear at a store in Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Parkinson, who is based in New York, asked an associate to call  
back, just to make sure it was the ``real deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Then,'' he said, ``I had an extra-big bag of chips and dip.''  
</P>
<P>
	Parkinson had another reason to celebrate: Cameron Diaz had  
decided to wear his clothes at the Venice Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	After 10 collections, Parkinson, 36, said he has developed a  
small base of clients who appreciate his use of traditional 
eveningwear fabrics in a ``slightly irreverent way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showing off a cotton tulle and sequin shell with a skirt made  
with a patchwork of laces, Parkinson said comfort is as important 
as color and cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elegance and beauty are important but without comfort, people  
won't wear it. When people are comfortable, people are at their 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parkinson, who was born and raised in England, had a store in  
Los Angeles but moved to New York two years ago because he wanted 
to make clothes for an audience beyond celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	He now designs mostly separates because it helps him reach a  
younger customer. The clothes can be dressy or casual, and -- at 
$400 to $1,000 an item -- a new skirt or top can update an outfit 
without having to start from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Angela and Sharon Wright call their collection The Wrights, and  
their personal styles literally define each item. 
</P>
<P>
	To find their target customer, they just need to look in the  
mirror -- or at each other. The Wrights' modern daywear styles in 
leather, bulky knits and high-tech fabrics are for women who know 
about fashion, don't have to wear a suit to the office and exercise 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't be all things to all people,'' said Sharon,  
explaining that their clothes are made for women size 12 and 
smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old sisters were born in England and now live in New  
York. Angela said that by working together, they have a level of 
comfort and trust that wouldn't exist with a random business 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean there aren't ``hiccups.''  
</P>
<P>
	If one sister falls in love with a fabric or pattern, she can  
usually persuade the other to embrace it. When it works, there are 
congratulations all around. When it doesn't, one sister is sure to 
remark, ``I knew we shouldn't have done that,'' Angela said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of our own blood, sweat and tears in each  
garment,'' she added. ``We'll ask each other, `Where is the glamour 
in this job?''' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Lind, 28, said she appreciates the value in creating a  
timeless style -- one that can be worn repeatedly. ``To buy an 
evening dress is an investment. It shouldn't be disposable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the New York-based designer keeps her eye on the future. She  
hopes to eventually add sportswear, handbags and shoes to her 
3-year-old company's eveningwear collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Lind tries to create a ``refined balance,'' making her dresses  
seductive by revealing one element of the body while concealing 
another, such as a gown with a low V-neck and a full skirt or a 
traditional cocktail dress with open panels down the sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growing up in New York was an enormous influence on me. I've  
always been inspired by the artists and creative people who live in 
New York,'' she said. ``I've always loved vintage, antique and 
designer everything -- clothes, shoes, handbags -- but I've always 
changed everything I bought a little bit to make them even 
better.''

<HEADLINE> Northwest Expects Big Loss in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Northwest Airlines expects to lose  
more than $100 million in Asia this year, but business should 
improve gradually in the next few years, a company executive said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Gross, general manager for the Philippines and  
Micronesia, said the financial crisis in Asia badly affected the 
company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that the region's air travel market, led by Japan,  
has started to recover and that the company could break even in 
Asia next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a clear recovery in the last couple of months,'' Gross  
said. He added, however, that ``We still have a long way to go 
before we will make money in Asia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline reported a net loss of $285.5 million in 1998 after  
a profit of $596.5 million in 1997. About a third of the airline's 
revenue is generated from its Asian operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross said that one sign of recovery in the region is that  
Japanese are again traveling to ``beach destinations'' such as 
Honolulu, Saipan and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the recent bilateral air agreement between the United  
States and China also should boost the carrier's activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest, the world's fourth largest airline, serves more than  
500 cities in over 100 countries on six continents with a fleet of 
415 aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Naomi Judd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEIPERS FORK, Tenn. (AP) -- There are angels on her windowsill, a  
room filled with costumes and about 20 dogs running around Naomi 
Judd's property. There also are figurines of the Statue of Liberty 
and Glenda the Good Witch from ``The Wizard of Oz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody needs an altar of their sacred things to center  
themselves,'' Judd says, explaining the hodgepodge of tchotchkes in 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
	To promote her latest venture, a syndicated radio show called  
``Heart to Heart With Naomi Judd,'' the mother half of the country 
duo The Judds gave a tour of her home, which sits on 1,000 acres in 
Williamson County, south of Nashville. Her equally famous daughters 
Ashley and Wynonna have houses on the property Naomi shares with 
husband Larry Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving lunch, Judd talked about her life, her career and  
her upcoming concert reunion with Wynonna. 
</P>
<P>
	Judd calls herself ``the star next door,'' someone who runs with  
the rich and famous but still cleans her own bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can be squeezing melons at (the grocery store) one minute  
and then having dinner with (director) George Lucas the next,'' she 
said. ``People are just people to me. I have no interest in 
titles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 53, she's beautiful, though in a painstakingly sculpted way  
unlike the fresh-scrubbed look of her daughter Ashley, an actress 
whose credits include ``Kiss the Girls'' and ``Simon Birch.'' Her 
hair is dyed red, but not as dramatic a shade as Wynonna favors. 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, Naomi is more down to earth than a typical star.  
She mentions she is on a diet to lose weight before her high school 
reunion and apologizes for ordering in instead of preparing 
something herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Her home is comfortable and not overly luxurious, though there  
is an upstairs room filled with her stage outfits, which are 
displayed in closets with glass doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Show business awards and mementos are confined to an upstairs  
office, near the pink-themed bedroom. Much easier to get to is a 
closet near the kitchen filled with books about healing and New Age 
music, which Naomi likes to give to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dogs roam the property -- there are nearly 20 between Naomi and  
Wynonna. Within walking distance of the main residence is a barn 
with six horses. Behind it is a building with a mock sheriff's 
office front. A small porch on the building will soon be expanded 
to accommodate a band, for square dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come here, I want to teach you something,'' Judd says,  
motioning to young country singer Brad Paisley. She is standing 
before the mock sheriff's office, across from offices where she is 
about to tape segments for the radio show. 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley, who has come to appear on Judd's radio show, obliges.  
</P>
<P>
	Inside the building are piles of boxes containing stuff fans  
have ever sent to her, from hand-knitted sweaters to dolls to 
plaques. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are important,'' she says. ``They make me what I  
am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judd was born Diana Ellen Judd and raised in Ashland, Ky., the  
daughter of a gas station owner and homemaker. Early on, she set 
her sights on show business, but got pregnant in high school and 
married. 
</P>
<P>
	She moved to Los Angeles with her husband and stayed there after  
they divorced. She gravitated to show business, taking a job as a 
secretary for singing group The Fifth Dimension and serving as an 
extra in the film ``More American Graffiti.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She became a registered nurse in 1977, which paid the rent when  
she moved to Nashville two years later with her daughters to pursue 
country music stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	Judd recognized the singing ability of daughter Christina -- who  
later changed her name to Wynonna -- when she was still a child and 
developed the act as a mother-daughter duo. For years, The Judds, 
sometimes called The Soap Sisters, sang on an early-morning 
television show in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Naomi worked tirelessly, trying to make contacts that would give  
the duo their big break. She succeeded by giving a demo tape to a 
patient at the hospital where she was working. The patient was the 
daughter of record producer Bret Maher, resulting in an audition at 
RCA Records that scored The Judds a record contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Their second single, ``Mama He's Crazy,'' released in 1984, made  
them stars. The Judds went on to sell more than 20 million albums. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, after a farewell tour, Naomi quit The Judds, announcing  
she had life-threatening hepatitis C. While Wynonna found success 
as a solo artist, Naomi managed to stay in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	She co-wrote her autobiography, ``Love Can Build a Bridge,'' saw  
it turned into a television movie, helped direct Wynonna's career 
and did charity work. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, she announced she was cured of hepatitis C, giving  
much credit to her spirituality and positive thinking. That 
experience set her off on another career as a motivational speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, she started the radio show.  
</P>
<P>
	On New Year's Eve, The Judds will reunite for a concert in  
Phoenix. Naomi has written two songs for a new Judds album, and 
hopes she can get Wynonna to put her solo career on the back burner 
so they can tour next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, she spends Sundays broadcasting ``Heart to Heart With  
Naomi Judd'' from the studio near her barn. She pre-tapes 
interviews during the day, and goes on live for four hours in the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're now entering Juddsville, which is a state of mind,''  
Naomi intones into the microphone for a recent show. ``This is what 
it's all about, a beautiful Sunday afternoon sitting around with an 
acoustic guitar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which focuses on country music and chatter, appears to  
be a hit. It's heard on 36 stations in cities around the country, 
including Nashville and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Judd's tour of her home is winding down. She has more work to do  
for the radio show, but first she stops by her answering machine to 
retrieve two messages. Both are long and rambling. 
</P>
<P>
	One is from Wynonna, who was touring on the West Coast: funny,  
apologizing for being out of touch recently. The other is from 
Ashley on the set of a movie in Austin, Texas: peeved because a 
Nashville gossip columnist has revealed the identity of her new 
boyfriend, a race car driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll listen to the rest of this later,'' Judd says, snapping  
off the machine. And then she says goodbye and heads back to work.

<HEADLINE> Nary A Glitch on 'All Nines Day' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- On the high-tech side, it was -- as expected -- a  
snoozer. And the rumors of rebellion in secluded Myanmar appeared 
to be overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	But a rare alignment of nines on the calendar today provided an  
excuse for thousands of superstitious people around the world to 
head out of town, try a little gambling or even get married. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computer experts had warned of potential problems with old  
programs that might mistake the date 9-9-99 with a code used to end 
an operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Though few had expected any serious malfunctions, the ``9999  
bug'' was seen by some as a possible dry-run ahead of the Year 2000 
problem, in which computers unable to properly handle the change 
from the year 1999 to 2000 on Jan. 1 go haywire. 
</P>
<P>
	If today was any indication, the Y2K bug could be a breeze.  
</P>
<P>
	To be safe, the Bank of Japan added $2.7 billion worth of  
Treasury bills Wednesday, and even more today, because of concerns 
that foreign banks might be in need of cash should any computer 
problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
	But a bank official said that as of late this morning, there had  
been no reports of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, while the All Nines appeared to be shaping up to be just  
another day in the computer world, it was anything but ordinary for 
thousands of gamblers, eccentrics and lovers across the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan Travel Bureau, this country's largest travel agency,  
commemorated the date with a package tour for 99 people that 
included airfare to New York or Orlando, Fla. for 99,999 yen (about 
$909). 
</P>
<P>
	In Malaysia, four-digit lottery ticket hawkers were on a roll,  
The Sun newspaper reported, with ``9999'' being a hot bet at 
lottery outlets. And 999 senior citizens were to attempt to set a 
new -- albeit obscure -- Malaysian record for the largest gathering 
at older persons in a circus. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian couples were also rushing to get married. Ninety-nine  
couples took their wedding vows in a mass ceremony at exactly 9:09 
a.m. at a Buddhist temple in the capital of Kuala Lumpur. The 
number of Malaysian couples registering to be married today was 
nearly three times the daily average, according to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	A rush of weddings was also expected in Japan and China. And,  
not to be outdone, a mass marriage was to be held at the monkey 
house of the Berlin Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was Taiwan, where a conflicting tradition --  
the end of Ghost Month -- makes many people consider Thursday to be 
bad luck. Along with marriages, there were likely to be fewer 
people eating out there as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of Nines Day was lighthearted.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the past few weeks there have been persistent rumors that  
activists in Myanmar might be plotting an uprising to coincide with 
the Nines Day, which they consider auspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently taking such rumors seriously, the Myanmar government  
had recently detained 16 pro-democracy activists, and Thai troops 
on the Myanmar border were put on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thai government is concerned that fighting might erupt  
between Myanmar forces and those of the Karen National Union, one 
of the last remaining ethnic insurgency groups fighting the central 
government.

	Exercise isn't just good for the heart -- your gall bladder will  
thank you, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who exercise two to three hours a week cut their risk of  
excruciatingly painful gallstones by nearly one-third compared with 
women who don't exercise at all, according to a study at the 
Harvard School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The usual treatment for painful gallstones is removal of the  
gall bladder, and about 500,000 Americans, two-thirds of them 
women, have their gall bladders taken out each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The operations and hospitalization cost more than $5 billion a  
year, and the problem is the most common and costly digestive 
disease requiring hospitalization, according to the National 
Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier study by the same group looked only at men, even  
though women are twice as likely to develop gallstones. This study, 
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, confirmed 
the earlier findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, led by Dr. Michael F. Leitzmann, looked at  
60,290 women who were ages 40 to 65 in 1986 and had no history of 
gallstone disease. The women filled in surveys every two years 
about their activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, women who exercised about 30 minutes a day cut their  
risk of gall bladder surgery by 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Obesity increases the risk of gallstones, as does rapid weight  
loss. But even after the researchers took obesity and recent weight 
changes into account, the exercisers were still 20 percent less 
likely to undergo gall bladder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers theorize that exercise may reduce the  
cholesterol content of bile, the digestive juice stored in the gall 
bladder. That could reduce the number of gallstones, since 80 
percent of the gallstones in this country are solid cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, people who exercise have more active large intestines and  
better levels of blood sugar and insulin, all of which may reduce 
the risk of gallstones. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who sit for 41 to 60 hours a week -- that's most women with  
desk jobs -- were found to be 42 percent more likely to need their 
gall bladders removed than those who spend six hours or less 
sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
	At more than 60 hours a week, the risk skyrockets: A woman is  
132 times as likely to need gall bladder surgery as someone who 
spends most of her waking hours on her feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think many diseases that are problems for us in the United  
States are lifestyle-oriented,'' said Dr. Joe Hines, a professor at 
UCLA Medical School. ``I think this is another study which points 
out the importance of Americans being more physically active.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rudra Rai, a professor of gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins  
University, said the results aren't surprising, but the study was 
the first he has seen to sort the effects of exercise out from a 
vast array of other factors, such as weight, age, hormone 
replacement therapy, diabetes, smoking, alcohol and caffeine.

<HEADLINE> Michelin Restructures in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French tire giant Michelin plans to restructure the  
whole of its activities in Europe, shedding a total of 7,500 jobs 
over the next three years, the company announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelin warned that the restructuring, which represents a  
reduction of around 10 percent in Michelin's staff in Europe, could 
lead to the closure of some of its sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The tire company said the move is part of a new European  
strategy which aims to lift the group's productivity by at least 20 
percent over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier periods when Michelin ``had to fight for its survival''  
should be behind it, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has set itself a target of growing revenues by 4  
percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelin's debt at the end of June was nearly $1.08 billion  
higher than a year ago. Michelin's debt now stands at $3.96 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Beloit Corp. Announces Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELOIT, Wis. (AP) -- Beloit Corp., which manufactures papermaking  
equipment, is eliminating 350 factory jobs in Beloit and in 
Rockton, Ill., by Jan. 31, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A soft Asian market and light demand forced the cuts, company  
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beloit Corporation must become profitable and cash flow  
positive in the very near term, so the company is taking this 
action to reduce excess capacity and the cost associated with it as 
quickly as possible,'' Chief Operating Officer Mark Readinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beloit Corp. currently employs 1,100 people in Beloit and  
Rockton. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Beloit Corp. has laid off between 500 and 600  
employees in Beloit, including 150 workers in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees will continue to report to work until current orders  
are filled, but new orders will be shifted to other Beloit 
facilities, said spokesman Peter E. Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Beloit Corp.'s parent, Harnischfeger Industries Inc. of St.  
Francis, Wis., underwent an upper management shakeup and sought 
Bankruptcy Court protection from creditors earlier this year while 
it attempts to reorganize its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers are hoping that Beloit Corp. will be bought out, said  
Kurt Fullmer, president of a Machinists union local.

<HEADLINE> Russian Investigators Going to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Investigators from Russia's main security agencies  
plan to go to the United States to discuss a probe into alleged 
money laundering through the Bank of New York, Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	American investigators reportedly believe that up to $10 billion  
has been illegally channeled by the Russian mob through the Bank of 
New York. No one has been charged with any crime, but the case has 
been described as potentially one of the biggest money laundering 
affairs ever uncovered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government, which has angrily denounced the reports  
as an attempt to smear Russia, hasn't opened a formal probe into 
the matter, but said it is cooperating with U.S. investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from Russia's Federal Security Service, the main  
successor to the KGB, the Interior Ministry, Tax Police and other 
special services will go to the United States on Monday to consult 
with their American counterparts, Ivanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he indicated that Russia still had little interest in  
starting a thorough investigation of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if one allows that money has been laundered through  
banks, those were not Russian banks, but banks from the United 
States and other western nations,'' the Interfax news agency quoted 
Ivanov as saying during a trip to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``So the problem is far from being solely Russia's,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. investigation has reportedly been expanded to include  
dozens of banks worldwide that were involved in transfers of money 
through Bank of New York accounts.

<HEADLINE>  John McEnroe Is Davis Cup Captain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just call John McEnroe captain now.  
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, perhaps the most successful player in Davis Cup  
history, got his wish Wednesday when he was appointed captain of a 
U.S. team that has not won the title since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the proudest moments of my life,'' McEnroe said.  
``Apparently it took this wonderful lady to show some guts finally, 
and I appreciate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman is Judy Levering, president of the U.S. Tennis  
Association. She selected McEnroe after meeting with Pete Sampras, 
Andre Agassi, Todd Martin and Jim Courier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I wanted to show the players that I was responsive  
to their needs and would not make a decision about the future of 
Davis Cup without their consent,'' Levering said. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe succeeds Tom Gullikson, who had been U.S. Davis Cup  
captain since 1994 and compiled a 13-5 record, including the last 
championship in 1995. Gullikson will remain as director of coaching 
of the USTA's Player Development Program. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe has been passionate about this international event. The  
40-year-old Hall of Famer played on five U.S. Davis Cup 
championship teams and has a 59-10 record. He competed in Davis Cup 
for 12 years and still holds six U.S. records, including most 
singles (41) and total victories (59). 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he will be just as successful as captain, bringing  
that same passion and energy he did as a player,'' Levering said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras and Agassi enthusiastically endorsed the move.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that John has wanted for a long time,''  
Sampras said. ``I know he will do a great job as captain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be the best captain yet by far,'' Agassi  
said. ``John will make a huge difference. Now, all we have to do is 
get Pete on board and we're all good. We've still got the players. 
Let's get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe said he has not yet spoken to Agassi or Sampras.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to bother Andre right now while he's involved in  
the U.S. Open,'' he said. ``I'd be more than happy to fly out to 
talk to Pete if that's what it takes. I'm hoping that both of them 
will come on board immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson took much of the blame for the United States loss in  
Australia in July when Sampras played only doubles. McEnroe was 
asked how he would handle such a situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the details of that,'' he said. ``I'd prefer not  
to look at the past at this time. That was obviously a position 
that was awkward in some ways. It's easy to be a backseat driver at 
this point. I prefer to look ahead. I'm sure I'm going to have some 
tough decisions to make of my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe has been interested in this job for a while, but said  
the time was not right until now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I needed some time away from the game,'' he said.  
``Time away sometimes gives you appreciation for what you don't 
have and what you want to be a part of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. resumes Davis Cup play in February against an  
undetermined opponent The draw for the 2000 Davis Cup is Oct. 7 in 
London.

<HEADLINE> Study: Alternative Schools Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- About one in four U.S. children are going to  
alternative and private schools as choices other than neighborhood 
public schools are increasing across the country, a new study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage attending private school has remained at 10  
percent for years. But with newer options of charter schools, 
magnet schools, open enrollment and voucher programs, the 
alternatives -- including private schools -- account for a full 25 
percent of U.S. students. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the increase in so-called school choice, researchers  
said they did not find a great deal of evidence that the 
alternatives improve student achievement, according to the study 
released Wednesday by the Policy Analysis for California Education 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury is still out,'' concluded the report, ``School  
Choice: Abundant Hopes, Scarce Evidence of Results.'' PACE is based 
at the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, 5.3 million of the nation's 50 million students, or 11  
percent, took advantage of public school choice. That rose to 7.8 
million, or 15 percent, in 1999, the think tank estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	School choice advocates said the report was too negative. The  
real measure of achievement is the happiness of parents who have 
taken their children out of failing neighborhood public schools, 
said Stanford political science Professor Terry Moe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Choice is really popular out there among parents, particularly  
among minority, low-income parents in districts that are not doing 
a good job,'' said Moe. His book, ``Politics, Markets and America's 
Schools,'' has been influential in the school choice movement.

<HEADLINE>  Moss Says Vikings Have Lost Feeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Randy Moss sounded the alarm. The  
star receiver says the Minnesota Vikings don't have that special 
feeling they did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He sees evidence everywhere -- from the mood in the locker room  
to the play on the field. Things just aren't the same for this new 
cast of Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably something we probably could recapture,''  
Moss said Wednesday. ``But last year, it was something special. It 
was something inside that knew the '98 Minnesota Vikings were 
something special. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this year, we lost a lot of guys on defense. We have our  
whole offense back (but) we lost our offensive coordinator. ... So, 
there's a lot of things that we have to get used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss's worries stem from a lackluster exhibition season in which  
the Vikings looked nothing like the team that went 15-1 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost eight free agents in the offseason and failed on draft  
day to shore up the holes left by the departures of defensive stars 
Jerry Ball, Derrick Alexander and Corey Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite returning all 11 starters, the offense, under new  
coordinator Ray Sherman, has yet to get untracked. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss, who set a rookie record with 17 TD catches last season,  
alternately proclaimed his team ready to put its troubles behind 
and bemoaned its many inadequacies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hard. It's going to be a struggle this  
year,'' he said. ``You know there's a lot of high expectations this 
year for us to go out here and try to duplicate last season and I 
don't think there's any way possible -- well, I wouldn't say any way 
possible that we can do that again -- but it's going to be very hard 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss said he was shocked by the shoddy preseason play of the  
veteran offensive line that was so integral to last season's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Vikings lost to the New York Jets last week, coach  
Dennis Green assailed the pass protection and said he counted three 
mental mistakes from the first-team offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of shocked me, to be honest with you, to see as far as  
the veteran group of guys we got playing the offensive line. ... 
You know it kinds of hurts when it's third-and-short and then it 
ends up third-and-long,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive line coach Mike Tice said he is hardly depressed over  
his unit's play. He said the game films show easily correctable 
lapses. 
</P>
<P>
	And Moss added that nobody can stop the Vikings if Todd  
Steussie, Randall McDaniel, Jeff Christy, David Dixon and Korey 
Stringer keep Randall Cunningham upright. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put 60 points up on that board, 50, 60  
points,'' Moss said. ``We're capable of that if everybody's on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upon reflection, Moss acknowledged he didn't get that special  
feeling about last year's squad until Week 5, when the Vikings beat 
Green Bay 37-24 at Lambeau Field. He said the feeling grew stronger 
after the Vikings won the rematch with the Packers at the 
Metrodome, then flew to Dallas and routed the Cowboys on 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this year it's like we're going to need a gut check for us  
to see where we are we're going,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday is as good a time as any.  
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings visit the Georgia Dome to face the Falcons, who  
upset them in the NFC championship by holding Cunningham, Moss and 
the most productive offensive machine in league history to just one 
touchdown during the final 42 minutes in the thunderous Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, that loss to Atlanta's probably going to always be  
in the back of my mind,'' Moss said. ``Probably until the day I 
die.''

year for us to go out here and try to duplicate last season and I 
don't think there's any way possible -- well, I wouldn't say any way 
possible that we can do that again -- but it's going to be very hard 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss said he was shocked by the shoddy preseason play of the  
veteran offensive line that was so integral to last season's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Vikings lost to the New York Jets last week, coach  
Dennis Green assailed the pass protection and said he counted three 
mental mistakes from the first-team offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of shocked me, to be honest with you, to see as far as  
the veteran group of guys we got playing the offensive line. ... 
You know it kinds of hurts when it's third-and-short and then it 
ends up third-and-long,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive line coach Mike Tice said he is hardly depressed over  
his unit's play. He said the game films show easily correctable 
lapses. 
</P>
<P>
	And Moss added that nobody can stop the Vikings if Todd  
Steussie, Randall McDaniel, Jeff Christy, David Dixon and Korey 
Stringer keep Randall Cunningham upright. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put 60 points up on that board, 50, 60  
points,'' Moss said. ``We're capable of that if everybody's on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upon reflection, Moss acknowledged he didn't get that special  
feeling about last year's squad until Week 5, when the Vikings beat 
Green Bay 37-24 at Lambeau Field. He said the feeling grew stronger 
after the Vikings won the rematch with the Packers at the 
Metrodome, then flew to Dallas and routed the Cowboys on 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this year it's like we're going to need a gut check for us  
to see where we are we're going,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday is as good a time as any.  
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings visit the Georgia Dome to face the Falcons, who  
upset them in the NFC championship by holding Cunningham, Moss and 
the most productive offensive machine in league history to just one 
touchdown during the final 42 minutes in the thunderous Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, that loss to Atlanta's probably going to always be  
in the back of my mind,'' Moss said. ``Probably until the day I 
die.''

<HEADLINE> Suns Sign Forward Corie Blount </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns signed Corie Blount to a  
two-year contract Wednesday, beating out four other teams that were 
interested in the 6-foot-10 forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns used their $1.1 million salary cap exception. Blount  
has the option of accepting a second-year salar of $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana, the Los Angeles Lakers, Vancouver and Washington all  
were interested and had more cap room, but Blount's agent said his 
client liked the opportunity in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a number of teams that were pursuing him and had the  
chance to earn considerably more dollars with some other teams,'' 
Mark Bartelstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition was important for Phoenix, which traded forwards  
Danny Manning and Pat Garrity to Orlando for coveted shooting guard 
Penny Hardaway in early August. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bryan Colangelo said the offseason moves are  
designed to address weaknesses identified when the Suns were swept 
by Portland in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about athleticism. We talked about interior  
toughness,'' Colangelo said. ``We talked about a lot of things that 
at least on paper have been addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest addition gave the Suns six players who measure 6-10  
or taller. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Danny Ainge said Blount, who has taken more than 40  
percent of his rebounds off the offensive glass, will provide 
needed rebounding and interior defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He adds great depth to our front line, and he's probably more  
athletic than most of our current big guys,'' Ainge said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days before the Hardaway trade, the Suns gave free agent  
forward Rodney Rogers their $2 million cap exception. That left 
them only the lesser exception to land Blount, considered one of 
the best big men left on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Blount, 30, played for Chicago, the Los Angeles Lakers and  
Cleveland in his six NBA seasons, averaging 3.4 points and 3.8 
rebounds in 13.7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls drafted him No. 25 in the first round in 1996, then  
traded him to Los Angeles two years later. Blount played with the 
Lakers until last season, when he was traded to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns open their training camp Oct. 4 in Flagstaff.

<HEADLINE> Lance Armstrong Marks Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Lance Armstrong celebrated another  
poignant victory Wednesday, successfully completing his first 
medical checkup since winning the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	The survivor of testicular cancer is in excellent health,  
according to his doctor, who performed a routine exam on the elite 
cyclist at Oregon Health Sciences University. As part of his 
recovery, Armstrong must undergo two medical exams a year for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're totally pleased with his medical situation,'' Dr. Craig  
Nichols said. ``Chances of this recurring are infinitesimally 
small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 27, became an inspirational figure for cancer  
patients around the world after winning cycling's most prestigious 
race in July -- just two years after beating his illness. He was 
found to be cancer-free in 1997 after four rounds of chemotherapy 
and two operations -- one for brain lesions and one to remove a 
testicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he is in the clear, the Texan remains connected to  
cancer patients and survivors, whom he describes as his extended 
family. In 1997 he founded the Lance Armstrong Foundation to help 
people manage and survive cancer. The foundation, led by Nichols, 
has raised more than $1.4 million for cancer research and 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	And he stays in touch with patients across the country by  
sending them inspiring notes through e-mail, letters and 
autographed photos. ``It doesn't take much,'' he said, to keep 
someone going when they're in the throes of the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	When Armstrong was first diagnosed in 1996 at the age of 25, he  
was desperate to understand what was going on in his body. He read 
as much as he could on testicular cancer, which strikes 7,400 men 
nationwide each year. He quizzed doctors. Above all, he talked 
about it with as many people as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	He encourages patients to do the same. Testicular cancer is the  
leading form of cancer among men in their 20s and 30s, but in 
Armstrong's experience, it's not something young men usually want 
to bring into casual conversation. Few athletes asked him about his 
illness when he returned to cycling. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop him talking about it. ``I didn't think about  
getting embarrassed or the potential of people to joke -- it's not 
funny,'' said Armstrong, likening society's discomfort on the topic 
to what women with breast cancer went through 10 to 15 years ago. 
``If there is always secrecy and shame to talk about it, we won't 
move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the battle over cancer, he said, helped him achieve the  
ultimate test of endurance in cycling. Cancer changed his body -- 
destroying in months the muscle he built over a decade of cycling. 
It changed his perspective on life. Now married, he and his wife, 
Kristin, are expecting a child next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I would have won the race if I didn't have  
cancer,'' he said. ``I was more focused and serious this time 
around in everything.''

<HEADLINE> Gases Could Show How Body Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *LAURAN NEERGAARD   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a laboratory at the University of Virginia,  
a handful of patients inhaled a deep breath of helium and watched 
their lungs light up. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are exploring a dramatic new way to peer into  
patients' bodies: using specially treated gases that let doctors 
watch, for the first time, how breath flows through the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the technology isn't just for lungs -- it promises to light  
up other organs now difficult to see with conventional scanning. 
Researchers are poised to try it as a colon cancer test, and say it 
might also offer better images of the brain or a woman's 
reproductive tract, without the discomfort or radiation of some of 
today's tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really looks like it's going to help people,'' said UVA  
radiology professor James R. Brookeman. 
</P>
<P>
	These so-called hyperpolarized gases are still highly  
experimental, experts caution. But radiologists compare the black 
blob an MRI pictures as a lung with the brightly lit image of 
helium-filled lungs, and say the need is great. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new idea and a new technique'' that provides ``very  
striking'' images, said James MacFall, a Duke University medical 
physicist who also has tested the gases. 
</P>
<P>
	Scanners like magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, provide  
incredible illumination of parts of the body. But they don't image 
some organs well. They don't picture airflow through the lungs, for 
instance. Tracking airflow could help treat emphysema, cystic 
fibrosis, asthma, even monitor how well a transplanted lung is 
adapting. 
</P>
<P>
	But inhale a hyperpolarized gas into the lungs, just like you  
would inhale oxygen, and an MRI shows a bright image of plump 
lungs. Where there's an obstruction -- where the lungs aren't doing 
their job -- the image is dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Tom Daniel, a UVA lung surgeon, uses hyperpolarized helium  
to help perform a tricky surgery for emphysema patients: slicing 
away dead portions of lung so the remaining good lung tissue moves 
and breathes more freely. It's called lung reduction surgery, and 
picking just which spot to cut is difficult but key. 
</P>
<P>
	``It told me with a lot more confidence what part of her lung  
was not getting oxygen,'' Daniel said in describing a woman he 
operated on last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas provides ``a very beautiful picture of the abnormal  
pathology in emphysema. It was just a no-brainer'' to try, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Molecules of substances like gas normally spin randomly.  
Physicists can fire a laser at certain gases, and the molecules 
temporarily spin in the same direction, called hyperpolarization. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Princeton University physicists were researching  
hyperpolarized gases for the military when one of them needed an 
MRI -- and wondered if the research might also help medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Experiments showed the lined-up molecules of hyperpolarized  
helium-3 produced an MRI signal thousands of times stronger than 
today's technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Helium is benign -- divers routinely breathe it, and a  
helium-induced high-pitched voice is an old comedian's trick. The 
isotope helium-3, a byproduct of the tritium used in hydrogen 
bombs, is the version that can be hyperpolarized. Simply gulp a 
lungful and hold your breath for 10 seconds while the MRI scans. 
</P>
<P>
	Now New Jersey-based Nycomed Amersham Imaging is preparing  
clinical trials necessary to prove to the Food and Drug 
Administration that hyperpolarized helium lung scans are safe and 
useful. In addition to UVA's ongoing study, Nycomed hopes to begin 
other studies by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	But helium's not the only choice. Xenon-129 also can be  
hyperpolarized. It can penetrate into the brain -- giving it an 
anesthetic effect -- and thus might give better brain scans. It's 
also more abundant than helium-3, which Nycomed now must buy from 
the former Soviet Union because the Defense Department won't sell 
its supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Those aren't the only potential uses:  
</P>
<P>
	--Brookeman plans next year to study inflating people's colons  
with helium to hunt colon cancer. Everyone over age 50 now is 
supposed to get a colonoscopy in which a fiber-optic tube is 
threaded through the intestine. Using helium to just light up 
precancerous colon polyps promises to be less uncomfortable, says 
Brookeman, who has successfully tried the experiment in dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	--A common test to check for infertility is to inject an oily  
substance into a woman's fallopian tubes and then X-ray her 
abdomen. An early animal experiment suggests helium could tell if 
the fallopian tubes are blocked without an X-ray's radiation, 
Brookeman said.

<HEADLINE> New Job for Washington Post's Hiatt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Post has named editorial writer  
Fred Hiatt as editor of the editorial page. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Donald E. Graham said Tuesday that Hiatt, 44, will  
assume the job in several months upon the retirement of Stephen S. 
Rosenfeld, the interim editorial page editor who was tapped for the 
job after the death of Meg Greenfield in May. Greenfield ran the 
Post's editorial and op-ed pages for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said ``we looked inside the paper and outside at some  
length'' during the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fred's journalistic values and standards are of the same type  
as Meg Greenfield's, and that's the best type there is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiatt, a finalist for a Pulitzer this year, began his reporting  
career in 1979 with the Atlanta Journal. He joined the Washington 
Star eight months before the newspaper folded in 1981, and was 
hired by the Post to cover suburban counties. 
</P>
<P>
	After a three-year stint covering military affairs on the  
paper's national staff, Hiatt in 1987 went to Japan, where he 
shared bureau chief duties with his wife, Margaret Shapiro, now an 
editor of the Post Magazine. In 1991, the couple began a similar 
four-year tour in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hits to all fields,'' Rosenfeld said. ``He goes after the  
facts and he frames the issues vigorously. He's got great 
peripheral vision. In a short period of time, he's grabbed hold of 
the issues we deal with and written about them forthrightly, 
stylishly and elegantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hiatt, a Harvard University graduate, will serve as deputy  
editorial page editor until the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled,'' he said. ``As far as I'm concerned, this is  
the best job in journalism, a page with a great tradition. I feel 
very fortunate to have had a few years working with Meg and 
Steve.''

	BOSTON (AP) -- Earl Henry Sholley doesn't deny slapping his  
daughter five years ago. The act, he said, was meant to discipline 
a precocious 14-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sholley said he never expected the fallout: a restraining  
order taken out by his daughter, a 6-month jail sentence for 
assault and battery, and eventual divorce proceedings that gave his 
ex-wife their house and assets. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Sholley and five other men say they filed a federal  
lawsuit claiming the state's court system victimizes men by issuing 
restraining orders at the first allegation of domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it will level the playing field and force  
Massachusetts judges to treat both parents equally,'' said Sholley, 
51, who owns a landscaping company and lives in Medway. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Tuesday, claims that men involved in marital and  
custody disputes are routinely denied their constitutional rights 
of due process and equal protection, as well as the right to bear 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't looking for money. We're looking for relief,'' said  
attorney David Grossack, who filed the suit on behalf of the six 
men and the Fatherhood Coalition -- a Massachusetts-based advocacy 
group that claims several hundred members. 
</P>
<P>
	Grossack said he is seeking to have the state's restraining  
order law overturned because it allows for an order to be issued 
based only on allegations -- not proof -- of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for battered woman said the lawsuit is a disturbing  
backlash by men hoping to reassert control they lost after 
anti-abuse laws grew tougher in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they have a very weak claim,'' said Cheryl Garrity,  
president of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Organization 
for Women. ``I think the courts attempt to be fair and there are 
due process provisions in place. I don't think judges come to the 
situation thinking men are automatically the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 40,000 restraining orders issued in the state each year,  
more than 90 percent are requested by women against their male 
partners, Grossack said. Those numbers indicate the orders are 
discriminatory against men, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Subjects of the orders are typically ordered from their homes,  
often prohibited from contacting their children and denied a 
``meaningful'' hearing to defend themselves, the suit alleges. 
Federal and state laws also unfairly deprive them of their right to 
own weapons during that time, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs claim that Massachusetts judges routinely deny  
accused men visits with their children and order them to write 
support checks beyond their means. In addition, some men have been 
threatened with jail for sending greeting cards to their kids, the 
suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Nollet, 49, of Woburn, said he joined the legal action  
after his ex-wife accused him of abuse and took out several 
restraining orders against him in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was acquitted of the charges in court, a judge  
continued to allow successive restraining orders, and ordered him 
to pay $1,000 per month for spousal and child support, a sum he 
couldn't afford, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People believe the government brings good and honest  
accusations, but that is not always so,'' Nollet said. ``It's a 
sword hanging over your head. You're one unsupported accusation 
away from being arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Whiting, a spokeswoman for the state courts, and  
Marcia Cohen, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's 
office, declined to comment Tuesday on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	NOW's Garrity said laws requiring the subjects of restraining  
orders to relinquish their firearms and vacate their homes are 
crucial to protecting victims of battery. 
</P>
<P>
	``This (lawsuit) is clearly an attempt to undo the protections  
that battered women have gained over the past 10 years,'' she said. 
``These laws were put in to stop upfront offenses. We can't wait 
until the woman is almost dead to start protecting her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Paul Cellucci said he supported the state's current law on  
restraining orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been some abuse in divorce cases, and sometimes it's  
abused, and I think it's unfortunate,'' he said. ``But I think for 
the most part it's a law that has worked to reduce violence in the 
home.''

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Indicts N.J. Troopers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- In a case that fueled a national debate  
over racial profiling, two state troopers have been charged with 
attempted murder in the shooting of black and Hispanic men on the 
New Jersey Turnpike. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hogan, 29, and James Kenna, 28, were also charged in a  
state grand jury indictment with aggravated assault. The troopers, 
who are white, face up to 40 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The troopers are accused of firing into a van containing four  
young men on their way to a basketball tryout in North Carolina in 
1998. Three were wounded, and all have filed civil rights and 
injury lawsuits against the troopers and the state. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the union representing state troopers called  
Tuesday's indictments ``outrageous and beyond belief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today a stake was driven through the hearts of many men and  
women troopers who put their lives on the line every day to protect 
the citizens of this state,'' said Ed Lennon, president of the 
State Troopers Fraternal Association of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident triggered protests and internal probes of ``racial  
profiling'' -- the practice of stopping motorists strictly on the 
basis of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Gov. Christie Whitman fired the State Police  
superintendent after he said minorities were responsible for most 
of the state's cocaine and marijuana traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, President Clinton issued an executive order calling on  
federal law enforcement agencies to collect race and gender data in 
all stops and arrests. Police in several places, including North 
Carolina, Houston, San Diego and San Jose, Calif., have taken 
similar measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan and Kenna have said they stopped the van because the  
driver was speeding, and they opened fire because it appeared the 
van was backing up to hit them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first step on the road to justice,'' lawyer  
Johnnie Cochran Jr., who represents the men in a civil rights 
lawsuit, said today. ``Eleven bullets were fired from almost 
point-blank range at these young men. They still bear the wounds 
and scars and emotional trauma. It's been very difficult for these 
young men to deal with. This case shows that terror on the 
thoroughfares is not acceptable in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan's lawyer, Robert Galantucci, called the indictment  
``politically motivated'' and said the 16-month investigation 
browbeat grand jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grand jury and the attorney general had months to debate  
and investigate these issues,'' Galantucci said. ``These troopers 
had a matter of seconds to make a decision that had an impact on 
their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Assemblyman Joseph Charles, chairman of the New  
Jersey Legislative Black and Latino Caucus, said the indictments 
``should send a sobering message to the state police hierarchy that 
nobody is above the law and that truth cannot be repressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Hogan and Kenna were indicted on separate  
charges of falsifying traffic-stop reports to conceal that they 
were stopping a lot of black drivers. Their lawyers have claimed 
the charges were exaggerated from paperwork mistakes.

<HEADLINE> Burmah Castrol To Cut 1,450 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SWINDON, England (AP) -- Burmah Castrol PLC, a British lubricants  
and chemicals company, announced Wednesday that it plans to cut 
1,450 jobs worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A major restructuring will lead to 450 job losses this year and  
an additional 1,000 ``over the next few years,'' the company said 
in a statement announcing interim financial results. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it hoped most of the job cuts would come  
through attrition and voluntary layoffs. It said the savings could 
total 60 million pounds ($96.6 million) a year by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 of the first cuts are expected to come from a plant in  
Staffordshire, while others will be in continental Europe and 
India. 
</P>
<P>
	Burmah Castrol employs some 20,000 people worldwide, including  
3,000 in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ending June 30, the company posted a pretax  
profit of 94.8 million pounds ($152.4 million) compared with 153.5 
million pounds ($95.9 million) in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to 1.44 billion pounds ($231.5 billion) from 1.41  
billion pounds ($226.7 billion).

<HEADLINE> Rounding Up Commodities Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures retreated Wednesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade amid some profit-taking on the prior day's run-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices continued to reach new highs and natural gas futures  
gave back some of their recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The downturn in soybeans came after the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture reported late Tuesday that 46 percent of the soybean 
crop was in the good-to-excellent range as of Sunday. That was down 
1 percentage point from last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling was limited by continued expectations the soybean  
crop will be smaller than the last estimate of 2.87 billion bushels 
made by the USDA. Harvesting of the soybean crop begins later this 
month. The next crop estimate will be released later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in soybeans weighed on wheat and corn futures.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also was pressured by worries the recent rise in prices  
may have scared away foreign buyers for the U.S. crop. Corn was 
pressured by reports of weak farmer sales and a slight rise in the 
USDA's rating of the corn crop. The losses were limited by reports 
South Korea and Taiwan are in the market for corn, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was 6 3/4 cents lower at $2.86 a  
bushel; December corn was 4 1/4 cents lower at $2.21 a bushel; 
December oats were 1 1/4 cents lower at $1.15 3/4 a bushel; November 
soybeans were 12 1/4 cents lower at $5.08 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
continued to rise to levels not seen since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The move higher was in anticipation of the Sept. 22 ministerial  
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers are expected to decide against changing the level  
of oil production by member nations, said analyst Michael Rothman 
of Merrill Lynch. That expectation was reinforced by published 
reports that OPEC Secretary General Rilwanu Lukman, speaking in 
Indonesia at a conference, said current production levels of 26.2 
million barrels per day will remain in effect past March if oil 
prices weaken. 
</P>
<P>
	October light sweet crude was 5 cents higher at $22.66 a barrel;  
October heating oil was 0.43 cent higher at 59.52 cents a gallon; 
October unleaded gasoline was 0.20 cent higher at 66.70 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures gave back more than half of Tuesday's gains  
amid expectations the American Gas Association will report a 
significant increase in gas inventory levels. 
</P>
<P>
	October natural gas was 6.5 cents lower at $2.612 per 1,000  
cubic feet.

<HEADLINE>  76ers Welcome Asst. Coach Calipari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Calling him ``the finest young coach I've  
ever been associated with,'' Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown 
welcomed John Calipari aboard as his newest assistant Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who gave Calipari his first college coaching job in 1982,  
said he feels the latest move should do nothing but benefit both 
the team and Calipari. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just excited about coaching again,'' said Calipari, who  
was fired after getting off to a 3-18 start last season with the 
New Jersey Nets; the year before that, he guided the team into the 
playoffs. ``You're talking about a talented young team here that's 
so well-coached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started with (Brown) at Kansas. Now I'll be re-introduced to  
him and can see what changes he's made. But in terms of being an 
assistant again, after being a head coach, I was an assistant 
before I was a head coach. So I'll do whatever I can to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Brown, what Calipari brings to the table is  
something special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been with some great ones but I think he's the whole  
package,'' Brown said. ``It bugged me that certain people say he 
failed in New Jersey last year. But he understands the game great. 
He's got great rapport with the players and is much more of an 
innovator than I ever hope to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want him to be like a head coach. I want all my assistants  
to be that way. But I don't think he'll be with us very long and 
that's OK with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari is making no commitments beyond this season. He said  
what happened in New Jersey is something he's already put behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has an opinion about what happened there,'' Calipari  
said. ``Hopefully, when they look back on it, they'll see things 
were better than when I took over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	76ers president Pat Croce, seriously injured in a June  
motorcycle accident, made an appearance at the press conference. 
Croce, who has undergone three operations and a broken leg, hopes 
to be walking without any help in time for the team's Nov. 8 home 
opener against Seattle.

	Clinton Prodding Congress on Health  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With lawmakers back in town, President Clinton  
will urge Congress to press ahead with new HMO rules, Medicare 
reform and a host of other health items still lingering on the 
agenda. The president will frame the discussion in terms of 
cooperation, rather than confrontation, a departure from a series 
of speeches where he slammed the Republican tax cut plan as too 
expensive. Still, many of the health issues are politically 
charged, including Medicare and HMO rights, which Democrats hope 
will help them capture Congress next year.

	East Timor Intrudes on APEC Meeting  
</P>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Ahead of an emergency meeting on  
the East Timor crisis, the U.S. and other Pacific Rim governments 
pressured Indonesia today to end the violence or face international 
intervention. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Auckland 
for a regional free-trade forum and a meeting on the Indonesian 
crisis, said Jakarta has the responsibility to restore order in 
East Timor and see that its vote for independence last week is 
adhered to. East Timor's descent into terror following the 
referendum for independence overshadowed the annual meeting of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC, and stirred 
dissension among its 21 members.

	40 Dead in Greece Earthquake  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Rescue teams labored today to find and  
free survivors of an earthquake that rocked Athens, and engineers 
inspected hundreds of buildings to see if they were fit to house 
the thousands of people who fled their homes. Engineering crews 
began fanning out through Athens' hard-struck northern suburbs, the 
epicenter of yesterday's earthquake -- the most powerful to hit this 
sprawling city of more than 5 million in nearly a century. At least 
40 people, including several children, were killed by the 
magnitude-5.9 temblor that struck in the afternoon, the Health 
Ministry said.

	2 Die in Kosovo U.S. Sector Blast  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A series of late night explosions  
rocked the American sector of eastern Kosovo, killing two people 
and injuring four, one critically, NATO said today. Eight to 10 
blasts occurred late Tuesday near Donja Budriga village, three 
miles south of Gnjilane, according to Pfc. William Patterson of the 
U.S. military press office at Camp Bondsteel. He did not say 
whether the victims were Serbs or ethnic Albanians. Patterson said 
the critically injured victim was evacuated to an American military 
clinic near Urosevac.

	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Houses were burning just 40 yards from  
the besieged U.N. compound in Dili today, as Indonesian troops 
tightened their stranglehold on the complex in an attempt to force 
international officials to leave. Witnesses who ventured into the 
deserted city streets said Indonesian soldiers were ``looting 
everything in sight,'' carrying furniture out of abandoned houses 
and loading it onto trucks.

jubilant celebration of Moammar Gadhafi's 30 years in power, and of 
his return to the world stage after years of isolation. Flanked by 
more than two dozen African leaders, Gadhafi yesterday raised two 
arms in salute to his troops, pounded a clenched fist on the arm of 
his gilded chair as the military band played and craned his neck to 
watch fighter jets piloted by women officers flying low over the 
Mediterranean coast.

	CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico (AP) -- Maids swept water from hotel  
lobbies and tourists scurried across flooded streets as a tropical 
storm dumped heavy rain on this fishing resort at the tip of 
Mexico's Baja California peninsula before slipping out to sea. 
Greg, which was downgraded from hurricane status yesterday, forced 
hundreds of local people to flee their humble shacks of cardboard 
and plywood to spend a second night in emergency shelters. American 
vacationers grumbled over canceled flights and headed back to their 
hotels hoping to book passage home today.

innings -- but held the top five batters in the Yankees' order to 
three hits in 17 at-bats. David Cone dropped to 1-4 with a 4.22 ERA 
since his perfect game against Montreal on July 18.

	U.N. Delays Exit From East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- The United Nations heeded the pleas of  
East Timorese refugees today and delayed the evacuation of its 
mission to the Indonesian province, fearing the withdrawal could 
end in mass bloodshed. More than 2,000 people have crowded into the 
U.N. compound in Dili, the provincial capital. Many said 
pro-Indonesian militias would kill them if the U.N. workers left. 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the pullout of the remaining 
206 international officials and 167 East Timorese working for the 
world body would be delayed 24 hours. He also said he is trying to 
keep a small U.N. presence in the violence-torn province to protect 
innocent civilians.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Parliament today approved Prime Minister Ehud  
Barak's new peace deal with the Palestinians. Opposition leader 
Ariel Sharon warned that the accord endangered Israel's security. 
``It's an opening for endless bloodshed,'' he warned. Israel moved 
quickly to implement the agreement, authorizing the first release 
of Palestinians from Israeli jails tomorrow, a day ahead of 
schedule. After seven hours of debate, the peace agreement was 
approved by a vote of 54 to 23, with two abstentions. Under the 
accord, Israel will hand over 11 percent of the West Bank in three 
stages by Jan. 20.

	Quake Unites Greek, Turk Rescuers

	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greek and Turk rescuers found themselves  
working side-by-side today for the second time in less than a month 
despite the historical animosity between the two nations. The death 
toll from yesterday's earthquake in Athens rose above 60. A 
20-member Turkish team was the first foreign unit to reach the 
city's most battered areas. Turks had praised Greece for the quick 
and extensive help following the giant quake in Turkey on Aug. 17 
that claimed more than 15,000 lives. Their teamwork caused 
political leaders on both sides of the Aegean Sea to reassess their 
political positions. The two nations have nearly gone to war three 
times in the past 25 years over territorial disputes.

	Poll: Bush Lead Over Gore Widening

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A growing desire for change in the nation's  
leadership is making it tough for Democrat Al Gore to close the gap 
on Republican George W. Bush in a matchup of the two front-runners 
for their parties' presidential nominations, says a new poll. Bush 
had the support of 56 percent and Gore had the backing of 37 
percent in an ABC News-Washington Post poll out today. More than 
half of those surveyed, 53 percent, said they are tired of 
President Clinton. And almost that many, 48 percent, said Gore is 
too close to Clinton to provide a fresh start for the country.

	Bradley Spells Out Campaign Message

	CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill  
Bradley today held a fall kickoff rally staged to spell out a 
candidacy that has been under way for months. The former New Jersey 
senator told a crowd at his old high school that he feels ``an 
urgent need to seize this moment in history, to strengthen the weak 
and to challenge the strong to lead us into our full greatness as a 
nation.''

	Study: 19 Clicks Between Web Sites  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORk (AP) -- Any two randomly picked pages on the World Wide  
Web are on average just 19 clicks away from each other, researchers 
say. The findings, to be reported in tomorrow's issue of the 
journal Nature, suggest that the Web is so interconnected that any 
desired information is nearby even though there are 800 million 
documents available. Researchers constructed a robot that collected 
all the links on a Web page and followed them to their destination. 
The process was repeated over and over again. Using statistical 
tools, they figured out the average distance between two random 
pages. And even if the Web grows 1,000 percent, the distance would 
change only from 19 clicks to 21.

little changed while most stocks ended with modest losses. At the 
close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average 
was up 2.21 at 11,036.34. Losers on the New York Stock Exchange led 
gainers 1,785-1,185. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 28.52 at

	MONTREAL (AP) -- Todd Helton homered twice to reach 30 for the  
first time in his career and drove in three runs today to lead the 
Colorado Rockies over the Montreal Expos 5-1. A day after Rockies 
manager Jim Leyland confirmed he will retire following the season, 
Colorado dominated with the long ball. Larry Walker hit his 35th 
home run, going 2-for-3 to raise his league-leading batting average 
to .368.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Criticized GOP Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUREL, Del. (AP) -- Steve Forbes criticized the Republican tax  
cut, Washington's political culture and administration's commitment 
to the military, sounding themes Wednesday that impressed voters 
who nonetheless wondered whether he could win the GOP presidential 
nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The millionaire publisher also stressed his support for allowing  
prayer in school and posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The $792 billion, 10-year plan to cut taxes does not go far  
enough in offering tax relief and would mean only ``pennies on the 
dollar'' for most working people, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pennies, and Washington is tied up in knots,'' he said.  
``Washington is not connected to the people.'' He repeated his goal 
of scrapping the federal tax code and replacing it with a flat tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also criticized Vice President Gore, the Democratic  
front-runner, as part of the political structure in the nation's 
capital where promises are made but often not kept. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times, for example, have they said they're going to  
save Social Security?'' Forbes asked during a speech before about 
150 people. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Americans should have the choice of investing  
their Social Security dollars in private IRAs: ``After all, that 
money belongs to you, not Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said the current administration has been derelict in  
maintaining military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not just a military issue. It's a moral issue,''  
Forbes said. ``When some young person dons that uniform to serve 
this country, and then they are not given the tools they need, the 
spare parts, that's dereliction of duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his speech outlining proposals to overhaul health care,  
Social Security and the military, Forbes discussed school prayer 
and the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is easier, in many instances, to bring a copy of Hitler's  
'Mein Kampf' into a school than it is to bring in a Bible,'' Forbes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That mirrored what Forbes said in June after the House voted in  
favor of permitting the display of the Ten Commandments in hopes of 
ending some school violence. Democrats such as Gore and former Sen. 
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, also a presidential aspirant, have 
questioned the constitutionality of the amendment and its 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Harrington, 46, said she had not decided whether Forbes  
would get her vote in the state's Feb. 15 Republican caucus. She 
also was uncertain whether he could win the nomination, despite 
having a platform she liked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a tough battle for Forbes again,'' she said.  
``I don't know if its because of the way he comes across or not. 
It's a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes impressed Jack Lucia, 62, a retired school teacher. He  
liked the candidate's position on abortion. Forbes opposes it, but 
is willing to work toward a consensus that would restrict late-term 
procedures called ``partial birth'' abortions and make teen-agers 
get parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked what he said about staking out a common ground,''  
Lucia said. ``I can't say we're Forbes supporters, but we're 
certainly not against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At his state campaign headquarters in Wilmington later  
Wednesday, Forbes picked up the endorsements of two Republican 
state lawmakers: House Speaker Wayne Smith, and Sen. John Still.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Williams Undergoes MRI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams  
returned Wednesday to New York for an MRI on his sore left shoulder 
and missed the wrapup of a two-game series against the Kansas City 
Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The examination confirmed an earlier diagnosis of tendinitis in  
the shoulder. But the Yankees said Williams was expected to play 
Friday against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is hitting .344 with 22 home runs and 100 RBIs for the  
AL East leaders. He won the AL batting title last year for the 
World Series champions.

<HEADLINE> Coach Neuheisel Plans Huskies Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- If Bob Marley is blasting on the stadium  
speakers, Rick Neuheisel's team is probably warming up on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's no longer Colorado, where Neuheisel coached for four  
seasons. After taking the Washington job and its $1 million salary 
in January, he debuts with his new team Thursday night against 
Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did in Boulder, Neuheisel takes over a nationally  
prominent program. In Seattle, he is expected to revive a team that 
struggled to a 6-6 record in the last of Jim Lambright's six 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies say so far, so good.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shock to lose your coach but we have a big personality  
in Rick Neuheisel,'' said receiver Dane Looker. ``He's exciting and 
charismatic. He makes playing in this program an enjoyable 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No question the Huskies are having fun. Neuheisel plays Marley  
tunes for stretching exercises before practice, and he awards 
popsicles or candy bars to the top performers afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Neuheisel seems tired of talking about his laid-back  
approach, which at Colorado, sometimes meant taking the team skiing 
or whitewater rafting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have music on during stretching, but I think that if  
you've been in any weight room or Jazzercise class in the country 
they have music on all the time,'' he said. ``I don't think that's 
a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel also has grown weary of talking about his return to  
the Pac-10. As quarterback at UCLA, he was MVP of the 1984 Rose 
Bowl after leading the Bruins to a 45-9 victory over Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he talks about BYU, which has lost four straight to  
Washington. Last year, the Huskies won 20-10 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very excited to be going into a nationally televised  
game of this magnitude,'' Neuheisel said. ``We have a tall order in 
front of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BYU staff has picked the brain of defensive back Elan  
Edwards, a standout at Boulder High School, who played his freshman 
season at Colorado before transferring to Provo. 
</P>
<P>
	BYU coach LaVell Edwards said the Cougars also have studied  
Colorado films from last season but he's unsure how the schemes 
will look with different players executing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did get some access to Colorado film but Rick has different  
coordinators on both sides of the ball now,'' Edwards said. ``I 
don't know if that will be a big advantage for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cougars are expected to unveil a new shotgun offense.  
Edwards hopes it will better utilize quarterback Kevin Feterik and 
return BYU to its pass-happy past. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an outfit that knows how to throw the ball,''  
Neuheisel said. ``I would say that it will look like a track meet 
on Thursday night if we're not ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides a new coach at Washington and a new system at BYU, both  
teams literally have a new look. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cougars have new uniforms: dark blue replaced royal blue,  
and tan accents were added. The Huskies dumped the purple helmets 
of Lambright's era in favor of gold helmets worn for decades 
before.

<HEADLINE>  El Guerrouj Breaks 2,000 Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN, Germany (AP) -- Hicham El Guerrouj has a goal of breaking  
all world records between 1,500 and 5,000 meters. He's now another 
step toward achieving that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan, who already owns the mile and 1,500 records, ran  
all alone for the last two laps of a 2,000-meter race Tuesday, and 
his time of 4 minutes, 44.79 seconds eclipsed by more than 3 
seconds the 4:47.88 set by Algeria's Noureddine Morceli in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan's record in the rarely run event highlighted the  
meet, along with Wilson Kipketer of Denmark and Romania's Gabriela 
Szabo splitting a $1 million jackpot for going unbeaten in all 
seven Golden League meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, the Kenyan-born Dane completing a remarkable comeback  
from malaria, easily won the 800 in 1:44.04, while Szabo won the 
women's 5,000 in a year's best of 14:40.61. 
</P>
<P>
	The first person to greet and hug Kipketer, who spent most of  
last year sidelined by his illness, was Szabo when he crossed the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely hard getting over the sickness, but this  
year has gone well,'' Kipketer said. ``I don't know what I will do 
with the money -- maybe pay my training costs. But it's been my goal 
all year to win the jackpot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The diminutive Szabo, whose prowess in the middle distances  
includes an Olympic silver in the 1,500, sprinted away from a pack 
of four runners on the final curve to win going away. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo, who had said she wanted to break her own European record  
set last year, said the cheering crowd of 30,000 spurred her on to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't disappointed at being 9 seconds off her European  
record of 14:31.48. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great race. I felt how much the fantastic audience  
pulled me to the win. That was the secret. It was purely 
psychological,'' said Szabo, admitting to fatigue as the long track 
season winds to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet boasted 18 gold medalists from the recent world  
championships, including Maurice Greene, who took the 200 in a 
relatively slow 20.21 seconds. Neither Michael Johnson nor world 
championships silver medalist Frankie Fredericks were entered to 
push him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted a win -- the time wasn't important,'' said  
Greene, the 100 world record-holder, ``I'm just preparing to win 
the 100 and 200 next year at the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Ali Ezzine, the bronze medalist at the worlds,  
outsprinted Bernard Barmasi of Kenya after the last hurdle to win 
the 3,000 steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first loss for Barmasi in the Golden League, but he  
had already been disqualified from the jackpot after allegedly 
telling a fellow Kenyan to let him win a race in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruny Surin breezed to victory in the 100 in 10.07, well off his  
9.84 recorded this season. American Tony McCall was second in 
10.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wade beat fellow American Mark Crear in the 110 hurdles,  
leading all the way and winning by .03 seconds in 13.27.

<HEADLINE> Gore a Man of Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steam rose off the horses on a cold winter's  
day as a band of hippies and a knot of old-time preachers packed 
into a Tennessee barn where heat shimmered from a drum of 
smoldering wood. 
</P>
<P>
	Cub reporter Al Gore shivered near the back, taking it all in --  
this odd gathering organized by a commune called the Farm. The idea 
was to show locals that their new neighbors, just in from 
whacked-out San Francisco, were not wild revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There had been some badmouthing going around,'' recalls Al  
Bates, one of the long-haired types. ``We invited the preachers to 
come in and thump the Bible for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was a quiet observer that day in 1972 but his story in The  
Tennessean had an impact. Sensitive, touched with humor, written 
with a tone suggesting the new need not be feared, it helped turn 
culture shock into something more comfortable for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understood we were trying to live simply and nonviolently  
and not make trouble,'' says Bates, now director of the Farm's 
Ecovillage Training Center and still a stranger to a haircut. 
``That was a turning point for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Years later people in all stations of life -- constituent,  
inventor, bureaucrat, business consultant, world leader -- have been 
touched and sometimes bowled over by Gore's inquisitive, grasping 
mind, his affability and charm. 
</P>
<P>
	So, too, are they confounded by the other side of Gore, the  
unreachable, mechanical side that appears at the worst moments, 
when he most needs to make the human connection he will have to 
make to become president. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see him close down,'' says Bates, who became Gore's  
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore,'' he ventures brightly, ``is by no means a hippie.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Relax! Relax! he's told. If Gore hasn't heard that all his life  
-- and even schoolmates remember thinking it -- he's heard it enough 
for one lifetime. The theme is a drumbeat: To see Gore at his best 
you must see him in private. 
</P>
<P>
	You must look at his childhood as the dutiful son of a  
strong-willed senator, at his own Senate career marked by 
diligence, at a married life where the smiles, winks and flirts 
that flash between husband and wife are not fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	It is on one hand a daunting political problem -- Americans don't  
see him in private. On the other hand, it may be effective if 
voters are convinced of the truth of it, and if they come to think: 
Better to have that sort of man than a public charmer and something 
else in private. 
</P>
<P>
	Because in private Gore is, chief among many things, the father  
of four and husband of Tipper, no small matter after President 
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	By virtue of his seven years as Clinton's vice president, Albert  
Gore Jr., 51, is among the best known of the vaguely known figures 
in American life. 
</P>
<P>
	He was back from the rubble of a 1988 candidacy for the  
Democratic nomination, making a name for himself as a senator and 
environmentalist and resolving to spend more family time after his 
son was struck by a car and nearly killed, when Clinton asked him 
to be his running mate. 
</P>
<P>
	Two good-looking guys with smart, accomplished wives and  
forward-sounding ideas gave the nation its first baby boomer 
campaign. Bill and Al's Excellent Adventure, someone dubbed their 
spirited bus tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's Gore's adventure, his own shoals, and there's no  
pumping up the river to help him through it, as they did for his 
canoe in an ill-fated New Hampshire campaign trip. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Management specialist Warren Bennis, whose book ``On Becoming a  
Leader'' is a Gore favorite, remembers their introductory meeting 
at a beach cafe near Santa Monica, Calif., after the senator 
returned from the 1992 environmental summit in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was full of policy fire. Digging out maps showing  
deforestation, he riffed for three hours on the environment, aging, 
national security, whatever came into his head. He listened 
sharply, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was floored,'' Bennis says. ``I felt he had the future in  
his bones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's environmental book ``Earth in the Balance'' was in small  
part about his own equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
	In it he ruminates about authenticity and artifice, recognizing  
both are part of his political life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voice modulation, ten-second 'sound bites,' catchy slogans,  
quotable quotes, newsworthy angles, interest group buzzwords ... 
relaxation for effect, emotion on cue -- these are the forms of 
modern politics,'' he wrote. ``Has everyone been forced to become 
an actor?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year a columnist saw him faking applause, going through the  
motions with great enthusiasm but stopping short of contact so as 
not to make a loud sound in a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's loyalty as vice president (a few years into his job he  
said he had never encountered a situation he could have handled 
better than Clinton) is a quality evident from his childhood 
growing up in a Washington hotel suite with summers in rural 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to do what we wanted him to do,'' his mother Pauline  
once said, calling him ``fairly much a conformist.'' A teacher 
commented that Gore was so mature beyond his years that it seemed 
an adult was talking to her in the classroom. In later years, some 
classmates found him preachy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al is frighteningly good at many things,'' observed his 1965  
yearbook at exclusive St. Albans prep school before he embarked for 
Harvard. ``It probably won't be long before Al reaches the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore had an odd upbringing, part farm, much city, a wagon load  
of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's power-brokers swept through the Fairfax Hotel suite  
when his parents weren't out socializing or attending to political 
business. On school breaks he toiled at the Tennessee family farm, 
sometimes living weeks at a time with the people managing the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Then as now, Gore did not march in complete lockstep with those  
in authority over him and he worked to carve out his own niche. 
When Gore was picked by Clinton as his running mate, he gently took 
issue with his flamboyant father's assertion that ``We raised him 
for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he saw it, he came to politics on his own terms and despite  
intending to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
	After Harvard, he went to Vietnam as an Army reporter, enlisting  
in a war both he and his father -- the late Albert Sr. -- opposed. He 
was aware that ducking Vietnam could hurt his father's reelection -- 
his dad lost in any event. And he said that if he had not gone, he 
couldn't have faced his peers on the streets of Carthage, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	He smoked marijuana on multiple occasions, like so many of his  
generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon his return from Vietnam, Gore enrolled in divinity school  
and landed a job at the paper in Nashville. But those were way 
stations and when a House seat opened, he went for it and in 1976 
was elected to his first term. 
</P>
<P>
	With Washington under the post-Watergate spell of muckrakers,  
Gore turned his journalist's eye to political ends. 
</P>
<P>
	He began a variety of one-man investigations, attacking sham  
insurance for the elderly, investigating the long-term effects of 
radiation on veterans of atomic testing, probing influence-peddling 
in the contact lens industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Science and technology became his forte, in the House and after  
he won election to the Senate in 1984. Gore pushed federal policy 
forward on supercomputers and information networks connected by 
computer, leading to his exaggerated claim this year that he had 
invented the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	His son Albert's accident in 1989 prompted a flood of  
self-examination, Gore turning his searching mind on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Family therapy accompanied the boy's physical recovery -- now 16,  
he is the youngest child and the only boy -- and Gore sought the 
counsel of philosophers and psychologists in what became a 
flowering examination of childhood and how families get along. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he made the personal political. Albert's recovery was  
likened to the Democratic Party's revival in one speech. In his 
address to the 1996 Democratic National Convention, he talked about 
his sister's 1984 death from lung cancer, moving some to tears and 
others to shake their heads at the jarring, maudlin tone. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennis, the management consultant from California, asks: ``Can  
you fake authenticity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he offers what has become a refrain from those who advise  
or just like the man: ''Let Gore be Gore.''

<HEADLINE>  El Guerrouj Breaks 2,000 Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN, Germany (AP) -- Hicham El Guerrouj has a goal of breaking  
all world records between 1,500 and 5,000 meters. He's now another 
step toward achieving that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan, who already owns the mile and 1,500 records, ran  
all alone for the last two laps of a 2,000-meter race Tuesday, and 
his time of 4 minutes, 44.79 seconds eclipsed by more than 3 
seconds the 4:47.88 set by Algeria's Noureddine Morceli in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan's record in the rarely run event highlighted the  
meet, along with Wilson Kipketer of Denmark and Romania's Gabriela 
Szabo splitting a $1 million jackpot for going unbeaten in all 
seven Golden League meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, the Kenyan-born Dane completing a remarkable comeback  
from malaria, easily won the 800 in 1:44.04, while Szabo won the 
women's 5,000 in a year's best of 14:40.61. 
</P>
<P>
	The first person to greet and hug Kipketer, who spent most of  
last year sidelined by his illness, was Szabo when he crossed the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely hard getting over the sickness, but this  
year has gone well,'' Kipketer said. ``I don't know what I will do 
with the money -- maybe pay my training costs. But it's been my goal 
all year to win the jackpot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The diminutive Szabo, whose prowess in the middle distances  
includes an Olympic silver in the 1,500, sprinted away from a pack 
of four runners on the final curve to win going away. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo, who had said she wanted to break her own European record  
set last year, said the cheering crowd of 30,000 spurred her on to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't disappointed at being 9 seconds off her European  
record of 14:31.48. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great race. I felt how much the fantastic audience  
pulled me to the win. That was the secret. It was purely 
psychological,'' said Szabo, admitting to fatigue as the long track 
season winds to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet boasted 18 gold medalists from the recent world  
championships, including Maurice Greene, who took the 200 in a 
relatively slow 20.21 seconds. Neither Michael Johnson nor world 
championships silver medalist Frankie Fredericks were entered to 
push him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted a win -- the time wasn't important,'' said  
Greene, the 100 world record-holder, ``I'm just preparing to win 
the 100 and 200 next year at the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Ali Ezzine, the bronze medalist at the worlds,  
outsprinted Bernard Barmasi of Kenya after the last hurdle to win 
the 3,000 steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first loss for Barmasi in the Golden League, but he  
had already been disqualified from the jackpot after allegedly 
telling a fellow Kenyan to let him win a race in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruny Surin breezed to victory in the 100 in 10.07, well off his  
9.84 recorded this season. American Tony McCall was second in 
10.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wade beat fellow American Mark Crear in the 110 hurdles,  
leading all the way and winning by .03 seconds in 13.27.

<HEADLINE> 'Stand Down' Ordered at DOE Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on  
Wednesday ordered a one day safety ``stand down'' at the agency's 
cleanup site in Paducah after a review found room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's decision to suspend the department's operations  
followed the completion last week of an initial visit to the 
Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant by the agency's environment, safety 
and health team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-member team, which arrived Aug. 17, reviewed documents,  
conducted interviews, inspected the site and gathered environmental 
samples. It will submit an initial report to Richardson by the end 
of September. 
</P>
<P>
	The team didn't uncover any imminent hazards to the plant's  
workers or the general public but found some room for improvement 
in radiological protection, procedures and conduct of operations, 
the DOE said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``While significant improvements have been made over the last  
several years, this stand down affords us the opportunity to 
further build upon existing safety programs,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The DOE investigation follows the recent revelation of a federal  
whistle-blower lawsuit filed by three plant employees, which 
alleges that plant workers were unknowingly exposed to plutonium 
for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	All DOE-related operations, except for emergency-related  
activities, will be suspended while employees and managers of the 
agency and of Bechtel Jacobs, the contractor hired by the DOE to 
clean up the site, review safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension of DOE activities at the plant site won't  
directly affect operations of U.S. Enrichment Corp., which uses the 
plant to enrich uranium for use as fuel in nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out safety staff will ensure that all areas of known on-site  
radiological and chemical contamination are properly posted and 
that barriers and procedures are in place to prevent inadvertent 
entry,'' said Jimmie Hodges, DOE's site manager in Paducah. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also will remind workers of the presence of plutonium  
and other highly toxic and radioactive contaminants at the site, 
Hodges said. Plutonium has been linked to leukemia and other forms 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	DOE operations at the cleanup site will resume Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> France Petroleum Co. Profit Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French petroleum company Total Fina said Wednesday  
its net profit fell 16 percent during the first half, but the 
company predicted a recent rise in oil prices will boost results 
for the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina, the product of Total's merger earlier this year with  
Belgium's Petrafina, reported its net profit dipped to the 
equivalent of $788 million from $935 million for the same period a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues slipped 2.9 percent to $18.68 billion from $19.23  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Total Fina launched an all-stock offer for rival Elf  
Aquitaine, which Elf rejected as hostile despite its backing by the 
French government. Weeks later, Elf turned the tables, announcing 
its own bid for Total Fina. The offers are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina said a merger with rival Elf Aquitaine would boost  
profits by more than 20 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Total Fina fell 43 3/4 cents to $66.06 1/4 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Open a Ryder Cup Primer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- For players like Justin Leonard, Mark  
O'Meara, Hal Sutton and Jim Furyk, the Canadian Open represents a 
final chance to sharpen their game for the Ryder Cup in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	They also share something else in common -- the third-oldest  
national open, which starts Thursday at Glen Abbey Golf Club, is 
another opportunity for them to win for the first time this year on 
the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	They are among nine Americans who have done well enough to make  
the Ryder Cup team, but not well enough to cash a first-place 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	None seems particularly troubled, or feel any sense of urgency  
to go into the Sept. 24-26 matches at The Country Club at 
Brookline, Mass., with a victory on their '99 resume. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing as well as I did last year,'' said Sutton, coming  
off his first multiple-win season in 12 years. ``Having been there 
before, I know I'm playing well enough to make a contribution to 
the team. Just because I haven't won a tournament this year I 
shouldn't be questioning myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard has gone longer than any qualifier without winning. His  
last victory was The Players Championship a year ago, a span of 41 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Sutton, he is far from concerned. Leonard notes that while  
only three U.S. Ryder Cup players have won on tour this year, Tiger 
Woods, David Duval and Jeff Maggert account for 10 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my goals this year was to play more consistently, and I  
felt like I've done that,'' Leonard said. ``I've had a couple of 
good chances. Probably the only disappointment is not winning. But 
I've got some tournaments left, and I feel like I'm doing the 
rights things with my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard was in the three-way playoff at the British Open, then  
finished third the next week at Hartford. Sutton has been on the 
verge of winning a couple of times this year, most notably at the 
Houston Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III was the runner-up at the Masters, Phil Mickelson  
a runner-up at the U.S. Open and at the NEC Invitational two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are going to win, and I would suspect that two or  
three of us win by the end of the year,'' Leonard said of the nine 
U.S. Ryder Cup players who have yet to win this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Four have a chance to win by the end of the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Sutton was three strokes out of the lead and wound up in a tie  
for fourth in the Canadian Open last year, when Billy Andrade won 
in a playoff over Bob Friend. Leonard was only three out of the 
lead in 1997 and tied for sixth last year. 
</P>
<P>
	And as much as O'Meara has struggled the past five months, he  
gets good vibes when he returns to the Abbey, where he won the 
Canadian Open in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting to hit the ball a little better,'' O'Meara said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone has the Ryder Cup on their mind.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrade dearly wanted to make his first team -- especially with  
the matches being played in his native New England -- after winning 
the Canadian last year. But his game deserted him after the Masters 
and he's just now starting to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to successfully defend the Canadian Open was Jim  
Ferrier in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	A tougher chore could await the biggest star in the field -- Mike  
Weir, the 29-year-old from nearby Bright's Grove who last week 
became the first Canadian in 45 years to win a PGA Tour event on 
home soil in the Air Canada Championship at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would equate that to myself being able to win a tournament  
in Texas, where I was born and raised,'' Leonard said. ``Obviously, 
Canada covers a little more territory and there's a few more 
people. But I can imagine what a thrill that was for him. You would 
think he was related to everybody out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weir never has played well in his national open, having missed  
the cut in his previous seven tries. Then again, he has never felt 
as confident as he does now, and the Abbey may look a little 
kinder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel much more confident with the way I'm driving the ball,  
which you have to do at Glen Abbey,'' Weir said. ``I hope I'll play 
much better than I have in the past.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Spells Out Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Bill Bradley, walking the small-town  
haunts of his boyhood, decried the current day's politics of 
``trifling things'' and asked Americans to follow him toward bigger 
dreams. ``We need a new kind of leadership,'' he declared 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a fall kickoff rally for a presidential campaign that has  
been underway for months, Bradley sought to offer Democrats a 
reason for choosing him over Vice President Al Gore despite an 
economy that has soared during his rival's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed to traditional Democratic sympathies for the  
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need in America is a deeper prosperity,'' Bradley  
argued from the steps of his old high school in this one stoplight 
Mississippi River hamlet. He lamented that one in five children 
live in poverty, and 45 million Americans lack health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Government should not do ``trifling things much of the time for  
some people, but it should be doing some large and essential things 
all of the time for the whole nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stricter gun control, campaign finance reforms, universal health  
insurance and the eradication of child poverty made his list of 
big, essential goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do fewer things, but they will be essential things and  
we will do them more thoroughly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After months of low-profile campaigning, Bradley staged this  
mom-and-apple-pie-event with hopes of more broadly introducing 
himself and what he called the ``small-town boy'' ethos he brings 
to politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Handsewn bicentennial flags were retrieved from the library's  
storage to festoon the oaks along Mississippi Avenue. Sno-cones 
from the elementary school PTA and 5,000 of the local ladies' 
home-baked snickerdoodles, oatmeal clusters and chocolate chip 
cookies stood in for apple pie to complete Bradley's vision of 
perfect Americana. 
</P>
<P>
	He came home buoyed by a weekend poll that showed that he and  
Gore were running neck and neck in New Hampshire, the first primary 
state. But he still has to overcome surveys suggesting he remains 
relatively unknown nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Even here, Kim Casey said she knew little of Bradley, having  
moved to Crystal City from St. Louis three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning the sno-cone table, Casey, a 35-year-old mother and  
grocery clerk, said she was nonetheless sure Bradley would ``set 
the country's standards to where we come from -- family values, 
where everybody sticks together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 35-minute address delivered in a level voice with the  
help of a TelePrompTer, the former New Jersey senator struck themes 
commonly heard from Gore's critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more interested in leadership than polls and politics,''  
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew approving nods and whistles when, in an apparent  
contrast with Gore and Republican front-runner George W. Bush, he 
noted that he grew up ``without a famous family name or great 
wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The adoring hometown crowd stood to applaud Bradley's promise of  
``a new kind of leadership -- a leadership that puts the people 
front and center, not the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Clinton-Gore administration unbudgingly faced off with  
congressional Republicans this week over tax cuts, Bradley also 
sounded a bipartisan note. 
</P>
<P>
	His late father was a Republican, Bradley said with a sly grin,  
but worked with town Democrats to build the high school in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do big jobs again, if we do them together,'' Bradley  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An only child, he remembered his late schoolteacher mother  
organizing youth dances in the family basement and added, with an 
apologetic nod to his wife, Ernestine, ``I still can't get beyond 
the same awkward two-step she taught in our living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradleys' 22-year-old daughter, Theresa Anne, is a college  
student and studying overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley proved his financial viability in the first half of this  
year by amassing some $12 million in campaign donations to Gore's 
$18 million. Now, Bradley hopes to use detailed policy 
announcements -- on child poverty, universal health care, the 
economy and foreign policy -- to overcome other surveys suggesting 
that he remains relatively unknown nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Washington Post-ABC poll put Bradley far behind Gore, 29  
percent to 64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	News cameras from London and Tokyo news outlets were among those  
in the high school gymnasium as a lineup of Bradley's aunt, 
second-grade music teacher, Little League teammate and others 
dished up an affectionate version of the old game show ``This is 
Your Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The candidate was also leading reporters on a twilight tour of  
his life's landmarks: the old State Bank where his father, the 
president, weathered the Great Depression without foreclosing on a 
single homeowner; the weeded-over lot where the Pittsburgh Plate 
Glass factory shut down the town's lifeblood when it closed in 
1992; the Little League field where Bradley's integrated team 
learned to resist the racial discrimination of visiting teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, this is where the world of possibility and hope all  
began,'' Bradley said, ``a world I want to open for all 
Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Danford To Head Waco Standoff Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Republican Sen. John Danforth of  
Missouri today accepted Attorney General Janet Reno's offer to head 
an independent inquiry into the fiery end of the FBI's standoff 
with the Branch Davidian cult. The Senate's top Republican, 
meanwhile, said he now has doubts about who started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are doubts because questions have been raised,'' Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am beginning to think that the attorney general should  
resign,'' added the Mississippi senator, a frequent critic of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurrying to Reno's defense, Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of  
South Dakota said she ``deserves commendation rather than 
criticism,'' and that ``under no circumstances'' should she resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange came during final talks between the Justice  
Department and Danforth over the details of the independent inquiry 
and an announcement could come as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials who spoke with the Justice Department  
Tuesday said they understood Danforth was willing to take the job. 
According to government lawyers and congressional officials, the 
Justice Department was considering appointing a second person to 
assist Danforth in the investigation and help to manage the 
day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, 63, would bring solid Republican credentials as well  
as a background in law enforcement. Before entering the Senate, he 
served as attorney general in Missouri for eight years. He retired 
from the Senate in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth also is an Episcopal priest, and both admirers and  
detractors have noted his moral integrity and his stubborn 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not return a call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Final touches were being put on the scope and nature of the  
investigation, said the sources, who include Republicans on Capitol 
Hill who had discussions Tuesday with Justice Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's decision comes as congressional Republicans have  
increased pressure on her and on FBI Director Louis Freeh to 
explain how evidence about the siege, including videotapes, was 
withheld from the public for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican lawmakers want to know whether the FBI lied  
about using incendiary tear gas canisters during the final raid on 
the compound on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reported today that Texas Rangers had  
found flares that were apparently fired by federal officials. The 
newspaper said the Rangers discovered the expended military 
illumination flares amid tons of evidence recovered Friday from a 
storage facility near Waco. Evidence logs showed more flares were 
recovered in the weeks after the Davidian compound burned following 
the FBI siege. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 sect members died, some of them children, in a fire  
that the government contends was set by sect members. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the committees looking into the raid has found evidence  
that the government was responsible for starting the fire, 
according to several aides familiar with the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP-led committees in Congress have begun  
reinvestigating the Waco matter. Democrats on Capitol Hill have 
asked the GOP to let the independent investigation sought by Reno 
take place before congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are recent revelations by the FBI that it fired several  
potentially flammable tear gas canisters at a storm shelter near 
the main Branch Davidian building hours before the main building 
went up in flames. The FBI and the Justice Department had 
previously denied use of any incendiary devices, and investigations 
will focus on whether this misinformation was the result of a 
bureaucratic slip-up or a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department insists there is no change in conclusions  
that it was David Koresh and his followers who started the fatal 
fire. The department also stresses that military special operations 
officers were on the scene only as observers and advisers, and not 
in an illegal capacity as participants in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have used the revelations to attack the credibility  
of Reno and the Justice Department. The White House has stood 
behind Reno, but President Clinton has declined to give a similar 
vote of confidence to Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know Danforth say he would bring instant credibility  
to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He calls them like he sees them,'' former Sen. Thomas  
Eagleton, a Missouri Democrat who served 10 years with Danforth, 
has said. ``Members of the Senate or House will have full faith in 
his finding.''

<HEADLINE> Jane Clayson To Co-Host News Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jane Clayson has won the opportunity to get up  
really, really early. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old ABC correspondent has been named as Bryant  
Gumbel's co-host on CBS' new morning news broadcast, ``The Early 
Show,'' the network said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meeting Bryant was like seeing an old friend,'' Clayson said  
at a news conference. ``We just clicked. We really liked each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network's search for Gumbel's partner took most of the  
summer and was so closely watched that it was dubbed ``Operation 
Glass Slipper'' within the television industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will debut Nov. 1 from a storefront studio CBS is  
constructing across from Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayson has reported for ``World News Tonight'' and other ABC

<HEADLINE> Chiefs' Corner Absent from Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City Chiefs cornerback James  
Hasty, a former Pro Bowl player, was absent from practice 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has some personal issues he is addressing,'' Chiefs coach  
Gunther Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasty practiced Monday and the team took Tuesday off.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither Cunningham nor Ken Kremer, one of Hasty's agents, know  
when Hasty would return to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was caught off guard by this just like everyone else,''  
Kremer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasty has missed only two games in 11 seasons and only one since  
joining the Chiefs in 1995. He is in the second year of a four-year 
contract that pays a base salary of $1.5 million for 1999, plus 
another $200,000 in roster bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasty spoke about commitment and quitting last week during the  
Chiefs' preseason team banquet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about trying to win this thing,'' he said. ``That's  
what it's all about. It's a travesty that we have one championship 
in this city. One. With the great players who have come through 
here ... it's time to stop all the (fooling around). We've got to 
go play football. And pretenders have to leave the room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Kansas City worked out rookie defensive back Andre  
Dixon, who was signed by Green Bay as an undrafted free agent but 
released in the final roster cutdown. The Chiefs also began talks 
with veteran Merton Hanks, the NFC's starter at free safety in four 
of the past five Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanks spent his first three NFL seasons as a cornerback. His  
agent, Leigh Steinberg, said he held preliminary talks with Kansas 
City on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect those talks would continue tomorrow,''  
Steinberg said.

<HEADLINE> Embezzler Sentenced to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An insurance claims supervisor who embezzled  
millions of dollars to support a double life in the exclusive world 
of show horses was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in federal prison 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Shaw, a 46-year-old woman described by co-workers as  
awkward, said the lure of the show-horse culture was so strong she 
could not stop herself from stealing to remain a part of it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Around the horse industry, I felt like a human being,'' Ms.  
Shaw said, reading from note cards prior to sentencing. ``I was 
never into it for the social status. It was an inner feeling of 
peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shaw told the court she never intended to steal so much. Her  
embezzlement ``just got totally out of control.'' Once she had the 
horses, she kept stealing to care for them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Paducah, Ky., Ms. Shaw worked for 21 years at New  
England Financial as a $30,000-a-year claims processor. She shared 
a tiny rental cottage with her mother in Marshfield, a shoreline 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	To enter the glamorous sphere of the horsey set, Ms. Shaw cashed  
fraudulent checks made out in the names of fictitious policy 
holders. By the mid-1990s she was taking as much as $730,000 a year 
and buying show horses. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving her statement, Ms. Shaw was sentenced and ordered  
to pay restitution of about $418,000. Although prosecutors said she 
stole $3.3 million, restitution laws prevent the government from 
recovering the full amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shaw, who pleaded guilty in May, asked the judge for a  
sentence of two years.

<HEADLINE> 2 Arkansas Murderers Executed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VARNER, Ark. (AP) -- Two Arkansas men were put to death Wednesday  
night, one who killed a father, mother and their daughter, and 
another who killed his son and brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Gardner, 43, was executed by injection shortly after 8 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
	``Blessed ... are those who are called to the Lord's supper, a  
never-ending feast awaits me,'' Gardner said when asked if he had 
any last words. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner killed Joe and Martha Joyce and their adult daughter,  
Sara McCurdy, in Fort Smith in 1985. Mrs. McCurdy was also raped. 
</P>
<P>
	His execution was followed less than two hours later by that of  
Alan Willett, 52, who killed his 13-year-old son and his brother in 
1993. Willett's brother was mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II and Andrew J. McDonald, the Roman Catholic  
bishop of Little Rock, sent letters to Gov. Mike Huckabee asking 
him to spare the men's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Wednesday, there had been 19 executions in Arkansas  
since the state resumed the death penalty in 1990.

<HEADLINE>  Israel OKs Troop Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Cabinet today overwhelmingly approved  
an Israeli troop redeployment in 7 percent of the West Bank, the 
first stage of a new land-for-security agreement between Israel and 
the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Ehud Barak said the decision to hand over parts  
of the biblical Land of Israel was not made easily, but that it was 
in Israel's best interest to move toward comprehensive peace 
agreements with its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are parting from areas that are precious to all of us,''  
Barak said in a statement. ``We walked the land, we learned about 
its place in our history, we fought for it and we developed a 
connection to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cabinet ministers voted 17-1, with one abstention, to  
approve the maps outlining the redeployment. Four ministers of the 
religious Shas party were absent because of a dispute with Barak 
over government funding for Shas schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The land to be transferred from sole Israeli to joint  
Israeli-Palestinian control is located south of the West Bank's 
largest city, Nablus, and close to the Palestinians' commercial 
center, the city of Ramallah. 
</P>
<P>
	The redeployment is expected to be completed by Monday, the day  
set for the festive launch of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a 
final peace agreement. As part of the first stage of the agreement, 
Israel also pledged to release 200 Palestinians held for 
anti-Israeli activity. The releases were expected by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Cabinet vote, the redeployment maps were presented to  
legislators in Israel's parliament, which was to ratify the 
agreement later today. Legislators were expected to approve the 
agreement, a revision of last year's U.S.-brokered Wye accord, by a 
large margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Israel will hand over another 11 percent of  
the West Bank now under its exclusive control to the Palestinian 
Authority. By the end of the three pullbacks, on Jan. 20, the 
Palestinians will control just over 40 percent of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Tax Court Rules Against Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clothing retailer The Limited Inc. owes taxes  
on $174.1 million stemming from transactions between a foreign 
subsidiary and another entity created to handle the chain's credit 
cards, a federal court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Tax Court ruling Tuesday marks a victory for the  
Internal Revenue Service, which issued notices of tax deficiency to 
The Limited over the transactions for the 1992 and 1993 tax years. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved a subsidiary called World Financial Network  
National Bank, organized by The Limited in 1989 to handle its 
credit card business, thus avoiding a patchwork of 50 state laws. 
The Limited, based in Columbus, Ohio, operates some 5,000 stores 
including Limited, Express, Lane Bryant, Structure and Lerner New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the subsidiary sold eight certificates of deposit to  
another subsidiary of The Limited, a Netherlands Antilles-based 
entity called MFE N.V. Those CDs were worth $174 million; the money 
was used to reduce a line of credit within yet another Limited 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS contended that this arrangement avoided income taxes on  
U.S.-controlled foreign subsidiaries because, in effect, it was a 
dividend paid from one part of the company to another. The Tax 
Court agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	In its decision, the court found that ``the principle purpose''  
for the transaction was to ``avoid the application'' of these 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Limited had argued that the tax did not apply  
because of an exemption that applies to banks, including the World 
Financial Network it had organized to handle the store credit 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tax Court, however, ruled that the institution was too  
specialized to fit the law's definition of a bank and is ``not of 
much use to a foreign business customer except as the issuer of a 
private label credit card or as the recipient of large deposits of 
funds that are not needed immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call Tuesday evening seeking comment from The  
Limited was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the IRS won a Tax Court decision against the United  
Parcel Service in a case involving a Bermuda company set up by UPS 
that the government insisted was to avoid income taxes. UPS is 
mulling an appeal of that ruling, which could cost it hundreds of 
millions of dollars in back taxes, penalties and interest.

<HEADLINE> Rabbi Pleads To Lesser Drug Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A rabbi once honored as ``Rabbi of the  
Year'' by his colleagues admitted smuggling illegal items into a 
federal prison, though he denied intentionally carrying contraband 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Gottesman, 74, of Ogdensburg agreed to plead guilty Tuesday  
to conspiracy to defraud the government by bringing in items such 
as Stars of David, clothing, watches and food. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Gottesman tried to smuggle a shampoo bottle  
filled with cocaine and marijuana encased in balloons into the 
medium-security lockup at Ray Brook in the Adirondack Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Gottesman insisted he knew nothing about drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bottle was sent to me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He was originally charged with attempting to provide contraband  
and could have been sentenced up to 20 years in prison and fined 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	If U.S. District Judge Thomas McAvoy accepts the plea agreement,  
Gottesman would be sentenced Jan. 5 to a year in prison or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Gottesman, honored as ``Rabbi of the Year'' in 1987 by the New  
York Board of Rabbis, had worked as a contract employee at Ray 
Brook since 1991. Government employees are not supposed to bring 
anything into a prison, his lawyer, Brian Premo, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rabbi's contract was terminated after his arrest in October.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Blamed for Traffic Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airlines contributed to this summer's spate of  
air traffic delays by scheduling too many flights during peak 
travel times, air traffic controllers contended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Such overscheduling guaranteed delays at popular airports even  
before accounting for bad weather, controllers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like trying to cram 10 pounds of sand into a five-pound  
bag,'' said Randy Schwitz, executive vice president of the National 
Air Traffic Controllers Association, the nation's largest 
controller union. ``If airlines continue to overbook runways, the 
passengers will continue to wait unnecessarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines said the controllers were merely trying to protect  
their system. In recent months, airlines blamed a 34 percent 
increase in delays on the Federal Aviation Administration, saying 
it has an inadequate air traffic control system and dated 
flight-control practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market sets the demand for air travel: It's high when  
people want to fly,'' said David Fuscus, spokesman for the Air 
Transport Association, which represents the nation's major 
carriers. ``It's time the controllers started looking at how they 
can meet the public's needs, instead of trying to place blame where 
it doesn't belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controllers cited airport flight log information to back  
their claims. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Thursday, July 29, airlines scheduled 57 takeoffs and  
landings during a 10-minute period around 6 p.m. at the Dallas/Fort 
Worth airport. The field's capacity was 35 operations -- 22 fewer 
flights during that span. 
</P>
<P>
	--At the tower in Minneapolis, 44 takeoffs and landings were  
scheduled from 7 a.m. to 7:15 a.m. on Thursday, Aug. 12, yet only 
30 planes could have arrived or departed during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	--At Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport on Wednesday,  
Aug. 11, more flights were scheduled than were allowed to take off 
or land nearly one-third of the time during a 12-hour period 
starting at 12:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's major airlines added roughly 600 daily flights this  
year, not counting a boom in regional and commuter air service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to passenger complaints, the airlines are faced with a  
congressionally mandated `passenger bill of rights,' and the air 
traffic control system is used as a convenient scapegoat for the 
airlines to protect their precious profits,'' said Schwitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuscus said the 600-flight addition represented only a small  
increase in the 22,000 daily flights major carriers had when the 
year began. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if there are spots where (overscheduling) occurs, isn't  
it the job of the air traffic control system to meet the needs of 
the American people?'' Fuscus said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has conceded equipment problems and decentralized  
decision-making increased delays this summer, and it has 
implemented procedures to reduce delays. However, it blamed weather 
for 75 percent of delays, with air traffic control equipment 
outages causing only about 3 percent of the delays.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Prepares for Brees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Purdue quarterback Drew Brees is a  
nightmare for defensive coordinators. For Clifford Jefferson, he's 
a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
	The Notre Dame cornerback can't wait to face Brees when the  
16th-ranked Irish play No. 20 Purdue on Saturday. He's counting on 
the Boilermakers quarterback to throw 50 or 60 times, to challenge 
him constantly. 
</P>
<P>
	And to lose a few of those battles.  
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to get at least two interceptions,'' Jefferson said  
with just a touch of brashness. ``Maybe I can get more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Jefferson knows Notre Dame's secondary has a  
reputation for being shaky, he said not to expect any of his fellow 
defensive backs to be intimidated against pass-happy Purdue in West 
Lafayette on Saturday. While other defenses might shudder at the 
thought of Brees coming at them throwing, Jefferson sees this as a 
chance to finally earn some respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to step up our game to show the whole NCAA  
that we're a high-caliber team,'' Jefferson said. ``Some teams, 
they don't respect our secondary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brees has his own scores to settle. He still hasn't forgotten  
the two interceptions he threw last year to hand Notre Dame a 31-30 
victory. The more damaging came on third-and-long from deep in 
Purdue territory with less than two minutes to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than take a sack, he threw across the middle, where Tony  
Driver intercepted the ball and returned it to the Purdue 5 to set 
up the game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some mistakes in that game that I made that cost us  
the game toward the end,'' Brees said. ``What I learned from that 
was don't throw late across the middle ever again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brees might not want to give up on the middle just yet. Though  
the Irish didn't give up gaudy numbers to Michigan's passing game 
(237 yards on 20 completions), quarterback Tom Brady had few 
problems throwing quick slants to his receivers or longer routes 
over the middle in the Wolverines' 26-22 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	During Michigan's final two scoring drives, Brady had five  
completions of 14 yards or more, including a 28-yarder over the 
middle to open the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that we will probably see a little more nickel  
coverage out of Notre Dame than what Michigan saw,'' Purdue coach 
Joe Tiller said. ``We felt like, yes, Michigan made a couple of big 
plays against them, but they made some big plays against Michigan's 
offense, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson said Notre Dame will have to play more bump-and-run if  
it hopes to throw off Purdue's four- and five-wideout scheme that 
largely relies on three-step quarterback drops and quick timing 
patterns. If the Irish can't do that, then Brees will likely do 
what he always does -- throw and throw and throw until a defense has 
a moment of weakness that turns into six points for the 
Boilermakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has got a good presence. He is one of those guys when he  
gets flushed out of there, he doesn't panic,'' Irish coach Bob 
Davie said of Brees. ``He looks for open receivers on the run. You 
have got to contain him on those bootlegs.''

<HEADLINE> Viacom, CBS Pitch to Regulators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Media titans Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. are  
going to have to make their case to regulators if they want to 
complete a proposed $35.89 billion marriage with all of their 
possessions intact. Of particular concern is whether they'll have 
to sell off some television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Top executives from both companies headed to Washington today to  
meet with regulators and lawmakers to discuss the deal. Viacom and 
CBS announced Tuesday they wanted to merge their extensive 
interests in TV, movies, radio and outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger would run up against restrictions on the  
percentage of the national audience that one company may reach 
through its owned TV stations. Another rule prohibits a company 
from owning more than one TV network in certain combinations -- a 
category that CBS and Viacom, with its half-interest in the UPN 
television network, would fall under. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies could have to get rid of some of their stations to  
comply with the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of six, including the chiefs of both companies and  
attorney Dick Wiley, a former FCC chairman, spent the morning 
meeting with FCC Chairman Bill Kennard and three other 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives made no specific requests in their meetings but  
updated the commissioners on the proposed deal, according to an FCC 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, in a statement today, stressed that the proposed merger  
is not yet before the commission. ``Once it is, the essential 
question will be: How will this merger accelerate delivery of 
digital age services to all consumers?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sources familiar with the matter, and speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said they believed the proposed merger 
would undergo its antitrust review at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is just the latest result of recent FCC actions that  
made it possible for a single company to own more than one local TV 
station in a given market. The trend has consumer groups on guard 
that more consolidation will lead to a handful of companies 
controlling the information people receive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if they comply with the rules, it's just a very dangerous  
consolidation of potential media competitors,'' said Gene 
Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumer's 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Former FCC Commissioner Rachelle Chong said such unions are a  
reaction to the changing demands of the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I see are the people that have content starting to pair  
with people who have pipes'' to provide services, said Chong, now a 
partner in the San Francisco law office of Coudert Brothers. 
``Broadcasters have been asking the FCC to recognize this shift in 
the marketplace for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She expected the companies would have to sell some of their  
stations to comply with federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Current FCC rules forbid companies from owning two or more  
networks in certain combinations. A CBS/UPN union would fall under 
this regulation, leaving the door open that the UPN network may be 
sold off or folded into CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC regulations also prevent broadcasters from operating  
television stations that reach more than 35 percent of the nation's 
home. CBS comes close to hitting this cap now, and company 
officials say the deal would give the new Viacom about 41 percent 
of the national audience. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS President Mel Karmazin and Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone  
planned to bring their cause to the capital today, but said they 
would dispose of properties if need be. ``At the end of the day, 
all we can do is go to Washington and make our case,'' Karmazin 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two antitrust lawmakers said they are considering holding  
hearings on the matter, that may take place sometime this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, chairman of the Judiciary antitrust  
subcommittee, and its top Democrat, Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, 
said they need to look carefully at the merger, which would greatly 
bolster the new company's ``ability to influence the information 
delivered to consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staffers said they expected some committee members would meet or  
speak with the company officials, but could not say when. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives also had requested an audience with Rep. Billy  
Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce telecommunications 
subcommittee, to brief him on the merger. Tauzin spokesman Ken 
Johnson said it was likely the congressman would talk with them in 
the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin believes that the new company may have to spin off some  
of its television stations to satisfy federal ownership rules. He 
also predicted that regulatory obstacles limiting TV ownership 
would fall eventually, but not until local affiliates -- some of 
which oppose changing the rules -- and networks come together on a 
plan, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say opposition is strong enough to prevent the rules from  
being relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see the rules being changed very easily,'' Andrew Jay  
Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a watchdog 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has never granted a waiver to the national television  
audience limit, according to a commission official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the companies will have to follow specific criteria  
in order to own more than one local TV station in a given market. 
Under the changes adopted by the FCC last month, a company could 
own two TV stations in the same market if there were at least eight 
other competitors after the deal and if one of the stations is not 
among the market's top four.

<HEADLINE> Kent State Protesters Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENT, Ohio (AP) -- From now on, students at Kent State University  
will know exactly where four of their predecessors were slain 
during an anti-war protest 29 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a solemn, 20-minute ceremony, the university dedicated  
memorials Wednesday at a dormitory parking lot where Allison 
Krause, Jeffrey Miller, Sandra Scheuer and William Schroeder were 
shot and killed by National Guardsmen May 4, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see these markers as a permanent vigil, not dependent on any  
person or organization. It is always there. That's important, 
because I think people are still trying to make sense of this 
absurd tragedy,'' said Jerry Lewis, a Kent State professor of 
sociology who was a faculty peace marshal at the scene of the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	A hillside memorial to the Vietnam War era and the Kent State  
shootings was dedicated in a much larger ceremony on the campus in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year, present-day students asked the university to  
permanently mark the spots where the students fell, and when 
parents of the victims agreed that markings would now be 
appropriate, school officials went along with the plan. Some of the 
parents were among about 100 people who attended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This milestone commemoration will be and should be cause for  
people around the world to inquire, to learn, to reflect, to wonder 
why the world is still plagued by hate, intolerance and violence,'' 
said Carol A. Cartwright, Kent State president. 
</P>
<P>
	The markers cost about $100,000, collected from private sources.  
Each memorial has a rough-edge granite border and six waist-high 
lamp posts. A polished triangle of granite in each space has the 
date May 4, 1970, and the name of a slain student. 
</P>
<P>
	The parking lot surrounding the memorials was closed to vehicles  
Wednesday, but still will be in use. The lamps at each spot will 
shine at night, except for the night of each May 3, when an annual 
candlelight vigil is held. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings occurred two days after the Guard was sent to Kent  
in the wake of student protests and the burning of the campus Army 
ROTC building. After using tear gas to disperse rock-throwing 
students, Guardsmen shot at least 61 shots in a 13-second burst. 
One of the four killed, Miss Scheuer, was not involved in protest 
but was walking to class. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison Krause's mother, Doris Krause, said the campus in  
northeast Ohio still holds terrible memories for her. She returned 
Wednesday for the first time in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy,'' she said after the ceremony. ``I felt this  
was a good reason to come back, and I'm glad I did.''

<HEADLINE> The Literary Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the writings of Al Gore, as newspaper reporter,  
environmentalist and vice president: 
</P>
<P>
	March 13, 1972, writing for The Tennessean in Nashville:  
</P>
<P>
	SUMMERTOWN, Tenn. -- A barn decorated with Oriental rugs and  
bleachers made from straw has become the unlikely meeting ground 
between members of Stephen Gaskin's commune near here and a Church 
of Christ congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Every Sunday afternoon and every Monday night for the past four  
weeks, the minister of Sandy Hook Church of Christ has come with 
some 30 to 40 members of his congregation and several other 
ministers to share ``the word of God'' with Gaskin and the 
estimated 450 members of his commune, who live on a farm just 
outside Summertown. 
</P>
<P>
	It began as a brave attempt by the churchmen to ``save'' the  
souls of those who came here seven months ago from San Francisco to 
start a brand new life on 1,014 acres of land in Lewis County. But 
it has developed into a series of electric debates. Each side 
presents its beliefs and then both sides hash out their 
disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many communes, the Gaskin group is committed to leading a  
religious life. ... Gaskin describes his group as a ``coed 
monastery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	From Gore's book ``Earth in the Balance,'' published in 1992:  
</P>
<P>
	Modern industrial civilization, as presently organized, is  
colliding violently with our planet's ecological system. The 
ferocity of its assault on the earth is breathtaking, and the 
horrific consequences are occurring so quickly as to defy our 
capacity to recognize them, comprehend their global implications, 
and organize an appropriate and timely response. ... As long as 
civilization as a whole, with its vast technological power, 
continues to follow a pattern of thinking that encourages the 
domination and exploitation of the natural world for short-term 
gains, this juggernaut will continue to devastate the earth no 
matter what any of us does. 
</P>
<P>
	I have come to believe that we must take bold and unequivocal  
action: we must make the rescue of the environment the central 
organizing principle for civilization. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	From Gore's book ``Common Sense Government,'' published in 1995:  
</P>
<P>
	And today, once again, we feel our government has become distant  
and insensitive -- not to mention too big, too meddlesome and too 
costly. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The less government there is, the more we like it.  
</P>
<P>
	Until the earth cracks open in California and people's lives  
crack with it. Until the rains keep raining in the heartland and 
people's achievements and memories disappear in a swirl of angry 
brown water. Until a river becomes so polluted that it catches 
fire. Until a child dies from contaminated hamburger. Or until we 
lose a job, need help feeding our family, grow old and can't afford 
medical care for our infirmities, or become victimized on our own 
neighborhood streets. Then we want that government to be there for 
us, and quickly.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Flat to Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed flat to lower Wednesday,  
with the biggest decline coming from London, where the Bank of 
England surprised markets by raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTSE 100 index of leading British stocks dropped 55.9  
points, or 0.9 percent, to end at 6,253.6, after the Bank of 
England's Monetary Policy Committee raised the benchmark lending 
rate by a quarter point to 5.25 percent, the rate the central bank 
charges on loans to other banks. 
</P>
<P>
	London banks were among the biggest blue-chip decliners, with  
Standard Chartered, HSBC Holdings and Lloyds TSB all ending lower. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.K. market had a big shock today,'' said David Coleman,  
chief economist at Canadian investment bank CIBC. ``In Europe, 
investors are waiting for some fresh direction and momentum to come 
back into the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 0.2 percent, the  
Paris CAC-40 index ended flat, and Milan's MIBtel index rose 0.6 
percent. Other bourses that declined included Amsterdam's AEX 
index, down 0.7 percent, and Zurich's SMI index, which fell 0.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies fell 0.36  
points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 313.62. The Dow Jones Euro 
Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in countries that joined 
the single currency, closed up 0.08 points at 329.33. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 7.27 points to 3,827.07,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 15.52 points at 3,744.02. 
</P>
<P>
	On the economic front in the rest of Europe, slightly  
weaker-than-expected German industrial output figures and comments 
from Bundesbank President Ernst Welteke kept investors subdued. 
Welteke, who is also a member of the 17-member policy-making 
council of the European Central Bank, said Tuesday he saw no reason 
at the moment to change interest rates in the euro zone.

<HEADLINE> Cable: 10 Years in Classrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As millions of children head back to school, so  
do more than 40 cable television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	This month marks the 10th year of the Cable in the Classroom  
program, which has quietly wired schools across the country for 
free or low-cost cable TV service and provided programming for 
teachers to supplement their curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 networks participate, most airing educationally  
oriented shows without commercials in pre-dawn hours for teachers 
to tape and use later. Networks, such as CNN, Discovery and The 
Weather Channel produce shows specifically for students. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry estimates it has spent $1 billion on Cable in the  
Classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best use of television,'' said Judith McHale,  
president of Discovery Communications, Inc. ``It is an incredibly 
powerful medium. If used appropriately, it can really enhance a 
child's experience in the classroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The motives aren't entirely altruistic. If a network's  
programming piques a young consumer's interest, it might create a 
fan for life. Free hookups at schools seem a worthwhile investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of 800 teachers surveyed last year said they used  
videos or television programs with their classes, just under the 79 
percent who include computers. Two-thirds said they were aware of 
the cable service, and most of those use it, according to the 
survey paid for by Cable in the Classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Programming from PBS, Discovery, The Learning Channel and CNN  
was among the most widely sampled, the teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``C-SPAN has been popular among some of the teachers I've talked  
to,'' said Kathleen Lyons, a spokeswoman for the National Education 
Association in Washington. ``Many are using the series on the 
American presidents. People like C-SPAN because they view it as 
nonbiased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers union has worked with the cable industry to develop  
guidelines for appropriate programming and, in some cases, 
curriculum material to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television has been another arrow to put in a teacher's  
arsenal of teaching tools,'' Lyons said. ``It's not something that 
should be overused, but it definitely has its place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The programming specifically produced for students includes  
CNN's daily ``Newsroom,'' which discusses current events, and the 
new ``SportsFigures,'' an ESPN2 show in which athletes like Tiger 
Woods, Juwan Howard and Steve Young talk about the relationship of 
math and physics to sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks this month are showing some of their educational  
programming in prime time so parents can see what is being made 
available to schools. While occasionally some of what networks call 
educational seems a stretch -- like VH1's rock star soap opera, 
``Behind the Music'' -- most of it is solid and informative. 
</P>
<P>
	The History Channel, for example, presents a miniseries on ``The  
Great Depression.'' Outdoor Life Network airs a show on the grizzly 
bear and A&AMP;E showcases a biography of P.T. Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the decade, the networks have learned how to tweak their  
shows to make them more classroom-friendly. For example, Discovery 
has cut some programs into shorter segments because students and 
teachers prefer this format, McHale said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, cable companies have wired an estimated 85,000 schools  
across the country for TV service, said Megan Hookey, managing 
director of Cable in the Classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 500 hours of programming cable networks offer  
to the schools, Cable in the Classroom also offers teacher training 
in how best to incorporate this video into the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest barrier we have,'' Hookey said, ``is that not  
enough teachers know that it is available.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	EARLY TODAY: To much fanfare, NBC debuted its ``Later Today''  
morning news and talk show on Tuesday. Much less attention-getting 
is another ``Today'' spin-off that started this week: ``Early 
Today.'' It's a morning business and general news program that airs 
weekdays at 4:30 a.m. ET., preceding local news in most markets. 
Produced by CNBC, the program has Nanette Hansen as host. ``Early 
Today'' features live reports on overseas markets from reporter 
Sydnie Kohara in London, and weather forecasts from Joe Witte.

<HEADLINE> Synagogues on Alert for Holidays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Edward Alpert had heard stories of Jewish  
persecution and knew anti-Semitism persisted. But he had never been 
afraid of being a target until a 21-year-old white supremacist shot 
and wounded six Jews just a few miles from Alpert's synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
	As Jews prepare for their most sacred time of year -- the High  
Holy Days, which start Friday at sundown with Rosh Hashana and run 
through Yom Kippur on Sept. 20 -- synagogues across the country will 
be on alert, with armed guards and security cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish leaders say the July attack in Chicago and the August  
rampage at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles have renewed 
feelings of vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt personally a sense of complacency that some of these  
issues were behind us,'' said Alpert, executive director of 
Chicago's Temple Sholom. ``Yet the reality is, given recent events, 
I feel the dangers that were present many years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Security is being stepped up because the crowds of worshippers  
during the High Holy Days could create a concentrated target for 
harassment or violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be on the lookout,'' said Rabbi Ivan Wachmann of  
Temple Shalom in Pompano Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Society Hill Synagogue in Philadelphia will hire an armed,  
off-duty police officer to stand guard during services, and ushers 
will check visitors for membership cards and watch for 
suspicious-looking bags, said executive director Evelyn Segal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very expensive and we can't afford it, but we're taking  
it out of the budget because we feel that we can't afford not to,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's Temple Sholom will hire security guards -- some armed --  
for services, and also has surveillance cameras, Alpert said. The 
temple has banned briefcases, tote bags and backpacks, and 
worshippers will not be admitted without a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Other synagogues will assign seats and have doors that open only  
from the inside during services. Police will increase their 
presence around many synagogues, and worshippers will be instructed 
not to gather in large crowds outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine there will be a single temple or synagogue  
that won't have some increased security,'' said Jonathan Levine, 
Midwest director of the American Jewish Committee. But he added: 
``If we imprison ourselves, we help the haters accomplish their 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The white supremacist accused in the Los Angeles attack, Buford  
O. Furrow Jr., told authorities he wanted to send a ``wake-up call 
to America to kill Jews.'' Still, many Jews said they don't want 
fear to define the High Holy Days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think violence will ever keep Jews from coming  
together and celebrating,'' said Hanna Dahan, 49, who attended 
Friday night services at Temple Sholom in Philadelphia. ``We are a 
community here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a temple near the Los Angeles community center where five  
people, including three children, were wounded, Rabbi Aron Tendler 
said his congregation decided against heavy security. And he 
doesn't plan to discuss the attack during services. But he said he 
will advise worshippers not to linger in front of the synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a community that refuses to be put behind gates,'' he  
said. ``We'll do that which is sensible -- we're not going to walk 
around with big flags. But people are going to walk to the 
synagogue with prayer shawls and will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other clergy said it was important to acknowledge the renewed  
fear during the holidays, by tradition a time of introspection and 
atonement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Chaim Landau of the 1,000-member Greenspring Valley  
Synagogue near Baltimore said the recent attacks will figure into a 
prayer that is traditionally recited at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this prayer, we stand before God and ask who will live and  
who will die,'' he said. ``Then we list the specifics of how we 
might die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he said, he intends to add a line: ``Who by gunshots  
and who by bombs?''

<HEADLINE>  Death Toll Tops 50 in Greek Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- As rescue workers hacked slowly through  
mounds of rubble, the death toll from one of the worst quakes to 
hit Athens this century climbed past 50 today. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 80 people missing in collapsed buildings, crews  
intensified their efforts to find survivors a day after a magnitude 
5.9 quake ripped through the capital's northern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	In central Athens, there was very minor damage to the Acropolis,  
with some small chunks of rock falling off a gate and one of the 
Parthenon's columns, Culture Ministry officials said. But Greece's 
best-known tourist attraction remained open to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake also broke pottery at the National Archaeological  
Museum, which will be closed for three days while officials assess 
damage. The towering columns of the Temple of Zeus were spared any 
harm.

	About 500 engineers fanned out through the hardest-hit area this  
morning. Greeks were being helped by teams from Turkey, France and 
Switzerland. More squads were expected from Germany and Russia, but 
rescue efforts could be hampered by rain, which was forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can now increase our attempts,'' said Fire Chief  
Panaghiotis Fouras, deputy head of the Greek Fire Department. But 
as he stood on a mountain of rubble watching rescuers crawling 
around in 15 shafts bored into what remained of the five-story 
factory, he was unsure anyone would emerge alive.

	``We don't have any signs of life right now, but that doesn't  
mean that we have no hope,'' Fouras said.

<P>
	At least 53 people, including 14 children, were killed, fire  
officials said. They said rescue crews had found 160 survivors by 
early today, but officials feared the death toll could reach 80.

<P>
	Thousands of Athenians, fearing a new quake, camped out in city  
parks as aftershocks rumbled through the night. Many reportedly 
stayed away from work today. 
</P>
<P>
	There were more than 700 aftershocks, including eight over  
magnitude 4 and a midnight jolt that registered magnitude 4.7. 
Experts said the strong aftershocks were an indication that the 
energy built up along the fault line was abating to safe levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's chief prosecutor, Giorgos Koliokostas, launched an  
investigation to determine if poor workmanship contributed to the 
collapse of more than 100 buildings, from multistory apartment 
houses to factories. The government-run Athens News Agency cited 
reports saying 2,500 homes suffered serious damage. The figure 
could mean thousands of people were rendered homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the damage and casualties were concentrated in  
working-class and immigrant areas, where construction standards 
apparently were lower or building shortcuts were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will look at this with great care. We have some of the  
strictest earthquake regulations around and if they were kept we 
should not have had this much damage,'' said Interior Minister 
Vasso Papandreou. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials declared a one-day state of emergency in the Athens  
metropolitan area, closed all public schools today and warned 
people to stay out of even slightly damaged homes until they were 
inspected. The Athens Stock Exchange also was closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also began setting up more than 700 tents in the area  
around Menidi, where the quake was centered. The telephone company 
reprogrammed pay phones in the area to dial free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek media had high praise for a 19-member crew from Turkey's  
volunteer Akut rescue team, which arrived first and headed straight 
for the foam factory after arriving at Athens airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's quick offer of assistance to its traditional rival was  
a poignant reminder of Greece's aid to its neighbor when it was hit 
by a devastating quake on Aug. 17-- a move that helped thaw decades 
of enmity. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Greek crews had just returned from Turkey, where a  
quake near Istanbul killed more than 15,000. That quake registered 
a magnitude of 7.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece, however, was better-equipped to handle Tuesday's quake  
than Turkey. Strict building codes in quake-prone Greece allowed 
the huge Athens metropolis to ride out the temblor with far less 
damage than Turkey, where shoddy construction was blamed for 
near-total destruction in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	Official emergency crews, police and military forces were on the  
scene within the hour, compared to hours and even days in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest quake in the Athens area this century was a

<HEADLINE>  Death Toll Tops 50 in Greek Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- As rescue workers hacked slowly through  
mounds of rubble, the death toll from one of the worst quakes to 
hit Athens this century climbed past 50 today. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 80 people missing in collapsed buildings, crews  
intensified their efforts to find survivors a day after a magnitude 
5.9 quake ripped through the capital's northern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	In central Athens, there was very minor damage to the Acropolis,  
with some small chunks of rock falling off a gate and one of the 
Parthenon's columns, Culture Ministry officials said. But Greece's 
best-known tourist attraction remained open to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake also broke pottery at the National Archaeological  
Museum, which will be closed for three days while officials assess 
damage. The towering columns of the Temple of Zeus were spared any 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 engineers fanned out through the hardest-hit area this  
morning. Greeks were being helped by teams from Turkey, France and

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Want Return to Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- For the Arizona Cardinals, a breakthrough  
season was followed by a long, ugly summer of player departures, 
contract hassles and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The team enters the 1999 season facing the second-toughest  
schedule in the NFC, based on last year's records. Even in the 
conference derisively known as the NFC Least, Arizona faces an 
uphill climb for a second consecutive trip to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, coach Vince Tobin begins his fourth season insisting he  
remains optimistic that the Cardinals will build on last year's 
success, a 9-7 record and a victory over Dallas for the franchise's 
first playoff triumph in 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of things we've had to overcome,'' Tobin said,  
``but I think through it all it will make us a better football 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any reason for optimism begins with Jake Plummer, who is  
emerging as one of the next great quarterbacks in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, after a slow start, Plummer engineered a series of  
last-second triumphs that earned the team its first winning season 
since 1984. But his preparation has been hampered by a sprained 
right thumb that kept him out of the last two exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to hurt him some,'' Tobin said. ``You need to be  
out there playing. He's certainly not a seasoned, veteran, gnarled 
quarterback. He's going into his third year, his second year of 
really starting, and he needed the work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also needs Rob Moore, the big-play wide receiver who is one  
of three players who have held out in contract disputes with the 
notoriously conservative Cardinals' ownership of Bill Bidwill. The 
others are Mark Smith, sorely missed at defensive tackle, and 
first-round draft pick L.J. Shelton, who had a chance to start at 
offensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals already were without three of their main leaders  
from last season. Linebacker Jamir Miller and offensive tackle 
Lomas Brown went elsewhere as free agents, and the team cut 
fullback Larry Centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both starting offensive guards missed most of the preseason,  
Chris Dishman with elbow surgery and Lester Holmes with facial 
lacerations that were the result of the car crash that crushed the 
right arm of backup offensive lineman Ernest Dye. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle Eric Swann, the two-time Pro Bowl performer who  
underwent surgery on his arthritic right knee twice last year, said 
he won't be ready to play until six or seven weeks into the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had plenty of things happen that haven't gone in our  
direction,'' Plummer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule includes games at Miami, the New York Jets, Atlanta  
and Green Bay, and home games against San Francisco, New England 
and Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I'm looking forward to it,'' wide receiver Frank  
Sanders said. ``It's exciting. They are teams we haven't played in 
awhile. Those are teams that have consistently won and been in a 
position to be champs. I think we have an opportunity to go out and 
make some things happen this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Moore eventually signs, the Cardinals would have three  
big-time receivers, counting Sanders and rookie David Boston. 
Adrian Murrell, who rushed for more than 1,000 yards the last two 
seasons, will be backed up by muscleman Michael Pittman. Rookie 
Joel Makovicka has won the starting fullback job. 
</P>
<P>
	On defense, Andre Wadsworth and Simeon Rice are solid at  
defensive ends, as is the secondary with cornerbacks Aeneas 
Williams and Corey Chaveous at safeties Tommy Bennett and Kwami 
Lassiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Free agent Rob Frederickson was signed to replace Miller. He's  
better against the pass but not nearly as good against the run. The 
other outside linebacker is a big question mark. The coaches were 
so dissatisfied with Patrick Sapp and Tony McCombs that they gave 
the job to second-year pro Zack Walz. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Swann would have been one of the league's most  
formidable tandems at defensive tackle. Their replacements, Jerry 
Drake and Rashod Swinger, are something less than that. 
</P>
<P>
	The odds don't look good, but that's nothing new for a franchise  
that's been down this long. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to surprise everybody again,'' Wadsworth said,  
``and that's the way I like it.''

<HEADLINE> Visa International Plans Makeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Visa International plans to cede some  
control over what products and services it offers and charges 
members in a move that could give those financial organizations 
greater input into rapid changes taking place in the credit card 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The association, which controls the Visa logo put on about 60  
percent of all credit cards issued worldwide, is considering 
allowing its six subsidiaries around the globe to choose from a 
menu of debit and credit card systems and services that meet the 
needs of members in a particular region. 
</P>
<P>
	Visa International has been under pressure to cut its fees and  
loosen rules on how members use the logo and offer services as 
banks and other financial services organizations try to increase 
profits in the highly competitive credit card industry. Citigroup 
last year defected to Visa competitor MasterCard, in part because 
Visa USA refused to allow it to move the logo to the back of the 
card. 
</P>
<P>
	If Visa International's board of directors approves the proposed  
changes in a meeting Sept. 24, it could be the first in a series of 
steps to allow such large members as Bank One Corp.'s First USA 
credit card subsidiary greater flexibility in how they market Visa 
brand products, said industry analyst Spencer Zahn, president of 
research firm Zahn &AMP; Associates in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Various banks in the past few years have wanted to do more  
individual things for themselves, and this could be a very clear 
indication that the doors are open for people to give greater 
input,'' Zahn said Wednesday. ``The world is dramatically changing 
in terms of electronic commerce, stored valued cards and the like. 
Decisions about how to proceed should be open as we close out this 
century and start the new one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary plans call for Visa International to offer its  
21,000 members basic services such as financing and global 
marketing while leaving the regional groups free to pick and choose 
more extensive offerings -- all at varying price levels.

<HEADLINE> Viacom, CBS Execs Pitch Regulators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Media titans Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. are  
going to have to make their case to regulators if they want to 
complete a proposed $35.89 billion marriage with all of their 
possessions intact. Of particular concern is whether they'll have 
to sell off some television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Top executives from both companies were headed to Washington  
today to meet with regulators and lawmakers to discuss the deal. 
Viacom and CBS announced Tuesday they wanted to merge their 
extensive interests in TV, movies, radio and outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger would run up against restrictions on the  
percentage of the national audience that one company may reach 
through its owned TV stations. Another rule prohibits a company 
from owning more than one TV network in certain combinations -- a 
category that CBS and Viacom, with its half-interest in the UPN 
television network, would fall under. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies could have to get rid of some of their stations to  
comply with the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Federal Communications Commission declined to  
comment on the specifics of the case, but said they would look into 
the deal when the companies file their papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our policy is to evaluate mergers to see if they meet the  
public interest standard,'' said an FCC spokesperson, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sources familiar with the matter, and speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said they believed the proposed merger 
would undergo its antitrust review at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is just the latest result of recent FCC actions that  
made it possible for a single company to own more than one local TV 
station in a given market. The trend has consumer groups on guard 
that more consolidation will lead to a handful of companies 
controlling the information people receive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if they comply with the rules, it's just a very dangerous  
consolidation of potential media competitors,'' said Gene 
Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumer's 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Former FCC Commissioner Rachelle Chong said such unions are a  
reaction to the changing demands of the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I see are the people that have content starting to pair  
with people who have pipes'' to provide services, said Chong, now a 
partner in the San Francisco law office of Coudert Brothers. 
``Broadcasters have been asking the FCC to recognize this shift in 
the marketplace for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She expected the companies would have to sell some of their  
stations to comply with federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Current FCC rules forbid companies from owning two or more  
networks in certain combinations. A CBS/UPN union would fall under 
this regulation, leaving the door open that the UPN network may be 
sold off or folded into CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC regulations also prevent broadcasters from operating  
television stations that reach more than 35 percent of the nation's 
home. CBS comes close to hitting this cap now, and company 
officials say the deal would give the new Viacom about 41 percent 
of the national audience. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS President Mel Karmazin and Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone  
planned to bring their cause to the capital today, but said they 
would dispose of properties if need be. ``At the end of the day, 
all we can do is go to Washington and make our case,'' Karmazin 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A top telecommunications lawmaker said the new company may have  
to spin off some of its television stations to satisfy federal 
ownership rules, but he also predicted that regulatory obstacles 
limiting TV ownership would fall soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Production and distribution are going to be integrally linked  
in the 21st century, and both Viacom and CBS are positioning 
themselves to be a key player,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., 
chairman of the House Commerce Committee's telecommunications panel 
that has jurisdiction over the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	But some are less certain that the FCC will relax its ownership  
rules because of opposition to doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see the rules being changed very easily,'' Andrew Jay  
Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a watchdog 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has never granted a waiver to the national television  
audience limit, according to a commission official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the companies will have to follow specific criteria  
in order to own more than one local TV station in a given market. 
Under the changes adopted by the FCC last month, a company could 
own two TV stations in the same market if there were at least eight 
other competitors after the deal and if one of the stations is not 
among the market's top four.

<HEADLINE> Springsteen Tour Running into Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bruce Springsteen's tour with the E Street Band  
is running right into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boss' much-anticipated reunion with the band has already  
played for 1.25 million fans since April. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour on Tuesday annnounced 11 new dates in 10 cities this  
fall. Additional dates extending the tour into next year were 
expected later this year, although no New Year's Eve show is 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation that Springsteen and the band would  
play Dec. 31, 1999, at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, where they 
recently completed a sold-out 15-night stand. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first tour for Springsteen with the E Street Band in  
more than a decade.

<HEADLINE> Showdown Set for Browns, Steelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Many have heard about the Steelers-Browns  
rivalry or watched it on TV. Some even felt it as they were whacked 
in the back of the neck by an errant bone tossed from the Dawg 
Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though the Cleveland Browns were absent from the NFL  
for only three seasons, not many Pittsburgh Steelers have played 
against them in a game that counts. At least in a Steelers uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 11 of the current 53 Steelers -- or about one-fifth of their  
roster -- were on the team that beat Cleveland 20-17 on Nov. 26, 
1995, the last Steelers-Browns game. 
</P>
<P>
	Or at least the last one until Sunday night in Cleveland.  
</P>
<P>
	No wonder that some experienced Steelers, such as Dermontti  
Dawson, Levon Kirkland and Joel Steed, are helping their younger 
teammates this week not only with their playbooks, but their 
history books. 
</P>
<P>
	They're telling them that this won't be like any other game they  
will play this season. And that even when one team is doing well 
and the other isn't, it's a game that commands the attention of 
both cities. And that when one team returns to the NFL after a 
three-year absence by opening at home against the other, it is a 
really big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Something special. Something to be remembered. Something not to  
lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great that football is back in Cleveland, it really is,''  
said Steelers coach Bill Cowher, a former Browns player and 
assistant coach. ``It belongs there. It's like if you would take 
football out of Pittsburgh, something wouldn't seem right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't seemed right that the Jacksonville Jaguars, not the  
Browns, were the Steelers' biggest rivals the last three years. 
Jacksonville might still be the team to beat in the AFC Central, 
but the Browns are the team that Steelers fans most like to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when we played them three times in 1994, those  
games were really intense,'' Kirkland said Tuesday. ``It's going to 
be especially intense because this is our first game. But I think 
it's fun. I love it the way it is in Cleveland, with all of their 
fans booing us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland realizes that Browns fans will be whipped to a  
playoff-like pitch Sunday night. But he believes that crowd noise 
can motivate an opposing team to try to show up those clamorous 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to shut 'em down and not let them get into the  
game,'' Kirkland said. ``They've got one of the great fan bases 
there is, and they're going to be happy to get their franchise 
back. I think they have the best road atmosphere in the league, 
with the Dawg Pound and those masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I love being the bad guy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Earl Holmes, who plays alongside Kirkland, has never  
played in a Steelers-Browns game and is as curious as anyone to 
experience one. 
</P>
<P>
	``The older guys on the team have been telling me about it,  
telling me about the fans,'' he said. ``Their fans go crazy and 
Pittsburgh is not too far away, so I'm sure we'll have some of our 
fans there, too. They're going to be rowdy and they're going to go 
at it the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher just wishes it weren't the first game of the season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like going up there on Sunday night, but it's the  
right thing to do,'' he said. ``There's so much tradition in this 
football game with these cities that are so identical, with the 
people and the passion and the way they identify with their sports 
teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Steelers don't know is if they'll have running back  
Jerome Bettis (sore left knee) for even part of the game. He talked 
optimistically again Tuesday about playing, but didn't sound 
totally convincing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll play as much as coach wants me to play,'' Bettis said.  
``I want to get out there.''

<HEADLINE> Meet Nation's Drive-Thru Cup King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Salespeople know. So do truckers,  
cabbies, couriers and pizza deliverers. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who spends a lot of time on the road must know the  
disposable drinking cups used by restaurants and convenience stores 
keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the largest such cups held a mere 16 ounces. Then  
along came the 24-ounce and 32-ounce cups, followed by vat-like 
vessels holding 44 ounces and 64 ounces. In Las Vegas, some 
businesses have even tried out an 85-ounce cup -- roughly two-thirds 
of a gallon of ice and beverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's behind this madness? George Willbrandt, vice president of  
sales and marketing of the drinking cup division of 
Evansville-based Berry Plastics Corp. He invented the giant, 
wide-barreled, narrow-bottomed, plastic cup known in the industry 
simply as the ``drive-thru.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're constantly trying to improve on the total package of the  
cup and the lid,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Willbrandt is the founder of Sterling Products Inc., a maker of  
plastic promotional drinking cups. When Berry purchased the company 
in 1995, Willbrandt joined the firm to direct the drinking cup 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition turned Berry from a bit player into the industry  
leader in the injection-molded plastic drinking cup business. 
Berry's annual domestic cup sales climbed from $7.5 million in 1995 
to $40 million last year, when it captured 40 percent of the $100 
million market. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry has 2,400 employees and now produces about 500 million  
drinking cups each year at plants in Evansville; Lawrence, Kan.; 
and Henderson, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	The cups come in 30 different styles. Twenty-six in-house  
artists and graphic designers make them look any way a customer 
desires. 
</P>
<P>
	Those customers include McDonald's, Burger King, Steak 'n Shake,  
Cracker Barrel, Bigfoot and Circle K convenience stores, and oil 
companies Amoco, Mobil, and Sunoco. Berry also provides promotional 
drinking cups used by college and professional sports teams and its 
cups can be found at national parks and the Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never the same thing from day to day,'' said Mark LaRue,  
product line supervisor of the drinking cup division. ``You're 
dealing with a wide variety of customers and needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides drinking cups, Berry's sales are focused in four major  
product lines: caps for aerosol cans, open-top containers, 
housewares and lawn and garden products and custom molding. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry originally was founded as Imperial Plastics in 1967 and  
has grown into a large manufacturer of injection-molded plastic 
packaging. The company was renamed Berry Plastics in 1983, when it 
was purchased by Jack Berry Sr., a Florida-based citrus grower and 
real estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the company's assets were purchased by an investment  
fund managed by First Atlantic Capital Ltd. of New York. Berry 
Plastics' management owns part of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquisitions have been key to the company's success with  
drinking cups, said Don Loepp, managing editor of Plastics News, a 
weekly industry newspaper based in Akron, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put together a group of acquisitions with the right  
geographical mix for their customers and also the right mix of 
services and products for their customers,'' Loepp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry also has deftly adjusted its product mix in recent years  
as consumer demands declined for certain plastic products, such as 
caps for aerosol cans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Willbrandt said that with innovation, manufacturing efficiency,  
aggressive marketing and customer service, Berry's share the of 
plastic drinking cup market will keep growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You put all these together, it's what has made us  
successful,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, Softbank Invest in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft and Softbank of Japan are investing in  
a venture with Global Crossing to build a fiber-optic network in 
Asia for high-speed Internet, voice and video communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11,000-mile web of land and undersea cables will connect in  
Japan to Global Crossing's trans-Pacific links with the United 
States and its fiber networks in the Americas and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and Softbank, an early investor in Yahoo! and other  
hugely successful Internet ventures, will each contribute $175 
million in cash to the $1.28 billion project. The companies also 
committed to buy a combined $200 million worth of network capacity 
from Global Crossing over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	For Global Crossing, the investments by shrewd technology  
players like Microsoft and Softbank gave a much-needed vote of 
confidence to Global Crossing's plan to build a worldwide 
fiber-optic network. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into Wednesday, Global Crossing's stock had lost  
two-thirds of its value since May, hit hard by a blowout in Wall 
Street's Internet rally and concerns about how much a price war in 
long distance rates will hurt merger partner Frontier Corp. Global 
Crossing was forced to renegotiate that merger last week, 
increasing the amount of stock it will pay for Frontier, which also 
owns a fiber-optic network in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	After Wednesday's venture was announced, Global Crossing's stock  
jumped 26 percent, rising $5.31 1/4 to $25.62 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment by Microsoft, meanwhile, was the latest bid by  
the software maker to ensure its place as the Internet becomes a 
venue for telephone calls and television in addition to data 
traffic, e-mail and Web surfing. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Microsoft invested $5 billion in AT&AMP;T, which  
plans to provide various telecommunications services over the cable 
TV networks it recently acquired. As part of the deal, Microsoft 
will provide software for set-top boxes deployed in parts of the 
AT&AMP;T cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference Wednesday, Global Crossing officials  
repeatedly stressed the growth potential of the Asian economy, 
which has been recovering from last year's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asia has half of the world's population and is the fastest  
growing region in the world, but it's telecom infrastructure has 
just not kept up,'' said Gary Winnick, founder and co-chairman of 
Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to capitalize on an early start in such a huge market and  
Wall Street's hearty appetite for Internet-related ventures, the 
partners said they would likely sell stock in Asia Global Crossing 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bermuda-based Global Crossing will initially hold a 93 percent  
stake in the venture. Microsoft and Softbank will each own an 
initial stake of 3.5 percent, but those stakes will expand if the 
market value of Asia Global Crossing exceeds $5 billion, reaching 
as much as 19 percent if the venture's worth tops $7.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing will give the new venture its development rights  
in the Asia-Pacific region and its 57.75 percent share of Pacific 
Crossing 1, a separate partnership that's building a 13,000-mile 
network under the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Scanlon, vice chairman of Global Crossing, will be chief  
executive of Asia Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Asian network, which will be built in two phases, would  
connect Japan, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, 
Malaysia and the Philippine. The first 6,300 miles of cable are 
expected to be ready by December 2000, and the remainder about a 
half year later. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners hope to expand the network to Thailand and  
Indonesia down the road.

<HEADLINE> GDP Revision Paints Healthy Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Changes in the way the government takes the  
nation's economic pulse are expected to show an even heartier 
economy with faster growth, lower inflation and Americans doing a 
better job of saving than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The adjustments to the gross domestic product -- the broadest  
measure of the nation's economic health -- should better reflect 
changes in the economy and new sources of data, the Commerce 
Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the change ``will be modest ...,'' said Brent  
Moulton, a government economist overseeing the project. ``We're not 
going to have a wholesale change in picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think the directions are pretty clear, that the changes  
... will modestly increase the real growth rate and modestly reduce 
the inflation rate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government conducts a major review of how it calculates the  
nation's economic pulse around every five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists said the changes should give the Federal  
Reserve and other policy-makers a more accurate picture of the 
economy but didn't believe it would prompt any policy shift. 
</P>
<P>
	``The changes will show that the economy is probably doing  
better than the government previously thought and that's getting 
closer to reality,'' said Mark Zandi, an economist with Regional 
Financial Associates. ``But I don't think it will change Fed policy 
because they have already incorporated a lot of this into their 
thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's briefing laid out changes in the way the government  
calculates gross domestic product -- the country's total output of 
goods and services. That report also includes information on 
inflation and Americans' personal savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual numbers showing the impact of these changes on past  
GDP estimates, dating back to 1929, won't be released by the 
government until late October. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest change involves how the government classifies  
business investments in computer software. Under the new 
methodology, purchases of software programs will be treated as 
``private fixed investments,'' meaning they will add to the value 
of the GDP. Such purchases currently are classified as 
``intermediate input'' -- a material used in production, such as an 
automaker's purchase of steel -- and isn't included in the GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	Government purchases of computer software also will be treated  
as an investment, which would add to GDP, rather than as an 
expenditure, which has no effect on GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed to give an example, Moulton said that as a result of  
these changes, GDP in 1996 will be around $115 billion higher than 
the government originally estimated. In 1996, total GDP was pegged 
at $7.662 trillion, government economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new methodology, savings associated with a worker's  
government pension plan will be counted as personal savings, rather 
than as government savings. That won't affect the GDP, but it will 
boost the nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage 
of disposable income -- by an estimated 1.5 percentage points to 2 
percentage points, or around $100 billion in extra savings, for the 
1990s, Moulton said. 
</P>
<P>
	And personal contributions to government pension plans will no  
longer be deducted from personal income, a change that will boost 
personal income estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also will revise the way it measures productivity  
in the banking sector to take into account not only hours worked by 
bank employees but also ATM transactions, the number of checks 
cleared, electronic fund transfers and other factors. The change is 
expected to show improved banking productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	To better gauge consumer spending, the government will consider  
changes in buying behavior during sales. 
</P>
<P>
	That banking productivity and consumer spending changes are  
expected to show that an inflation gauge tied to the GDP is even 
lower than previously estimated.

<HEADLINE> Sabre Group Chief Quits Abruptly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The president of Sabre Group Holdings  
has quit after three years at the top of the travel information 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Durham, a longtime AMR Corp. executive, had been  
entrusted with Sabre since it was spun off by AMR in 1996. 
According to a company statement issued late Tuesday, Durham 
resigned to pursue other business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a personal decision that Durham made,'' Sabre  
spokeswoman Barbara Kiecker said. ``He felt it was the right point 
and time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AMR chairman and chief executive Donald Carty will serve as  
Sabre's interim chief executive while a search for a permanent 
successor gets under way. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Durham praised the company's growth but said  
nothing about his reasons for leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Durham rose through the ranks at Fort Worth-based AMR Corp. and  
American Airlines, the AMR subsidiary that built Sabre. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1995, AMR reorganized and set Sabre up as a separate  
unit with Durham as president. In July 1996, AMR formed Sabre Group 
Holdings Inc., then sold off 17.6 of Sabre's stock to the public in 
October 1996. AMR still owns about 83 percent of Sabre. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabre also provides reservation services for American Airlines  
and an assortment of other carriers, including US Airways Group and 
Canadian Airlines International.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Pleads Innocent to Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Undefeated International Boxing  
Federation junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas and four 
other men pleaded innocent Wednesday at their arraignment on 
assault charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 21, and the others are charged with assault with a  
deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit a crime stemming from a July 
25 altercation at a Summerland home. 
</P>
<P>
	Conviction could carry a prison term of almost eight years,  
deputy district attorney Hilary Dozer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men are accused of beating Doug Rossi, 23, who had broken up  
a fight between Vargas and a woman's ex-boyfriend at her apartment. 
Vargas claimed he was out of the room when the alleged assault took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Joseph Lodge said he will determine a  
preliminary hearing date by Sept. 23. He said the court also might 
resolve the matter for at least some of the defendants at that 
time, but he did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Arraigned along with Vargas during the 15-minute proceeding were  
his cousin, Ernesto Vargas, 27; Carlos Lopez, 28; Freddie Flores, 
21, and Vincent Arenas, 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight days before the incident, Vargas ran his ring record to  
17-0, with 17 knockouts, by successfully defending his title 
against Raul Marquez.

<HEADLINE> A Gore-Bradley Comparison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How the two Democratic candidates -- Vice President Al Gore and  
Former Sen. Bill Bradley -- stand on some issues: 

</P>
<P>
	WELFARE REFORM:   	
</P>
<P>
	Bradley: Voted against a 1996 welfare reform bill, signed by  
President Clinton, that transformed welfare from a federal 
entitlement to a block grant that enabled states to craft their own 
plans to help the needy. ``I thought there was a federal obligation 
to individual children who are poor,'' Bradley said in January, 
``not simply an obligation to take a pot of money and send it from 
one group of politicians to another group of politicians in a 
state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore: Supported 1996 welfare reform bill. He has suggested as a  
candidate that faith-based organizations should play a more 
prominent role in social programs. 

</P>
<P>
	ABORTION:   	
</P>
<P>
	Bradley: Pro-choice. He supports federal funding for abortions  
for women on Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore: Pro-choice. Like Bradley, Gore has said he supports  
federal funding for abortions for women on Medicaid, although as a 
congressman and Senator he made statements to the contrary. 

</P>
<P>
	SCHOOL VOUCHERS:   	
</P>
<P>

to the problems of public education,'' he said last month. Voted 
twice for federally funded experimental voucher programs, however. 
Neither bill became law. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore: Supports school choice in public schools and supports

	GUN CONTROL:   	
</P>
<P>
	--Bradley: Has proposed photo ID licenses for people who buy

<P>
	--Gore: Supports photo ID licenses for handgun buyers and bans on  
``Saturday night specials.'' In 1999, cast tie-breaking Senate vote 
for instant background checks at gun shows.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Soccer To Play Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Perhaps still haunted by visions of Brandi  
Chastain's impromptu victory celebration during the women's World 
Cup, the Chinese national soccer team wanted no part of a friendly 
rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will have settle for the next best thing.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's national team will play Brazil in Denver on  
Sept. 26. The Americans beat Brazil in the World Cup semifinals 
before defeating China on Chastain's deciding penalty kick in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Soccer president Bob Contiguglia said China was invited to  
take part in a series of exhibition matches that will conclude with 
the U.S. Women's Cup '99 next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not interested in coming back to the U.S.,''  
Contiguglia said Wednesday. ``It is still a disappointment for 
them. I think the next time they want to play us is in the Olympic 
finals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women became national celebrities with their run  
through the World Cup, and Chastain was the cover girl on several 
magazines after removing her shirt in celebration of her 
game-winning goal on July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the crush of autograph requests and talk-show appearances  
have slowed, the U.S. women are trying to continue their momentum 
and prepare for the 2000 Olympics with games around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	They beat overmatched Ireland 5-0 last Saturday in Foxboro,  
Mass., and will play international games in the next month in 
Denver; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Mo.; and Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to share and celebrate the women's victory with  
areas of the country where we didn't have games,'' Contiguglia 
said. ``Colorado has a very rich women's soccer history. We've 
turned out some of the finest players in the country. It's a 
supportive community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 7,000 tickets have been sold for the game at Mile High  
Stadium. More than 30,000 people watched the game in Foxboro, and 
Contiguglia expects 40,000 in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the level that we've always dreamed that women's  
soccer would become in this country,'' said forward Cindy Parlow, 
who scored against Brazil in the World Cup. ``To have the media 
come out, to have the TV, to have all the endorsement opportunities 
... we've worked so hard to get to the level we have reached, and I 
think it's very well-deserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a victory over Brazil, the U.S. women would tie the  
3-year-old team record of 22 victories in a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
	Parlow doesn't expect the record to come easy, and the World Cup  
semifinals support her case. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil had a chance to beat the Americans, but goaltender Briana  
Scurry made several breathtaking saves to help the United States to 
a 2-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know how close it was,'' Parlow said. ``We were on the  
field. We were relieved every time Bri would come up with a 
tremendous save. Believe me, it was close game. ... It's going to 
be a battle. There's a lot of pride out there. There's a lot of 
intense women competing.''

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Alan Clark, a maverick Conservative Party  
legislator who blew the whistle on British arms sales to Iraq, 
flaunted his philandering and flirted with Margaret Thatcher, died 
Sunday at age 71. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1993 political diaries hit the bestseller list packed with  
unflattering descriptions of political colleagues, betrayals and 
Clark's serial extramarital affairs. They included tales of 
addressing the House of Commons while ``not entirely sober,'' and 
of brushes with the one woman to whom he appeared faithful -- the 
prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, during the trial of three British executives charged  
with illegally exporting defense-related equipment to Iraq, Clark 
nonchalantly announced that he had encouraged the sales. The 
executives were acquitted and the government sharply criticized in 
a judicial inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Retiring once from politics in 1992, he made a successful  
comeback five years later. Nearly 70, Clark secured the nomination 
for London's Chelsea and Kensington district. He returned to the 
Commons in May 1997 elections in which the Conservatives lost power 
to the Labor Party.

Pensacola News Journal, died of a heart attack Sunday. He was 40. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland's conversational Sunday column often revolved around  
local news events. However, he did not shrink from issuing sharp 
criticism of local newsmakers.

<P>
	He also worked at the Alabama Journal in Montgomery; the  
Sarasota Herald-Tribune, the Palm Beach Review and The Anniston

Indiana who served five years as the president of the National

illness. She was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendel served as president of the National Federation of  
Republican Women from 1980 to 1985. She also was vice chairman of

the well of an elevator in Rome. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Ungari's body was recovered on Monday night, but authorities  
believe the accident may have occurred on Friday and gone unnoticed 
because the professor's family was out of town, the ANSA news 
agency said. The elevator was in the building where Ungari worked 
as head of the government's human rights commission.

<HEADLINE> Eskimo Pie Up For Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Eskimo Pie will be sold in whole or in  
parts, company executives told shareholders at the dessert maker's 
annual meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskimo Pie previously had resisted a bid by its largest  
shareholder, Canada's Yogen Fruz World Wide Inc., to replace the 
board of directors with one willing to sell the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, however Eskimo Pie's board relented and agreed that  
shareholders wanted the company sold rather than restructured. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders reaffirmed the changed mandate of the existing  
board to sell the company, re-electing it Wednesday over an 
opposition slate put forth by Yogen Fruz. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got pretty much a mandate from our shareholders to go  
ahead and sell this company either in whole or in part,'' Eskimo 
Pie president David Kewer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kewer said the Richmond-based company, which sells Eskimo Pie  
chocolate bars, Oreo Big Stuff and Smart Ones, soon will begin 
looking for buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-based Yogen Fruz, which owns a 17 percent stake in  
Eskimo Pie, has made several offers to buy the company since 
November, but has not been successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Yogen Fruz operates about 3,500 frozen-yogurt outlets and  
recently entered the retail dessert market. 
</P>
<P>
	Yogen Fruz president Michael Serruya has accused Eskimo Pie of  
neglecting shareholders' interests by refusing to sell off the 
company. He said Eskimo Pie's parts were more valuable than the 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskimo Pie contended Yogen Fruz was merely trying to recoup its  
investment, having seen the price of Eskimo Pie stock it bought at 
$13 per share drift down to around $10. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Eskimo Pie rose 8 percent on the news of the company's  
planned sale, moving up 81 3/4 cents to $10.75 in trading Wednesday on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Kewer had hoped to keep the company together with several new  
concoctions and a restructuring plan using money from the recent 
$9.5 million sale of its flavorings division. But shareholders, 
some of whom bought the stock for as much as $17 a share after the 
company's initial public offering in 1992, believed it was time to 
cut their losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believed in the growth and restructuring plan, but they  
did not want to wait around for the time it would take to happen,'' 
Kewer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskimo Pie introduced its most famous product and namesake, an  
ice cream bar on a stick and covered with chocolate, in 1934. The 
company had $63.5 million in sales in 1998 but has been facing 
tougher and tougher competition from large industry competitors 
such as Nestle and Unilever.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks closed lower today as investors sold  
shares on concerns that upcoming Japanese economic data might 
indicate a slowing recovery. Those worries helped push up the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 66.12 points,  
or 0.37 percent, to close at 17,641.38. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 40.01 points, or 0.28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.22 yen in the late afternoon, up 0.42 yen  
from its level of 110.80 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above 
its late New York level of 110.81 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices slipped ahead of Thursday's  
release of Japan's April-June gross domestic product figures, 
traders said. GDP is the measure of all goods and services produced 
in a country. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists downgraded their forecasts for second quarter  
GDP on Tuesday following the release of weaker than expected 
corporate spending data for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan said it now predicts a 0.4 percent contraction in  
GDP, worse than the 0.1 percent decline it previously forecast. In 
the January-March period, Japan's GDP grew 2 percent from the 
previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The series of downgrades in economists' GDP forecasts hit  
market sentiment just as participants had become unsure about their 
earlier predictions of a steady economic recovery,'' said Kazunori 
Shimono, manager of equity trading at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall in prices was limited, however, by expectations that  
the government might come up with a big supplementary budget to 
support the economy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 44.32 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,034.13. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 2.05 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,502.57. 
The TOPIX closed down 7.46 points, or 0.49 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said worries over economic growth  
helped lift the dollar higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 118.24 yen in the  
late afternoon, up from 116.82 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 215 10-year Japanese government  
bond was unchanged at 1.8150 percent from Tuesday's finish. Its 
price remained at 100.71 yen.

<HEADLINE> PGA Tour To Return to Philadelphia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Philadelphia area will be the  
first stop when the PGA Tour returns to Pennsylvania in 2000 for 
the first time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayneborough Country Club in Paoli, Pa., will be the first  
course used for the Pennsylvania Classic, which will make its debut 
Sept. 14-17, the tour announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The club has all the ingredients necessary to stage a  
first-class PGA Tour event,'' commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``I 
know our players will agree when they compete there next 
September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new tournament had the backing of Arnold Palmer, and it was  
widely believed that the inaugural event would be played at Laurel 
Valley Country Club near where Palmer grew up in Latrobe. 
</P>
<P>
	But western Pennsylvania will have to wait until 2001. The tour  
plans to alternate the event between the eastern and western parts 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy that things are working out and we are going to  
have a Pennsylvania Classic next year,'' Palmer said. ``It's nice 
to have the tour back in my native state again after a long 
absence. I look forward to the tournament coming to western 
Pennsylvania, perhaps to Laurel Valley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nike Tour plays two events in Pennsylvania, but the last PGA  
Tour event there was the 1980 IVB-Philadelphia Classic at 
Whitemarsh Valley Country Club in Lafayette Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	When the U.S. Amateur was played at Merion in 1989, the USGA  
used Waynesborough as one of two courses for the stroke-play 
qualifying rounds.

<HEADLINE> Watson Ready for Senior PGA Debut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Before Tom Watson could make his debut on  
the Senior PGA tour, he had to accept that age had slowed his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A year and a half ago, when I won the Colonial, it was, `Hey!  
I can still play with these guys,' '' Watson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, he made the cut in just seven of the 13 PGA  
events in which he competed, finishing no higher than 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who turned 50 Saturday, will make his seniors debut in  
the Comfort Classic at the Brickyard. The 54-hole tournament begins 
Friday on the grounds of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching other aging golfers such as Lee Trevino and Hale Irwin  
struggle to keep up with younger players helped convince Watson to 
change gears. His 1998 divorce from his wife of 25 years also 
affected his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was time to pass the baton, but it is hard to let go of it  
when you have to pass it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson remarried again last week, and believes his focus and his  
game are getting back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here because this is the first tournament I'm eligible  
for,'' said Watson, who will play a minimal fall schedule before 
competing in earnest next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My game is a little sporadic. My driver isn't going where I  
want it to go. But it isn't exactly out of control,'' he said. ``If 
I can shoot between 12- and 16-under, I should have a chance to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving from the rigors of competing against younger players over  
longer courses doesn't guarantee success on the seniors tour, said 
Watson, who had been the leading active winner on the PGA tour with 
34 professional victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Baiocchi won last year's Comfort Classic with a  
tournament-record 196, 20-under. Watson shot 68 during Wednesday's 
pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to be right on here to shoot the type of scores  
Hugh Baiocchi shot here last year,'' Watson said. ``The greens are 
holding much better than the greens on the regular tour. And these 
guys can flat play. I've been watching their scores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson said he's looking forward to playing against many of his  
old friends now competing on the seniors tour. But he won't see 
them all just yet. The tour's top four money-winners, Hale Irwin, 
Bruce Fleisher, Allen Doyle and Larry Nelson, are skipping this 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Watson expects the adrenalin to flow when he tees off  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is I will be in competition and I will be nervous,  
anxious and nervous,'' he said. ``I hope the first tee ball is a 
good one.''

<HEADLINE> Etch-A-Sketch Maker Hopes To Renew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Ohio (AP) -- The company that makes the Etch-A-Sketch  
hopes its shaky financial picture will take shape in the coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	A new line of sports toys and the popular Betty Spaghetty doll  
have Ohio Art Co. officials optimistic that they will rebound from 
a year that has seen them lose their chief lender. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy maker, which had its stock pulled off the American Stock  
Exchange in May because of financial losses, revealed Friday that 
it had defaulted on $17.7 million in loans from Fifth Third Bancorp 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's auditors, accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young, also said  
in the report that Ohio Art's finances ``raise substantial doubt'' 
about its business. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the grim prognosis, the company's vice president for  
finance said the bottom line is improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two quarters of this year we had a good  
turnaround,'' Paul R. McCusty said Wednesday. ``It's just a matter 
of getting the financing in place. We're doing very well 
operationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio Art earned about $612,000 for the first six months this  
year -- compared with about $600,000 in losses for the same period 
last year, McCusty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will file much delayed first-quarter earnings  
reports this week, which could allow its stock to resume trading 
within two weeks, McCusty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest blow came last year, right before the holiday  
shopping season, when a retailer -- he wouldn't say which one -- 
canceled a $15.2 million order for toys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I was devastated,'' McCusty said, noting that some  
of those toys are still sitting in the company's warehouse. ``We 
had reported a profit through the first three quarters and 
anticipated a good year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio Art said that in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, it lost  
$1.8 million, or $2.10 a share, compared with a loss of $5.1 
million, or $5.68 a share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Ohio Art's toys are made overseas, but its most famous  
toy, the Etch-A-Sketch, is manufactured in a factory in Bryan, 
about 50 miles west of Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers still turn out the small plastic box on which kids for  
almost 40 years have scrawled their art -- then erased their 
mistakes with a quick shake. Ohio Art has sold more than 100 
million of the toys since they were introduced in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leibowitz, a toy industry analyst with Burnham Securities  
in New York, said the company is still in good shape, because of 
its metal-lithography operation that makes decorative trays, 
canisters and other colorful metal products with company logos and 
advertising slogans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe they are going to be out of business soon or  
otherwise,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: No US Troops for East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said today the  
United States has no plans to contribute troops to any peacekeeping 
force for Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, responding bluntly to questions from reporters on the  
Pentagon lawn, said it is up to the Indonesian government and the 
international community to respond to the growing post-election 
violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is not planning an insertion of any  
peacekeeping forces,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``We will look  
at what is the appropriate level of assistance we can give, whether 
it be logistical or technical support or other. But I can tell you 
that there's been no decision made on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the situation in East Timor is ``clearly very  
serious and very dangerous.'' He said economic assistance to 
Indonesia from Washington and multilateral organizations ``is 
dependent on them adopting an approach that will restore order and 
avert a humanitarian catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific forces commander,  
Adm. Dennis Blair, confirmed that Blair would visit Indonesia this 
week. The Malaysian news agency Bernama reported he would meet 
Thursday with Indonesia's top commander, Gen. Wiranto, in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman, Lt. Col. Dewey Ford in Honolulu, said he had no  
details on the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, Cohen said military-to-military contacts with  
Indonesia would continue, although there have been no joint 
military exercises since June 1998. A U.S.-Indonesian training 
exercise focused on humanitarian and disaster relief activites 
concluded Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen called upon the Indonesian government to act ``swiftly and  
effectively'' to quell violence caused by anti-independence militia 
groups defying the vote by East Timorese to become an independent 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government of Indonesia is responsible for bringing order  
and peace to East Timor,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the international community continues to look at ``a  
number of levers it can pull'' to put pressure on Indonesia to 
resolve the crisis, including economic isolation. He said market 
forces are also playing a role. The U.S. government, however, would 
react with other countries to any serious instability in the 
region, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not spell out what U.S. reaction would be but repeated  
assertions that the United States cannot act as the world's 
policeman and has to be selective in crises where it commits 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's premature for the United States to be talking  
about any peacekeeping force at this time,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been a dramatic deterioration in the security  
situation in East Timor since the referendum nine days ago, giving 
rise to a number of calls for the establishment of a U.N.-sponsored 
international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has made clear it has no plans for  
any high-profile involvement in such a force but also has not ruled 
out the possibility of some support role. 
</P>
<P>
	If such a force is formed, ``We would obviously look at ways to  
be helpful,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, East Timorese activist Jose Ramos Horta, co-winner of  
the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, told a news conference in Washington 
today that the Timorese people ``need an unequivocal commitment to 
send a peace enforcement mission to East Timor'' or else they 
``will be doomed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the United Nations fails to act, ``I don't think people  
around the world will ever again trust the United Nations,'' Horta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also called for a freeze on World Bank and International  
Monetary Fund programs for Indonesia as a means of bringing added 
pressure on the Jakarta government.

<HEADLINE> First Public ROTC High School Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As the Stars and Stripes are raised to the sound  
of drums and bugles, dozens of teen-agers in uniform struggle to 
line up under the frowning gaze of a retired Army major. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not an elite private military school. It's an inner-city  
public high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Military Academy opened last month as the first  
public school in the nation run by the Army's Junior Reserve 
Officer Training Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 150 students attend military-style classes in a  
historic South Side armory where black recruits once drilled before 
marching off to the battlefields of World War I. But the school's 
aim is to send students to college, not to war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not training soldiers,'' said retired Brig. General  
Frank Bacon, the school's commandant. ``We are using military 
methodology to educate these students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Vallas, chief executive of the Chicago's public schools,  
said students who participate in JROTC perform a half-grade to a 
full grade higher academically. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids are motivated,'' Vallas said. ``It helps them to  
develop self-confidence, self-esteem and comradeship. It helps to 
develop character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school's staff members chose students they believed wouldn't  
chafe under a military regimen. Both the students and their parents 
were interviewed, the parents to determine if they would support 
the school by volunteering their time. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's principal, Col. Charles Fleming of the Illinois  
National Guard, calls his students average kids, their only 
distinction being they are qualified to attend high school. A few 
gifted students have enrolled, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``In four years, they will be head and shoulders over your  
regular high school graduate because of their leadership skills,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruby Cruz, 14, rises at the crack of dawn to get to school by 7  
a.m. She said she decided to attend because she wants a college 
scholarship and needs discipline, though she's more interested in 
becoming a pediatrician than in making a career of the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of a bad girl,'' she said. ``I never did my chores  
and I hung out on the streets with the wrong crowd. I think this 
will help me do better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students, who attend classes in JROTC uniform, eat breakfast  
together when they arrive. Roll call follows 20 minutes later in 
the drill hall. The raising of the colors takes place outside the 
main entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent morning, the band played a ragged ``To the Colors''  
during the flag-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone in the class will be in the band,'' Bacon said. ``As  
a marching academy, we need a band. Next year, the incoming class 
also will be required to learn to play an instrument. It is a skill 
they can use later in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students take English, math, science and other college  
preparatory courses. They also study military history, military 
science and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hallways, there's none of the usual high school noise or  
horseplay. Students move quietly, greeting Bacon and Fleming 
respectfully in shy voices, but without salutes or exclamations of 
``Sir!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discipline is expected. Tardiness is not tolerated.  
</P>
<P>
	``We only had one late today,'' Bacon said, pointing over his  
shoulder at a girl. ``She's over there right now getting ... chewed 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There won't be a summer break for these students, who must take  
classes and participate in a two-week military camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The school is situated in the 8th Regiment Armory, once home to  
the nation's first black-commanded infantry unit. Bacon, backed by 
city officials, led the effort to renovate the 1914 armory at a 
cost of $24 million. A $10 million annex to be completed next year 
will allow the school to grow to 540 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Moskos, a Northwestern University sociology professor  
who studies the military, noted that private military schools are 
booming, so it makes sense for a public school to offer the same 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, these schools attracted the affluent and those  
who are in trouble,'' Moskos said. ``It will be interesting to see 
if this school will draw the squared-away kids or the troubled 
ones.''

<HEADLINE> Summit May Aid China WTO Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House raised the possibility  
Wednesday of a trade breakthrough when President Clinton meets with 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in New Zealand on the eve of a summit 
of Pacific Rim leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling said the administration  
hopes the discussions between the two presidents on Saturday 
``would at least lead to a resumption of negotiations and 
momentum'' toward a deal that would allow China to join the World 
Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first Clinton-Jiang meeting in 15 months. Since  
then, relations plummeted on allegations of Chinese spying and 
theft of U.S. nuclear secrets, the U.S. bombing of the Chinese 
embassy in Yugoslavia and tensions between China and rival Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade talks were frozen by the May 7 embassy bombing in  
Belgrade. The negotiations are aimed at allowing China's entry into 
the WTO, a move that would require Beijing to lower trade barriers 
and presumably lead to greatly increased access of U.S. products in 
Chinese markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparations for Saturday's meeting, U.S. Assistant Trade  
Representative Robert Cassidy met with China's top WTO negotiator 
in Beijing this week. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky 
is to meet with Chinese trade officials in New Zealand before the 
two leaders sit down. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will leave Washington late Thursday, crossing the  
international dateline after a refueling stop in Hawaii and 
arriving in Auckland Saturday morning. Saturday's only appointment 
is with Jiang. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will meet jointly Sunday with Presidents Keizo  
Obuchi of Japan and Kim Dae-jung of South Korea, discussing North 
Korea's suspected preparations to test a long-range ballistic 
missile. Clinton also will meet with Russia's new prime minister, 
Vladimir Putin, on the heels of new allegations about Russian 
corruption and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Sunday, Clinton will join leaders for the opening talks of  
the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC). 
</P>
<P>
	``APEC met last year in the shadow of Asia's financial crisis,''  
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said. ``It will meet next 
week in the wake of a surprisingly strong recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to economic issues, the meeting also will focus on  
security matters, particularly the violence by pro-Indonesia 
militias in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger hinted that failure by Indonesia to resolve the crisis,  
or to request the assistance of the international community, could 
result in the withholding of Western financial support to the 
populous island nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``How the Indonesian government deals with the challenges in  
East Timor will have implications for the capacity of the 
international community to support Indonesia's economic program,'' 
Berger told a White House briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	After the conclusion of the APEC meeting, Clinton will fly to  
Queenstown on Tuesday for a day of rest. On Wednesday, the 
president will travel to Christchurch, a southern city that is the 
starting point for most American expeditions to the Antarctic. 
</P>
<P>
	He will speak at the Antartica Center about efforts to protect  
the global environment. The president also will meet with New 
Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and opposition leader Helen 
Clarke. He also is to attend a black-tie dinner given by Shipley 
before a late takeoff for home. En route to Washington, Clinton 
will stop in Hawaii again for refueling and a day of golf.

<HEADLINE> 'Swamp Boogie Queen' Dead at 63 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEAGUE CITY, Texas (AP) -- Katie Webster, the blues singer known  
as ``The Swamp Boogie Queen'' for her frenetic, two-fisted piano 
style, has died. She was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Webster died Sunday of a heart attack at her home in League  
City, just southeast of her native Houston, according to her record 
label. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Kathryn Jewel Thorne, Ms. Webster first learned to play  
gospel and classical music. 
</P>
<P>
	Her parents, wary of secular influences, kept the piano locked  
up so she couldn't play unsupervised. But, thanks to an old Philco 
radio she smuggled into her bedroom, Ms. Webster was exposed to the 
earthly, earthy tunes they discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen, she moved in with more permissive relatives in south  
Louisiana and, by age 15, became one of the most requested studio 
musicians in the region. Her music appears on more than 500 singles 
cut in the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	A young Otis Redding discovered her playing with her band in  
1964. She toured with him until his death in a 1967 plane crash 
that might have killed her, except she couldn't fly because she was 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Devastated, Ms. Webster essentially stopped performing until the  
early 1980s, when she took Europe by storm. She also became a 
favorite in the U.S. blues festival circuit and recorded on the 
Chicago-based Alligator Records label with the likes of Robert Cray 
and Bonnie Raitt. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1993 stroke severely damaged her eyesight and use of her left  
hand, but she continued to appear at select festivals. 
</P>
<P>
	An Associated Press reviewer, critiquing February's ``Deluxe  
Edition,'' a compilation album featuring past recordings, wrote 
that Ms. Webster ``combined a soulful voice with a rollicking piano 
style to reign as Queen of the Boogie.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos Can't Keep Elway on Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A plan brewing at Denver Broncos headquarters to  
keep retired quarterback John Elway on the roster fell flat because 
of his appearance in beer commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos hoped to free some space under the salary cap by  
keeping Elway on the active list. But, instead of paying him $2.3 
million next season, the Broncos will have to pay him $3.9 million 
this season and $5 million next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The hangup was an NFL rule that bars players from endorsing or  
appearing in alcohol advertisements. Elway is appearing in a series 
of Coors beer commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	So Elway, who led Denver to back-to-back Super Bowl  
championships, was officially listed as retired last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos owner Pat Bowlen agreed that coach Mike Shanahan's idea  
to make space under the salary cap was a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have made it easier for us financially next year. But  
it's not going to happen, so let's get on with our life,'' Bowlen 
said. ``We've been good at managing the cap, and now we'll just 
have to do it without John being on the roster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway said he didn't know that Shanahan was considering keeping  
him on the active roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``He mentioned it to me six months ago, but hasn't talked to me  
about it since,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping Elway on the roster would have delayed his first shot at  
the Hall of Fame from 2004 to 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen said listing Elway on the active roster also would have  
created undue pressure on a man who is determined to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had two quarterbacks who went down, there would be 25  
players on John's front doorstop saying, `You're on the roster, why 
don't you just come back and hand off to Terrell (Davis)?''' Bowlen 
said.

<HEADLINE> TV Guide To Provide Listings to AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- TV Guide Inc. is becoming the main provider  
of TV program listings to America Online Inc. in an agreement the 
companies announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide Online, a subsidiary of TV Guide, will supply AOL, the  
nation's largest online service, with TV listings and synopses of 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide, based in Tulsa, Okla., will receive prominent  
placement in eight AOL Channels, or topic areas. Its listings also 
will be found on three other AOL-owned properties: AOL.com, 
CompuServe and Netscape Netcenter. 
</P>
<P>
	No money will change hands in the agreement, said TV Guide  
spokesman Ari Karpel said. ``We get something and (AOL gets) 
something. This is strictly about getting our name out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors responded positively to the deal, hoping that the  
added exposure on AOL could boost TV Guide's business. TV Guide's 
stock was up $3 or 11 percent at $31.37 1/2 in trading on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide will contribute daily online chats with TV stars and  
personalities on AOL Live and will provide localized television 
listings to Digital City, AOL's network of city guide Web sites in 
60 cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, TV Guide will customize age-appropriate viewing  
recommendations for AOL members. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online has more than 18 million members, and CompuServe  
has about 2 million. TV Guide magazine has a weekly circulation of 
about 34 million.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Lead Over Gore Widening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A growing desire for change in the nation's  
leadership is making it tough for Al Gore to close the gap on 
George W. Bush in a matchup of the two front-runners for their 
parties' presidential nominations, says a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, governor of Texas and front-runner for the Republican  
nomination, had the support of 56 percent and Gore, vice president 
and Democratic front-runner, had the backing of 37 percent in an 
ABC News-Washington Post poll out Wednesday. Bush had a similar 
lead in a matchup against the other Democrat in the race, former 
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, who formally announced his candidacy 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those leaning toward voting Republican, Bush had a  
four-to-one lead over his closest GOP competitor, former Cabinet 
member Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has a better than two-to-one lead over Bradley among those  
who lean toward voting Democratic. But incumbency may prove to be a 
burden for Gore when competing with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of those surveyed, 53 percent, said they are  
tired of President Clinton. And almost that many, 48 percent, said 
Gore is too close to Clinton to provide a fresh start for the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll's margin of error on such questions was plus or minus 3  
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bush and Gore were given credit for being honest and  
ethical by a majority, but Bush got far more credit for being a 
strong leader -- 70 percent to 38 percent for Gore. And two-thirds 
of those polled said Bush has the right kind of personality for the 
job, while half said that about Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of 10 said they felt Bush was an interesting candidate,  
while more than half said they found Gore boring. Seven of 10 say 
they need to know more about Bush, however, while just over half 
said that about Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people who say the country needs to move in a new  
direction has grown to almost half. Six months ago, more than half 
felt the country needed to keep moving in the same direction it has 
been moving under Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's advisers say they don't believe fatigue with the Clinton  
administration will be a major factor. But they have acknowledged 
that Gore's role as vice president may hinder public perception of 
him as a leader on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,526 adults was taken Aug. 30-Sept. 2, and its  
overall margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points was 
larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Filling in Health Insurance Gaps / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On any given day, tens of millions of Americans  
may be without health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	For many of them, however, it's only temporary. The gap may  
occur after college graduation when adult children are no longer 
covered under their parents' plans, for those between jobs or just 
starting new ones, or even with retirees on Medicare traveling 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Although this uninsured period is usually very brief -- often  
lasting just a few months, at most -- it can be a dangerous time 
financially if a serious illness or injury should occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a young person planning to enter graduate school who  
decided to forgo coverage one summer and came down with a rare 
nerve disorder,'' said Jonathan Pond, a Boston-based financial 
adviser. ``She spent weeks in intensive care ... (and incurred) 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``She lost a house that she had just inherited from her  
grandmother ... and faces (medical) payments for the next 20 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thankfully, there are several options available to prevent  
financial catastrophes like that one. 
</P>
<P>
	The first, and the most common one, is for individuals to  
continue the group coverage offered by their former employers until 
they become eligible to participate in a new employer's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees can purchase COBRA benefits (named for the  
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986), but 
they'll have to pay the entire premium, plus administrative costs. 
Coverage can be continued for up to 18 months, and in some 
instances, up to 36 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Young adults who may no longer be eligible for their parents'  
group policy, either because of their age or because they are no 
longer full-time students, might be able to continue coverage under 
COBRA. (COBRA benefits, though, usually aren't available under 
college health plans.) 
</P>
<P>
	Another option is to purchase health insurance through a  
professional group or trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can join a local chamber of commerce or state business  
association, which are basically in the business of offering group 
coverage,'' Pond added. 
</P>
<P>
	A third option is to purchase short-term health insurance, which  
typically provides coverage for one to six months. Such plans are 
often indemnity plans, which means individuals are free to choose 
their own doctors or hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike most regular health care plans, there are usually  
many restrictions. For instance, many temporary plans do not cover 
maternity costs as well as some pre-existing health problems. Also, 
some states don't permit the sale of short-term policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Costs vary by age, state where the insured party resides,  
deductibles and coverage plans chosen. The higher the deductible, 
the lower the premium. Also, in some instances, the shorter the 
term, the less costly the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	A 40-year-old nonsmoking man from Miami, for instance, can  
expect to pay a total of $391.68 for a standard three-month policy 
with a $250 deductible offered by Fortis Health Insurance Co. in 
Milwaukee (www.healthaxis.com). That same policy with a $2,500 
deductible would come to a single payment of $195.84. 
</P>
<P>
	A 23-year-old nonsmoking woman from Los Angeles would pay  
$180.58 initially, then $57.02 a month for a 95-day standard policy 
with a $2,500 deductible, renewable for up to 185 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Other insurance carriers or agents can easily provide quick  
quotes, either over the telephone or through the Internet. Some Web 
sites to check: www.insure.com; www.goldenrule.com; 
www.quickquote.com; www.champion-ins.com. 
</P>
<P>
	For the traveling retiree covered by Medicare, short-term travel  
insurance may be sufficient. Traditional Medicare, many Medicare 
HMO plans and Medigap policies generally don't cover medical 
problems abroad. The insurance department in your state should be 
able to provide a list of insurance carriers that offer temporary 
health insurance plans designed for international travel.

	Bank of England Raises Interest Rate  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A torrid housing market and other signs of a  
fast-recovering economy led the Bank of England to raise a key 
interest rate for the first time in more than a year, in a move 
that unsettled stock markets in Britain and the United States. The 
base lending rate was increased to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. The 
base rate is the interest Britain's central bank charges commercial 
banks for loans and last was raised in June 1998. The increase

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A barrage of conflicting signals on interest  
rates kept investors off balance today, leaving the Dow industrials 
little changed while most stocks ended with modest losses. At the 
close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average 
was up 2.21 at 11,036.34. Broader stock indicators were mostly 
lower. The fear of higher interest rates, which has rattled stock

	GDP Revision Paints Healthy Economy

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy will look a little healthier --  
growth has been even better than previously thought and Americans 
haven't been as free-spending -- as the government changes its 
calculations. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis 
announced the planned changes today as part of an effort to adjust 
the gross domestic product to better reflect changes in the economy 
and new sources of data. Experts said the changes should give the 
Federal Reserve and other policy-makers a more accurate picture of 
the economy but would not result in any policy shift.

mortgage debt, advanced at a 7.9 percent annual rate in July to a

today. All told, consumers borrowed $8.8 billion more in July than

<HEADLINE> Nets' Eschmeyer Injures Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Nets draft choice Evan  
Eschmeyer ruptured a shoulder muscle while working out at home and 
will have surgery, the team said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eschmeyer ruptured the muscle during strength training at his  
home in Illinois last week, the Nets said. He will have surgery on 
Thursday, and his status will be evaluated after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Eschmeyer, a center from Northwestern, was chosen 34th overall  
by the Nets in this year's NBA draft. He averaged 16.1 points and 
shot almost 60 percent from the field in his college career. The 
6-foot-11 Eschmeyer averaged 19.6 points and 10.1 rebounds, 12th 
best in the country, last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Eschmeyer, 24, has suffered injuries before. A 1993 break in his  
right foot required surgery and sidelined him for two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Monroe Items To Be Auctioned Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The sweater is frumpy and spotted with  
stains. The platform shoes have seen better days. Nevertheless, 
some people still consider them relics. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie's has put 20 items once owned by Marilyn Monroe in a  
traveling exhibition to promote its auction of Monroe memorabilia 
in New York on Oct. 27 and 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe, who died of a drug overdose in 1962, left most of her  
estate to acting coach Lee Strasberg. Strasberg's widow, Anna, has 
contracted with Christie's to auction more than 1,500 of Monroe's 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
	The small touring collection has been showed in New York, Los  
Angeles and now St. Petersburg, Fla. Stops in London and then Paris 
also are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons Marilyn's myth endures is that despite the  
apparent glamour of her life, people perceive her as the salt of 
the earth,'' Amy Wexler, who is in charge of special projects and 
tours for Christie's, said Wednesday. ``People identify with her 
heartache and tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> Credit Suisse Profit Up 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Credit Suisse Group AG said Wednesday  
its first-half profits rose 11 percent despite a drop in earnings 
in its investment banking business. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking company said it earned the equivalent of $1.78  
billion, up from $1.6 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its investment bank, Credit Suisse First  
Boston, reported a 4 percent decline in first-half net profit to 
$676 million as it sought to reduce risks after its exposure to 
Russian bonds last year. A drop in market activity in Europe also 
affected Credit Suisse First Boston's results. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse Group said it plans to expand businesses such as  
asset management and insurance that are less volatile than 
investment banking. These businesses contributed 62 percent of the 
company's profits during the first half, up from 58 percent a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse said its second-half performance will fall short  
of its first-half results, but predicted good results for the whole 
year.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Criticizes Gore, Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUREL, Del. (AP) -- Millionaire publisher and Republican  
presidential contender Steve Forbes said prayer and the Ten 
Commandments have a place in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stump speech Wednesday in southern Delaware, Forbes did not  
mention any of his Republican opponents for the party nomination by 
name, keeping most of his verbal jabs for Vice President Al Gore, 
the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	After his speech he answered a question from the audience about  
the Ten Commandments, which he believes should be posted in 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is easier, in many instances, to bring a copy of Hitler's  
'Mein Kampf' into a school than it is to bring in a Bible,'' Forbes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said something similar in June after the House passed a  
legislative amendment allowing the display of the Ten Commandments 
as a means of ending some school violence. Democrats, like Gore and 
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, have questioned the 
effectiveness and the constitutionality of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was the target of several Forbes jokes and criticisms. The  
vice president is part of a Washington political culture that makes 
promises but never delivers, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times, for example, have they said they're going to  
save Social Security?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' platform seemed sound to Marie Harrington, 46, of  
Roxanna. But because she wasn't sure if Forbes could win the GOP 
nomination, she said she didn't know whether she would vote for him 
in the state's Feb. 15 Republican caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a tough battle for Forbes again,'' she said.  
``I don't know if its because of the way he comes across or not. 
It's a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Forbes impressed retired school teacher, Jack Lucia, 62.  
Foremost was Forbes' stance on abortion: Forbes opposes it, but 
also recognizes that not everyone agrees and is willing to work 
toward a consensus that would restrict partial-birth abortions and 
make teen-agers get parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked what he said about staking out a common ground,''  
Lucia said. ``I can't say we're Forbes supporters, but we're 
certainly not against him.''

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Gish Jen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Gish Jen's cast of internationally  
minded characters don't slide into the great American melting pot 
without some trial and trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's the friction of assimilation that fuels her latest  
short-story collection, ``Who's Irish?,'' which explores the 
idiosyncrasies of Chinese and Irish culture. 
</P>
<P>
	In the collection's title story, an elderly Chinese woman is  
comically bewildered by the attitudes of her Americanized daughter, 
Natalie, and her chronically unemployed Irish-American son-in-law, 
John Shea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beautiful wife, beautiful daughter, beautiful house, oven can  
clean itself automatically. ... If John lived in China, he would be 
very happy. But he is not happy. Even at the gym things go wrong. 
One day, he pull a muscle. Another day, weight room too crowded. 
Always something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another story, ``Duncan in China,'' follows an aimless, 30-ish  
Chinese-American who moves to China to escape the shadow of his 
BMW-driving, import-export tycoon brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan longs for the mythical China of ``nobility and  
restraint,'' But he's mortified to find his Western sensibilities 
thoroughly ruffled by the poverty and political oppression he finds 
in modern-day Shandong. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending time with a relative scarred by the Cultural  
Revolution, Duncan comes to the iconoclastic realization that ``the 
China of the early 1980s had more to do with eating melon seeds 
around a coal heater the size of a bread box than about Sung 
dynasty porcelain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jen, 43, is no stranger to cultural mix-and-match. The child of  
immigrant parents who came to America to study but were prevented 
from returning by the Communist revolution, Jen was raised in 
affluent Scarsdale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	During an arty phase in her teen-age years, she changed her  
first name from Lillian to Gish, after the silent-screen actress of 
the same name. 
</P>
<P>
	When she finished high school, Jen went to Harvard University  
where she graduated with a degree in English. Although she loved to 
write, she spent an aimless semester in business school at Stanford 
University before committing to a career as a novelist. 
</P>
<P>
	A stint in 1985 at Radcliffe College's Bunting Institute helped  
create an ``atmosphere of expectation'' that allowed her to write 
professionally, Jen said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent interview in the kitchen of her Cambridge home,  
about a mile from the Harvard campus, Jen said her own life is a 
hodgepodge of work, travel and time spent with family -- her 
third-generation Irish-American husband, their young son and infant 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	She said a desire to stir up the cultural cauldron and see what  
bubbled to the top helped drive her 1996 breakthrough novel, ``Mona 
in the Promised Land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A comedic tale of a Chinese-American teen-ager's quest to  
convert to Judaism, the book could have rubbed the politically 
correct crowd -- both Jewish and Chinese -- the wrong way, Jen 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of nervous,'' she admitted. ``But it's less a  
matter of political correctness than political sensitivity. If you 
are slightly insensitive, you will get nailed. You have to do your 
homework.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, ``Mona'' received raves from reviewers, but  
more important, was embraced by critics like Cynthia Ozick, who 
often writes about Jewish culture. 
</P>
<P>
	That affirmation, Jen said, gave her the confidence to tackle  
more serious social issues, like domestic violence, in ``Who's 
Irish?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jen's success has much to do with talent. But she is also the  
beneficiary of happy timing -- bringing her stories forth when 
audiences are ready and willing to hear them. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first book, ``Typical American,'' emerged in 1991, just as  
Chinese-American novelists like Amy Tan and Gus Lee were writing 
best sellers and readers of all ethnic backgrounds were showing 
unprecedented interest in multicultural fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Jen's hard-luck story of immigrants Ralph and Helen Chang, and  
their struggle to find security and happiness in 1950s America, 
struck a nerve. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just as Chinese-Americans as a group were coming into  
their own as a minority population eager to explore their ancient 
and modern heritage, Jen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an openness and receptivity on the part of the  
audience,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The novel was meant to consider the evolution of the American  
Dream from the purely economic goals of the newly arrived immigrant 
to the pursuit of life's less tangible pots of gold: love, social 
status, spiritual peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long way from Horatio Alger,'' she said. ``I wanted to  
made the reader reconsider what a 'typical American' really is. The 
second generation (of immigrants) have a very different set of 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And ``Who's Irish?'' arrived on bookshelves this summer, just as  
the short story form enjoys a popular revival. The book keeps 
company with new collections by fiction powerhouses such as Alice 
Munro, Lorrie Moore, Annie Proulx and Alice Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jen said she admires other contemporary short-story writers,  
while also drawing inspiration from enduring women authors like 
Grace Paley and Jane Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozick and Jamaica Kincaid also rate highly for their daring,  
unconventional approaches to prose. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are fearlessly bad,'' she chuckled. ``I'm fearfully  
bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jen said she is still deciding whether to produce another novel  
or more short stories. 
</P>
<P>
	There are potential projects ``simmering,'' she said, politely  
declining to reveal more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a great time being a mom right now,'' she said. ``I  
am very, very lucky.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Fight Orlin Norris in Oct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Orlin Norris, who despite a winning record and  
world title has boxed in the shadow of brother Terry, will be Mike 
Tyson's first opponent since his release from a Maryland jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-round fight Oct. 23 is signed for the MGM Grand in Las  
Vegas and will be televised on Showtime, a source close to Tyson, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the second bout of the year for Tyson, who was  
released May 24 from a Maryland jail, where he had served 3 1/2 months 
for assaulting two motorists over a fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris was a second choice to fight the 33-year-old former  
undisputed heavyweight champion. James ``Buster'' Douglas, who 
knocked out Tyson in a shocking upset in 1990, appeared to be the 
first choice but was ruled out for not being in good physical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris is the 33-year-old brother of Terry Norris, who was  
considered one of the best fighters in the world when he was a 
super middleweight champion early in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson already is training in Las Vegas for what will be his  
first bout since he knocked out Francois Botha with a right to the 
jaw in the fifth round Jan. 16 in the MGM Grand. Tyson was trailing 
on all three cards after four rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be only the second time in his 10 fights since 1990 that  
Tyson has not fought on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who was a WBA cruiserweight champion in 1993-95, has  
posted a 50-5 record since turning pro in 1986. He has 27 knockouts 
but he is known more as a crafty boxer than a banger. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris figures to give Tyson some rounds, which Tyson needs. He  
doesn't figure to have the power or strength to beat him. In two of 
his losses, Norris was stopped in the eighth round by Bert Cooper 
in 1990 and he was knocked out in the eight round by Nate Miller 
when he lost the cruiserweight title in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last fight, Norris stopped Pele Reid in the first round  
in England. In three fights before that, he lost a 12-round 
decision to Henry Akinwande and won 12-round decisions over Adolpho 
Washington and Nate Miller for the fringe IBA heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tyson-Norris fight is being billed as something called the  
WBC international heavyweight title.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Family To Sell Ranch to Govt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A huge cattle ranch known for its stunning  
vistas, trout streams and one of the nation's largest wild elk 
herds will become public land under a deal reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of negotiations, a Texas family agreed to sell  
the 95,000-acre Baca Ranch to the federal government for $101 
million in a deal that environmentalists had been pushing to 
preserve open space in northern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was hailed by The Wilderness Society, which  
called the ranch ``a scientific treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This place deserves to be added to the federal public land  
system for the American people,'' said Pamela Pride Eaton, 
Denver-based regional director of society. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still needs congressional approval.  
</P>
<P>
	``While we are still a long way from the day when people can  
hike and fish up there, I can say in all honesty that we have never 
been this close to a deal,'' said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranch contains the Valles Caldera, the collapsed crater of  
an ancient volcano that has been closed to the public since 1860. 
</P>
<P>
	Situated in the Jemez Mountains, the area features mountain  
towers, grassy meadows, trout streams and six valleys that include 
the Valle Grande, which stretches nearly six miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranch is owned by the heirs of oil man James P. Dunigan, who  
died in 1980. It was a land grant in 1860 to the heirs of a Spanish 
leader, and the property remained mostly intact as it passed 
through three owners before the Dunigans bought it in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	They paid $2.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The heirs said they wanted to be sure the property was never  
developed. The forests on the ranch had been extensively logged 
before the Dunigans bought it, but a new growth of trees masks most 
of the scars of clear-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	There are scattered sheds and cabins and an eight-bedroom lodge  
for hunters. Wildlife abounds, including bear, mountain lion, bald 
eagles and golden eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 miles northwest of Santa Fe, the ranch is surrounded by  
publicly owned lands in the Santa Fe National Forest and Bandelier 
National Monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Congress authorized a $40 million down payment for  
the purchase, and the White House agreed that a trust should be set 
up to manage the property. 
</P>
<P>
	Those supporting the deal include the Sierra Club and the  
Wilderness Society, as well as officials with the U.S. Forest 
Service and the President's Council on Environmental Quality.

<HEADLINE> 7 in 10 Drug Users Work Full-Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven in 10 people who used illegal drugs in  
1997 had full-time jobs, the government reports. Officials hope the 
data will dispel notions that most drug users are burned out and 
disconnected from the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``The typical drug user is not poor and unemployed,'' said Barry  
McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director. ``He or she can be 
a co-worker, a husband or wife, a parent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 6.3 million full-time workers, ages 18 to 49 -- or 7.7  
percent -- admitted in 1997 using illegal drugs in the preceding 
month, according to the report issued every few years by the 
Department of Health and Human Services. The proportion has been 
steady since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers in restaurants, bars, construction and transportation  
were more likely than others to use drugs, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS officials were using the report's findings to encourage  
businesses to establish treatment programs. Increasingly, drug 
users are working in medium-sized companies, which have the 
resources to establish these programs, they said. Still, 44 percent 
of drug users were working for small businesses -- those with fewer 
than 25 employees, down from 57 percent in 1994 but still the 
largest category. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you are corporate CEO or a small-business owner, you  
need to know that simple, low-burden, effective steps ... can 
increase workplace safety and productivity and lower substance 
abuse and its human and economic effects,'' said Nelba Chavez, 
administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration, the HHS agency that produced the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found that in 1997:  
</P>
<P>
	--Young adults, men, whites and those with less than a high  
school education were more likely to use drugs than other workers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nineteen percent of food preparation workers, waiters,  
waitresses and bartenders used illegal drugs. For construction 
workers, it was 14 percent; for transportation and material moving 
workers, it was 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Workers who used drugs were more likely to have worked for  
three or more employers, to have left a job in the past year and to 
have skipped a day or more of work in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is based on an annual household survey of Americans  
about their drug and alcohol use. Every few years, the government 
includes questions about respondents' workplace in order to conduct 
this analysis. In 1997, there were 7,957 workers ages 18 to 49 who 
participated in the survey. They are statistically representative 
of the nation's 81.8 million full-time workers.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Speech Pushes Dow Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned higher today as Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan made no mention of inflation in a speech 
today, instead praising technological advances that have 
contributed to ``the greatest prosperity the world has ever 
experienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 57.30 at 11,091.43. The Dow had tumbled as much as 
66 points in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also turned slightly higher after an  
early decline. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.94 at 
1,353.39, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 7.95 at 2,845.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks began rising as the text of Greenspan's speech in Grand  
Rapids, Mich., hit news wires. Greenspan discussed a wide range of 
topics, from the benefits of free-market economies to the need for 
fairness in business dealings, but did not discuss U.S. interest 
rates or inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns that the Fed will raise for a third time this year in  
its own quest to hold down inflation have pressured stock and bond 
markets. Stocks initially tumbled today after the Bank of England 
increased its base lending rate for the first time in more than a 
year, following a string of seven cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that while Britain's rate increase may have  
temporarily stunned the markets, it was unlikely to affect the 
course of interest rates in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bank of England's action may not mean anything in  
particular for the rest of the world,'' said Tim O'Neill, chief 
economist for the Bank of Montreal and Harris Bank. ``Britain is 
facing many of the same issues, with tight labor market and strong 
domestic spending, but the Fed is more concerned about what's 
happening in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strength in certain technology companies helped turn the market  
around. Global Crossing, the architect of an undersea fiber 
network, shot up 3 1/2 to 23 13/16 after the company agreed to sell a 
portion of its cable to Microsoft and Softbank for $350 million in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier Corp., a long-distance provider that Global Crossing  
plans to acquire, rose 5 15/16 to 42 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's strength came from Chevron, up 2 1/8 to 95 5/16, and J.P.  
Morgan, which picked up 2 1/2 to 131 9/16. J.P. Morgan has been one of 
the most volatile Dow components throughout the interest-rate 
debate, falling steeply on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-8 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 352.2 million 
shares, well ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 0.68 to 437.56.

<HEADLINE> More Minority Clerks in High Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court will begin its 1999-2000  
term next month with the most minority law clerks in recent memory, 
but they were chosen before civil rights groups and some members of 
Congress criticized the justices' hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new class of 35 law clerks at work for the highest  
court's nine justices are five minority clerks -- two blacks and 
three Asian-Americans. By comparison, last year's class included 
one, a Hispanic. Court employees could not remember any recent term 
in which the justices employed more than three minority clerks. 
</P>
<P>
	Each justice hires three or four recent law school graduates to  
help with screening new cases and researching and drafting 
opinions. The one-year jobs are prizes for young lawyers, most 
often leading to high-paying posts in law firms or law schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999-2000 law clerk class includes 23 men and 12 women, all  
of whom previously worked for federal appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today reported in March 1998 that blacks comprised less than  
2 percent of the law clerks hired by the courts current justices 
during their tenures, and that less than 25 percent of their law 
clerks had been women. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, three members of Congress urged the justices to  
participate in ``a dialogue with minority bar associations 
regarding the hiring process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist told Reps. Danny Davis of  
Illinois, Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Gregory Meeks of New 
York, all Democrats, that such a dialogue would be 
``inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,  
National Organization for Women and the predominantly black 
National Bar Association also criticized what they perceived to be 
the court's lack of commitment to racial and gender diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP President Kweisi Mfume was among 18 people arrested in  
October for carrying a protest demonstration onto court property. 
</P>
<P>
	The court routinely chooses law clerks a full year before they  
begin work. All 35 current law clerks were chosen by last summer, 
court sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before a House appropriations subcommittee in March,  
Justices David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas, the court's only 
black member, defended the court's collective hiring record. Both 
said the justices rely on recommendations from law schools and 
federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivy League law schools for years have provided the bulk of  
Supreme Court law clerks, and some federal appeals court judges 
have earned reputations as ``feeders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current 35 law clerks include four who previously worked for  
J. Harvie Wilkinson III, chief judge of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals, and three who worked for his conservative 4th Circuit 
colleague, J. Michael Luttig. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia hired three of those clerks. The others  
are working for Thomas, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the new law clerks spent last year working for Judge  
Michael Boudin, a liberal member of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals. They were hired by Souter, John Paul Stevens and Stephen 
G. Breyer.

<HEADLINE> Moss Says Vikings Have Lost Feeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Randy Moss sounded the alarm. The  
star receiver says the Minnesota Vikings don't have that special 
feeling they did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He sees evidence everywhere -- from the mood in the locker room  
to the play on the field. Things just aren't the same for this new 
cast of Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably something we probably could recapture,''  
Moss said Wednesday. ``But last year, it was something special. It 
was something inside that knew the '98 Minnesota Vikings were 
something special. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this year, we lost a lot of guys on defense. We have our  
whole offense back (but) we lost our offensive coordinator. ... So, 
there's a lot of things that we have to get used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss's worries stem from a lackluster exhibition season in which  
the Vikings looked nothing like the team that went 15-1 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost eight free agents in the offseason and failed on draft  
day to shore up the holes left by the departures of defensive stars 
Jerry Ball, Derrick Alexander and Corey Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite returning all 11 starters, the offense, under new  
coordinator Ray Sherman, has yet to get untracked. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss, who set a rookie record with 17 TD catches last season,  
alternately proclaimed his team ready to put its troubles behind 
and bemoaned its many inadequacies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hard. It's going to be a struggle this  
year,'' he said. ``You know there's a lot of high expectations this 
year for us to go out here and try to duplicate last season and I 
don't think there's any way possible -- well, I wouldn't say any way 
possible that we can do that again -- but it's going to be very hard 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss said he was shocked by the shoddy preseason play of the  
veteran offensive line that was so integral to last season's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Vikings lost to the New York Jets last week, coach  
Dennis Green assailed the pass protection and said he counted three 
mental mistakes from the first-team offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of shocked me, to be honest with you, to see as far as  
the veteran group of guys we got playing the offensive line. ... 
You know it kinds of hurts when it's third-and-short and then it 
ends up third-and-long,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive line coach Mike Tice said he is hardly depressed over  
his unit's play. He said the game films show easily correctable 
lapses. 
</P>
<P>
	And Moss added that nobody can stop the Vikings if Todd  
Steussie, Randall McDaniel, Jeff Christy, David Dixon and Korey 
Stringer keep Randall Cunningham upright. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put 60 points up on that board, 50, 60  
points,'' Moss said. ``We're capable of that if everybody's on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upon reflection, Moss acknowledged he didn't get that special  
feeling about last year's squad until Week 5, when the Vikings beat 
Green Bay 37-24 at Lambeau Field. He said the feeling grew stronger 
after the Vikings won the rematch with the Packers at the 
Metrodome, then flew to Dallas and routed the Cowboys on 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this year it's like we're going to need a gut check for us  
to see where we are we're going,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday is as good a time as any.  
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings visit the Georgia Dome to face the Falcons, who  
upset them in the NFC championship by holding Cunningham, Moss and 
the most productive offensive machine in league history to just one 
touchdown during the final 42 minutes in the thunderous Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, that loss to Atlanta's probably going to always be  
in the back of my mind,'' Moss said. ``Probably until the day I 
die.''

	``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge'' (RCA/Victor) -- Various Artists  

</P>
<P>
	Listening to the music from the HBO biopic ``Introducing Dorothy  
Dandridge'' is an upbeat, joyful experience -- a stark contrast to 
the celebrated but depressing life the movie chronicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Dandridge, whose beauty and diverse talents propelled her to  
fame in the 1950s, was the first black woman nominated for an 
Academy Award in the best actress category. But racism and personal 
tragedies led her down a road of despair, and she was found dead of 
a supposed drug overdose in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The soundtrack includes many of the tunes Dandridge sang during  
her successful cabaret career, but does not feature her voice -- nor 
does it contain the voice of Halle Berry, who plays Dandridge in 
the film. Instead, Wendi Williams provides the vocals on classics 
like ``I Got Rhythm'' and ``Chattanooga Choo Choo.'' While 
Dandridge's voice was richer, Williams does a fine job of 
interpreting the tunes that Dandridge did so well, with 
arrangements by Bill Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides old pop and jazz standards, the disc contains original  
compositions by Elmer Bernstein, who knew Dandridge. He provides 
both beautiful and melancholy compositions that summarize the very 
essence of the tragic actress. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Tracie'' (Capitol Records) -- Tracie Spencer  

</P>
<P>
	The last time we heard from Tracie Spencer, she was a teen-ager  
in musical limbo, straddling between bubble-gum soul and adult 
rhythm and blues. Now the former child star is off the fence and 
ready to assume her position as an adult singer tackling mature 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though she's now 23, Spencer's vocals haven't changed much  
on ``Tracie,'' her first album since 1989. She still has that same 
sweet-sounding but powerful soprano voice. But she sounds 
convincingly sexy on tracks like the slow-burn ``Love to You,'' or 
the playful ``It's on Tonight,'' which she co-wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	While Tracie sounds wonderful, sometimes her material lets her  
down. Too often, the songs are just a little better than average, 
like ``Still in My Heart,'' a midtempo tune that does little to get 
you moving, and her current hit, ``It's All About You (Not About 
Me).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the overall tone of the disc is soft and pleasing. You  
won't want to wait another 10 years to hear Spencer's voice.

	``Chock Full Of Country Goodness'' (Valley Entertainment) --  
Amazing Rhythm Aces 

</P>
<P>
	The Amazing Rhythm Aces' first album, ``Stacked Deck,'' was one  
of the underrated gems of the 1970s. The record produced a nifty 
novelty hit in ``Third Rate Romance,'' but all 12 cuts were jewels 
as the Memphis group forged a unique blend of country, bluegrass, 
pop and soul. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aces soon lost guitarist-producer Barry Burton and their  
muse, then disbanded for 14 years. They reunited in 1995, and 
``Chock Full of Country Goodness'' may be their best record since 
``Stacked Deck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The band still mixes genres with style and humor. Four original  
members remain, and thankfully that includes the Aces' king, singer 
Russell Smith. With an even richer voice than he had 25 years ago, 
Smith can rumble the woofers and turn feathery at the high end. 
James Hooker on piano is terrific, too, often showing that less is 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's twangy touch is still missed, and ``Chock Full''  
doesn't have songs quite as strong as ``Stacked Deck''; few records 
do. But there's not a bum tune among the 12. The lyrics are clever 
enough to keep everyone smiling, such as on the opening cut, when 
Smith describes a woman as ``a 10 and that's a natural fact -- I 
mean a four with a six-pack.'' ``DUI/SOL'' is just as funny, 
``Dancin' With the Ones You Love'' irresistible and ``Vera Cruz'' 
simply beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
	The reunion of the Amazing Rhythm Aces is a first-rate  
rendezvous.

<HEADLINE> White Sox' Thomas Has Ankle Spur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Thomas has a bone spur and tendinitis in  
his right ankle, and Chicago White Sox general manager Ron Schueler 
will meet with doctors this week to determine whether the slugger 
is done for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays revealed a ``significant spur'' on the ankle, and an  
ultrasound test confirmed tendinitis, the team said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan is to meet with Frank and the doctors on Friday to  
determine a course of action,'' Schueler said. ``We will decide if 
his ankle has calmed down enough for him to continue playing, or we 
may all agree that it is time to take care of the problem by moving 
up his planned surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas underwent tests on Tuesday after missing three games  
because of the ailing ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is hitting .305 with 15 home runs and 77 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	The designated hitter-first baseman hit the 300th homer of his  
career Aug. 7, but has only one since. His 15 home runs rank third 
on the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The White Sox expect second baseman Ray Durham will return to  
the lineup when the team begins a homestand against the AL 
Central-leading Cleveland Indians on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Durham underwent an MRI on his left hamstring Tuesday. The test  
revealed only a slight irritation and no ruptures or tears in the 
muscle.

<HEADLINE> Female Boxer To Be in Playboy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mia St. John was asked what she wore for the photo shoot.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had my wraps on,'' she replied, referring to the bandages  
fighters wear inside their gloves to protect their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	A professional boxer is what the 32-year-old St. John is -- a  
featherweight with a 12-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
	She will fight Kelly Downey on the pay-per-view welterweight  
title card featuring Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad on Sept. 
18 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-6, 126-pound St. John also is scheduled to appear in  
a two-page layout in the November issue of Playboy Magazine, which 
will hit the newsstands in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Punching for pay and posing for Playboy don't seem to go  
together, but given a choice, St. John says -- for now -- that she 
prefers the punching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done some modeling, some acting simply to promote my  
boxing,'' said St. John, who recently completed filming for an 
upcoming episode of the USA Network Series, ``Pacific Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother said boxing was something I was born with, something  
I wanted to do all my life,'' St. John said. ``I was 23 years in 
Taekwondo. I've been boxing almost three years. I have another two 
years left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born to fight?  
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot see a normal, functional human being wanting to  
fight,'' St. John said. ``I grew up going all over the United 
States with a father who was in and out. I come from an alcoholic 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's not difficult to believe that maybe it's boxing  
that's promoting St. John's modeling and acting careers, not the 
other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no doubt that sex appeal has played a part in getting  
St. John fights on big shows. 
</P>
<P>
	She admits it, but she said, ``It's the same as Oscar gets. Half  
of the women would not be watching if he were `Joe Pug.' You can't 
hide the fact that he's pretty. He's a very good-looking guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya's status as the biggest pay-per-view attraction  
outside the heavyweight division owes a lot to women wanting to 
watch his fights. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John also contends -- and she is right -- that punching, not  
pulchritude, is the big reason for the relatively recent success of 
women's pro boxing. Women boxers, at this point in time, generally 
lack defensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fights are so much more exciting because of no defense,''  
she said. ``The crowd goes wild. They want to see blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a broken nose and a damaged retina,'' said St. John,  
who broke the nose while sparring with a man. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, I was sparring with men, small men, but  
sometimes egos get in the way, and they have to prove something. 
They don't do it on purpose, they just get carried away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. John lives at Calabasas in California's San Fernando Valley  
with son Julian and daughter Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over my dead body,'' St. John said when asked if she'd  
allowing Julian and-or Paris to box. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the children have not shown any indication that they  
were born to box.

<HEADLINE> Flares Found in Waco Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Several spent illumination flares were found in  
the tons of evidence recovered from the charred rubble of the 
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, The Dallas Morning News 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Texas Rangers discovered a star parachute  
flare while sifting through a storage facility Friday for missing 
pyrotechnic tear gas grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence logs showed more such incendiary flares were recovered  
in the weeks following the FBI siege and assault on April 19, 1993, 
said James B. Francis Jr., head of the Texas Department of Public 
Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``These flares are potentially a very important issue, inasmuch  
as the government had enormous spotlights trained on the compound 
throughout the standoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't need these flares to light the compound. One or  
more was fired,'' Francis told the newspaper. ``For what purpose or 
reason would these rounds be used?'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Collingwood, an FBI spokesman, told the newspaper he could  
not flatly rule out the agency's use of illumination rounds during 
the deadly siege but said they played no part in the final assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several times during the standoff, they had people sneaking in  
or out of the compound at night. Whether they ever used them then, 
I don't know,'' said Collingwood. ``But I can say categorically, we 
did not use illumination rounds on the 19th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Koresh and 78 followers died in the fire and assault at  
the compound following the 51-day siege. The government has 
maintained that the fires that destroyed the compound were 
deliberately set by the Branch Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP lawmakers want to know whether the FBI lied for several  
months about using incendiary tear gas canisters during the final 
raid. The possibility of launching an independent inquiry has been 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of the pyrotechnic rounds, Attorney General Janet Reno has  
said, violated her strict instructions that nothing capable of 
sparking a fire be used during the FBI tear-gas assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 24,000 pounds of evidence has been recovered from the  
burned compound, plus more than 300,000 rounds of ammunition and 
other ordnance stockpiled by the sect.

<HEADLINE> Panel Faults Lockheed Martin Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Lockheed Martin overemphasized expenses instead  
of mission success in a string of launch failures that cost the 
company billions of dollars, an independent review panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which released its report Wednesday, also cited a  
lack of quality control and the loss of experienced personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found too much emphasis on cost. Mission success needs to  
be re-established as the most important performance criteria for 
all employees,'' said A. Thomas Young, a former Martin Marietta and 
NASA executive who co-chaired the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin suffered four launch failures between August  
1998 and this April. More than $2 billion in military and private 
satellites were either destroyed or placed in useless orbits. The 
failures were partly to blame for the Bethesda-based defense 
giant's second-quarter loss of $41 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Lockheed lost a $4.5 billion government spy satellite  
contract to Boeing, which also has suffered a number of launch 
failures. President Clinton has ordered a separate government 
investigation of the failures by Lockheed, Boeing and the U.S. 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff cuts were one reason for the Lockheed failures, according  
to the review. The company's Denver unit, which builds the Titan 
rockets used to launch satellites, and its Sunnyvale plant, have 
had large-scale cuts in staff over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said Lockheed should improve training, mentoring and  
its implementation of the ``better-faster-cheaper'' mantra. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better, faster, cheaper'' has been NASA Administrator Daniel  
Goldin's motto since he took the post in 1992 and began a 
cost-cutting program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not good enough to say those three words. If you're not  
careful, the one that's easy to concentrate on is cheaper,'' Young 
said.

<HEADLINE> British Bank Rates Affecting Dow / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks struggled to stay in positive territory  
today as investors already worried about higher U.S. interest rates 
were surprised by a rate increase by the Bank of England. 
</P>
<P>
	In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 15.19 at 11,049.32. The Dow had tumbled as much as 
66 points in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also turned slightly higher after an  
early decline. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.27 at 
1,350.72, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 13.02 at 2,850.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially tumbled after the Bank of England increased its  
base lending rate for the first time in more than a year, following 
a string of seven cuts. Saying in a statement that ``a rise in 
interest rates was necessary to keep inflation on track further 
ahead,'' the bank's concerns rang familiar to U.S. investors who 
are well aware of the inflation concerns of Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns that the Fed will raise for a third time this year in  
its own quest to hold down inflation have pressured stock and bond 
markets. Today, investors were awaiting a midday speech by 
Greenspan and looking for any signals about his sentiments on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and brokerages, among the most rate-sensitive stocks, were  
lower today. Chase Manhattan fell 5/8 to 80 3/4 and Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter lost 1 1/16 to 92 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But strength in certain technology companies helped turn the  
market around. Global Crossing, the architect of an undersea fiber 
network, shot up 3 1/8 to 23 7/16 after the company agreed to sell a 
portion of its cable to Microsoft and Softbank for $350 million in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier Corp., a long-distance provider that Global Crossing  
plans to acquire, rose 4 13/16 to 41 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 93.9 million shares, 
well ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 2.49 to 435.75.

<HEADLINE> Instant Replay Returns to NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The only thing more maddening than seeing referees blow a call  
once is having to wait around to watch them do it twice. 
</P>
<P>
	History does repeat itself, though rarely the way we'd like it  
to. That's why the return of instant replay to the NFL after an 
8-year hiatus reminds us of something Mychal Thompson said about 
Vlade Divac when the two were teammates with the Los Angeles Lakers 
a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a quick learner,'' Thompson said, ``but he forgets quick,  
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instant replay was the law of the turf from 1986-91, when league  
executives were again convinced to shut off the VCR. It wasn't 
foolproof, it delayed games unnecessarily, intimidated referees, 
and the NFL's own study only confirmed what everybody should have 
known: The calls on the field were almost always right. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 216,540 plays and 376 reversals during a 5-year span.  
Of those reversals, 38 were later judged to be wrong -- roughly 10 
percent. What that meant was that one call was correctly reversed 
for every 641 plays -- roughly once every four games. Exactly one 
game in those five years was decided by a replay call in the final 
minute, resulting in a 14-13 win by the Packers over the Bears in 
1989, and the league wound up conceding the replay official didn't 
have enough evidence to overturn the original call. 
</P>
<P>
	Anybody who bought a VCR in the last few years can attest to the  
fact that they're easier to operate. But even though the league 
spent $10 million on its men and machines, it faces the same 
dilemma people face at home, one that former NFL broadcasting head 
Val Pinchbeck framed this way in a recent interview with The 
Orlando Sentinel: ``Can humans do it properly?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the preseason experiment is any indication, the answer in too  
many cases is still ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through 34 exhibition games, coaches asked to have 30 plays  
reviewed. Three were overturned and NFL supervisor of officials 
Mike Pereira admitted that replay officials got two of them wrong. 
Some improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	And that wasn't the worst of it.  
</P>
<P>
	For a while, the push-button devices given coaches to signal  
their challenges were so sensitive that Rams coach Dick Vermeil 
buzzed the referee nearly every time he bent over. In one game, a 
computerized system failed, causing a 4-minute delay while 
officials switched to a backup. In another, Broncos coach Mike 
Shanahan signaled a challenge, found out from his assistants in the 
press box that the call was correct and told the ref he hit his 
buzzer by mistake. In yet another, a TV technician crossed the 
wrong wires; a definitive replay made it to the stadium JumboTron, 
but not to the official who needed it in time to make the right 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell used to rail about the  
deliberate way his fellow owners went about the business of the 
league. ``The U.S. Congress,'' he said, ``can declare war with a 
simple majority, but we need a three-fourths majority to go to the 
john.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reason instant replay was banished for the intervening years  
is because six teams refused to cave in and bring it back. Now they 
might regret it. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson finally switched sides after a  
terrible pass-interference call at the end of a game cost his team 
a game against New England in late November. It came at a 
particularly bad time, just a few days after referee Phil Luckett 
screwed up a coin toss in the now-infamous Thanksgiving Day game 
between Pittsburgh and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wilson followed longtime Lions owner William Clay Ford Jr.,  
by taking off after the officials, commissioner Paul Tagliabue had 
a real problem on his hands. Wilson got slapped with a $50,000 
fine, but he and Ford were old-guard ownership, and their rumblings 
gave the campaign to restore instant replay the credibility it had 
been lacking in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help, either, that the officiating went downhill from  
that point on pretty much through the end of the season. In a 
sense, the refs made the predictions come true. The more the 
replays of blown calls were shown, the more heft the calls picked 
up, almost like a snowball rolling downhill. Late in the year, 
officials spent more time looking over their shoulders, more 
hesitant than ever to make calls. 
</P>
<P>
	It got so bad at one point that when an officiating crew visited  
Children's Hospital in Boston, Bob McElwee said a 21-year-old 
cancer patient pulled him off to the side and said, ``You've got to 
have replay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now we do, at least until the phrase ``after further review'' is  
replayed often enough to remind us why the VCR got thrown into the 
closet the first time. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dell To Acquire ConvergeNet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. is acquiring storage  
networking company ConvergeNet Technologies Inc. in a deal worth 
about $340 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition, the first by Dell, marks another bid by the  
Round Rock-based company to directly compete with Compaq, IBM and 
Hewlett-Packard Co. in the storage vendor market. Dell, the largest 
seller of computers directly to customers, began venturing into the 
market last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This didn't come lightly,'' said Michael Lambert, senior vice  
president of Dell's Enterprise Systems Group. ``We're probably the 
largest technology company that has never made an acquisition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ConvergeNet has developed a system of high-end hardware and  
advanced software for storing large amounts of data for complex 
computer systems that may run an entire business. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Dell will exchange about 6.9 million shares of  
company stock for all outstanding shares and options of 
ConvergeNet. Dell also will incur a one-time charge against 
after-tax earnings of 5 to 7 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition is expected to be completed within 60 days and  
has already been approved by the boards of directors of each 
company.

<HEADLINE> Airplane Guitairist Now Teaches Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY AMY SANCETTA   	
</P>
<P>
	POMEROY, Ohio (AP) -- Jorma Kaukonen, lead guitarist for  
Jefferson Airplane, stood on the stage at Woodstock in the summer 
of 1969 and gazed out on a sea of a half-million faces. The 
Airplane was huge, and Woodstock was the ultimate stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years later, Kaukonen is still rockin'. But he is playing  
to a much smaller audience. 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, he is showing his mastery of a particular acoustic  
lick to a wide-eyed and eager group of nine, including an 
anesthesiologist from Milwaukee, a high school sophomore from 
Columbus, Ohio, and the dean of biology at Brown University. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine are students.  
</P>
<P>
	Kaukonen is their teacher.  
</P>
<P>
	Their classroom: the recording studio at the Jorma Kaukonen Fur  
Peace Ranch Guitar Camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes run for several hours in the morning and again in the  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp, nestled in the Appalachian foothills in southeastern  
Ohio, is now in its second season -- and Kaukonen is loving it all. 
The camp is open on weekends from April through October, except 
when Kaukonen, 58, is touring to promote his new music, 
</P>
<P>
	``I get to play guitar all day and talk about myself,'' Kaukonen  
said with a satisfied smile. ``What could be better?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Kaukonen's oldest friends are instructors, including  
fellow Airplane bandmates Jack Casady and Pete Sears. Weekend guest 
instructors have included Arlo Guthrie, Bob Weir, Rory Block, 
Robert Jones and Livingston Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've followed Jorma all our lives,'' said Peter Mulligan, 42,  
who came with two former college roommates from Kenosha, Wis. 
``It's so cool to sit across from him playing and see how down to 
earth he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marjorie Thompson, 47, agreed. Her college-age daughter was also  
at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a come-to-life dream,'' Thompson said. ``But aside from  
all the groupie stuff, the idea of playing with and learning from 
such an emissary of acoustic music is exhilarating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of living the fast-paced life of musical  
superstardom, Kaukonen changed direction. He got married, got sober 
and bought a 119-acre tract of rolling Ohio countryside as a 
Christmas present for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	When the couple lost the lease on their home in New York State,  
they packed up and moved to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not want to move to Ohio,'' said Vanessa Lillian, 37.  
``But sometimes the universe provides you with answers when you 
don't know better yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple eventually bought a 60-acre farm in nearby  
Harrisonville. The idea of creating a guitar camp on the Pomeroy 
land began to grow. Lillian's sister, Ginger Stake, designed the 
camp, including the placement of buildings and a proposed schedule 
of camp activities. An A-frame was constructed that Kaukonen began 
using as a recording studio in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our loan officer was an old Jefferson Airplane fan,'' Lillian  
said with a smile. ``We got the loan and we were off!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The physical layout is impressive: Small two-bed cabins, enough  
to house 32 students, surround the camp's main buildings. Two 
150-year-old log cabins have been renovated for use as a kitchen 
and cafeteria. The camp's workshop and music library, constructed 
from rustic yellow pine, have large porches that are popular spots 
for impromptu evening jam sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	As dusk approaches, one guitarist sits on the porch practicing  
an old classic. Others join in. Kaukonen and G.E. Smith, former 
music director of the ``Saturday Night Live'' band, grab their 
guitars, plunk themselves down in rockers and join in the music. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Suits, a 48-year-old electrician from Greenview, Ill., and  
Campbell Hunter, a 46-year-old high school teacher from Walnut 
Creek, Calif., are now jammin' with Jorma! 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ask anyone here, we'd say this is the finest experience  
of our lives,'' exclaimed Ralph Kylloe of Lake George, N.Y. ``If 
you really love music, this is the place to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the camp is not in session, the couple rents the facility  
for weddings, reunions and luncheons. The workshop can be converted 
into a 75-seat theater for concerts. A holiday craft fair is held 
on the grounds in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaukonen hopes to build a 200-seat theater on the property. He  
would also love to host a weekly radio show for National Public 
Radio from his studio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love what we're doing here and I love living in the country.  
When I come over this rise,'' he said, casting his gaze across the 
rolling hills of the countryside to his camp beyond, ``I just can't 
believe my eyes.''

<HEADLINE> Church Worker Guilty of Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A former youth worker for one of Austin's  
largest churches was sentenced to 60 years in prison for molesting 
eight teen-age boys. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Reid Jones, 28, a volunteer at Riverbend Church, said he  
pleaded guilty Tuesday to spare his victims the trauma of a trial. 
He asked for forgiveness from their families and the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get down to the basics, this isn't about me. It's  
about a group of teen-agers who have already been through a lot,'' 
Jones said in a letter given to reporters Tuesday. ``A trial would 
not be fair to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones confessed to exploiting his victims and implied he had  
been abused as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Jones in May after one of his victims told a  
minister about Jones' sexual advances. Jones was indicted on 24 
counts of abusing eight boys in 1993, 1998 and this year at his 
home. He met some of the boys through church activities.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Star Blast, Black Hole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	New evidence supports the theory that the explosive death throes  
of giant stars can lead to the formation of black holes, the 
strange celestial objects where gravitation is so strong that 
nothing -- including light -- can escape the pull. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers analyzed the gases near a star that wobbles around a  
suspected black hole, and concluded that the chemicals could have 
originated only in the blast of a neighboring supernova. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in today's issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Black holes are super-dense dead stars whose gravity is so  
powerful that nothing can escape from them. Since even light is 
trapped, scientists cannot actually see a black hole, but they can 
infer its existence from the effects on the orbits of nearby stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Black holes are believed to form in two different ways: when a  
star runs out of fuel and collapses, or when a dying star explodes. 
The debris from such a blast falls back on itself to create a black 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to establish the physical conditions of the star  
that ended in a supernova and provide a connection between the 
supernova and black hole formation,'' said Rafael Rebolo, study 
co-author and researcher at the Institute of Astrophysics of the 
Canary Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers suspected that a black hole and a visible star  
existed side-by-side in the constellation Scorpius about 10,000 
light-years from Earth. Large bursts of X-rays -- evidence of matter 
swirling around a black hole -- were detected nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebolo and his colleagues analyzed the spectrum of the visible  
star to try to decipher its chemical composition. They found an 
overabundance of oxygen, magnesium, silicon and sulfur -- elements 
that could not have been produced by the visible star. Instead, the 
researches speculated that the elements were spewed during the 
explosion of its now-dark neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way you can produce an excess of these elements is  
through several billions of degrees,'' Rebolo said. ``The only way 
to reach these temperatures is when a star goes to a supernova 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former star was probably about 40 times more massive than  
the sun before it exploded an estimated 1 million years ago, he 
said. Such a blast might have been visible from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers said the Spanish researchers are the first ever to  
offer convincing evidence of the birth of a black hole from a 
supernova explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The explanation offered by the researchers is the most  
straightforward and logical one,'' said John Cowan, professor at 
the University of Oklahoma in Norman. ``There could be some other 
explanation, but it would have to be more convoluted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the theory requires a delicate balance between the explosion  
and the fallback of material, said Alex Filippenko, an astronomy 
professor at the University of California, Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outer parts of the star seemingly got expelled, but the  
inner parts collapsed to form a black hole,'' he said. ``It 
requires a delicate balance between the explosion energy and the 
amount of material in the star.''

<HEADLINE> Los Angeles a Tough Sell for NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On the lawns outside Los Angeles Memorial  
Coliseum, the game of choice is not football but futbol -- soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just one obstacle in bringing an NFL expansion team  
to Los Angeles, where the entertainment options are nearly as 
diverse as the city. 
</P>
<P>
	There are beaches, mountains and theme parks, not to mention a  
professional soccer team and two popular college football teams to 
compete with the NFL for money and attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who want recreation in LA don't want for options,''  
said Allen Sanderson, a University of Chicago economist who follows 
the sports business. ``If people won't have an NFL team, so what? 
It's different than, say, Green Bay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations to bring a team to the Coliseum hit a stumbling  
block last month when the city refused to kick in $150 million to 
build a garage the NFL wants next to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council reiterated its position Tuesday by passing a  
resolution against using any existing tax money. However, the 
council left a loophole that could allow the city to finance the 
garage with future revenues that would be generated by NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's expansion committee was scheduled to discuss the  
Coliseum bid when it meets in Washington on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the loophole in the council's latest vote, the use of  
tax revenue will be a tough sell, said David Carter of the Sports 
Business Group consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how much the NFL tells us we need a team, we are  
standing here saying we would like that, but not at all cost. I 
don't think the NFL is accustomed to that kind of response,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel is not expected to make a recommendation on which city  
should get the team. The NFL has given Los Angeles promoters until 
Sept. 15 to come up with an acceptable plan. 
</P>
<P>
	If Los Angeles fails to meet the Sept. 15 deadline, the NFL says  
it will take another look at Houston, the LA's principal rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been focusing on LA,'' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said.  
``We created the window until Sept. 15 through which we're trying 
to see if we can get a stadium project in place that would work. If 
not, then we would look towards Houston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium plan is backed by billionaire Eli Broad and former  
Hollywood super agent Michael Ovitz. The NFL also is looking at 
several other plans that would put a team in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the NFL may need Los Angeles -- the nation's  
second-largest media market behind New York -- more than the city 
needs the league, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to the NFL and LA, the league wants to be in  
LA,'' said Mark Eschenfelder, a professor of sports economics at 
Robert Morris College in Pittsburgh. ``They may go to Houston 
first, but the league does not want a vacuum in Los Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Putting an expansion team in Los Angeles would mean more  
television revenue for the NFL. Also, dissatisfied owners of 
existing teams would no longer be able to cajole the league and 
local governments by threatening to pack up and head to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having an empty city that's desirable is a nice thing for  
existing franchise owners,'' Eschenfelder said. ``They can always 
make noises about moving to LA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles isn't the only city to dig in its heels on stadium  
financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix rejected the Arizona Cardinals' bid for a new stadium,  
and Chicago officials so far have resisted the Bears' request that 
the city finance a stadium to replace aging Soldier Field, 
Sanderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Twins threatened to move to North Carolina unless  
the Minnesota Legislature paid for a new stadium. The baseball team 
followed through on the threat, only to be rejected by North 
Carolina as well, Sanderson said. So the Twins remain in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of cases, but they're in the minority. It's  
a growing minority,'' Sanderson said. ``I think there's some 
growing momentum against using substantial amounts of public 
money.''

	Reno Picks Danforth for Waco Inquiry  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno has selected  
former Republican Sen. John Danforth to head an independent review 
of the 1993 government standoff with the Branch Davidians, 
government officials said today. Before entering the Senate, 
Danforth served as attorney general in Missouri for eight years. 
Reno's move came as Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said he now 
has doubts about who started the fire that ended the fatal siege in 
Waco, Texas, and believes it is time for the attorney general to 
step down.

	Yeltsin Denies Part in Scandal

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin called  
President Clinton today and denied he or his family are involved in 
a broadening international money-laundering scandal, a White House 
official said. Russia's chief prosecutor, suspended by Yeltsin in 
March, said in an interview this week that Yeltsin and his 
daughters should be questioned about whether they received 
kickbacks from a Swiss construction firm. And U.S. authorities are 
trying to determine whether Russian organized crime groups funneled 
up to $10 billion illegally through accounts of Bank of New York.

	U.N. Fears More E. Timor Bloodshed  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- The United Nations on Wednesday delayed  
the evacuation of its mission to East Timor, fearing the withdrawal 
could end in mass bloodshed in the Indonesian province. More than 
2,000 people have crowded into the U.N. compound in Dili, the 
provincial capital. As the refugees streamed out of the embattled 
territory to escape rampaging militias, witnesses charged that 
soldiers were looting throughout Dili. Rumors of mass slaughters 
swept through refugee camps. Many said pro-Indonesian militias 
would kill them if the U.N. workers left. U.N. Secretary-General 
said he is trying to keep a small U.N. presence in the 
violence-torn province to protect innocent civilians.

	Congress Returns to Full Work Load  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Congress returned to  
work today, still at odds with the White House on tax cuts, 
spending, health care, gun control and other issues. Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., predicted an ``action-packed'' 
September and October. Lott said that tax cut legislation approved 
before Congress' break would go to the White House next week for 
its threatened veto. Clinton's rejection of the measure will 
present Republicans with an important decision: whether to set the 
issue aside until next year's election campaign or attempt to work 
out a compromise that also would cover issues as diverse as 
spending and Medicare.

	Consumer Borrowing Surged in July  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' rate of borrowing surged in July  
mainly reflecting heavy credit card use, which posted its sharpest 
increase in two years. Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding 
mortgage debt, advanced at a 7.9 percent annual rate in July to a 
seasonally adjusted $1.354 trillion, the Federal Reserve said 
today. All told, consumers borrowed $8.8 billion more in July than 
during the month before, greater than the $6.3 billion gain many 
analysts' had expected. The increase follows a 2.9 percent gain in 
June and was the biggest jump since May when consumers' credit 
outstanding rose at an annual rate of 9.4 percent.

	Star Blast Linked to Black Hole

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have found some of the best evidence  
yet to support the theory that the cataclysmic explosions of giant 
stars can lead to black holes. The findings were to be published in 
tomorrow's issue of the journal Nature. Researchers analyzed the 
gases near a star that wobbles around a suspected black hole, and

<HEADLINE> Synagogues on Alert for Holidays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Rabbi Brad Bloom stands in one of  
three arson-damaged synagogues, his voice choked with emotion as he 
describes a ``summer of hate and hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the temple's parking lot, a police officer sits in a patrol  
car. Two private guards stroll the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of this summer's attacks, Sacramento's Jewish  
community is trying to face its fears, raise its spirits and 
rebuild its synagogues as the High Holy Days approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've received a few calls and e-mails from people who've said  
'I'm afraid to come,''' Bloom said. ``We're saying, 'Don't not be 
afraid. But don't let your fears conquer your conscience. If you 
don't come, you give a victory to the terrorists.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``summer of hate'' has created feelings of vulnerability  
since the fires, the July attack by a white supremacist who shot 
and wounded six Jews in Chicago, and the August rampage at a Jewish 
community center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	As Jews prepare for their most sacred time of year -- starting  
Friday at sundown with Rosh Hashana and running through Yom Kippur, 
the Jewish Day of Atonement, on Sept. 20 -- synagogues across the 
country will be on alert, with armed guards and security cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Congregation B'nai Israel's staff hurries between temporary  
offices in portable trailers preparing for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish 
new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Extra security has been added since the arsonists struck,  
causing $1 million damage at B'nai Israel near downtown Sacramento, 
Congregation Beth Shalom in suburban Carmichael and the Kenesset 
Israel Torah Center in northeastern Sacramento early June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed against two suspects, white  
supremacist brothers from Northern California facing murder charges 
in the slaying of a gay couple. 
</P>
<P>
	At Congregation Beth Shalom, member Lorrie Kagan says she's been  
touched, not by fear, but by the expression of sympathy and offers 
of help from outside the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost indescribable,'' Kagan says. ``You feel so good  
that not everybody hates the Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish history in California's capital city extends to the Gold  
Rush of 1849, when Jews were among the thousands who flocked from 
Europe and the East Coast to pan for gold. Jewish merchants joined 
the shopkeepers who headed west to supply the miners. 
</P>
<P>
	B'nai Israel, whose 1,500 members make it the city's largest  
congregation, is celebrating its 150th year and calls itself the 
oldest Jewish congregation west of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires forced the three congregations to pray in temporary  
locations -- protected by police and private security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is physically and mentally wearying not to be at home. A  
prayer place is a place of comfort and becomes a home. When you 
can't be at home, it just isn't right,'' said Rabbi Matt Friedman 
of Beth Shalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why these attacks were so awful. It attacks much more  
than the physical building. It attacks emotionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the arsons also have prompted about $700,000 in donations  
for rebuilding, and rallies showing support for the synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's drawn the community together,'' Friedman said. ``In many  
ways, it has encouraged people to reaffirm their identity as 
Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds of worshippers during the High Holy Days could create a  
concentrated target for harassment or violence. Police will 
increase their presence around synagogues across the country, and 
many worshippers will be instructed not to gather in large crowds 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine there will be a single temple or synagogue  
that won't have some increased security,'' said Jonathan Levine, 
Midwest director of the American Jewish Committee. But he added: 
``If we imprison ourselves, we help the haters accomplish their 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though B'nai Israel will celebrate holidays under guard in what  
member Pat Macht calls an ``antiseptic, industrial'' setting at the 
Sacramento Convention Center, it will bring the entire congregation 
together for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the congregation met in two sessions because of its  
size. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we're in physical exile we'll all be in one spot to  
celebrate the holidays together,'' Macht says. ``We can survive 
this and go on. We may come out feeling stronger.''

<HEADLINE> Don't Bet on 'The Sopranos' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- What makes for an exciting Emmy Awards show?  
Your favorite star winning a trophy can do the trick. Or watching a 
deserving series set a record, as ``Frasier'' did when it snared 
its fifth consecutive best comedy Emmy last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe it's guessing the winners and picking up $20 in the  
office pool. With the goal of public service in mind (disclaimer: 
no gambling endorsement implied), Emmy expert Thomas O'Neil and I 
huddled over predictions in the top categories. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neil, author of ``The Emmys,'' notes there are important  
elements to consider before making an educated forecast for 
Sunday's ceremony (airing 8 p.m. EDT on Fox). 
</P>
<P>
	An Emmy Award reflects a specific episode or episodes submitted  
for judging, not a show's or a performer's entire body of work for 
a season. Actors tender one episode; a series vying for best comedy 
or drama submits eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing them are peer panels made up of members of the Academy  
of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences. Actors judge acting nominees, 
directors review their colleagues and so on during marathon viewing 
sessions in August. 
</P>
<P>
	That approach tends to assure that the quality of the work,  
rather than industry buzz, helps determine the winner, O'Neil said. 
It also can result in surprises, particularly in the acting 
categories in which performers often kill their own chance with a 
weak episode. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year you wonder what goes through these actors' heads,''  
said O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
	Having the most nominations or critical support also doesn't  
guarantee a glorious outcome. HBO's suburban mob drama ``The 
Sopranos,'' with 16 nominations, is facing what O'Neil has deemed 
``the frontrunner's curse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unique to television. When it comes to the Academy Awards,  
the film with the most bids took best picture nine out of the last 
10 years. During the same period, Emmy frontrunners were tripped up 
six times, O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
	With that back story in mind, here are O'Neil's predictions in  
six categories, along with my take. 

</P>
<P>
	--Best actor in a comedy series: Kelsey Grammer, last year's  
winner, chose a ``dud'' with a Christmas-theme episode that failed 
to showcase his talent and may have put himself out of the running, 
O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Lithgow of ``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' on the other hand, is  
big and outrageous in a smartly performed piece of comedy, O'Neil 
said, naming him the likely winner. O'Neil's dark horse: Paul 
Reiser for the tearjerker final episode of ``Mad About You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	My pick: Don't count out Grammer. Even when the material falls  
short, he is the ultimate in sitcom savoir-faire. 

</P>
<P>
	--Best actress in a comedy series: O'Neil is putting all his  
chips on Helen Hunt of ``Mad About You,'' who submitted the 
sitcom's emotional hour-long finale. The victory would be her 
fourth in a row, tying a record set in 1988 by John Larroquette of 
``Night Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	My pick: Calista Flockhart, your Emmy is ready. Yes, Emmy voters  
are awed by the Oscar-winning Hunt, but the ``Ally McBeal'' star 
was a state-of-the-art emotional roller coaster in the episode in 
which she and former beau Billy share a kiss. 

</P>
<P>
	Best actor in a drama series: He's stumped, O'Neil admits,  
willing to rule out only Jimmy Smits. The ex-''NYPD Blue'' star 
submitted his deathbed episode, in which Smits is upstaged by 
co-star and fellow nominee Dennis Franz. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Franz rages in that 90-minute episode and then smolders  
quietly in the season finale he turned in, the range may sway 
voters, O'Neil said. He picks Dylan McDermott of ``The Practice'' 
as a deserving upset winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Our choice: The trophy goes to the mobster you hate to love in  
``The Sopranos.'' James Gandolfini's compelling character lacks the 
sympathetic edge O'Neil says Emmy voters favor, but I believe he'll 
muscle in on chutzpah. 

</P>
<P>
	Best actress in a drama series: Last year's winner Christine  
Lahti could take the trophy again for ``Chicago Hope,'' but the 
character's unlovable nature may undercut her big, explosive 
performance, O'Neil said. Edie Falco, the mob wife in ``The 
Sopranos,'' turned in a wonderful example of her work and has a 
serious shot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	My pick: Falco, a gutsy actress who doesn't play it safe and  
whose character is as close to a moral center as ``The Sopranos'' 
can have, is a winner. 

</P>
<P>
	Best comedy series: A weak season rules out a sixth victory for  
``Frasier'' and opens the door for ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' the 
kind of family comedy that gives Emmy voters a warm feeling, O'Neil 
said. But he suggests keeping an eye on the hour-long ``Ally 
McBeal,'' which combines comedy and emotional heft. 
</P>
<P>
	My pick: ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' has grown into a worthy  
contender and is the likely winner. But in a more perfect world 
voters wouldn't be afraid to admit that the brazen and outrageously 
funny ``Sex and the City'' had won their hearts -- and their 
ballots. 

</P>
<P>
	Best drama series: ``The Practice,'' which had a strong year  
both in stories and in showcasing its appealing cast of lawyers, is 
invincible, O'Neil maintains. If there is a surprise winner, he 
tags ``NYPD Blue'' for its emotionally complex year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' simply faces too many hurdles, O'Neil said: The  
difficult characters, an intricate storyline that must be seen in 
its entirety to be fully appreciated and a macho nature that may 
repel some female voters. 
</P>
<P>
	My pick: ``NYPD Blue'' is a series of depth and unrelenting  
emotional clout that had a classic season. And ``The Sopranos,'' 
easily one of the best dramatic series TV has ever produced, is 
just too dark to take home the gold.

<HEADLINE> Topless Woman Causes Power Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A fire-breathing woman danced topless on an  
electrical tower beside a freeway bridge for more than an hour this 
morning, snarling rush-hour traffic and forcing a power outage to 
5,000 homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Olympia woman donned a halter top and descended  
at the urging of police shortly before 9 a.m. She was arrested for 
investigation of criminal trespass and indecent exposure, police 
spokeswoman Carmen Best said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was first reported at 7:26 a.m. on a tower that  
carries electrical lines next to an interstate bridge over the Lake 
Washington Ship Canal. Wearing only shorts, she was gyrating, 
drinking vodka, spitting the liquor out of her mouth and lighting 
it on fire, Best said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle City Light cut power to protect the woman, leaving 5,000  
customers without electricity.

<HEADLINE> Victims' Families Nix Swissair Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Relatives of 229 people killed in last  
year's Swissair Flight 111 crash are rejecting a settlement in 
which the airline would compensate each family provided they not 
pursue punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief filed Tuesday, attorneys for the families said the  
settlement would significantly limit financial awards and keep 
survivors from learning the full extent of misconduct involved in 
the September 1998 crash off the coast of Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed settlement would have covered 167 cases involving  
U.S. victims as well as any future claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer was worth about $300 million to families, compared to  
an estimated $1 billion award if punitive damages are awarded by a 
jury, according to an attorney for the victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is their fault and there is a price to be paid for fault,''  
Arthur Wolk said today. ``There needs to be recognition that this 
person had value beyond the recovery of the strict economic 
contribution that the person would have made to his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brief, filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia,  
requests that the suit continue against Swissair; Boeing, which 
owns the company that built the MD-11 jetliner; Delta Airlines, 
which had a ticket-sharing deal with Swissair; and Inflight 
Technologies, which provided the plane's electronic entertainment 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair, Boeing and Delta last month offered the settlement,  
although Swissair said the proposal was not an admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney representing Swissair, Boeing and Delta said that  
the victims' families are unlikely to receive punitive damages 
whether or not they reject the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like they are saying, `Please we want to spend 10 years  
litigating this case,''' said attorney Mike Holland of New 
York-based Condon &AMP; Forsyth said today. ``We've already agreed to 
accept liability. There's no issue to contest.''

<HEADLINE>  Houston Honors WNBA Champion Comets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- First, Cynthia Cooper preached. Then she launched  
into a rap. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of her delivery style, the message was clear for  
thousands of Houstonians who turned out on Wednesday to celebrate 
the Houston Comets' third straight WNBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody said there were too many trials, too many  
tribulations, too much adversity,'' Cooper said on a sweltering day 
from the steps of City Hall. ``Somebody said the influx of new 
players (from the defunct ABL) was too strong and the Comets could 
not handle it. But who are the champions?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd answered predictably and red, white and blue confetti  
filled the air as stars Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson 
each hoisted one of team's trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston won its third title in as many WNBA seasons on Sunday  
with a 59-47 victory over the New York Liberty in the deciding game 
of a best-of-three championship series. The Comets' first title 
also came against New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally followed an eight-block parade along Smith Street,  
which was lined two and three fans deep along the route. More 
confetti and other paper fluttered from the sun-drenched glass 
skyscrapers above. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the third year in a row, the Comets have claimed the  
coveted WNBA championship title,'' Mayor Lee Brown said. ``In doing 
so they have established themselves as the first dynasty in the 
WNBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the procession was Houston fire department truck No. 10,  
the jersey number of fallen point guard Kim Perrot, who lost her 
battle with lung cancer last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as much a celebration for Kim as it is for us,''  
center Monica Lamb said. ``She is definitely with us today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marching bands, floats and dignitaries in convertibles preceeded  
the fire engines escorting the Comets, coach Van Chancellor, owner 
Les Alexander and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so great to see what this is doing for the whole  
community,'' resident Olympic champion Carl Lewis said aboard the 
ladder truck carrying Cooper. ``These women have done such a 
tremendous job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor included his on-court custom of throwing candy to the  
crowd, hurling treats off his fire truck to the screaming throng. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even describe what this feels like,'' Chancellor said  
after the parade. ``We have come so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown couldn't help but inject some politics into the revelry  
just two months before both the mayoral election and a referendum 
to spend an estimated $100 million in public money on a new arena 
for the Comets and NBA Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A great team needs a great arena to play in,'' Brown said,  
muting the cheers a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who has demanded a new home for his teams, chose to  
sidestep the issue in his brief remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how hot and humid this is for your lunchbreak,'' he  
told the midday crowd, which braved near-record temperatures and 
oppressive mugginess that made it feel like 100 degrees. ``We can't 
tell you how much we love you.''

<HEADLINE> Umpires Receive Anonymous Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Umpires trying to oust union leader Richie  
Phillips have received an anonymous letter accusing each of them of 
being ``a cowardly, selfish scab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How could you jump out of the foxhole in the midst of battle  
and desert your friends for your own selfishness?'' said the 
letter, which was obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press. ``How 
could you pledge your allegience to the `intelligence' of Joe 
Brinkman and John Hirschbeck?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The handwritten letter, postmarked in Santa Ana, Calif., on Aug.  
31, was received by about 25 umpires who oppose the union 
leadership, one member of the anti-Phillips faction said, speaking 
on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips engineered the failed strategy of mass resignations,  
which cost 22 umpires their jobs Sept. 2. Phillips' supporters in 
the union say the resignation strategy would have been successful 
had they all stuck with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, you abandoned the ship! You sunk the ship!'' said  
the letter, which contained misspellings and had several words 
underlined for emphasis. ``Now you have to look at yourself in the 
mirror every day forever and see the reflection of a cowardly, 
selfish scab! You can change. You can return your allegience to 
where it belongs!'' 
</P>
<P>
	To form a new union or decertify the current union, 30 percent  
of umpires must file a petition with the National Labor Relations 
Board, which would then hold an election. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on whether the 22 umpires who were let go last week  
count as part of the bargaining unit, there are either 71 or 93 
major league umpires eligible to vote. Fourteen umpires issued a 
statement in July condemning Phillips, and the group now thinks it 
has the support of about 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-Phillips faction is led by three AL umpires: Brinkman,  
Hirschbeck and Davey Phillips. Working with agent Ron Shapiro, who 
has been advising them, the group drafted a response to the 
anonymous letter and was in the process Wednesday of sending it out 
to all umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not have trouble looking at ourselves in the mirror,''  
the group said. ``As for the cowardly comment, we have and will 
continue to stand tall when it comes to our decisions. We will not 
be swayed by the peer pressure, name calling, threats ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips announced July 14 that more than 50 umpires were  
resigning en masse, effective Sept. 2, with umpires saying they 
wanted to prod baseball into an early start of negotiations for a 
labor contract to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired when more than two dozen umps -- nearly  
all in the American League -- either refused to resign or quickly 
withdrew their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball then hired 25 umps from the minor leagues and accepted  
the resignations of 22 veterans. Umpires sued to stop baseball from 
the letting the 22 go, and in a deal worked out last week in 
federal court, the matter will go to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that with a different negotiation approach  
for our association, we will ... save some of the jobs that Richie 
Phillips lost with his flawed and ridiculous strategy,'' the 
anti-Phillips group said. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig and NL president Len Coleman on July 29  
warned umpires against making threats or attempting to intimidate 
their colleagues. That statement came as Hirschbeck's wife received 
a letter from Ed Montague's wife, calling her husband a ``Judas'' 
for opposing the union leadership.
