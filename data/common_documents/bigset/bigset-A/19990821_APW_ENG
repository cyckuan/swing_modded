<HEADLINE> Computer Glitch Delays Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMDALE, Calif. (AP) -- Air traffic controllers had to rely on  
memory to guide airplanes during a computer problem that also 
delayed scores of flights across the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	A new computer system was down for about three hours, forcing  
delays of up to 90 minutes for nearly 140 flights at five airports 
Thursday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the computer failure has not been determined.  
</P>
<P>
	The computer at the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center  
in Palmdale guides flights north of the U.S.-Mexico border, over 
central California, Nevada and the Pacific Ocean. It failed at 5:07 
a.m. and was fully restored at 8:05 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Mitch Barker in Seattle said controllers relied on  
their memories to identify planes on their screen and they were 
guided to their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	No airplanes were in danger, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Palmdale center is the fifth in the United States to begin  
using the new computer system installed last year as part of a 
nationwide $425 million FAA modernization.

<HEADLINE> Actress Bids for U.S. Archery Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Geena Davis found out she was a good  
shot on a movie set. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old actress is now ranked 22nd in the nation in  
women's archery and is competing this weekend to qualify for the 
next Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have learned as an adult that I'm fairly athletic,'' Davis  
said Friday as she practiced for semifinals of the U.S. Olympic 
trials, which began this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of ``Thelma and Louise'' and ``The Accidental Tourist''  
-- for which she won an Oscar in 1988 -- has surprised archers with 
her quick rise in a sport that doesn't normally capture much 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Camera crews on Friday surrounded Davis, wearing a floppy blue  
hat and sunglasses, as she calmly fired off 60 arrows to a target 
70 meters away. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she would make the team, it would be unbelievable for our  
sport,'' said Denise Parker, the top-ranked woman in the nation. 
``The question is, does she want to be in the spotlight in this 
environment?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis discovered she had great aim while training to fire  
handguns for her part as an assassin in 1996's ``The Long Kiss 
Goodnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She kept her hobby a secret from Hollywood and the public,  
despite winning a tournament or two, until she finished 29th out of 
300 women in Ohio to qualify for the Olympic semifinals. Four of 
the 32 semifinalists dropped out, making Davis one of 28 competing 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	That number will drop by Monday to eight women who will compete  
next month in California for three team spots and one alternate 
spot at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' coach Don Rabska, an archer for more than 30 years, said  
she has mastered a concentration during her acting career that 
helps her as an archer. Archery, he said, is all about finesse and 
mental toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has been practicing five hours a day, shooting about 300  
arrows. She had a target range set up on the set of her latest 
film, ``Stuart Little.'' She also goes to the gym five days a week 
to work out on the treadmill and lift weights. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Davis: ``I don't feel that I've yet discovered how good I  
can get.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Outlines U.S. Aid to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday urged  
Americans to contribute to the relief effort for earthquake-ravaged 
Turkey and he outlined various ways the United States was assisting 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turkey is our longtime ally and the people of turkey are our  
friends,'' the vacationing president said in a statement. ``Now 
with many of them in desperate need, we must do all we can to help, 
and we will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official death toll topped 12,000 on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The task ahead is immense,'' he said. ``Approximately one  
million people are sleeping outdoors, clean water is scarce, and 
the risk of disease is rapidly increasing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is offering a broad range of assistance,  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Military and civilian personnel are helping with search and  
rescue efforts, assessing emergency needs, providing medical 
services, delivering medicines, blankets and tents and helping to 
coordinate an outpouring of aid from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said it was clear that many Americans will want to  
help relieve the suffering and restore hope to Turkey's stricken 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I encourage my fellow citizens to give generously to  
responsible charitable organizations that are supporting relief 
efforts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said cash donations will enable relief  
organizations to purchase exactly the supplies they need and speed 
up the delivery of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said the USS Kearsarge will arrive later in the  
week, bringing substantial medical support, while the USS Gunston 
Hall and USS Ponce are to arrive shortly thereafter. The three 
ships will contribute 2,200 Marines and 22 helicopters to the 
relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said U.S. relief agencies already have delivered  
30,000 blankets, 500 rolls of plastic sheeting and medicine for 
10,000 people. Water purification units capable of meeting the 
needs of 28,000 people also are on the way.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Seems Summerless With Cold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- For many residents of the Pacific Northwest, the  
only thing that gets them through them through the dark, dank 
winters is the promise of a bright, warm summer. 
</P>
<P>
	They're still waiting: This summer is the coolest in Seattle  
since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's complaining about it. ... It's a little  
depressing,'' said Ronnica Hamm, 32, working the deli counter at a 
grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	The average high temperatures in June and July were 3 degrees to  
4 degrees below normal, while rainfall was slightly higher than 
usual. Seattle has had just two 80-degree days this month; last 
year, there had been seven by mid-month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually you can count on one really good month and we didn't  
even get that this year,'' said longtime local columnist Emmett 
Watson, now of The Seattle Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Some visitors from east of the Rockies -- where much of the  
country has been sweltering through heat and drought -- find it 
refreshing, but many locals are hurting. 
</P>
<P>
	``People feel cheated when they don't get a nice June,'' said  
Cliff Mass, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University 
of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Mass is expecting sunshine in late August and September, but  
said the only remarkable weather this summer was the series of 
thunderstorms -- ``not only unusual but quite entertaining'' -- that 
marked the beginning of August. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologist Ted Buehner at the National Weather Service said  
residents are feeling ``ripped off'' by the cloudy, drizzly summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got done with a La Nina winter that was really soggy,  
really windy and rather depressing,'' Buehner said. ``Now they're 
hearing that we're going to have La Nina again this winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even plants are confused.  
</P>
<P>
	Local gardeners say plants are blooming out of their usual  
sequence and some magnolias and azaleas bloomed twice, said Carrie 
Bowman, who tends the Seattle Library gardens around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Woodland Park Zoo, deputy director Mike Waller said June  
attendance was down 22 percent from last year and was ``probably 
the worst in our history.'' He said most people would rather see 
the zoo on a sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to change that, since we have a series of indoor  
exhibits,'' Waller said. ``But if you're going to drag your kids in 
strollers, it's pretty uncomfortable to do that in the rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buehner hasn't given up hope on summer, which doesn't officially  
begin here until July 12 and extends well into September. 
</P>
<P>
	Things look good this weekend, with a high near 80 forecast for  
Sunday. Still, Buehner said he's been a bit cautious about 
admitting his profession in some circles: ``They want to blame 
somebody.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Park Protection Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday urged  
Congress to fund his efforts to preserve national parks and 
historic sites, saying GOP leaders' tax plan ``would actually roll 
back our progress'' on environmental protections. 
</P>
<P>
	In a radio address taped while here on vacation, Clinton asked  
for the full $1 billion included in his budget proposal for a 
``lands legacy'' initiative. The money would be used to acquire and 
preserve 110 parks or historic sites in 40 states and territories. 
He also urged lawmakers to approve permanent funding of $1 billion 
a year for such projects, beginning in fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republican-controlled Congress has approved less than  
half of Clinton's request for the budget year that begins Oct. 1, 
which he said means that national treasures could become a victim 
of Republican leaders' push for a large tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican leadership's risky tax plan would actually roll  
back our progress,'' Clinton said. ``It would cut funding to our 
national parks, even threaten to shut some of them down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout this century, the stewardship of our lands has not  
been a partisan issue. It's been a bipartisan cause,'' he said. 
``It is our sacred obligation to leave this land a better land for 
our children and for generations yet to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A House Republican leader responded by saying ``there isn't a  
single aspect'' of the tax-cut plan that will hurt the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just one more attempt by President Clinton to scare  
the American public with threats of dire consequences if sound 
Republican ideas are implemented,'' Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma 
said in a statement. ``So far, not a single one of his dire 
predictions has come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced that the U.S. Forest Service has reached a $13  
million agreement to acquire more than 9,000 acres of forest and 
grasslands adjacent to Yellowstone National Park that will help 
bison and other roaming herds survive and preserve underground 
springs that feed the park's geysers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll ensure that Old Faithful remains faithful for years to  
come,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the Forest Service will acquire 9,300 acres  
of the 12,000-acre Royal Teton Ranch north of Yellowstone, which is 
a collection of forest and grasslands that run from the Yellowstone 
River to the Gallatin Range. The agreement also gives the ranch's 
geothermal rights to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called the agreement ``another milestone in our effort  
to preserve the matchless wonders of America's first national 
park'' and said the government was acting to protect other sites. 
Among them are ancient petroglyphs in New Mexico's Bandelier 
National Monument, the Big Sur Coast in California and the 
birthplace of Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	William Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society, praised  
the Yellowstone acquisition and expressed ``hope that Congress 
promptly enacts legislation that would increase funding for 
national conservation and recreation programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife, also  
applauded the president's announcement. ``Although we no longer 
have a budget deficit, we still have a serious conservation deficit 
that we must address immediately,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With permanent funding, Clinton said Civil War battlefields, the  
Lewis and Clark trail, the Cape Cod national seashore and the 
Pelican Island refuge in Florida, the nation's first wildlife 
sanctuary, also could be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our land is more than a haven for wildlife or a vacation spot.  
It embodies our very history and our culture,'' Clinton said. ``In 
too many places, vital pieces of this heritage are disappearing. 
Once lost, they can't be replaced.''

<HEADLINE> Naked Ghosts Scaring Iraqi Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Ghost stories are pretty common around the  
old Iraqi city of Haditha. Still, when the ghosts start dancing 
naked in front of oncoming motorists, it creates quite a stir. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Alwan weekly said Saturday that drivers passing  
through Horan Valley outside the town of Haditha, 135 miles 
northeast of Baghdad, were reporting that ``ghosts appeared next to 
the bridge, naked and doing some acrobatic moves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tales of ghosts in the Horan Valley are common, but these ghosts  
were ``throwing themselves before cars, causing the drivers to 
panic,'' the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alwan quoted motorist Shawki Sabar as saying ``they were almost  
human -- although I could not concentrate on their looks because I 
was so scared and it was dark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ghosts were so lifelike that one motorist thought he'd hit a  
person and reported the accident to police. The newspaper said the 
police checked the area for a body, but found nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some motorists apparently suspect a less supernatural  
explanation. According to Alwan, drivers don't brake for ghosts 
just in case they are really a ploy by thieves to rob cars.

<HEADLINE> Parcells Not Happy With Jets Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Quarterback Rick Mirer takes the field  
for the Jets on Sunday afternoon. He may not like what he finds. 
</P>
<P>
	An irritated coach Bill Parcells again lashed into his ballclub  
Saturday, a day after enduring the team's listless performance in a 
10-9 preseason victory over the visiting Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	Players have been told to expect tougher practices and higher  
expectations, beginning Sunday when the Jets return to their 
Hofstra training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the more difficult things to explain to someone,  
but I can tell you I have seen this kind of behavior on a couple of 
other teams that I have had,'' Parcells said in a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really seen this kind of thing exist without a hard  
lesson having to be learned. I know if things don't change, if our 
team doesn't pick itself up, it will not be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the game, the Jets announced that they had traded a  
conditional pick in next year's draft to the Packers for Mirer, 
expected to immediately step in as the main backup to starter Vinny 
Testaverde. Mirer, a former first-round pick who Parcells passed up 
in favor of Drew Bledsoe in the 1993 draft, met with Jets 
quarterbacks coach Dan Henning and Parcells Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to see him, see where he is,'' Parcells  
said. ``We've got a lot of work to do with him before we put him in 
any situation. You've got to teach him what you want first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer may not be alone.  
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's game, played in occasionally heavy rain at Giants  
Stadium, Parcells saw his special teams and second-tier offensive 
and defensive units struggle for the second straight week. The Jets 
managed only 94 yards in the second half, failing to score, and 
found themselves fending off Eagles' threats too many times for 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, expected by many to contend for the AFC championship,  
are 1-1 in the preseason. Philadelphia, playing under first-year 
coach Andy Reid, fell to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play like we're capable of playing, like we want to  
be a Super Bowl team,'' Jets safety Victor Green said. ``We need 
more of a sense of urgency. If we keep coming out flat like we did 
... We just can't turn it on Sept. 12th (the season opener against 
the Patriots).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles rolled up 145 yards in kickoff and punt returns  
against the vaunted Jets' coverage units, gaining quality field 
position for much of the game. However, the Jets defense held the 
punchless Philadelphia offense to 220 yards, including 136 through 
the air, posting seven sacks, intercepting two throws and knocking 
down two passes by starting quarterback Doug Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
	The bright spot of that effort came with 9:58 left in the first  
half. The Eagles, set up at the Jets' 1-yard line when Leon Johnson 
muffed a punt, failed to punch the ball into the end zone, settling 
for Norm Johnson's 22-yard field goal, one of three scores for 
Johnson on the night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a kind of lackluster type of performance,'' Parcells  
said. ``But I think if I'm looking for something positive, the 
defense did respond well to the ball being on the 1-foot line and 
holding them to three points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than that, we just didn't do very much.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jets backup quarterback Scott Zolak, told by a friend just  
before kickoff of the team's acquisition of Mirer, failed to rise 
to the occasion, completing just 10 of 22 passes for 90 yards and 
getting sacked three times. The Jets punted on all six possessions 
under Zolak.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Keeps Eye on Foreign Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fruit growers cried foul when the government  
recently decided to ban one pesticide that they use and restrict 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	They fear foreign growers will keep spraying the chemicals on  
produce they ship to the United States, giving them an advantage 
over American producers who may have to use more expensive 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	But government officials say imported produce is just as safe as  
domestic varieties and that they won't let foreign producers get 
around U.S. restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll certainly be taking action against firms, whether  
domestic or imported, that aren't following the rules,'' said Terry 
Troxell, who is in charge of enforcing pesticide standards for the 
Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspections by FDA and the Agriculture Department seldom find  
violations of U.S. pesticide limits on either domestic or imported 
varieties, and in some cases, foreign produce even has fewer 
chemicals on it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, FDA found pesticide residue on 58 percent of the  
domestic fruit and 36 percent of the imported fruit it sampled. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 1 percent of the domestic fruit and 2.9 percent of the  
imported had residues that exceeded limits set by the Environmental 
Protection Agency. Officials say such violations are often minor 
and inadvertent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very rare that the imports have a worse pesticide problem  
than domestic produce,'' said Edward Groth, a scientist for 
Consumers Union, the research organization that publishes Consumer 
Reports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers Union analyzed four years of USDA inspection data,  
from 1994 to 1997, and found that pesticide residues varied widely 
depending on the year and the type of produce that was tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic peaches, apples, pears and green beans all had higher  
pesticide levels than imported varieties. Imports were higher when 
it came to Chilean grapes, Canadian and Mexican carrots, Mexican 
broccoli and tomatoes, Argentinian and Hungarian apple juice and 
Brazilian orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
	The study said U.S. peaches had 10 times the level of toxicity  
as Chilean peaches, largely because the domestic variety tested 
positive for methyl parathion, the chemical the EPA recently said 
it will ban from use on fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Traces of methyl parathion were found on U.S. apples in 1994,  
1995 and 1996 and on domestic grapes in 1994 and 1995. The chemical 
didn't show up on any apples imported from New Zealand or any of 
the Mexican grapes brought in during those years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to banning methyl parathion, EPA also is requiring  
growers to cut back on use of azinphos-methyl, which is used on 80 
percent of the nation's apples and a variety of other crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups contend that methyl parathion and other chemicals  
break down so quickly after they are applied that inspectors often 
can't find them. 
</P>
<P>
	But FDA officials say their inspection techniques allow them to  
catch minute traces of chemicals well after they are sprayed. 
Methyl parathion can be detected in amounts of 10 parts per billion 
-- 100 to 200 times below existing limits for the pesticide, 
according to FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA inspects fruits and vegetables as they are trucked  
across the border or shipped from domestic producers, while USDA 
tests produce the way consumers would use it at home, whether 
peeled, cooked or served whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups said there was no sound scientific basis for  
restricting either methyl parathion or azinphos-methyl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that foreign food is less safe. It's a fairness issue  
to growers,'' said Adam Sharp, director of agricultural chemical 
issues for the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA was acting under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, which  
requires it to evaluate tolerances for 10,000 pesticide uses. The 
law was intended to make sure there is a sufficient safety factor 
for chemicals ingested by children.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Wolverines Coach Portrayed in GQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Longtime Michigan football coach Bo  
Schembechler abused and humiliated his players and stepsons, a 
former player writes in a magazine article. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bully Bo,'' written by ex-player Elwood Reid, appears in the  
September issue of ``Gentleman's Quarterly,'' which is to appear on 
newsstands Tuesday. Reid was approached about writing the article 
by Schembechler's youngest stepson, Matt, 40, The Ann Arbor News 
reported. The story is a recollection of the men's experiences with 
Bo Schembechler, who coached the Wolverines from 1969-89. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured (Matt Schembechler) has an ax to grind. And maybe I  
do, too, because the truth is that Bo has never left me,'' writes 
Reid, who played two seasons at Michigan and did not speak with Bo 
Schembechler before writing the article. ``Even now I can hear his 
voice, feel the snap of his gaze as I stand in judgment before him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt also bears the mark of Bo and his demanding  
how-to-be-a-man dicta. I want to hear his story: what it was like 
to live with the man for whom I've carried around a sack of hate 
since I stepped on the field more than a decade ago. A man who 
haunts my dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ann Arbor News, which received an advance copy of the  
article, said it could not reach Bo Schembechler, Matt Schembechler 
or Reid for comment. There was no answer at Bo Schembechler's home 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Jilek, a linebacker under Schembechler from 1973-75, said  
most of Schembechler's former players thought well of him then and 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``My experience with Bo was very positive,'' said Jilek, an Ann  
Arbor-based insurance agent. ``I've always had a great deal of 
respect for him. I'm sure, like any organization, someone can 
become disillusioned because of their own experiences, but I feel 
to this day that Bo is an honest, straightforward person. You never 
had to guess what he was thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Schembechler, an Ann Arbor businessman, is suing his  
father, the university and 12 other defendants, accusing them of 
trying to ruin his sports memorabilia business and damage his 
reputation.

<HEADLINE> 'Mork and Mindy' Actor in Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A once illustrious Manhattan gallery that helped  
launch Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning folds. And what, you 
may ask, does this have to do with the old TV show ``Mork and 
Mindy''? 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll Janis charges in a lawsuit that his brother, actor  
Conrad Janis, who played Mindy's dad on the 1970s sitcom, 
effectively looted the Sidney Janis Gallery started by their 
father, forcing it to close last month. 
</P>
<P>
	No way, says Conrad in a countersuit -- it was Carroll who looted  
and mismanaged the assets of their father, a onetime vaudeville 
dancer whose gallery off Fifth Avenue opened a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget Mork and Mindy. This is more like Cain and Abel.  
</P>
<P>
	In March, Carroll's suit claims, the 71-year-old Conrad  
``attempted to physically attack'' his 67-year-old brother -- a 
confrontation thwarted only when he ``was grabbed from behind'' and 
``physically restrained'' by his own assistant and his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, Sidney Janis, opened the gallery with his wife  
Harriet in 1948. He had a reputation for spotting trends, and in 
1961 mounted an exhibit that ushered in Pop Art. The father died in 
1989 at age 93, leaving most of his $200 million fortune to his two 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Pollock and de Kooning, their joint holdings include  
works by Albers, Motherwell, Oldenburg, Picasso, Braque, Klee, 
Leger, Dubuffet and Duchamp. 
</P>
<P>
	But things went sour, and their dispute came to state Supreme  
Court this week in dueling lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad claims his younger brother overpaid himself, handed  
interest-free loans and art bargains to relatives and friends, made 
unauthorized contributions to charity and wouldn't give him the 
keys to the gallery or the access code to the burglar alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll counters that he got stuck with all the work while  
Conrad traipsed off to Beverly Hills to pursue his acting career. 
He says Conrad enjoyed ``a free ride'' while abandoning 
responsibility for the gallery, which ``provided him with a 
handsome living for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, says Carroll's suit, his brother caused the  
business ``enormous financial damages'' by spoiling the New York 
brother's reputation with ``baseless and scurrilous allegations'' 
during a weak art market in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	One work the brothers are quibbling over is the late Quaker  
painter Edward Hicks' ``The Peaceable Kingdom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the sniping siblings had tried to settle things  
privately. Referred to in Conrad's suit as the ``management'' team 
of Carroll and Conrad, they even hired advisers to examine company 
finances from the time Carroll took over day-to-day operations in 
September 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides ``are attempting to amicably resolve their dispute,''  
says Conrad's lawyer, Brian Caplan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mork and Mindy, Robin Williams played the space alien Mork  
from Ork, who was taken in by Mindy (Pam Dawber). Janis played 
Mindy's father. Mork and Mindy eventually marry and honeymoon on 
Ork, populated by bizarre creatures. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is no sitcom. Stay tuned to Carroll and Conrad.

<HEADLINE> Jones, Greene Set 100-Meter Paces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Marion Jones and Maurice Greene opened  
their bids for multiple gold medals with sensational times Saturday 
in the quarterfinals of the 100 meters at the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, seeking an unprecedented four golds, won her heat in a  
championship record 10.76 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, shooting for a rare sprint double and three golds, ran  
9.91, the sixth fastest time in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' time shattered the previous championship record of 10.82  
set by fellow American Gail Devers in 1993 in Stuttgart. She also 
bettered her season's leading previous best of 10.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four women in history have run faster, including Jones, who  
posted 10.65 last year. The late Florence Griffith-Joyner still 
holds the world record of 10.49, set in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 semifinals and finals are set for Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	After being called for a false start, Jones blew away the rest  
of the field as she solidified her status as the overwhelming 
favorite for the sprint title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have asked for a better atmosphere, better  
weather,'' Jones said. ``The track is fast, fast, fast. Watch for 
some world records.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also qualifying for the semifinals in impressive style was  
American Inger Miller, who won her heat in a personal best 10.86, 
her first sub-11 since 1996. Greece's Ekaterini Thanos also ran 
10.86, a national record. 
</P>
<P>
	Others advancing included Devers and France's Christine Arron,  
both in 11 flat. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 100, Greene clocked his seventh sub-10 race of the  
year and showed signs he may be set to threaten the world record of 
9.79 he set earlier this year in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very fast final,'' Greene said.  
``Everybody's predicting I'll break (the record). We'll have to 
wait and see about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene outran one of his top rivals, Canada's Bruny Surin, who  
clocked 9.95. 
</P>
<P>
	``My coach (John Smith) told me, `Show 'em a little bit, but  
don't show 'em all of it,''' said Greene, who is also competing in 
the 200 and 400 relay. ``I believe I did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others winning their heats were Obadele Thompson of Barbados  
(10.04), Jason Gardener of Britain (10.04), Dwain Chambers of 
Britain (10.08) and Namibia's Frankie Fredericks (10.09). 
</P>
<P>
	The first gold medal of the championships went to Russia's Ilya  
Markov, who won the men's 20-kilometer walk in 1 hour, 23.34. 
Olympic champion Jefferson Perez of Ecuador took the silver, 45 
seconds behind, while defending champion Daniel Garcia of Spain was 
third, another 12 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	The versatile Jones also advanced to the final of the long jump.  
She is seeking gold medals in the 100, 200, long jump and a relay. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long jump, Jones leaped 22 feet, 4 1-4 inches on her  
second attempt, a distance that automatically put her into Monday's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the most confident I've been all year (in the long jump)  
and pleased that I could get through qualifying on the second 
jump,'' Jones said. ``My rhythm is a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best long jump qualifier was Italy's Fiona May, the 1995  
world champion. May soared 23 feet, 1 1-4 inches, the second-best 
jump in the world this year, on her first try. 
</P>
<P>
	A third American attempting to win multiple medals, John Godina,  
began his bid for a third straight shot put title, qualifying for 
Saturday night's final with a heave of 67 feet, 10 3-4 inches, the 
best of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Toth, also of the U.S., had the second-best qualifying  
throw, 67 feet, 4 inches, and the other two Americans, Andy Bloom 
and C.J. Hunter, Jones' husband, also made the shot put final. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's opening event of the heptathlon, the 100 hurdles,  
France's Eunice Barber, the European champion, made a strong 
impression, winning her heat in a personal-best 12.89 seconds. The 
next-fastest time among the 22 competitors was 13.28 by U.S. 
champion Shelia Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American, Tiffany Lott-Hogan, was disqualified for two  
false starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber had another career-best in the second event, clearing  
1.93 meters (6-4), for a total of 2,286 points and a 185-point lead 
over runner-up Denise Lewis of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some big surprises in the men's hammer throw  
qualifying. Among those failing to reach Sunday's final were the 
1-2 finishers at the 1996 Olympics, Balazs Kiss of Hungary and 
Lance Deal of the United States, along with Uzbekistan's Andrey 
Abduvaliyev, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist and 1993 and 1995 world 
champion, and Russia's Vasilly Sidorenko, the 1997 world bronze 
medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsten Kobs of Germany had the longest qualifying throw,  
258-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one thing could have stolen the stage Saturday from the  
world's No. 1 sprinters: the revelation of a drug case involving 
yet another big star. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of positive tests involving some of athletics' biggest  
names -- Merlene Ottey, Javier Sotomayor, Linford Christie and 
Dennis Mitchell -- had dulled some of the anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last couple of weeks our beautiful and lovely sport  
has been marred by all of this,'' said Jones, unbeaten since 1997 
in the two sprints. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that our wonderful performances will overshadow what  
has happened.''

<HEADLINE> Irvan Upgraded From Fair to Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Ernie Irvan, who sustained a bruised lung  
and a mild head injury in a crash at Michigan Speedway, was listed 
in good condition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, doctors at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in nearby Ypsilanti,  
who has listed Irvan's condition as fair after the crash Friday, 
decided to keep him until at least Sunday to run a few more tests 
on the injured NASCAR Winston Cup star. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Cameron, public relations director for the speedway, said  
Irvan's family had decided not to grant interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan, injured five years to the day after a near-fatal wreck on  
the same track will be replaced Sunday in the Pepsi 400 by Dick 
Trickle. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan, 40, was knocked unconscious in the crash in turn 4 during  
a Busch Grand National practice session, but became responsive as 
he was being transported to the infield medical center. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers trying to get Irvan out had to cut the roof from his  
car. He appeared to lose control of his Pontiac and spun in turn 4 
on the banked 2-mile oval. The rear quarter panel struck the 
concrete wall before the driver's side made contact. 
</P>
<P>
	As he was removed from the car, Irvan appeared to pick his arm  
up in what looked like a wave. 
</P>
<P>
	When Irvan crashed in turn 2 during Winston Cup practice on Aug.  
20, 1994, he was unconscious for two days. Irvan had critical brain 
and chest injuries. He was given only a 10-percent chance of 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	But he returned to the Winston Cup circuit on Oct. 1, 1995, in  
North Wilkesboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan had planned to compete in both the Busch Series race  
Saturday and the Winston Cup event. He co-owns the Busch car, and 
is in his second year driving the Winston Cup car for MB2 
Motorsports. Last month, Irvan's contract was extended through the 
end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan has 15 Winston Cup victories, but none since taking the  
June race at Michigan in 1997. He is 26th this year in the 
standings.

<HEADLINE> Speakership Changes Hastert's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENDOTA, Ill. (AP) -- If any constituent doubts that House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert has arrived as a Washington power figure, 
they should ponder this: After years of riding almost 
inconspicuously in the Sweet Corn Festival parade atop his 1953 
fire truck, he moved to the head of the line this year as grand 
marshal. 
</P>
<P>
	A security detail now accompanies the Illinois Republican nearly  
everywhere, making it difficult for him to get around. Gone are the 
days when he could unwind in the peace of a comfortable ranch-style 
home that slopes down to the Fox River. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's the same unassuming, easygoing guy his constituents  
have known all along. Except for the security detail that shadows 
him, he still could walk through an airport concourse unnoticed, 
much less accosted, by celebrity-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the office he now holds -- second in line of succession to  
the presidency -- has changed his universe. There is less time for 
his wife, Jean, and their two sons, for walking his three Labrador 
retrievers, for tinkering with his four antique Lincoln cars, for 
sipping coffee with buddies at the Cozy Corner. 
</P>
<P>
	For him, home always has been in the Fox River valley west of  
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty proud to say, 'Yes, I'm the speaker of the House,  
but I come out of the cornfields of Illinois,''' Hastert, 57, 
recently told a crowd at Mendota's Del Monte vegetable processing 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	It is to the communities amid the fields of farms that Hastert  
turns to keep his new job from changing who he is. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, in this business, especially in a job like this, you  
can get your head someplace where it shouldn't be,'' Hastert said 
in a recent interview on his back porch. ``But you come back home, 
and you're home. You're back where you've always been and your feet 
are back on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's why he used a brilliantly sunny Sunday this month to  
attend the Mendota parade, where he is whisked by police escort to 
the front float, his hunched, hulking frame perched on the back 
seat of a sporty red convertible. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks here don't call their local-boy-made-good by his formal  
title of Mr. Speaker, and their cheers don't have the edge that 
might greet a celebrity. Instead, the former high school teacher 
and wrestling coach just heard warm, familiar cries of ``Way to go 
Denny'' and ``Good to see ya', Coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional recess allowed Hastert his longest stay in  
Illinois since he took the speaker's gavel in January -- a welcome 
rest from the Capitol Hill battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert was criticized for his inability to line up GOP support  
for a resolution supporting U.S. intervention in Kosovo. And there 
have been repeated questions about whether Majority Whip Tom DeLay, 
R-Texas, is the real power in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert also can claim some accomplishments, including  
pushing through a $792 billion tax-cut bill before the August break 
and legislation to protect businesses from liability for year 2000 
computer glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	But even his nine days at home were hardly work-free. There was  
the parade, along with the visit to the Del Monte plant and the 
nearby home of Horace Hume, an energetic farm machinery inventor 
and longtime Republican marking his 101st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another day had Hastert in Elgin leading a rally to promote the  
Republicans' tax cut. He was even diverted from his wife's family 
reunion to do a fund raiser. Then he hit the road for an 11-day 
fund-raising swing through the West -- yet another task that comes 
with the new job. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a schedule is par for the course. When the House is in  
session, Hastert usually arrives at his office at 7:30 a.m., often 
staying until 10:30 p.m. or later. Many weekends, he travels the 
country for fund raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and his wife decided not to move their home to  
Washington -- ``to be a part of all that,'' as Hastert put it. And 
since Jean Hastert's job as an elementary school gym teacher often 
leaves them with conflicting vacations, they must be creative in 
finding time together. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, she and their youngest son, Ethan, a University of  
Illinois student, accompanied Hastert on part of the Western trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to spend some time with your family, that's  
how you have to spend it,'' Hastert said. ``They're going to have 
to sacrifice, intersperse that time that we have together with 
campaign events.''

<HEADLINE>  Egyptian Players Evacuated to Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Three Egyptian squash players competing in  
the Arab Games who were injured in a bus accident were evacuated 
Saturday to Cairo in an Egyptian military plane, diplomatic sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those flown back home on the orders of President Hosni  
Mubarak was Nesreen Nasha't who sustained a concussion and 
underwent three surgeries on her broken jaw and leg, said the 
sources, who did not wish to be identified further. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasha't was in stable condition after spending a night in the  
intensive care unit and was discharged, said officials at King 
Hussein Medical City hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a bus carrying several Egyptian athletes overturned,  
killing the Jordanian driver, whose name was not disclosed. Members 
of the Egyptian squash team were on an outing to the city of Madaba 
on their day off between matches at the Arab Games in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two players flown back with Nasha't were Iman Amir and  
Umniya Abdul Qawi, both of whom sustained bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Amir won the silver medal and Qawi the bronze in the women's  
squash championship on Thursday. Nasha't finished eighth in the 
individual championship, which ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt has already sent replacements for the three players and  
will continue participating in the team competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's state-run Petra news agency said King Abdullah II  
visited the Egyptians at the hospital earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's accident occurred outside Madaba, 20 miles southwest of  
Amman. The city is known for its Byzantine ruins featuring mosaic 
floors. It is also the site of Mount Nebo, where Moses is said to 
have sighted the promised land.

<HEADLINE> A's Put Chavez on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rookie third baseman Eric Chavez was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday with a right foot 
injury, and the Oakland Athletics recalled outfielder Jason 
McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez was hurt during an 11-0 loss to Toronto on Friday when he  
tried to avoid being tagged at first base and his foot landed 
awkwardly on the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was diagnosed as plantar fascia, a tearing of the  
membrane in the back of the foot. He's expected to be sidelined at 
least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who was hitting .259, was playing well for the A's after  
a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the All-Star break, Chavez was hitting .324 with six home  
runs and he was tied for the AL lead among third baseman with a 
.958 fielding percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland manager Art Howe said Olmedo Saenz and Scott Spiezio  
will split time at third in Chavez's absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Spiezio and Saenz will do a nice job for us at  
third,'' Howe said. ``We're certainly going to miss Chavez because 
he was doing so well for us. He had nice range and played very 
solid third base for us. He solidified the lower part of our order, 
gave us some power there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other two guys are going to have to step in, give us  
quality at bats and play as solid as they can at third. I'm sure 
they both can because they've shown us they can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald was optioned to Double-A Midland on Wednesday when the  
A's acquired Rich Becker in a trade with Milwaukee. However, he was 
recalled before he appeared in a game for Midland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be here, obviously,'' said McDonald, who began  
his third tour with the A's this season. ``The team was doing well 
and I wanted to be up here and be a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, walking around the club house on crutches, said he  
suffered a similar foot injury last year while he was in the minor 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, it bothered me for about six weeks but this one  
doesn't feel as bad,'' Chavez said. ``I want to make it back as 
soon as I can but it might take me the whole three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to stay off it. They said the only thing that can  
heal this is time.''

<HEADLINE> Fans of Kitsch Tour Cultural Icons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The tackier the better for these folks.  
</P>
<P>
	In the city that brought America sacks of little square  
hamburgers sold in porcelain steel White Castles, nostalgic fans of 
commercial kitsch met this weekend to discuss the historical 
significance of eye-catching roadside design. 
</P>
<P>
	In spirit at least, the electric buzz of old neon was in the air  
as members of the Society for Commercial Archeology shared their 
passion for preserving familiar and forgotten monuments to American 
culture, especially the gaudy ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me personally, nothing is too over-the-top,'' said  
participant Bert Bedeau, who works at the Idaho State Historic 
Preservation Office in Boise. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides classic White Castle burger joints, made to look like  
miniature medieval fortresses, the society was drawn to Columbus 
for its wealth of vintage motels and fast-food restaurants, 
roadside businesses whose main marketing goal was to get drivers to 
pull over. 
</P>
<P>
	The society is made up of architects, designers, teachers,  
collectors and others who simply have a taste for 20th century 
power marketing, said Daniel Hershberger of Plymouth, Mich., 
society president. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's bus tour agenda Saturday included a stop at the  
headquarters of White Castle, which sells little square burgers by 
the sack at about 330 restaurants, mostly in the Midwest and the 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	Company founders began experimenting with steel buildings in the  
'20s because they were easy to maintain and simple to dismantle and 
move, a necessity in still-developing urban areas. They settled on 
steel covered with white porcelain enamel. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're looking at is one of the earliest trademark  
buildings. This is a building designed, essentially, to be a 
three-dimensional logo,'' Hershberger said. ``It's a hamburger 
restaurant, but it's made to look like a castle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all society members agree fast-food is worth commemorating,  
as the group did with a kick-off reception at the flagship Wendy's 
hamburger restaurant. Large fast-food chains helped force oldtime 
diners and owner-operated lunch counters that the society reveres 
out of business, said Nancy Sturm, a fund-raiser for the National 
Endowment for the Humanities in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might visit a White Castle because it speaks of the region,  
but a place like Wendy's that has national penetration doesn't 
thrill me,'' Ms. Sturm said. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Wendy's, located in a downtown building that had  
once housed a car dealership, opened in 1969. It now features a 
museum detailing the history of Wendy's International Inc., which 
has 5,300 outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Another society fascination is old motels. Dozens still stand  
between downtown Columbus and Newark, about 30 miles to the east. 
Most went out of business during the 1960s, but society members 
collect and photograph the distinctive artwork of their colorful 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems there are about 11,000 places called the Sands  
Motel,'' said Ed Dorsa, an associate professor of industrial design 
at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	He actually had pictures of just three, along with dozens of  
neon signs he photographed in the Southwest and during a 
cross-country trip. He was looking for ideas to publish his 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	The society, which is funded through member dues and corporate  
sponsorship, strives to raise public awareness about what's left of 
urban curbside commerce that was abandoned for freeways and 
suburban mini-malls, said Christian Overland of Dearborn, who works 
at the Ford museum. 
</P>
<P>
	It works with other organizations that have similar goals and  
members who also often feels left out by higher profile groups that 
fight to preserve more famous landmarks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're bringing groups together who thought they were by  
themselves,'' Overland said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Feds Raid Bank of New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal investigators reportedly raided the Wall  
Street office of the Bank of New York in connection to a major 
international money-laundering scheme that authorities say involves 
the Russian mob. 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's raid, investigators seized the files of Natasha  
Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a senior vice president who supervised the 
bank's East European division, a source close to the bank told The 
New York Times in Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	She and a bank vice president in London, Lucy Edwards, were  
suspended on Wednesday. Both women are married to Russian 
businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	British authorities also searched Ms. Edwards' home and office.  
Her husband, Peter Berlin, had authority over some accounts at the 
bank. Neither she nor her husband has been accused of any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	However, investigators told the Times that the couple may be  
involved in one of the largest money-laundering operations ever 
conducted in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as $10 billion allegedly was laundered through the bank  
in what investigators say is an operation run by Russian organized 
crime, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $4.2 billion passed through a single account in more than  
10,000 transactions between October and March, the newspaper said, 
citing unidentified investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York Co. is the nation's 15th largest.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the bank said it ``has been cooperating with the  
office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York 
in the confidential investigation of the use of bank facilities to 
transfer funds from Russia to other countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No funds were lost and there were no allegations of wrongdoing  
by the bank, according to the statement. The bank declined to 
provide further details.

<HEADLINE> College Student Convicted of Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A college student has pleaded guilty to  
illegally distributing thousands of pirated software programs, 
movies and pieces of music from his Web site, giving the government 
its first Internet piracy conviction under a 1997 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Levy, 22, was charged in February with violating the  
federal No Electronic Theft Act after investigators found the 
material had been distributed through equipment at his apartment in 
Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior at the University of Oregon entered his plea in U.S.  
District Court on Friday. Levy allowed the public to download the 
material for free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Levy's case should serve as a notice that the Justice  
Department has made prosecution of Internet piracy one of its 
priorities,'' said Assistant Attorney General James Robinson, the 
chief of the department's criminal division in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is theft, pure and simple,'' Robinson said  
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 law makes it illegal to reproduce or distribute  
copyrighted works such as software and digital recordings, even if 
it is distributed without charge. Such piracy cost companies an 
estimated $11 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI was tipped to Levy by university computer managers who  
saw an unusually high volume of traffic on one of its servers, 
computers that typically handle connections with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We watch all of our network connections because you have to  
monitor the traffic patterns overall for the campus to make sure 
there aren't any problems,'' said Joanne Hugi, director of the 
university's computer center. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the school does not monitor individual exchanges, but  
watches volume to make sure the system is working smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sitting here being cybercops,'' Hugi said.  
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor who handled the case said Levy was downloading  
huge amounts of software and digital recordings that he passed 
along to anybody who found his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tremendous amount of traffic,'' said Sean Hoar, an  
assistant U.S. attorney in Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the act, reproducing or distributing more than 10  
copyright works with a total value of more than $2,500 is a felony 
punishable by up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy is to be sentenced Nov. 22.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Wins Alabama Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- The beaten-favorite jinx in the  
Alabama Stakes was trampled Saturday under the flying hooves of 
Silverbulletday at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-5 betting choice simply ran away from six rivals as she  
became the first favorite to win the Grade I stakes for 3-year-old 
fillies since Sky Beauty in 1993. Four of the beaten favorites in 
the five previous runnings of the Alabama were odds-on. The other 
was even money. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth or fourth until a half-mile remained, Silverbulletday then  
was moved into third by Jerry Bailey. She was second and pressuring 
Strolling Belle approaching the quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Then -- whoosh! -- Silverbulletday was gone, and the end of the 1 1/4  
miles she was 9 lengths ahead Strolling Belle. Gandria was another 
3 lengths back and 6 1/2 lengths ahead of On a Soapbox. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome -- that's the word that says it best,'' Bailey said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really impressed with her performance,'' owner Mike Pegram  
said. ``She's a gift from heaven and a once-in-a-lifetime horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday finished in 2:02 3-5 under level weight of 121  
pounds after a final quarter in under 24 seconds. Although it had 
rained for most of the afternoon, the track was listed as fast and 
the rain virtually had stopped by the 4:45 p.m. post time for the 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the seventh win in eight starts and 13th in 15 career  
outings for Silverbulletday, trained by Bob Baffert. It also was 
her 10th straight win over fillies and her first at beyond 1 1/8 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that 1 1/4 miles might be too far for  
Silverbulletday after her seventh-place finish in the 1 1/2-mile 
Belmont Stakes on June 5. The Belmont, however, was against colts. 
Against fillies, she simply is in a league of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to keep her with the fillies,'' Baffert said. ``I  
think it's one of those things where we're enjoying her. With Real 
Quiet being out, you have to enjoy the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert trains and Pegram owns Real Quiet, the 1998 Kentucky  
Derby and Preakness winner and winner of the Pimlico Special and 
Hollywood Gold Cup this year. Real Quiet cracked a bone in his 
right front leg last Sunday and is finished for the year -- maybe 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram indicated Silverbulletday would next start in the Grade I  
Spinster on Oct. 16 at Keeneland, where she could face Banshee 
Breeze, the 1998 champion 3-year-old filly, who is unbeaten in four 
starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday paid $2.80, $2.50 and $2.10 and earned $240,000  
from a purse of $400,000, boosting her earnings to $2,601,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Strolling Belle, ridden by Mike Smith, returned $6.50 and $2.10.  
Canadian-bred Gandria, ridden by Shane Sellers, paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish after On a Soapbox were Adam's  
Time, Back in Shape and Brushed Halory. 
</P>
<P>
	On a Soapbox, ridden by Robby Albarado, had won the 1 1/2-mile  
Coaching Club American Oaks on July 24 at Belmont Park, but she was 
never in contention Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Radio Pioneer Recalls Signal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On Dec. 12, 1901, radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi set himself up  
in a cliffside hut near St. John's, Newfoundland, to test his 
latest transmitter and receiver. He later recorded this 
recollection: 
</P>
<P>
	``Shortly before midday I placed the single earphone to my ear  
and started listening. The receiver on the table before me was very 
crude -- a few coils and condensers and a coherer -- no (vacuum 
tubes), no amplifiers, not even a crystal. But I was at last on the 
point of putting the correctness of all my beliefs to the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The answer came at 12:30 when I heard, faintly but distinctly,  
pip-pip-pip. I handed the phone to Kemp: 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you hear anything?'' I asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' he said, '' the letter S'' -- he could hear it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew then that all my anticipations had been justified. The  
electric waves sent out into space from Poldhu (Cornwall, on the 
English coast) had traversed the Atlantic -- the distance, enormous 
as it seemed then, of 1,700 miles -- unimpeded by the curvature of 
the earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result meant much more to me than the mere successful  
realization of an experiment. ... I now felt for the first time 
absolutely certain that the day would come when mankind would be 
able to send messages without wires not only across the Atlantic 
but between the farthermost ends of the earth.''

<HEADLINE> Former Va. Governor Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Federal authorities are investigating L.  
Douglas Wilder's use of money left over from his 1990 inauguration 
as the nation's first elected black governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am currently in discussion with federal tax authorities on  
matters relating to my inaugural fund,'' Wilder said in a statement 
Friday. ``I am cooperating fully and have instructed my accountants 
and anyone else who might have relevant information to do 
likewise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilder said his attorney advised him not to comment further.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilder, governor from 1990 to 1994, was questioned about the  
inaugural fund for most of his term. A ball held on the night of 
his historic inauguration took in $1.8 million and netted $966,533. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilder said he would use the money for personal political  
expenses and to help state candidates; he donated $50,000 to the 
state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax experts said at the time that if the money went for personal  
use, he would have to pay taxes on it.

<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- On a dark, steep street, just off Hong Kong's  
trendy Mid-levels area, about two dozen people gather in a small 
bar and ask for Mr. Lau. 
</P>
<P>
	They wait, chatting and looking around at the others who are  
probably there for the same reason. After a few drinks, Lau Kin Wai 
appears and tells the crowd it's time to go. Then he walks them up 
the road to an unmarked yellow door. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems like a secret society, but it's actually a bunch of  
strangers gathering for dinner at Sichuan Cuisine Da Ping Huo -- one 
of the hottest eating venues in Hong Kong. The fact that it doesn't 
have a restaurant license or a telephone listing doesn't seem to be 
a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	From its unassuming entrance, Da Ping Huo is a far cry from  
traditional restaurants, which lure their customers off the streets 
with a riot of neon lights, tanks of live fish and gilded statues 
of Chinese deities. 
</P>
<P>
	Lau, an art critic and one of the founders of Da Ping Huo, is  
quick to explain how his business is different from others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't call this a restaurant,'' he says. ``It's just  
everyone giving a little money to eat dinner.'' The proprietors 
also don't pay taxes on what they make from the dinners, which cost 
$26 per head, Lau says, breaking from his generally staid demeanor 
to giggle. And in terms of profits, well, they just about break 
even, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Ping Huo originated when Lau, his Sichuan artist friend, Wang  
Hai, and Wang's wife, Wong Siu-king, decided to split Wong's food 
costs by cooking dinners for friends. 
</P>
<P>
	They invited the owners of a struggling furniture store into  
their dinner club, and began serving meals a few times a week at 
the furniture store. 
</P>
<P>
	Word spread quickly through Lau's art circles about the place  
and its homemade, spicy cuisine from China's southwest. Notables, 
such as opposition legislator Martin Lee and tycoon Richard Li, 
started showing up, Lau said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few months, the trio ventured out and found the tiny,  
two-room place in Mid-levels. They began serving 12-course set-menu 
meals that include Sichuan classics, such as spicy tofu and 
stir-fried beans with minced pork. Sichuan is a province in 
southwestern China known for -- among other things -- spicy food. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Ping Huo maintains its unlicensed business with no problems,  
even getting reviewed by several local newspapers. Government 
officials, celebrities and business people continue to be among its 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole fact that it's private, the quality is better.  
You're not getting restaurant food,'' says Henry Lee, who once 
waited two weeks to get his table at Da Ping Huo. Now, people wait 
up to four months, putting their names on a list that Lau keeps 
scribbled on a few folded pages in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	And as long as Da Ping Huo doesn't open loud doors to the  
public, Hong Kong's Urban Services Department has been told the 
eatery is used for private parties and so is OK to operate, says a 
department spokeswoman on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the dinner group's success, Lau says there are no plans  
to expand and legitimize the venture any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Wong, who cooks every dish herself on three household burners in  
the back room, doesn't think she could handle more customers. ``I 
just wouldn't feel right about letting anyone else do the 
cooking,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The food so impressed Lau's friend Annabel Jackson, the head of  
public relations at the five-star Mandarin Oriental that she 
arranged for Wong to cook there once a week as part of a rustic 
Chinese cuisine food promotion. The hotel charges twice the price 
for the same Da Ping Huo fare. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was eating at the tiny, hidden local dining spot that  
fascinates Henry Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole fact that it's private, the quality is better,'' Lee  
said. ``You're not getting restaurant food.''

<HEADLINE>  Comets Carry On Without Perrot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Coach Van Chancellor remembers the day  
Kim Perrot showed up to open tryouts for the Houston Comets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-5 point guard out of Southwestern Louisiana hadn't  
been taken in the WNBA draft, and Chancellor didn't think she was 
as good as those who had. 
</P>
<P>
	But Perrot stood out among 150 people in the sweaty high school  
gym. 
</P>
<P>
	``You brought your 15 best friends and put them every 20 feet  
around the court,'' Chancellor told her. ``Everywhere I went, you 
heard them say, `I know you're going to keep Kim Perrot, coach.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And he did, inviting Perrot and another player to training camp.  
</P>
<P>
	But Chancellor still wasn't convinced Perrot could do the job.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought she was a little wild,'' he said. ``She thought I  
was a conservative Mississippi coach who didn't appreciate the 
flair for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He brought in other point guards, but Perrot outplayed them and  
was signed as a developmental player. She was promoted to the 
Comets' active roster in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through half a season yanking her in and out. She never  
did quit me or get mad,'' Chancellor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot didn't give up off the court, either.  
</P>
<P>
	She was diagnosed with lung cancer in February. Eventually the  
cancer spread to her brain and after a seven-month battle, she died 
Thursday in Houston. Perrot was 32. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped the Comets win consecutive WNBA championships and in  
the process became what Chancellor called the best defensive player 
in the league, despite never winning the defensive award. 
</P>
<P>
	``But no question in my mind, for two years running the best at  
stopping the ball,'' he said. ``She could guard 94 feet better than 
anybody I've coached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets played their first game Friday night since Perrot's  
death, losing 68-64 to the Los Angeles Sparks after rallying to tie 
the game with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very proud of the Comets,'' Chancellor said. ``We just  
fought and played our heart out and did everything that you humanly 
could do to win a game under the most difficult conditions ever in 
the history of women's basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Cynthia Cooper, Perrot's best friend, chose not to play  
and didn't dress. The league's two-time MVP missed her first game 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely missed her not playing, but at the same time,  
given the circumstances, we were just glad that she came,'' said 
Comets forward Sheryl Swoopes, who scored 25 points. ``She 
definitely helped us get through this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets had a game Saturday night at Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
	Many in the Forum crowd of 13,116 -- largest of the season -- wore  
a snippet of white ribbon above their hearts in Perrot's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Several fans displayed hand-lettered signs saluting Perrot. One  
read ``Kim Perrot, 4Ever in Our Hearts.'' Another read ``Go Comets 
Go. May you have strength and fortitude. Our prayers are with 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot was remembered in a brief halftime video that opened with  
her stealing the ball and scoring on a fingertip roll. Her smile 
was prominent in highlights from last season's WNBA championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kim was a wonderful person,'' Comets reserve center Tammy  
Jackson said. ``You can't take away the energy that she brought to 
this team, the love she brought to this team. She was something 
special to each individual person. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what the mood was, you knew Kim was going to come in  
and try to bring a smile or get you to laugh. It's going to be 
missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A public service to celebrate Perrot's life will be held Monday  
at Second Baptist Church in Houston, with several players 
participating. She will be buried Tuesday in her hometown of 
Lafayette, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when the team might recover from its grief, Chancellor  
said it would be a ``long time, when you lose someone like her.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans Say Bush Passed 1st Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nightmare, painted by a rival: Republicans  
for George W. Bush wake up next year, in the middle of a 
presidential debate with the Democratic nominee, and realize their 
guy is unready and unfit. 
</P>
<P>
	That fear, Lamar Alexander's parting shot at the Texas governor,  
now has been quieted by the simple fact that Bush survived his 
first campaign crisis, said Tom Rath, a field operative of 
Alexander's defunct campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not a GOP jittery -- publicly, at least -- about its  
runaway front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Out in the real world, at the grass roots, ``people feel  
relieved to see that it wasn't a house of cards that was going to 
crumble, that he has some steel in him, he didn't go off into a 
snit,'' Rath said from New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what Lamar was asking. How will George W. do in a  
debate, where you get something thrown at you that you didn't 
expect,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rath, now uncommitted, may someday seek a job in the Bush  
operation. But his review of Bush's performance over the past week 
echoed in random checks with Republican activists and officials 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent firestorm will strengthen Bush, said Arkansas Gov.  
Mike Huckabee, who announced his endorsement of Bush in the middle 
of the three-day eruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll make him bulletproof,'' Huckabee said.  
</P>
<P>
	First, Bush angrily lashed out Wednesday at reporters pressing  
to know, based on no allegation, whether he had ever used cocaine. 
The next day, he showcased his composure by convening a news 
conference on the matter, only to contort his denials around a 
confusion of 15- or 25-year standards used to investigate the drug 
use of prospective White House employees. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, Bush was back on message: My past is nobody's  
business as long as I've learned from my mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	A Time-CNN poll released Friday backed his assertion. Fully 84  
percent of Americans surveyed said any cocaine use in his 20s 
should not disqualify Bush from being president. And of the 54 
percent who were aware of the unsubstantiated talk about Bush and 
cocaine, half thought the governor had handled it well. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansans ``are saying that if this country let Bill Clinton  
take a walk, not with allegations but with admissions of wrongdoing 
..., I'll be doggoned if I'm going to let the press and the 
opposition party take down a man for something that hasn't even 
been alleged,'' said Huckabee. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois freshman Rep. Judy Biggert said she was at a state  
Capitol event with the Young Republicans, and all the sour talk 
there was about the news media, not Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really tired of the press and the media really  
hounding candidates,'' she said. ``What we see is just that the 
press is looking for any chink in the armor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has not yet made a presidential  
endorsement and has sounded supportive not only of Bush but of his 
rivals John McCain and Elizabeth Dole. On Thursday, he defended 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with the separation of a person's private life from  
their public duties,'' said the mayor, who has faced public 
questions about his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm interested in is what kind of job did he do as  
governor of Texas. I think he's done a great job as governor of 
Texas,'' said Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim DeMint, at the close of a week traveling his South  
Carolina district, said: ``I just hear, `Leave the guy alone.' I 
think he's setting a pretty good precedent about questions like 
this. If a credible person wants to come forward and challenge his 
integrity ..., he should answer it. But if it's just an abstract 
question, he's doing the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeMint, another freshman, added that the controversy will help  
Bush's image. ``He's not sensitive,'' DeMint said. ``He's still 
smiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield Nelson, a Republican national committeeman in Little  
Rock, Ark., said the only jitters within the party are coming from 
Bush's primary rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``His opponents would like for us to think that (some  
nervousness) is now taking place out there,'' Nelson said. 
``They're grasping for straws.''

<HEADLINE> Bush's Principles Could Hurt Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush is digging in to a position  
that may be costly to defend as he dismisses and denounces the 
question of whether he ever used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	He's gone so far as to issue a denial covering the past 25  
years. But he insists he won't go beyond that to say never, because 
that would yield to destructive, rumor-driven politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody floats a rumor and it causes you to ask a question  
and that's the game in American politics and I refuse to play it,'' 
the governor snapped at a reporter in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he seemed to be playing a variation of it as he  
got more specific about time frames. 
</P>
<P>
	His stand has not dented his lead in polls on the Republican  
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's no denying the problem of the drug distraction,  
for a frontrunner who otherwise has almost everything running his 
way. It roiled a routine Austin news conference into an 
argumentative session that made national television. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in New Orleans, when the Dallas Morning News tied the  
question to the requirement that federal officials getting security 
clearances tell whether they've used illegal drugs within seven 
years, Bush said he has not. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, in Roanoke, Va., he upped the no-drugs time frame  
to 25 years, saying he met the stringent White House standard of no 
drugs within 15 years from the time his father became president in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	His set response covered those years anyhow. ``I made some  
mistakes years ago, but I learned from my mistakes,'' Bush says. 
</P>
<P>
	The nagging, repetitive questions may be unfair, but they're  
there. They stem, as Bush said, from rumors. No one has openly 
accused him of using cocaine. Reporters trying to find any grounds 
for the rumors have come up empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of a denial is not an admission, although Bush says  
he knows that some people are going to draw conclusions based on 
his silence. Still, the Texas governor sometimes seems to be 
answering without answering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want to send signals to anybody that what Gov. Bush  
did 30 years is ago is cool to try,'' he said in a New Hampshire 
television interview earlier this year. He's said that when he was 
young and irresponsible, he behaved that way. 
</P>
<P>
	He insists it is a matter of principle to refuse to deal with  
rumors about his personal life long ago. ``It's time for some 
politician to stand up and say, 'enough of this,''' he says. Bush 
said he thinks the voters will agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has dealt with personal matters, saying during the White  
House sex scandal that he had never been unfaithful to his wife, 
and that he once drank too much but quit alcohol on his 40th 
birthday, 13 years ago. Indeed, when there was adultery gossip 
about his father in the 1988 presidential campaign, the younger 
Bush answered it with a firm no. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush encountered the drug question in his first campaign for  
governor of Texas in 1994, and replied then much as he does now. 
The replay has been dogging him since he emerged as the leader for 
the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democrat's complaint that Bush wasn't being held to the same  
standard that is applied to other political figures and the White 
House led the New York Daily News to ask all the candidates for 
president in 2000 whether they had ever used cocaine. All except 
Bush said no; he stuck to his standard response. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his Democratic challenger, Bill  
Bradley, both have acknowledged using marijuana in the early 1970s. 
All the Republican candidates but Bush say they never used illegal 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to be able to say with no hesitation that no, we have  
not broken the drug laws of the United States,'' said conservative 
Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Couple Helps Catch Escaped Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENDENHALL, Pa. (AP) -- Rick Mercurio likes to joke around, so  
fiancee Ellen Baldo didn't believe him when he said an escaped 
killer was lurking near their house. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't joking. Before long, their morning turned into  
something resembling a crime thriller, with frightening noises from 
their back deck, a scramble to snatch up a gun and cellular phones, 
a dash to safety in their barn and flashlight signals to police 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for convicted murderer Norman Johnston ended early  
Friday in the couple's front yard. 
</P>
<P>
	A wet, scratched and exhausted Johnston, who killed four  
teen-agers to cover up a family burglary ring, was captured not far 
from where he and his brothers committed their crimes two decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was sentenced to life in prison in 1980 along with  
older brothers Bruce Sr. and David. The men feared the teens would 
tell police about their activities. The 1978 slayings were 
portrayed in the film ``At Close Range'' starring Sean Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 48, had been on the run since Aug. 2, when he escaped  
from a maximum-security prison in Huntington, 130 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic capture began after Mercurio, who is in the  
wholesale produce business, left for work about 4 a.m. Friday. He 
came back a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Baldo described what happened next: ``He headed downstairs  
to open up the safe and he was getting his gun out of the safe, at 
the same time saying to me, `The house is surrounded. The property 
is surrounded by police. Norman Johnston is in the woods.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't believe him at first,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The two knew the hunt for Johnston had heated up after he  
crashed a car late Thursday less than two miles from their house. 
</P>
<P>
	All through the night, Ms. Baldo said, ``it was choppers and  
police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercurio got his gun -- and then the noises started.  
</P>
<P>
	It was ``like somebody was underneath the back deck knocking  
something over, or walking into something,'' Ms. Baldo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grabbing the gun, flashlights and two cellular phones, the two  
hurried to their barn and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing that there were choppers in the valley, he said to the  
operator on 911, `I'll signal you with the flashlight so that you 
can get closer to the house ... we'll stay in the barn, so if you 
pick up anything in or around the house it's probably him,''' Ms. 
Baldo said. 
</P>
<P>
	After spotting the flashlight signal, police soon located the  
house and fanned out to search under the deck. The couple then 
spotted Johnston as he emerged from some trees in front of the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's Norman,'' Mercurio yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnston turned and ran, crashed into a board fence in the  
bushes, and police grabbed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was kind of surprised to see us,'' said Trooper  
Brian Barber. ``He was tired. He knew it was daylight. He knew he 
didn't have any place left to run.''

<HEADLINE> NJ Little League Team Goes for Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Just getting to the Little League World  
Series is difficult enough. But the team from Toms River, N.J. is 
trying to defend its title. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey team becomes the third team in 52 years to return  
to the series for 11- and 12-year-olds. Lock Haven, Pa., won in 
1948 and came back in 1949, and Long Beach, Calif., won in 1991 
when a team from the Philippines was disqualified, and then won the 
championship outright the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think most people realize how amazing it is,'' said  
Red Gaynor, grandfather of Toms River pitcher Casey Gaynor and 
father of manager Mike Gaynor. ``You have better odds at winning 
Powerball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Gaynor becomes the first person to manage three teams at  
the series, each of them during the last five years. His son, 
Casey, threw a no-hitter during the regional playoffs, and Eric 
Campesi hit a home run in Thursday's regional final 3-0 win over 
Middleboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting Casey and Eric made a huge difference. They expect to  
win,'' second baseman Mike Casale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both played as 11-year-olds with last year's champions -- only  
the seventh U.S. team to win the series during the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Toms River plays Phenix City, Ala., at 6 p.m. Sunday in an  
opening round. Phenix City manager Tony Rasmus said his ``scrawny 
bunch'' exceeded most expectations -- he would have been happy 
enough being on national television for the southern final, a 3-2 
win over Kernersville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Colby, will pitch against Toms River.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Brownsburg, Ind., plays Phenix City and Toms River  
plays Boise, Idaho -- only the fourth team from outside California 
to represent the western United States since Gerald Ford's 
administration. Boise's Dane McCrady, also a manager's son, threw a 
two-hitter in a 3-1 regional championship win over Sacramento, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan, whose teams have won the series 17 times in that span,  
is absent. Osaka, Japan, a U.S. team from Ramstein Air Force Base 
in Germany, Victoria, British Columbia and Yabucoa, Puerto Rico are 
also in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	One team each will emerge from the U.S. and international  
divisions for Thursday night's semifinals. Within a division, the 
teams all play each other, and the team with the best record before 
Thursday advances. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship is set for 4:30 p.m. EDT Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Papis Gets CART Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Winning the pole for the inaugural Target  
Grand Prix brought a feeling of contentment that Max Papis has 
missed in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was driving for Ferrari, I got kind of used to being on  
the pole,'' Papis said after topping Saturday's qualifying on the 
1-mile oval at the new Chicago Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really missed the feeling. It's a personal satisfaction. The  
race tomorrow is what is important, but winning the pole position 
means today I'm the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pole was the first in 54 CART FedEx Series races for the  
29-year-old Italian driver. It was also his first since 1996, when 
Papis was running in World Sports Cars for Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
	Papis, who moved up the grid when he took over the Team Rahal  
seat left vacant when team owner Bobby Rahal retired from the 
cockpit after last season, turned a lap of 162.559 mph. That was 
just enough to relegate Mark Blundell's 162.381 to the outside of 
the front row for Sunday's 225-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
	Papis, who nearly got his first victory last month at Michigan  
Speedway before running out of fuel while leading the race on the 
last lap, said a combination of things have brought him toward the 
top of the pack in the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed,'' he said. ``I'm always the same. You  
have it in your heart or you don't. It's the team around you that 
brings out the best in you. They motivate me and I motivate them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On ovals, CART's qualifying procedure sends the drivers onto the  
track one at a time, in order from slowest to fastest in the 
combined practices leading up to time trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell, something of a surprise after showing little speed in  
practice, had been at the top of the speed chart for quite a while 
before Papis, the fastest in practice, drove his Reynard-Ford onto 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a tinge of disappointment that we didn't get the pole,''  
said Blundell, whose lap time was just 0.025-seconds slower than 
that of Papis. ``It would have been my first CART pole, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former series champion Jimmy Vasser was third at 162.331,  
followed by series points leader Dario Franchitti at 162.296, Helio 
Castro-Neves at 162.246 and Patrick Carpentier at 161.884. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Montoya, Vasser's teammate and trailing Franchitti by just  
one point in the season standings, was 10th at 160.357. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good car, but not a qualifying car,'' said Montoya,  
a rookie who leads the series with five victories this season. 
``I'm still excited about the race. The track has improved quite a 
bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andretti, third in the standings and 28 points behind,  
was even farther back in 18th after qualifying at just 156.906. 
</P>
<P>
	A big question heading into Sunday's race is whether the new  
track will lend itself to passing. So far, with limited rubber laid 
down on the track, most of the passing has occurred under braking 
in turns 1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fresh track, a little like a golf course,'' Blundell  
said. ``It needs to mature. It has to have people go around it and 
build up rubber. And with the hard braking on this track, it's 
going to be hard to keep brakes under you for 225 laps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what kind of a race he expects it to be, Papis said,  
``It's going to be flat out. It's a short oval.''

<HEADLINE> Family Misidentifies Girl's Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HINSDALE, Ill. (AP) -- A girl whose body was recovered from Lake  
Michigan was misidentified as her older sister by relatives 
distraught over the loss of the girls and their father on a family 
sailing trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Bull, 39, and his two daughters, Madeleine and Alexandra,  
were reported missing Monday after they failed to return from an 
overnight trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Two bodies recovered Wednesday were identified by family members  
from photographs as Bull and 7-year-old Madeleine. Family friend 
Amy Falk said the body was actually that of Madeleine's 5-year-old 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistake was discovered Friday during funeral arrangements.  
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard officials have called off their search for the other  
girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-foot sailboat was found in good condition Tuesday about  
27 miles from shore, and authorities said the only thing out of the 
ordinary was that the swim ladder was down in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were found a few hundred yards apart, without life  
jackets, 20 miles southwest of the boat. Authorities said the 
victims had drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to speculate, but it is likely that someone ... fell  
overboard, and then they jumped in after,'' Coast Guard Lt. Chris 
Button said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bull was chairman of Bradner Central Co., a family-owned firm  
that distributes business forms and other paper products. He and 
his wife, Pam, also have an infant son.

<HEADLINE> Release of Supremacist Worries Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Members of this city's Jewish community are  
concerned over the release of a white supremacist convicted as a 
teen-ager in 1989 for conspiring to bomb ethnic groups, a rabbi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of last week's shooting by a white supremacist at a  
Los Angeles Jewish Community Center, ``the level of angst is very 
high,'' said Rabbi Robert Kravitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael A. Bloom, 26, was released from a state prison in Yuma  
on Thursday and returned to Phoenix, where he will remain under 
house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom has said he renounced his past beliefs.  
</P>
<P>
	In a July interview with Jewish News of Greater Phoenix, Bloom  
said he wanted to apologize to the Jewish community and ask for 
forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to work with the Jewish community and anybody  
else who wants to be involved in trying to prevent other children 
from making the same bad decisions that I made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom served a four-year sentence after his 1989 conviction on  
charges of misconduct with a weapon and conspiracy to commit arson 
on an occupied structure. Police had found pipe-bomb materials, a 
sawed-off shotgun, piles of anti-Jewish and anti-black propaganda 
and map identifying 30 potential targets, including a Jewish 
bookstore in Scottsdale and the Anti-Defamation League office in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released in 1993 but sent back within months, after  
police found he was hiding several guns and ammunition in his 
apartment, along with more neo-Nazi propaganda. He was convicted of 
a parole violation and sentenced to an 11-year term, which expires 
in October 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Under house arrest, Bloom will only be able to go to work,  
church or rehabilitation programs. He could qualify for a complete 
release by July 2001.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Rockers Fire Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Rockers fired head coach Linda  
Hill-MacDonald on Saturday following the team's 66-56 victory over 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also announced that assistant coach Susan Yow was also  
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to thank Linda and Susan for their contributions to  
this organization,'' Rockers' general manager Wayne Embry said in a 
news release. ``At this time, we feel it is in the best interest of 
the organization to move forward in a new direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockers finished their season by snapping an eight-game  
losing streak with a victory over the Eastern Conference champion 
Liberty. The Rockers were 7-25 and failed to make the playoffs this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill-MacDonald coached the Rockers since the WNBA's inception in  
1997. She had an overall record of 42-48, including last season's 
20-10 record and an Eastern Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill-MacDonald could not be reached for comment Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rockers said they will begin their search for a new coach  
immediately.

<HEADLINE> Diana Photographers Not Off Hook Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- They were after the million-dollar photo: a snap of  
Princess Diana and her beau. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the chase that ended horribly in a Paris traffic tunnel  
brought down the law and public anger on nine of the paparazzi who 
pursued the couple that fateful night two summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhaustive investigation into the Aug. 31, 1997, crash that  
killed Diana; her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed; and driver, Henri Paul, 
could soon be over. The legal limbo for the photographers could 
last far longer. 
</P>
<P>
	France's state prosecutor recommended last week that charges of  
manslaughter and failing to assist persons in danger be dismissed 
against the photographers and a press motorcyclist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosecutor's office finally saw that the photographers  
were not the cause of the accident, which was merely the result of 
a drunken driver with no appropriate license,'' said Christian 
Curtil, lawyer for bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, the crash's only 
survivor. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's too early for the photographers and the motorcyclist to  
cheer. The investigating judge, Herve Stephan, has the final call 
on whether any of them should be sent to trial. And civil parties 
to the case could appeal any dismissal of charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephan, who takes up a new job in the French judiciary Sept. 1,  
is expected to conclude his probe soon, but is not obliged to 
follow the prosecutor's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although manslaughter charges are considered unlikely, several  
of the photographers, particularly those who approached the 
princess as she lay dying, possibly could face trial on the charge 
of failing to assist persons in danger. That crime carries a 
maximum jail term of five years and a fine of 500,000 francs, about 
$83,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Stephan clears the photographers, appeals by relatives  
and other parties could drag the case on for months -- if not years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the decision, it's open to appeal,'' said Virginie  
Bardet, a lawyer for two of the photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	High on the list of people who might appeal is Mohamed Al Fayed,  
father of Dodi Fayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Fayed, owner of London's Harrods department store and the  
Ritz Hotel where Diana and Dodi dined shortly before the crash, 
initially insisted the paparazzi's pursuit of his son and the 
princess was to blame for their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, he has argued the crash was a murder conspiracy plotted  
by people who did not approve of Diana's relationship with Dodi, an 
Egyptian, and has spend a lot of money trying to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephan turned down a request by Al Fayed to have three British  
diplomats posted in Paris interrogated in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	An American judge rejected his demand for access to classified  
U.S. intelligence documents, but the Defense Department has since 
agreed to take a second look at documents containing references to 
Diana. Officials say they don't expect to find any incriminating 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Rees-Jones, the bodyguard and a former Al Fayed employee, also  
might want to appeal. He has filed a suit against the Ritz and the 
limousine company that supplied the Mercedes for Dodi and Diana, 
charging they endangered lives by allowing a drunk and unqualified 
driver act as chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the driver could appeal as well. Paul's parents,  
who live in the western French province of Brittany, have had a 
hard time coming to terms with the death of their son and his 
apparent role in the crash. They maintain the blood tests that 
indicated Paul was drunk were not accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana has long faded from French news media, which laconically  
reported the prosecutor's decision last week. ``Just an Accident,'' 
the daily Le Monde said. 
</P>
<P>
	But people from around the world still leave flowers and notes  
at the Place de l'Alma, next to the tunnel where she died. It is 
one of the city's most frequently visited sites.

<HEADLINE> Perrot Service To Be Held Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A memorial service will be held Monday for  
Houston Comets point guard Kim Perrot, who died Thursday after a 
long battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas A&AMP;M women's basketball coach Peggie Gillom was among those  
in the room when the 32-year-old Perrot died at a Houston hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillom was an assistant coach with the WNBA's Comets before  
taking the job at Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillom told KPRC-TV on Friday that she had gone to be with  
Perrot during her alternative treatment in Tijuana, Mexico. They 
returned together last weekend to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was fighting it to the end,'' Gillom said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gillom said Perrot touched so many lives, but she prefers that  
her friend be remembered for her on-the-court talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see Kim in the bed suffering. I don't see Kim and her  
last breath. I see Kim Perrot on that floor, telling the Houston 
Comets what to do and schooling the rest of her opponents and being 
a pest,'' Gillom said. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service has been scheduled for 11 a.m. Monday at  
Second Baptist Church.

<HEADLINE> United 3, Fusion 2, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- In a game that featured a league-record  
four red cards, D.C. United goalkeeper Mark Simpson stopped four 
shots and a penalty shot in the shootout period in a 3-2 victory 
Saturday night over the Miami Fusion. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. United improved its road record to a league-best 10-3 and  
its Eastern Conference mark to 14-1. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C.'s Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno converted their kicks  
in the shootout, while Miami's Henry Guiterrez, Welton, Tony Kuhn 
and Tyrone Marshall missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson hit Kuhn as he was moving past him, so Kuhn was awarded  
a penalty kick, which Simpson stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Lassiter opened the scoring with 29:10 left when he took a  
pass from Ben Olsen and knocked the ball past Fusion goalkeeper 
Garth Lagerway. It was the fourth goal for Lassiter in three games 
this year against the Fusion. 
</P>
<P>
	A minute later, Lassiter, who moved into a tie as the top scorer  
in the league with his goal, was ejected for extreme force. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lassiter out, the teams were at even strength for the first  
time since Miami's Leo Cullen got the game's first red card after 
just seven minutes of play. 
</P>
<P>
	Cullen was the first of three Fusion players to be ejected, also  
an MLS record. 
</P>
<P>
	With 25:25 to play, Miami's Jay Heaps was red-carded for  
clipping Jeff Agoos' foot on a tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over a minute later, Marshall beat Simpson in the lower  
right corner from 30 yards out to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 21:24 mark, Welton came down the right side, cut inside  
of defender Eddie Pope and beat Simpson to put the Fusion up, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope tied the contest with 4:42 remaining when he took a pass  
from Etcheverry and scored from point blank range. 
</P>
<P>
	The game's other red card occurred when Cullen was ejected.  
Nelson Vargas, who was being replaced in the Miami lineup, voiced 
his disagreement with the call to referee Rich Grady and was also 
given a red card. Since Vargas already left the contest, the Fusion 
did not have to play two men down.

<HEADLINE> Astros Win 'Ugly' Game Over Marlins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The pitching staff's totals for the 16-inning game  
-- 21 strikeouts, 17 walks, 299 pitches -- looked like something from 
a high school team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Marlins have been called worse.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida had the Houston Astros swinging and missing as if Kerry  
Wood was on the mound, but the Marlins still managed to lose 6-4 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros stranded 20 runners in the ugly marathon. They didn't  
manage a hit in extra innings until the 16th, when Ken Caminiti's 
second homer of the night broke a 4-4 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nutsy game,'' Caminiti said. ``But it's a win, and we  
love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Marlins, their 72nd loss of the season stood out from  
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This seems like the toughest one for me,'' manager John Boles  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida stranded 21 runners and lost despite out-hitting Houston  
15-7. The Astros had more homers (three) than singles (two). 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference is they know how to win these kind of games,  
and we're learning,'' Marlins catcher Mike Redmond said. 
</P>
<P>
	The game took 5 hours, 44 minutes, the longest by time in  
Marlins' history. It matched Arizona's 7-6 win over Los Angeles on 
April 13 as the longest by innings in the major leagues this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida starter Ryan Dempster set the tone for the wild night  
with eight strikeouts and seven walks in 3 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ridiculous,'' he said. ``Walks are a pain in the butt.''  
</P>
<P>
	The 17 bases on balls issued by Dempster and six successors were  
a Marlins record, and also a record for Houston hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell went 0-for-2 and walked six times, tying a  
major-league record first achieved by Jimmie Foxx of Boston in 
1938. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not really the record I'm looking for,'' Bagwell said. ``It  
was a crazy game. But it's nice to play 16 when you win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros' strikeout total broke the team record of 20 set  
against Wood last year. It was a record for Marlins pitching, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's seven pitchers included Billy Wagner, who earned his  
31st save. Manager Larry Dierker considered using starter Mike 
Hampton as a pinch hitter, but the left-hander left during the game 
when his wife went into labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti hit a third-inning homer, his first in nearly four  
months. Then, 13 innings later, he hit another one. He returned 
from the disabled list Monday after missing 79 games with a calf 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone was going up there trying to end it with one  
swing,'' Caminiti said. ``I was really tired as the game went on. 
But it was the first game where I really had a good time and 
enjoyed myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Craig Biggio didn't have quite so much fun. He went  
1-for-8 with four strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is I'm just glad we won,'' Biggio said. ``I was  
thinking, `This could be a really bad day.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For Florida, it was. The Marlins rallied from a 4-0 deficit,  
then were shut out over the final seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	With their bench depleted, pitcher Alex Fernandez pinch-hit with  
the bases loaded in the 11th. He flied out to the warning track to 
end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours later, Dempster stood in the losing clubhouse and  
looked at the clock. It said 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one's over,'' he said. ``It's a new day already.''

<HEADLINE> Jones Sets Record in Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Now, Marion Jones has another contender to  
deal with -- her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	As Jones, the defending champion in the women's 100 meters, was  
smashing the World Championships record during a quarterfinal heat 
Saturday, C.J. Hunter won his first major international title in 
the shot put with a career-best 71 feet, 6 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, American Stacy Dragila, winner of the first world  
indoor women's pole vault title in 1997, completed a historic 
double, winning the first outdoor world title and equaling the 
world record of 15-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The usually passive 300-pound Hunter couldn't contain his  
emotions after the surprising throw on his final attempt ended John 
Godina's string of two consecutive world titles. He swung his arms 
in windmill fashion and smiled broadly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than the birth of my kids and marriage to Marion, this  
is the best thing in my life,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	After his winning throw, Hunter made eye contact with Jones, who  
was sitting in the front row of the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew as soon as I let it go ...'' Hunter said of the feeling  
on his final toss. ``I didn't want to hold back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said he and Jones wouldn't celebrate until Oct. 3, their  
first wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we'll shake hands, I'll give her a kiss and that will  
be it,'' he said. ``It's not about bragging rights. It's a family 
thing. She just said she was proud of me and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first step in fulfilling a big goal. The big  
picture is to do the triple -- this year, next year (Olympics) and 
the year after (worlds).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The frustrated Godina fouled on five of his six attempts and  
finished seventh at 66-9 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say what went wrong,'' Godina said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before Hunter began his celebration, the stage was set for some  
sizzling sprint times over the lightning-fast Olympic Stadium 
track, with Jones and Maurice Greene sending out strong messages 
with sparkling times in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, seeking an unprecedented four golds, won her heat in  
10.76 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, aiming for a rare sprint double and three golds, ran  
9.91, the sixth fastest time in the world this year 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' time shattered the previous championship record of 10.82  
by Gail Devers in 1993 at Stuttgart, Germany. She also bettered her 
season's leading previous best of 10.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four women in history have run faster, including Jones, who  
clocked 10.65 last year. The late Florence Griffith Joyner holds 
the world record of 10.49. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 semifinals and finals are Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The track is fast, fast, fast,'' Jones said. ``Watch for some  
world records. I'm not saying it's going to be me. Watch those men. 
...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was cautious out of the blocks because of one false start  
and fell behind early. Once she accelerated, she overwhelmed the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that first start was on the money,'' she said. ``I  
wasn't about to false start twice (and get disqualified). 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the (stadium) monitor and what those people were  
running. I knew if they were running those times, I could run fast 
as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other quarterfinal heat winners included Inger Miller, in a  
personal best 10.86, her first sub-11 since 1996; Greece's 
Ekaterini Thanos, also in 10.86, a national record; and Devers and 
France's Christine Arron, each in 11.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, seeking gold medals in the 100, 200, long jump and a  
relay, also advanced to Monday's final in the long jump, leaping 
22-4 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the most confident I've been all year (in the long jump)  
...'' Jones said. ``My rhythm is a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best long jump qualifier was Italy's Fiona May, the 1995  
world champion, at 23-1 1/4, the second best jump in the world this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 100, Greene ran his seventh sub-10 race of the year  
and appeared ready to threaten his world record of 9.79. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very fast final,'' Greene said.  
``Everybody's predicting I'll break (the record). We'll have to 
wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene beat one of his top rivals, Canada's Bruny Surin, who  
clocked 9.95. 
</P>
<P>
	``My coach (John Smith) told me, `Show 'em a little, but don't  
show 'em all of it,''' said Greene, who also is competing in the 
200 and 400 relay. ``I believe I did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila, a former rodeo performer, volleyball player and  
heptathlete, matched the pole vault record held by Australia's Emma 
George. Dragila then missed three times at 15-3, not coming close 
on any attempt 
</P>
<P>
	She outdueled Ukraine's Anzhela Balakhonova, who led all the way  
until missing at the record-equaling height. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here with a plan,'' Dragila said. ``I wanted to jump  
high and I wanted to be on the podium. I didn't worry about what 
the other competitors would do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to show everyone the beach vault wasn't just running  
downhill,'' she said, referring to the 15-0 3/4 in a beach vault 
competition over a wood runway in Santa Barbara, Calif., in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Ilya Markov, the European champion, won the 20K walk in  
1:23:24, beating Olympic champion Jefferson Perez of Ecuador by 45 
seconds. Defending champion Daniel Garcia of Mexico was third. 
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco won his  
opening 1,500 heat in 3:35.63, beating 1992 Olympic champion Fermin 
Cacho of Spain (3:36.43). Kenyan sensation Noah Ngeny, who pushed 
El Guerrouj to the world record in the mile this year, won his heat 
in 3:37.41. Noureddine Morceli, the three-time world champion and 
Olympic champion, qualified in 3:37.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic champion Charles Austin qualified for the men's high  
jump final, clearing 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenyan world record-holder Bernard Barmasai won his heat in the  
3,000 steeplechase in 8:16.50. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Eunice Barber recorded personal bests of 12.89 in the  
100 hurdles and 6-3 in the high jump to take a one-point lead over 
Britain's Denise Lewis, 3,994-3,993, after the first four events of 
the heptathlon. The final three events are Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In men's hammer throw qualifying, the 1-2 finishers at the 1996  
Olympics, Balazs Kiss of Hungary and Lance Deal of the United 
States, failed to reach Sunday's final. Karsten Kobs of Germany had 
the longest qualifying throw, 258-10.

<HEADLINE> 2 Pirates Put on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates put two of their five  
starting pitchers, Todd Ritchie and Pete Schourek, on the disabled 
list Saturday and activated left-handers Jason Christiansen and 
Chris Peters. 
</P>
<P>
	Schourek, a $4 million free agent pickup who has disappointed  
the Pirates with a 3-7 record and 5.68 ERA, has inflammation in his 
left shoulder. He will be replaced in the rotation by rookie Jimmy 
Anderson, who started Saturday night against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have had 19 players on the disabled list this  
season, or only six players fewer than an entire 25-man roster. 
They currently have nine on the list, including catcher Jason 
Kendall, starting shortstop Pat Meares, former closer Rich Loiselle 
and Ritchie, their top winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie's injury -- tendinitis in his rotator cuff -- is a major  
blow to the Pirates, who are contending for their first winning 
season since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie (12-8) leads the Pirates in victories despite never  
starting in the majors before this season. He took advantage of 
Peters' early-season arm problems to win a spot in the rotation and 
has been Pittsburgh's most consistent starter, pitching into the 
seventh inning in nine of his last 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie reported pain in his pitching shoulder while beating the  
Diamondbacks 5-4 Friday night, yielding five runs -- two after he 
left the game -- and four hits in 6 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie had retired 14 batters in a row until leaving after  
Erubiel Durazo's single and Steve Finley's double in the seventh 
inning. The shoulder began bothering him several starts ago, but he 
pitched through the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been building up, and I may need a little rest,'' said  
Ritchie, a non-roster player in spring training who did not make 
the opening day roster. ``It might be that my muscles are not used 
to throwing so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury may keep Ritchie, 27, from winning 15 or 16 games in  
his first season as a major league starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to shut it down for a while and try to get it  
right,'' he said. ``When you look at the big picture, you have to 
be cautious so I can keep on pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peters was 8-10 with a 3.97 ERA in 1998 and was in the rotation  
until developing inflammation in his left shoulder. He was 1-1 with 
a 6.88 ERA in 12 games before going on the disabled list in early 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters spent time at Triple-A Nashville on a rehabilitation  
assignment, stopped pitching for a while when he reported 
discomfort, then resumed the rehabilitation assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last appearance at Nashville, he beat Omaha 4-1 on  
Thursday, allowing one run on three hits despite walking five in 
seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters will start Wednesday against Colorado.  
</P>
<P>
	Christiansen (2-3, 4.46 ERA) had a 10.38 ERA in his final 12  
games before going on the disabled list July 31 with lower back 
inflammation. With Christiansen out, Scott Sauerbeck was the 
Pirates' only left-handed reliever.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Going After Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A video featuring graphic footage of the  
bombings last year of two U.S. embassies in Africa are being 
released by the State Department in an effort ``to bring to 
justice'' the terrorists responsible for the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an instant, 224 innocent people died, murdered by  
terrorists,'' a voice says as the video begins. ``Here are the 
victims of these evil crimes: Mother, wife, daughter, father, 
husband, son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-second public service announcement features pictures of  
bloodied or burned bombing victims trying to escape from the 
rubble. One scene shows a person falling from the ledge of a 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	The video also features wanted posters of several alleged  
criminals, including Osama bin Laden, the charged mastermind of the 
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Among those killed were 12 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said it hopes the video, which was released  
in English, Arabic, French and Spanish, will ``bring to justice 
those responsible for the terrorist bombings of our embassies in 
East Africa, as well as to prevent future acts of terrorism 
worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department released the tapes earlier this month. It  
sent copies to every U.S. embassy, more than 250, with hope that 
officials there would work with host governments and local media to 
broadcast them. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of dollars in reward money already has been awarded for  
information leading to any arrests, according to the video. It 
encourages individuals with such knowledge to ``take a stand, 
protect the innocent,'' and contact U.S. officials.

<HEADLINE> Dragila Wins Women's Pole Vault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Winning gold medals by matching world  
records in historic firsts is becoming a habit for Stacy Dragila. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila, a 28-year-old former rodeo competitor, won the first  
gold medal to be awarded in the women's pole vault at an outdoor 
world championship on Saturday and in the process equaled the world 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The American cleared 15 feet, 1 inch to beat Anzhela Balakhonova  
of Ukraine, who took the silver medal at 14-11, a European record 
in the event that was contested for the first time in a world 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila trailed the Ukrainian all the way until she scaled 15-1  
on her second attempt. That matched the world record set by 
Australia's Emma George on Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted that mark and I was hungry for some more marks but I  
am glad I came ahead and won the gold,'' Dragila said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila made three attempts to extend the record to 15-3, but  
missed them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatiana Grigorieva, a Russian-born vaulter now competing for  
Australia, won the bronze at 14-7 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila, a former heptathlete and volleyball player, completed  
an historic double. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the 1997 world indoor title by equaling the then-world  
record of 14-5 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really haven't thought about it like that. I came here with  
a plan, I wanted to jump high and I wanted to be on the podium,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila had cleared 15 feet earlier this year, but on a wooden  
runaway that is not recognized by the international athletics body. 
</P>
<P>
	She had a stress fracture in her foot last year and underwent  
surgery in September, coming back in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I am a good healer or the injury wasn't as bad as we  
thought,'' she said. ``I'm just glad I'm back in full force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila now has to see whether she will get the full $60,000 for  
the gold medal normally awarded to world championship winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Because women's pole vault is a new event, she may end up  
getting only $30,000, although IAAF officials will later rule if 
she is eligible for the full award. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of unfortunate.'' Dragila said. ``I think we've been  
established since 1997. I think we deserve it. At the Olympics next 
year I hope we don't get half a medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's pole vault competition provided a thrilling end to  
the first day of the championship and lasted more than four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Balakhonova cleared all her jumps on the first attempt up to  
14-11. But she failed two times at 15-1 and once at 15-3 and 
settled for the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	George, the Commonwealth champion coming off a recent back  
injury in a training accident, failed to clear 14-3 1/4 after 
struggling throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian has set 17 world records outdoors and indoors.

<HEADLINE> Hawaiian Luau Canceled at Dartmouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- A Hawaiian luau at Dartmouth College was  
canceled after students complained it was culturally insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The party, sponsored by the Alpha Chi Alpha fraternity and the  
Delta Delta Delta sorority, was to be held last weekend. It was 
canceled after a student sent an e-mail message to everyone on 
campus describing it as an act of ``bigotry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another student Aaron Akamu, a native of Hawaii, criticized the  
luau in the student newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``That people feel a right to capitalize on some stereotype of  
where I am from and the people I feel a cultural responsibility to 
in the name of fun, angers and hurts me,'' Akamu wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hawaii, a luau is a large feast with a religious theme. But  
with the growth of tourism on the islands, the luau has come to 
resemble more of a beach party. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a year that a party with an ethnic  
theme has caused an uproar on the Ivy League campus. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, more than 400 Dartmouth students staged a peaceful  
protest against a fraternity-sorority sponsored ``ghetto'' party in 
which students were encouraged to dress as inner-city black people.

<HEADLINE> Fittipaldi Hopes To Race Texaco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Christian Fittipaldi, knocked unconscious in  
a crash during testing at Gateway International Raceway earlier 
this month, hopes to resume racing Sept. 26 at the Texaco Grand 
Prix of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	If not, the 28-year-old driver will wait three more weeks for  
the Hondo Indy 300 in Queensland, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can't drive the car, I'll just sit on the beach and enjoy  
myself,'' Fittipaldi said Saturday, showing a sense of humor as he 
attended the Target Grand Prix at Chicago Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittipaldi hit a wall during his practice run in Madison, Ill.,  
and was unconscious for between five and 10 minutes. Tests show 
that the nephew of longtime racing star Emerson Fittipaldi has a 
subdural hematoma -- a collection of blood -- on the left side of his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having very little headaches, almost nothing,'' said  
Fittipaldi, who will have to be cleared by doctors before he can 
get back on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just watching some races and getting revved up to come  
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *--------	 
</P>
<P>
	BAD TIMING: This isn't the way Tony Bettenhausen dreamed of  
racing in his own backyard. Born and reared in nearby Tinley Park, 
CART team owner Bettenhausen had long noted the absence of a major 
motor speedway in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's past due that this part of the country had a  
speedway,'' Bettenhausen said Saturday before qualifying began for 
Sunday's 225-mile Target Grand Prix. But if only the track had been 
ready a year ago, when Bettenhausen had a team that at least could 
compete with CART's best cars and drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Or if only the track had not opened until next year, when he  
hopes he can get back on the developmental track that gave his team 
six podium finishes over an eight-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the loss of his sponsor has forced him to run a raw  
rookie, Shigeaki Hattori, who has brought sponsorship money but, so 
far, not a single championship point, to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a real steep learning curve for Hattori,''  
Bettenhausen said. ``We haven't been able to go testing, and that's 
a tough deal. (Rookie Cristiano) da Matta had 3,000 miles of 
testing before he ever ran a race for Arciero-Wells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettenhausen has run rookie drivers before, including Helio  
Castro-Neves, who had a pole and a second-place finish last year. 
But Bettenhausen felt obligated to release the young Brazilian from 
the final two years of his contract when his sponsorship fell 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the resources we had last year and with Helio we'd have  
won races this year,'' Bettenhausen said. ``We've been running 
year-old Reynards all season, and it's hard to be competitive that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettenhausen is trying hard to get a new major sponsor, but  
failure breeds failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard when you're in the back of the pack,'' he said.  
``What do you tell them when they ask how you're doing this 
year?'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BIG MOUTH: Max Papis might have learned a lesson all race  
drivers should heed. When you've got a secret, keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked after Friday's practice how he liked the new one-mile  
oval, Papis, who was the second fastest driver Friday and quickest 
in Saturday morning's practice, responded: ``I love that there are 
no curbs out there, only the white line. If someone is in front of 
you suddenly, you have a place to go below the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore. CART officials fired off a bulletin Saturday  
morning to the effect that any driver who gets his right side tires 
on or over the white line will be penalized. In qualifying, no time 
would be given for a lap in which the driver was in violation. 
During the race a black flag drive-through penalty will be 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	ALMOST THERE: Mark Blundell still has not fully recovered from  
the broken collarbone he suffered in a testing crash in May, but 
thinks Sunday's race on an oval track could be easier on him than 
his first two comeback events on road circuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's little easier because you can build up the head rests a  
little bit,'' Blundell said. ``But, on the other hand, there is 
constant G force and on this oval a lot of braking, so your head 
goes forward. I'm not up to 100 percent yet, but it won't be too 
much longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell spent several minutes Saturday morning talking with  
Formula One team owner Frank Williams, a guest this week of CART 
car owner Chip Ganassi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was Frank's first test driver,'' Blundell recalled. ``I was  
his test driver for two years before Damon (Hill) got the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is the current employer of Alex Zanardi, who won two  
PPG Cup points titles driving for Ganassi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganassi was the guest of Williams during a Formula One event  
earlier this year in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------

<P>
	 *PRECAUTIONARY TESTS: Boris Derichebourg, who hit the wall in  
turn 2 during Saturday morning's Indy Lights practice, was taken to 
Loyola Medical Center for precautionary x-rays and observaton. 
Derichebourg was diagnosed with a minor concussion by CART medical 
director Dr. Steve Olvey during a preliminary exam at the track. No 
driver is permitted to compete for at least seven days following an 
accident that results in a concussion or loss of consciousness. 
</P>
<P>

	FAN APPRECIATION:The final weekend of the 1999 CART series in  
Fontana, Calif., has been designated as fan appreciation weekend. 
The race, which could determine the PPG Cup points champion, will 
be run Oct. 31. The winner takes home $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	CART, the California Speedway and seven corporate partners  
joined forces for the fan appreciation events and a prize contest 
that includes an around-the-world trip to four continents to attend 
CART races next year.

<HEADLINE> July Was Hot, but Not a Record Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It wasn't a record month, but for the many  
folks who remember July as hot and dry -- you're right. 
</P>
<P>
	In 105 years of recordkeeping, it was the seventh driest July on  
record in the Central and Southeast states and the ninth driest in 
the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time it was the seventh warmest July in the  
Northeast and 10th warmest in the East North Central region of the 
country, the National Climatic Data Center reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That will come as no surprise to gardeners and farmers watching  
the crops and flowers wilt on the stem. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, residents of the East North Central States  
sloshed through their third wettest July on record. 
</P>
<P>
	A regional breakdown of rainfall and temperature for July:  
</P>
<P>
	--Northeastern states (New England, New York, Pennsylvania, New  
Jersey, Maryland and Delaware) averaged just 2.73 inches of rain 
for the month, well below the normal 3.81 inches. The record July 
low was 2.02 inches in 1968 and the record high was 6.57 inches in 
1897. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperature averaged 72.2 degrees. Normal is 69.3. The warmest  
July was 1958 at 73.8 degrees and the coldest 1962 at 66.1. 
</P>
<P>
	--East North Central states (Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and  
Michigan) averaged had 5.31 inches of rainfall in July, much more 
than the normal 3.61 inches. The dryness record is 0.85 inches in 
1936 and the wettest July was 1993 with 6.13 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperature averaged 72.8 degrees, topping the 70.2 normal. The  
hottest July was 1936 with 76.2 degrees and the coldest was 1992 at 
64.0 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	--Central states (Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky,  
Tennessee and West Virginia) had 2.54 inches of rain, well below 
the 4.25 inches of a normal year. The record low was 1.47 inches 
set in 1930 while the record for wetness was 8.27 inches in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	Average temperature of 78.4 topped the normal 75.3 degrees but  
failed to reach 1901's record 81.2. The coldest July on record was 
1947 at 71.9 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	--Southeastern states (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,  
Georgia, Alabama and Florida) had 4.03 inches of rain, compared 
with the normal 5.56 inches. The record low is a mere 2.94 inches 
in 1983 while the wettest year was 1916 with a hefty 11.55 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The average temperature of 80.1 degrees beat the normal average  
of 78.6. But 1993 still is the warmest July on record at 82.7 and 
1947 is the coldest at 76.3. 
</P>
<P>
	--West North Central states (Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota,  
South Dakota and Nebraska) averaged 1.75 inches of rain, below the 
normal total of 2.02. The record low is 1917 with 0.84 inches and 
1993 was the wettest at 5.56 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The average temperature of 69.7 degrees was just above the  
normal 69.5. The record high is 77.4 in 1936 and the low was 62.7 
set in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
	--Southern states (Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas  
and Mississippi) had 2.13 inches of rain, compared with 3.03 inches 
in a normal year. But the record low is 1.34 inches in 1980 and the 
wettest July was 1950 with 6.04 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	July was warmer than normal at 81.7 degrees, topping the usual  
81.3. The hottest July on record is 1980 at 85.9 and the coldest, 
1906 at 78.0. 
</P>
<P>
	--Southwestern states (Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico).  
</P>
<P>
	Monsoonal rains made it a wetter than normal July with 2.32  
inches, topping the typical 1.83 inches. The wettest July was 1911 
at 3.51 inches and the driest was 1911 with 1.00 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The average temperature of 73.2 was a bit cooler than the 73.6  
normal. The hottest July was 75.9 degrees in 1901 and the coldest 
70.1 in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	--Northwestern states (Washington, Oregon and Idaho) had a dry  
month with an average rainfall of just 0.41 inches, below the 
normal 0.73. That did not approach the low record of 0.16 set in 
July, 1953, though. The wettest July was 1983 with 2.05 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	July was colder than usual with an average temperature of 64.8  
degrees compared to the normal 65.9. The record for cold was set in 
1993 at 58.9 and the hottest July was 1906 at 70.6. 
</P>
<P>
	--Western states (California and Nevada) had 0.33 inches of rain,  
a bit less than the normal average of 0.34 in this region. The 
wettest July was 1984 with 1.18 inches of rain and 1903 has the 
record for the driest July with no rain whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature was a little cooler than usual at 73.6, compared  
to a normal 73.8. The record low is 69.0 in July 1903 and the 
hottest July was 1931 at 78.2. 
</P>
<P>
	The calculations do not include figures for Alaska and Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> Domenici Promotes GOP Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republicans' $792 billion package of tax  
cuts is the party's way of refunding money that citizens have 
overpaid, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the Republican chorus pushing the 10-year-plan, the New  
Mexico Republican said in the party's weekly radio address that 
``the government is taking more money from you than it needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A projected surplus over the next decade would leave $1.5  
trillion to give back to taxpayers, even after most of the money is 
reserved to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused President Clinton, who has threatened to veto the tax  
cuts, of wanting ``to keep all the money in Washington and give 
none back to overtaxed American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House says the bill's benefits are skewed toward  
wealthier people, would do little to protect Social Security and 
Medicare and could require deep cuts in critical spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a decade, the bill would reduce all income tax rates by one  
percentage point, cut capital gains taxes, improve retirement 
savings, ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by many two-income 
couples, gradually eliminate the alternative minimum tax, provide 
new breaks for education and health care and benefit large and 
small businesses.

<HEADLINE> Ayala Makes Comeback From Jail Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tony Ayala Jr. tried to keep his comeback win  
in perspective, even as hometown fans continued to chant his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen years in prison evidently taught him something.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, some years ago I made a terrible mistake,'' Ayala  
said. ``No fight will be able to replace that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Ayala didn't want the rape that sent him to prison for  
nearly half his life lost in the excitement of his third round 
knockout Friday night of Manuel Esparaza, the crowd of 10,676 that 
packed the Freeman Coliseum was in a more forgiving mood. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the fight, two middle-aged women carried a large banner  
around the ring that read ``Hispanic women for better justice 
support Torito.'' Other fans waved cards reading ``Torito, heeee's 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one night, at least, it seemed like he was, though it was  
against an opponent who would never have been considered for the 
fighter dubbed El Torito in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The passion was still there,'' Ayala said after knocking  
Esparaza down twice in the third round -- the first time with a 
vicious left hook to the ribs. ``I think things turned out real 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala's first rounds in the ring since he scored a third round  
knockout of Carlos Herrera on Nov. 20, 1982, earned him both the 
adulation of the hometown fans and a $200,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a stylistic fight, but for a boxer who hadn't fought  
in nearly 17 years, it wasn't a bad performance at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like the old days,'' Ayala said. ``My power felt good.  
My timing was a bit off and I'll have to work on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The win over the skinny 21-year-old Esparaza -- who qualified for  
the fight after being knocked out in the sixth round of his last 
fight -- was more notable in that it showed that Ayala hadn't lost 
the punch that made him such a ferocious fighter in his heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala was signed to fight Davey Moore for the junior  
middleweight championship when, on New Year's Day 1983, he entered 
a woman's residence and brutally raped her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've grown up and paid for my mistakes,'' said Ayala, released  
in April after serving 16 years of a 35-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala's father, Tony Ayala Sr., was in his son's corner just as  
he had been in his career as a teen-age sensation, and was happy 
with both the reception given his son and the outcome of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to grade him, I'd give him a B-plus,'' the father  
said. ``He's not going to box like he used to. He's going to be 
slipping and boxing more. He could have gone 12 rounds tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Ayala is fighting again, he's in a hurry to make up for  
lost time. 
</P>
<P>
	Another fight is in the works for September, and Ayala is  
already talking about returning to the level where he can fight for 
a middleweight or junior middleweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not 19 anymore and I can't go into a fight punching with a  
lack of abandon,'' Ayala said. ``But I hope that within a year I'll 
be better than anyone in the world.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged To Send Cash to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American officials have two words of advice  
for Americans eager to help earthquake victims in Turkey: Send 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	They do not want to repeat last fall's experience with Hurricane  
Mitch in Central America when many material items sent by Americans 
just got in the way or were inappropriate, such as winter coats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying hard to discourage people from sending things,''  
Harriet Babbitt, the No. 2 official at the U.S. Agency for 
International Development, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	AID is urging Americans to call 800-872-4373 (USAID-RELIEF)  
during normal business hours if they wish to make a cash donation 
through one of the more than two dozen private voluntary agencies 
involved in the relief effort. Donors can also call InterAction, an 
umbrella group for private voluntary organizations at 202-667-8227. 
</P>
<P>
	During natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch, ``piles of  
goods get in the way of legitimate goods coming in,'' said Bryna 
Brennan, head of public affairs at the Pan American Health 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad goods keep out good goods,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Turkish authorities are welcoming donations of certain kinds of  
material goods. A list of more than 100 items considered ``urgently 
required'' ranges from tents and body bags to jackhammers and 
surgical kits. The great majority of the items are medicines and 
medical equipment. The complete list is carried on InterAction's 
Web site: www.interaction.org. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals or institutions wishing to make donations can  
contact the Turkish Red Crescent in Istanbul at 90-212-227 51 64 or 
90-212-227 51 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish Airlines will transport donated material to Istanbul  
free of charge on its flights from New York, Chicago and Miami. 
Routine customs requirements have been waived. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistance from across ethnic and religious lines has been made  
available in response to the grim pictures of death and devastation 
in western Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Jewish Committee said Friday it is making a cash  
donation of $225,000 to predominantly Muslim Turkey. Earlier, the 
AJC contributed $25,000. Perhaps facilitating the AJC generosity 
are the friendly ties Israel maintains with Turkey. But Greece and 
Greek Cypriots also have made contributions to the relief effort 
despite their long-standing enmity toward Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt said AID contributions to earthquake relief total about  
$3 million and are increasing. The Pentagon also has contributed to 
the assistance effort, but no figures were available.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Coast Residents Brace for Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Hundreds of people fled South Padre  
Island Saturday as Hurricane Bret took aim at the southern tip of 
Texas and neighboring Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service posted a hurricane warning for a  
220-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast from La Pesca, Mexico, to Texas' 
Port O'Connor, between Corpus Christi and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal residents on Saturday stocked up at gasoline pumps and  
grocery stores, and building supply stores were overrun with 
customers wanting plywood, nails, flashlights and generators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We opened at 6 a.m. and at 10 minutes until 6 there were  
already lines out there,'' said Alma Ortiz at a Home Depot store in 
Pharr-McAllen, about 60 miles inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of popular South Padre Island ordered all 2,100  
residents to pack and leave by 8 a.m. Sunday, Mayor Ed Cyganiewicz 
said. Residents of Port Isabel, on the mainland side of the 
causeway leading to the barrier island, were given until 9 a.m. to 
evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	School buses were used to carry people to inland shelters, and  
90 percent of South Padre Island had already fled for the mainland 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to force people to leave if we have to,''  
Cyganiewicz said grimly. 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone refused to leave, ``then we hand out little body  
tags,'' said Cameron County Judge Gilberto Hinojosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to live if you stay on the island and the  
hurricane hits,'' he said. ``You're going to drown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some tourists remained on the beach at midday Saturday even  
though the sea was choppy and the sky was turning gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Veronica Nunez of Monterrey, Mexico, got in some last-minute  
kite flying with her husband and two daughters. ``We were supposed 
to leave tomorrow, but we have to leave this afternoon instead,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long lines of people waited to check out of beachfront hotels.  
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Bret, packing winds of 135 mph, was upgraded to a  
dangerous category four hurricane late Saturday and was expected to 
make landfall on Sunday along the Texas coast. 
</P>
<P>
	It was moving to the north near 10 mph, an increase in forward  
speed from the earlier speed of 8 mph. At 11 p.m. EDT, Bret was 
located about 155 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to powerful winds, Bret was expected to spin off  
destructive tornadoes, drench the region with up to 10 inches of 
rainfall and hit the coast with a 10-foot storm surge or wall of 
water, forecasters said. Rain had started falling around 
Brownsville. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand prison inmates joined other Texans headed for  
higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said  
3,175 prisoners in far South Texas were being sent by bus more than 
100 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials hoped to complete emergency evacuations from Willacy  
County State Jail in Raymondville and Segovia Unit and Lopez State 
Jail in Edinberg by 5 a.m. Sunday. The inmates will be housed at 
the McConnell, Garza East and Garza West units in Beeville, and in 
the Connally Unit in Kenedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hasn't been hit by a hurricane since Jerry killed three  
people in October 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the state's 367-mile-long coast has been struck by  
tropical storms since then, including Charley, which dumped 18 
inches of rain that killed 19 people in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Nev. Brothel Makes Ventura Tribute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- A Nevada brothel that pro  
wrestler-turned-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura patronized decades ago 
is naming a bedroom suite in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moonlight Bunny Ranch, where prostitution is legal, is  
remodeling one of its rooms and naming it the ``Jesse (The Body) 
Ventura Suite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be decorated with Navy SEAL regalia, professional

<HEADLINE> Research: Family Shapes Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Working parents, take heart: Researchers report  
that even lots of child care won't diminish the profound influences 
of family on young children. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings should help ease the mind of parents who fear that  
too much care by others is bound to shortchange a child, especially 
of the benefits of a mother's attention, the researchers contended. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an issue of quantity, as much as ... quality. You  
really need to look at what is the nature of the experience in 
child care,'' said Ellen Peisner-Feinberg, a developmental 
psychologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. She 
worked on an earlier large study of child care and is familiar with 
the new results. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest findings stem from an ambitious project carried out  
by the federal government's Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development. Researchers followed about 1,300 newborns at 10 sites 
over seven years. By age 6 months, most were in child care with 
someone other than a parent -- a relative, home provider, daycare 
center. Some of the findings were summarized Saturday at the annual 
meeting of the American Psychological Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers measured the quality of family environment based  
on such factors as income, a mother's education, how sensitively 
the mother handles her child's needs, and how well she plays with 
her child. 
</P>
<P>
	High scores in such areas turned out to predict good outcomes in  
children more strongly than the quality of care by someone else. 
Such outcomes at ages 2 and 3 included mental and language skills, 
school readiness, and positive social behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In a finding that surprised some researchers, the relationship  
between the family factors and outcomes in children stays the same 
whether the children spend less than 10 hours or more than 30 hours 
weekly in out-of-family child care. When both family and child care 
appear to influence outcomes in children, the estimated impact of 
family is at least twice as great as the child care influences. 
</P>
<P>
	The project's findings are similar to earlier research on the  
impact of preschool, which children usually attend at ages 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it very reassuring for parents who work,'' said Sarah  
L. Friedman, scientific coordinator of the federal project. ``It 
means what parents believe and what parents do and the quality of 
the family environment make a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Clifford, who helps run a research center on child  
development in Chapel Hill, N.C., said such findings stand to 
reason. ``Families have a huge amount of contact with kids. Parents 
have these kids seven days a week,'' he said. ``It tends to be 
one-on-one contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologist Margaret Burchinal, who analyzes statistics for the  
federal project, cautioned that the research also underscores the 
value of good child care. ``It's not as important as the home, but 
it is important,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Against Pizza Hut Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Pizza Hut Inc. will pay at least $160,000 and  
provide racial-sensitivity training to tens of thousands of 
employees nationwide as part of the settlement of a racial 
discrimination lawsuit, the Chicago Tribune reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But a company officer disputed that the sensitivity program was  
part of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed by a black family who claimed they were not  
allowed to celebrate a child's birthday in June 1996 at a Pizza Hut 
restaurant in suburban Midlothian, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	A settlement was reached in May and was to have remained  
confidential, but the Tribune obtained a copy of the 14-page 
document that was attached to a court filing made by the plaintiffs 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney for the plaintiffs, Fay Clayton, declined to  
comment on the settlement. Pizza Hut's director of public 
relations, Jay Allison, said, ``We're going to uphold our end of 
the bargain and not discuss it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Millen, chief legal officer for the company, said  
Saturday evening by telephone from Dallas that the sensitivity 
program was not part of the settlement but has been in effect for 
2 1/2 years and was a modification of a program that has been in 
effect for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the court papers, Pizza Hut admitted no wrongdoing  
or liability, but has agreed to conduct sensitivity training for 
five years for employees who deal with the public. It also agreed 
to pay $160,000 to the 20 plaintiffs, in addition to possible legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based company is owned by Tricon Global Restaurants  
Inc. and employs roughly 100,000 people in 7,100 company-owned and 
franchise stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed by Jacqueline and Curtis Randle El, who  
claimed they were turned away when they went to celebrate their 
son's 10th birthday at the Midlothian restaurant even though they 
had phoned in an order for five pizzas before arriving. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents of other children invited to the party joined in the  
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant manager contended he closed early that night  
because one waitress left work sick and supplies ran out. 
</P>
<P>
	But in rejecting Pizza Hut's attempt earlier this year to  
dismiss the suit, U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning noted that 
the restaurant remained open for three hours after the waitress 
left, and cash register receipts showed that 35 pizzas were 
delivered after the family was refused service.

	Hurricane Bret Gains Momentum  
</P>
<P>
	MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) -- The first Atlantic hurricane this year  
gathered strength Saturday and churned through the Gulf of Mexico 
towards the Texas-Mexico border with 135-mph winds. Forecasters 
upgraded Hurricane Bret to a Class 4 hurricane and said it could 
strengthen further before making an expected landfall sometime 
Sunday near Brownsville, Texas, and Matamoros, Mexico, twin cities 
on the border. Hurricanes are categorized in five classes, the 
fifth being the strongest.

	Bomb Kills 17 in Algeria  
</P>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- A bomb exploded at a party south of the  
capital, killing 17 people, including two children, and wounding 12 
others, security officials said Saturday. The bomb was thrown into 
the middle of a celebration late Friday in the small town of 
Ouzera, 60 miles south of the coastal capital, Algiers, officials 
said. Authorities have blamed recurring violence on Islamic 
insurgents, who have been fighting to topple the government of the 
northern Africa country since 1992. That was the year the 
military-backed government canceled elections that the Islamic 
Salvation Front was set to win. 

</P>
<P>
	Turkey Finding Fewer Earthquake Survivors  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- With just six people rescued Saturday  
and some 30,000 others presumed to be trapped beneath the rubble of 
buildings ruined by Turkey's massive earthquake, hopes dimmed that 
more survivors will be found. Experts say people trapped in such 
situations usually can survive only 72 hours because of 
dehydration, or until early Friday in this case. Authorities 
refocused their efforts on preventing disease and finding shelter 
for hundreds of thousands of people left homeless by Turkey's 
massive quake. Many of the homes that collapsed were constructed 
with substandard materials, provoking public outrage at builders.

	Giant Panda Gives Birth at San Diego Zoo  
</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- One of only three giant pandas in the United  
States gave birth to a cub Saturday at the San Diego Zoo. Bai Yun, 
a 213-pound giant panda on loan from China, delivered the cub at 
11:40 a.m. in a specially constructed den at the San Diego Zoo. It 
was the first baby panda born in the western hemisphere since 1990, 
zoo officials said.

	Farms in East Ravaged by Drought  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Five entire states -- Kentucky, West  
Virginia, Delaware, Massachusetts and South Carolina -- have been 
declared disaster areas by the Department of Agriculture because of 
drought. Livestock auctions are booming throughout the 
drought-stricken East, as farmers are forced to sell animals they 
can no longer feed. Many farmers also are faced with grain, 
vegetable and tobacco crops that have been ravaged by dry weather. 
Supermarket shoppers, however, will hardly notice, especially at 
major chains that buy produce on a national market, USDA Chief 
Economist Keith Collins said Saturday.

	Effort To Oust Milosevic Set Back  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a setback to efforts to unseat  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the head of the Serbian 
Renewal Movement accused another opposition group of pushing the 
country to civil war by refusing offers of early elections to end 
the political crisis that followed the 78-day NATO bombing 
campaign. Vuk Draskovic wants to accept the Milosevic government's 
offer of early elections this fall. Zoran Djindjic and his allies, 
by contrast, insist that Milosevic step down immediately and make 
way for a transitional government pending new elections under 
international supervision.

	Twins Beat Yankees 6-1

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Eric Milton allowed one run in 7 1-3 innings,  
baffling his former team for the second time this week, as the 
Minnesota Twins beat the New York Yankees 6-1 Saturday night to 
snap a five-game losing streak. Milton (5-10), traded from New York 
to Minnesota on Feb. 6, 1998 for Chuck Knoblauch, allowed six hits 
while striking out six and walking one. Roger Clemens (11-6) 
allowed five runs and nine hits in 6 2-3 innings as New York lost 
for the third time in four games.

	Report: Billionaire Interested in Jets  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- According to two NFL owners, Kirk Kerkorian, the  
owner of the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, has expressed an 
interest in buying the New York Jets, The New York Times reported 
Sunday. One owner, who was not identified by the Times, said the 
chances for Kerkorian, 82, to successfully buy the team are ``good 
if he really wants them.'' Potential owners can make a bid and 
those bids will be presented to the estate of former owner Leon 
Hess, which will accept the highest or most agreeable offer.

<HEADLINE> Crewman Killed in Auto Race Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELMA, Wash. (AP) -- One man was killed and two others were  
injured when a sprint car crashed in the pit area during pre-race 
preparations at Grays Harbor Raceway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly W. Pole, 37, of Canada, was pronounced dead on arrival  
Friday night at Mark Reed Hospital in McCleary, Grays Harbor County 
undersheriff Rich Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another crewman -- 65-year-old Charles Dunlap of Olympia --  
suffered a broken leg. He was in stable condition this morning and 
was expected to undergo surgery at Providence St. Peter Hospital in 
Olympia. 
</P>
<P>
	A third pit crewman, 26-year-old Walter Bachman of Kent, was  
treated at Mark Reed Hospital and released Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened as pit crews were preparing a record field  
of 52 sprint cars for racing and several cars were ``packing the 
track,'' driving around at low speeds to smooth the track's clay 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 81D car developed throttle problems and a crewman who  
was driving headed for the pits to fix the problem, sheriff's Lt. 
Matt Stowers said. To reach the pits, a driver must turn left 
sharply and proceed down a long aisle filled with pit crews and 
support vehicles on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The alcohol-fueled engine revved abnormally high and the car  
began to spin, Stowers said. The car clipped another car, spun 
across the aisle and plowed into the No. 4 car, fatally injuring 
Pole, then plowed into the No. 21 car, injuring the two other men. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's office was investigating.

<HEADLINE> Arab Games Athlete Has Leg Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Egyptian squash player Nesreene Nasha't  
underwent surgery Saturday to repair a bone in her left leg that 
was broken in a bus accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasha't, who also suffered a concussion, was in satisfactory  
condition, according to officials at the King Hussein Medical City 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasha't underwent two operations Friday to fix a fractured jaw  
and a broken thigh bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Her colleagues were at her bedside in the Intensive Care Unit  
after she woke up from surgery Saturday, one of the hospital 
officials said on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a bus carrying several Egyptian athletes overturned,  
killing the Jordanian driver, whose name was not disclosed. Members 
of the Egyptian squash team were on an outing to the city of Madaba 
on their day off between matches they are playing at the Arab Games 
in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other team members, including Iman Amir and Umniya Abdul  
Qawi, sustained bruises. They were reportedly in stable condition 
at the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Amir won the silver medal and Qawi the bronze in the women's  
squash championship Thursday. Nasha't finished eighth in the 
individual championship, which ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether the Egyptian team was intending to  
carry on with the team competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's state-run Petra news agency said King Abdullah II  
visited the Egyptians at the hospital earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's accident occurred outside Madaba, 20 miles southwest of  
Amman. The city is known for its Byzantine ruins. It is also the 
site of Mount Nebo, where Moses is said to have sighted the 
promised land.

<HEADLINE> College Football Notes and Quotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kevin Steele is a two-time winner in the Tommie Frazier  
sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	First, as an assistant to coach Tom Osborne, Steele recruited  
Frazier to play for Nebraska. Earlier this year, after Steele 
became Baylor's new coach, he hired Frazier to be his running backs 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing he thinks he can't do, and the players react  
to him because they've seen him do it,'' Steele says. ``He's 
mature, intelligent, competitive, and a winner in every sense of 
the word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier was perhaps college football's most exciting player for  
two years as he led the Cornhuskers to consecutive perfect seasons 
and national titles in 1994 and 1995. He tried to play in the 
Canadian Football League, but recurring blood clots in his leg 
forced him out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Frazier thought about coaching, but he wanted to be  
sure his playing days were over. So he spent the past two years 
avoiding the game. He worked in the Nebraska governor's public 
information office for six months, then landed a marketing job with 
a Lincoln, Neb., telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, when Steele left his job as an assistant for the  
Carolina Panthers to replace Dave Roberts at Baylor, Frazier showed 
up as a graduate assistant planning to take courses in 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take Steele long to figure he needed to keep Frazier  
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we sat down and looked at it, we said, `Hey, if we don't  
hire this guy we're going to lose him,''' Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
	Voila! Running backs coach Lee Fobbs moved over to handle the  
defensive tackles and Frazier became a full-time assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I called him into my office and told him the news, he  
gave me that same smile he gave me when we recruited him, and that 
same smile he gave when he told doctors he was going to play in the 
Fiesta Bowl,'' Steele said, referring to the 1996 rout of Florida. 
``He said, 'Coach, I'm going to get it done.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier, who still looks like he's ready to suit up, says his  
playing days are definitely behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of 30-year-old coaches out there who still want  
to play, and that takes away from their coaching,'' Frazier said. 
``I think if you're going to coach, your whole focus should be on 
helping the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bears -- 2-9 in each of the last two seasons -- need all  
the help they can get.

<HEADLINE> Juror in 1996 Drug Trial Was Paid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A second juror was paid in exchange for a vote to  
acquit two reputed drug kingpins in a 1996 federal trial, The Miami 
Herald reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the second bribed juror was revealed Friday at  
a bond hearing for Jorge Luis Hernandez, a friend of alleged 
cocaine lords Augusto ``Willie'' Falcon and Salvador ``Sal'' 
Magluta. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Davis referred to recorded  
conversations between Hernandez and a government informant in which 
they discussed whether the second juror was cooperating or 
``spending money ridiculously,'' the Herald said. 
</P>
<P>
	The juror was not identified by the newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, jury foreman Miguel Moya was convicted of taking  
$400,000 in bribes for his vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, 43, a former corrections officer at a federal jail,  
was released on bond Friday. He was charged with conspiracy, money 
laundering and witness tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was one of 12 alleged members of the Falcon-Magluta  
organization named in a 46-count indictment unsealed Friday on 
charges of participating in the conspiracy to obstruct justice on 
behalf of Magluta and Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new indictment, the pair is accused of ordering  
assassinations, bribes, threats and committing perjury to escape 
drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcon and Magluta were acquitted in 1996 on charges they  
smuggled 75 tons of Colombian cocaine into the country. Neither is 
a free man, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Magluta is serving a nine-year prison term for passport fraud.  
Falcon is serving 10 years for being a convicted felon in 
possession of a firearm at the time of his drug arrest.

<HEADLINE> Surplus on Track Despite Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government spent $25.16 billion  
more than it took in last month, but it's still on track to post a 
big budget surplus for the year, the Treasury Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	Outlays totaled $147.07 billion, while receipts totaled $121.91  
billion, the department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Government receipts from individual income tax payments in July  
came to $59.98 billion, compared with $92.99 billion in June as 
quarterly payments were made. Corporate income tax payments totaled 
just $3.4 billion last month, against $39.26 billion in June. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first 10 months of fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1,  
1998, the government posted a surplus totaling $69.11 billion, up 
from the $42.98 billion surplus for the same period last year. The 
July deficit contrasted with a surplus of $53.57 billion in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased to announce that we are on track to reach the  
largest annual budget surplus ever,'' President Clinton said in a 
statement. ``Thanks to solid fiscal discipline, the surplus at this 
point in the fiscal year is $69.1 billion -- the largest in history 
over a comparable period and more than $20 billion over last year's 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in its midyear economic forecast, projected  
that the surplus will climb from $69.2 billion in 1998 to $98.8 
billion in the current fiscal year and to $142.5 billion in 2000. 
Congressional accountants are predicting a surplus of about $120 
billion for all of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the government enjoyed its first budget surplus since  
1969. If the projections for this year prove true, it will have the 
first back-to-back surpluses since 1956 and 1957, during the 
Eisenhower administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used the report to again oppose Republican plans for a  
big tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax bill passed by Congress would reverse the achievement  
of fiscal discipline that has been so critical in making the 
American economy the strongest it has been in generations,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Lutherans Reject Gay Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on  
Saturday rejected a bid to scuttle its policy barring actively 
homosexual clergy. 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination will continue to permit homosexual pastors who  
agree to a celibate lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was submitted to a national assembly by the regional  
unit, or synod, covering northern California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Church members voted 820-159 to continue talking about the  
issue. A report from five denominational agencies said the 
5.2-million member church should not shrink from ``the sometimes 
discomforting experience of looking anew at our inherited 
tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sort of language unnerves Lutheran conservatives. One ad  
hoc Lutheran group in Minneapolis sent all bishops a letter this 
month urging the church to reaffirm ``the church's age-old 
teaching.'' The letter accused the denominational staff of 
promoting homosexuality in various publications. 
</P>
<P>
	James Weist of the North Dakota synod said allowing openly  
homosexual ministers would lead to a ``firestorm from rural 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bid to temporarily suspend the ban on ministers practicing  
homosexual lifestyles while the church discusses the issue farther 
failed as did another to reconsider the issue at the 2003 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Joseph M. Wagner, executive director of the ELCA's Division  
for Ministry, said church members still need to discuss whether 
people are born homosexual or chose the lifestyle and what the 
scripture says about homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Although disappointed by the vote, Emily Eastwood of St. Paul,  
Minn. said she was glad the issue was debated on the floor. She had 
feared it would be buried on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the issue would continue because some congregations are  
allowing their ministers to be openly homosexual and other churches 
are losing good pastors who have been disciplined for practicing 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're telling people you can sit in our pews and you can  
teach Sunday school, but you can't perform the sacraments,'' said 
Ms. Eastwood, a lesbian who runs Wingspan Ministry, the first 
Lutheran ministry for gays and lesbians.

<HEADLINE> Nine Slain in South Africa Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KWAMASHU, South Africa (AP) -- Gunmen shot and killed nine  
people, including three children, and burned houses in this black 
township, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims, who also included four men and two women, lived in  
three homes near each other in the township of KwaMashu. The gunmen 
burned down two of the houses, said Director Bala Naidoo, police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings started late Friday night and ended four hours  
later before dawn Saturday, Naidoo said. The spokesman did not give 
the ages of the slain children. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional police and army units were called into the area on  
Saturday, and leaders from the African National Congress and the 
Inkatha Freedom Party visited the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian Ocean province of KwaZulu-Natal has seen much  
political violence since the mid 1980s, but the area of KwaMashu -- 
around 18 miles north of the port city of Durban -- has been quiet 
in recent years, Naidoo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mtholephi Mthimkhulu, a provincial legislator from the ANC, said  
the motive for the killing did not appear to be political, the 
South African Press Association reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Mthimkhulu said one of the victims had been accused earlier in  
the week of harboring criminals at his house, and another of the 
victims had defended him at a public meeting. The police 
investigator, Bongani Ntanjana, said he could not confirm the 
allegation, Sapa reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A reward of up to $41,000 has been offered by police -- an  
unusual step that was used in this violence prone province once 
before this year, Naidoo said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a different case, police said Saturday they have arrested a  
sixth suspect in the January slaying of controversial opposition 
politician Sifiso Nkabinde in Richmond, about 60 miles northwest of 
Durban. Five other suspects were arrested over the past week for 
the killing, which set off revenge massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not release the name of the sixth suspect, arrested  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the suspects had close ties to Richmond mayor Andrew  
Ragavaloo, a member of the ruling African National Congress.

<HEADLINE> 3 Panda Cubs Born; 1 Dies in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A giant panda gave birth to a rare three-cub  
litter this week in southwest China's Sichuan province, but the 
smallest of the three cubs has died, the state-run Xinhua News 
Agency reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cub, which was born Wednesday at the Giant Panda Breeding  
Research Center, died of a bladder disorder. It had been deserted 
by its mother when a caretaker found it, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two cubs were healthy, the report said.  
</P>
<P>
	Giant pandas, an endangered species, usually give birth to only  
one or two cubs. A litter of three is rare. The animals are not 
prolific breeders, and the survival rate for cubs is low. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant panda is native only to China. Loss of its natural  
habitat and poaching threaten to cause its extinction. Only about 
1,000 survive in captivity and in the wild.

<HEADLINE> N. Orleans Introduces `Yes Sir' Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Students who fail to address their teachers  
with courtesy titles will be disciplined under a state law taking 
effect when classes start this year -- but many school officials 
have yet to decide just how mete out the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Believed to be the first in the nation mandating respectful  
conversation, the law requires students in kindergarten through 
fifth grade to address teachers and other school employees as 
``ma'am'' or ``sir,'' or to use the appropriate titles, like Mr. or 
Ms. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the state's 66 public school systems is supposed to  
decide how to punish impolite students -- with the law's only 
restriction on school officials saying that they can't expel or 
suspend violators. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans schools have a committee looking into policy changes  
but it has not settled on anything, even with classes starting 
Thursday, said spokesman Walt Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither have schools in Terrebonne Parish or Beauregard Parish.  
</P>
<P>
	``We just received the legislative update and we will bring it  
up,'' said Beauregard Superintendent Joe Aguillard. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he does not expect the law to be difficult to enforce,  
thanks to a program it already set up a few years back to teach 
students about respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Bossier Parish also does not anticipate any problems because of  
its Care to Education program, which encourages students to respect 
their teachers, administrators, and each other on a daily basis, 
said Betty McCauley, director of student services. 
</P>
<P>
	Some schools have established disciplinary guidelines.  
</P>
<P>
	East Baton Rouge Parish schools adopted a policy that will  
consider a violation of the rule as a minor offense. That means 
teachers will warn the students first. If the problem continues, 
they will contact the parent by telephone or request a conference. 
Notes will be sent to the student's parents if the problem 
persists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students should not be forced to say it, but they should  
follow the rules,'' said Julie Madere, a spokeswoman for East Baton 
Rouge Parish public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Most East Baton Rouge teachers already require students to  
address them as ``ma'am'' and ``sir,'' Madere added. 
</P>
<P>
	Cliff Friedman, superintendent in Jefferson Davis Parish,  
suggested letting principals at each school handle any violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really see a situation where punishment is going to be  
a major problem,'' Friedman said. ``Good teachers know how to 
handle those types of situations without a major distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Hall, who has taught in New Orleans schools for 28 years,  
said most students do not address her as ma'am, but that doesn't 
mean they lack respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice (law) in theory, but not in reality,'' said Hall,  
who teaches fifth grade at Gentilly Terrace. ``As long as children 
are respectful of me, and I am respectful of them, we have no 
problems.''

<HEADLINE> Bush's Principles Could Hurt Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush is digging in to a position  
that may be costly to defend as he dismisses and denounces the 
question of whether he ever used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	He's gone so far as to issue a denial covering the past 25  
years. But he insists he won't go beyond that to say never, because 
that would yield to destructive, rumor-driven politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody floats a rumor and it causes you to ask a question  
and that's the game in American politics and I refuse to play it,'' 
the governor snapped at a reporter in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he seemed to be playing a variation of it as he  
got more specific about time frames. 
</P>
<P>
	His stand has not dented his lead in polls on the Republican  
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's no denying the problem of the drug distraction,  
for a frontrunner who otherwise has almost everything running his 
way. It roiled a routine Austin news conference into an 
argumentative session that made national television. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in New Orleans, when the Dallas Morning News tied the  
question to the requirement that federal officials getting security 
clearances tell whether they've used illegal drugs within seven 
years, Bush said he has not. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, in Roanoke, Va., he upped the no-drugs time frame  
to 25 years, saying he met the stringent White House standard of no 
drugs within 15 years from the time his father became president in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	His set response covered those years anyhow. ``I made some  
mistakes years ago, but I learned from my mistakes,'' Bush says. 
</P>
<P>
	The nagging, repetitive questions may be unfair, but they're  
there. They stem, as Bush said, from rumors. No one has openly 
accused him of using cocaine. Reporters trying to find any grounds 
for the rumors have come up empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of a denial is not an admission, although Bush says  
he knows that some people are going to draw conclusions based on 
his silence. Still, the Texas governor sometimes seems to be 
answering without answering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want to send signals to anybody that what Gov. Bush  
did 30 years is ago is cool to try,'' he said in a New Hampshire 
television interview earlier this year. He's said that when he was 
young and irresponsible, he behaved that way. 
</P>
<P>
	He insists it is a matter of principle to refuse to deal with  
rumors about his personal life long ago. ``It's time for some 
politician to stand up and say, 'enough of this,''' he says. Bush 
said he thinks the voters will agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has dealt with personal matters, saying during the White  
House sex scandal that he had never been unfaithful to his wife, 
and that he once drank too much but quit alcohol on his 40th 
birthday, 13 years ago. Indeed, when there was adultery gossip 
about his father in the 1988 presidential campaign, the younger 
Bush answered it with a firm no. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush encountered the drug question in his first campaign for  
governor of Texas in 1994, and replied then much as he does now. 
The replay has been dogging him since he emerged as the leader for 
the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democrat's complaint that Bush wasn't being held to the same  
standard that is applied to other political figures and the White 
House led the New York Daily News to ask all the candidates for 
president in 2000 whether they had ever used cocaine. All except 
Bush said no; he stuck to his standard response. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his Democratic challenger, Bill  
Bradley, both have acknowledged using marijuana in the early 1970s. 
All the Republican candidates but Bush say they never used illegal 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to be able to say with no hesitation that no, we have  
not broken the drug laws of the United States,'' said conservative 
Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, President Clinton said that in 1992, before  
admitting that he'd tried marijuana as a student in England in the 
late 1960s -- and that he didn't inhale. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> CIA Cuts Ex-Spy Director's Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a highly unusual move, the CIA pulled the  
security clearances for former Director John Deutch, unwilling to 
excuse his violation of agency rules by keeping secret files on an 
unsecured home computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Intelligence Agency spokesman William Harlow said Friday  
he knew of no precedent for the action taken against Deutch, a 
former deputy defense secretary who spent 38 years in public 
service before leaving the CIA in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to suspend Deutch's security clearances was made by  
CIA Director George Tenet, Deutch's successor. Tenet acted after 
reviewing an inspector general's report on Deutch's improper 
handling of classified materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Director Tenet regrets that it was necessary for him to take  
this action, particularly in light of Dr. Deutch's distinguished 
record of public service,'' the CIA public affairs office said in a 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutch issued a written statement through the CIA in which he  
acknowledged he erred by using an unsecured computer to write 
classified documents and memoranda at his home. He stressed that 
investigators found no information was compromised as a result of 
his lapses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect the decision of the director to suspend my CIA  
clearances,'' Deutch said. ``As for the future, I intend to do 
everything in my power to reassure my colleagues at the agency of 
my commitment to comply with the rules that safeguard classified 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's report to Tenet on July 13 is  
classified. Tenet said it found no evidence that national security 
information was lost due to Deutch's security lapses, but 
``potential for damage to U.S. security existed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA normally does not announce suspension of security  
clearances but did this time because of prior news coverage about 
the Deutch case, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Pike, an intelligence specialist at the Federation of  
American Scientists, said he believes Tenet acted because of the 
public uproar over allegations that Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at the 
Los Alamos National Laboratory, gave China secrets about America's 
nuclear arsenal. The Lee investigation has unleashed an avalanche 
of charges about government inattention to lapses in protection of 
classified materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no way they could conceivably explain letting Deutch  
off the hook'' in light of the Lee case, Pike said, even though 
most officials regarded Deutch's lapses at the time as ``the sort 
of normal violation that is against the rules but is frequently 
practiced'' and not punished. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutch is an unpaid consultant to the CIA. The suspension of his  
security clearances makes it unlikely that the relationship will 
continue, Terrence O'Donnell, his personal attorney, said in an 
interview. O'Donnell said the CIA gave no assurance when the 
suspension might be reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutch was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. When he  
was leaving his CIA post, agency technicians went to his home for 
routine checks to ensure that secrets were properly protected. They 
found 31 classified documents on a CIA-issued computer not 
configured for classified work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department decided in April not to prosecute Deutch  
but recommended that the CIA review Deutch's continued suitability 
to hold high-level security clearances. It concluded that Deutch's 
security lapses were reckless rather than criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	In its statement Friday, the CIA said Tenet decided to suspend  
Deutch's clearances indefinitely in light of the ``nature of the 
security violations involved'' and the former director's 
responsibility as a senior intelligence official to set the highest 
standards in the protection of classified information. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, Deutch concluded a stint as chairman of a  
bipartisan commission that assessed the government's preparedness 
to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction, a role in 
which he relied on CIA security clearances.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Gives Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- One of only three giant pandas in the United  
States gave birth to a cub Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bai Yun, a 213-pound giant panda on loan from China, delivered  
the cub at 11:40 a.m. in a specially constructed den at the San 
Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first baby panda born in the western hemisphere since  
1990, zoo officials said. ``Everyone here is grinning from ear to 
ear over today's event,'' said Don Lindburg, of the zoo's giant 
panda team. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists were unable to determine the cub's gender. The mother  
can only be viewed through a special camera that allows observers 
to catch glimpses of the cub as it is cradled in her huge paws. 
</P>
<P>
	Pandas have a mortality rate of 60 percent at birth due to a  
cub's vulnerability to disease and accidentally getting crushed by 
its mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists say it should be two to three weeks before they can  
say with confidence that the still unnamed cub will survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo is consulting with Chinese biologists who have more  
experience with panda breeding. This is the second attempt to 
artificially inseminate the 8-year-old Bai Yun. The first attempt 
last year failed.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Hits 50th, 51st Home Runs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his major-league leading 50th and  
51st home runs Saturday, becoming the fourth player to post 
consecutive 50-homer seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	With two out in the fourth against Colorado's John Thomson, Sosa  
hit a 1-2 pitch into the left-field bleachers to pull the Chicago 
Cubs within 2-1 of the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	With two on and one out in the sixth, Sosa smashed a 2-1 pitch  
from Thomson into the right field seats to give the Cubs a 5-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who also hit two homers Friday, now leads Mark McGwire by  
three home runs. McGwire did not homer Saturday and has 48 this 
season. It was Sosa's 39th career multihomer game and sixth this 
year 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, McGwire, Babe Ruth and Ken Griffey Jr. are the only  
players with consecutive 50-homer seasons. Sosa had 66 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa is ahead of last year's pace. In 1998, he hit his 50th and  
51st homers in the Cubs' 130th game; Saturday was the Cubs' 121st 
game.

<HEADLINE> 1999 the Year of Sports Retirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mark down 1999 as a time of change in sports, when some of the  
greatest athletes moved on. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing is forever. Watch the great ones win game after game,  
championship after championship, and it feels as if they will last 
a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, one day, Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr., are hitting  
home runs instead of Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. And it's Hakeem, 
not Kareem, setting up under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, Randall Cunningham is throwing last-gasp touchdowns  
instead of Joe Montana, and Eric Lindros, not Mario Lemieux, is 
zeroing in on some poor goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	Turn around and the landscape changes.  
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio was always there as the centerpiece for Opening Day  
at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, he was not.  
</P>
<P>
	Gone with other immortals like Marion Motley and Gene Sarazen,  
Pee Wee Reese and Angelo Bertelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan was always there for the steal and the shot in  
the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, he was not.  
</P>
<P>
	Retired with other superstars like Wayne Gretzky and John Elway,  
Barry Sanders and Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough eight months for continuity, a time when  
exodus became an undeniable exclamation point for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of DiMaggio, coming less than two months after the  
retirement of Jordan, defined the rush of change. In their own way, 
each of them left a huge void in the psyche of their sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Who replaces Joe D. as baseball's greatest living player? Maybe  
Ted Williams, who generated a huge, emotional outpouring of 
affection at the All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	Who replaces Jordan as the highest profile player in the NBA?  
Perhaps Tim Duncan, who carried the San Antonio Spurs to a 
championship while Air Jordan was exploring the mysteries of putts 
and pars, bogies and bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Jordan's exit, the pace of passage has quickened.  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky is gone from the NHL. Elway and Sanders left the NFL.  
Graf decided it was game, set, match for her at age 30. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, retirement seemed almost premature, coming at a  
time when each of them was still more than capable of playing. In 
each case, however, continuing to play might have been superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
	Six NBA championships for Jordan. Four Stanley Cups for Gretzky.  
Two Super Bowls for Elway. More than 15,000 yards rushing for 
Sanders. Twenty-two Grand Slam titles for Graf, the only player to 
win each of the Slams four or more times. 
</P>
<P>
	What was left to prove? What more was necessary?  
</P>
<P>
	``Change is a natural evolution,'' sports psychologist Thomas  
Tutko said. ``Values is what this is all about. I think values have 
changed. There is a value difference between the old style in 
sports and the new style. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to be a star and they don't care about the  
team concept. Many stars are not happy with the young kids coming 
up and don't want to be in that kind of environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never heard about burnout before. But now some coaches and  
some superstars look around and see a lack of commitment. And they 
say, `What is all of this about? What am I doing here?' 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow, all sports can disappear, but the world will  
continue. That's not true about a lot of occupations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sports survives. There are always replacements in the wings,  
waiting their turn. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA survived the loss of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson with  
Jordan. Now, Duncan, Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson lead an army of 
young stars who are just like Mike. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky followed the legacy of Gordie Howe and Bobby Hull and  
now leaves the NHL in the strong hands of people like Jaromir Jagr, 
Pavel Bure and Teemu Selanne. 
</P>
<P>
	When Terry Bradshaw and Tony Dorsett bowed out of the NFL, Elway  
and Sanders picked up the ball. Now a new wave of quarterbacks and 
running backs, led by rookie hotshots Tim Couch and Ricky Williams, 
moves in. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf was there when Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova left  
tennis. Now, it's time for Lindsay Davenport, Martina Hingis and 
Venus Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the situation is summed up best in the Montreal  
Canadiens dressing room, where a portion of John McRae's World War 
I poem ``In Flanders Field,'' is emblazoned over the lockers. 
</P>
<P>
	It says: ``To you from failing hands, we throw the torch. Be  
yours to hold it high.''

<HEADLINE> Lutherans Reject Gay Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on  
Saturday rejected a bid to scuttle its policy barring actively 
homosexual clergy. 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination will continue to permit homosexual pastors who  
agree to a celibate lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was submitted to a national assembly by the regional  
unit, or synod, covering northern California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Church members voted 820-159 to continue talking about the  
issue. A report from five denominational agencies said the 
5.2-million member church should not shrink from ``the sometimes 
discomforting experience of looking anew at our inherited 
tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sort of language unnerves Lutheran conservatives. One ad  
hoc Lutheran group in Minneapolis sent all bishops a letter this 
month urging the church to reaffirm ``the church's age-old 
teaching.'' The letter accused the denominational staff of 
promoting homosexuality in various publications. 
</P>
<P>
	James Weist of the North Dakota synod said allowing openly  
homosexual ministers would lead to a ``firestorm from rural 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bid to temporarily suspend the ban on ministers practicing  
homosexual lifestyles while the church discusses the issue farther 
failed as did another to reconsider the issue at the 2003 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Joseph M. Wagner, executive director of the ELCA's Division  
for Ministry, said church members still need to discuss whether 
people are born homosexual or chose the lifestyle and what the 
scripture says about homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Although disappointed by the vote, Emily Eastwood of St. Paul,  
Minn. said she was glad the issue was debated on the floor. She had 
feared it would be buried on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the issue would continue because some congregations are  
allowing their ministers to be openly homosexual and other churches 
are losing good pastors who have been disciplined for practicing 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're telling people you can sit in our pews and you can  
teach Sunday school, but you can't perform the sacraments,'' said 
Ms. Eastwood, a lesbian who runs Wingspan Ministry, the first 
Lutheran ministry for gays and lesbians.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Players Evacuated to Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Three Egyptian squash players competing in  
the Arab Games who were injured in a bus accident were evacuated 
Saturday to Cairo in an Egyptian military plane, diplomatic sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those flown back home on the orders of President Hosni  
Mubarak was Nesreen Nasha't who sustained a concussion and 
underwent three surgeries on her broken jaw and leg, said the 
sources, who did not wish to be identified further. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasha't was in stable condition after spending a night in the  
intensive care unit and was discharged, said officials at King 
Hussein Medical City hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a bus carrying several Egyptian athletes overturned,  
killing the Jordanian driver, whose name was not disclosed. Members 
of the Egyptian squash team were on an outing to the city of Madaba 
on their day off between matches at the Arab Games in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two players flown back with Nasha't were Iman Amir and  
Umniya Abdul Qawi, both of whom sustained bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Amir won the silver medal and Qawi the bronze in the women's  
squash championship on Thursday. Nasha't finished eighth in the 
individual championship, which ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt has already sent replacements for the three players and  
will continue participating in the team competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's state-run Petra news agency said King Abdullah II  
visited the Egyptians at the hospital earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's accident occurred outside Madaba, 20 miles southwest of  
Amman. The city is known for its Byzantine ruins featuring mosaic 
floors. It is also the site of Mount Nebo, where Moses is said to 
have sighted the promised land.

<HEADLINE> Two-Time Champ Flops in Shot Put </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- John Godina let his shot put world title  
slip away Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Plagued by trouble with his footing, the two-time World  
Championships gold medalist fouled on five of six attempts during 
the final, settling for seventh place behind fellow American C.J. 
Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say my head is spinning right now,'' Godina said.  
``It's hard to tell what my problem was today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Olympic silver medalist, who led the field in the  
morning qualifying session, connected on just one effort -- his 
second -- in the final. That traveled 66 feet, 9 1/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old appeared to be out of sorts, talking to himself  
and shaking his head between turns in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	On his final attempt, Godina started to spin, the shot tucked  
under his chin, but came to a sudden halt -- a rare sight in the 
event -- and asked that the ring be swept. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite being given a chance to start the attempt over,  
Godina produced a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a muted end to a disappointing showing from the man who  
owns the world's leading throw this year, a career-best 72-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows John's the best and John just had a bad night.  
If I had to guess, it looked like he was rushing things a little 
bit,'' said Andy Bloom of the United States, who was fourth 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter claimed his first major international title by eclipsing  
his career best with a final effort of 71-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured (Hunter) would step up. Somebody had to,'' Godina  
said, a blank look on his face. ``It sure wasn't me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Oliver-Sven Buder took his second straight worlds  
silver in the shot with 70-3 1/2, while world indoor champion 
Alexander Bagach of Ukraine was third in 69-9. 
</P>
<P>
	Godina picked up his gold at the 1997 worlds with a little help.  
He was fourth at the U.S. Championships, not good enough to qualify 
for the worlds, but the International Amateur Athletic Federation 
decided to invite 1995 world champions to defend their titles as 
wild-card entries. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, during the competition, Godina finished second behind  
Bagach. But Bagach tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine and 
was stripped of his gold medal and the $60,000 first prize -- 
leaving both for Godina. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 285-pound Godina gets another shot at a medal here  
in the discus competition. Qualifying is Sunday, the final Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Godina was fifth in the discus at the 1997 worlds, and 10th in  
the event four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really upset for John, I know how hard he works,'' Hunter  
said. ``But this may make him come back even stronger.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Orders Serbs To Hand In Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO ordered Serbs in a southern  
Kosovo town to hand in their weapons Saturday or face arrest in a 
last-minute crackdown before Dutch troops turn security over to the 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kosovo capital, Pristina, a joint Serb-ethnic Albanian  
council formed to advise the U.N. mission held its second meeting 
Saturday -- but without Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim Thaci. 
</P>
<P>
	Thaci's rival, moderate politician Ibrahim Rugova, boycotted the  
first session July 16, complaining about the allocation of seats. 
Rugova, elected president of the unrecognized Republic of Kosovo, 
was present at Saturday's meeting, along with U.N. and NATO 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Thaci and Rugova claim leadership of Kosovo's majority  
ethnic Albanian community. Chief U.N. administrator Bernard 
Kouchner said Thaci told him earlier he would be out of the country 
but would attend the next meeting, scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Saturday, German and Dutch troops posted signs throughout  
a Serb neighborhood in the city of Orahovac with the names of Serbs 
NATO believes were given weapons by Serb police. 
</P>
<P>
	The signs ordered Serbs to turn in their weapons Saturday to  
NATO collection points in the center of town. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you respond to this, you will be freed of punishment,'' the  
signs said. The warning added that peacekeepers would begin 
house-to-house searches after the deadline, and ``if we find any 
weapons, you will be arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-afternoon Saturday, NATO officials said Serbs had turned  
in 120 weapons, mostly Kalashnikov rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	Orahovac, 40 miles southwest of Pristina, is in the  
German-controlled sector of Kosovo. Dutch soldiers have been 
stationed there for weeks but are to hand the town over to Russian 
peacekeepers starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians resent the Russians, accusing them of favoring  
their fellow Slavic Serbs. Many Serbs believe only the Russians can 
protect them from ethnic Albanians seeking revenge after an 
18-month crackdown in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's 
dominant republic. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic withdrew 
Serbian forces from the province as part of a peace plan reached in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, NATO said Dutch and German peacekeepers arrested  
three Kosovo Serbs in Orahovac on suspicion of committing 
atrocities against ethnic Albanians during the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said four people were  
detained in Orahovac and described them as ``respected figures'' in 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
	In a commentary Saturday, Tanjug denounced the arrests, calling  
them a ``grotesque move'' and claiming NATO troops ``have turned 
the barrels of their guns on the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Reprisal attacks have prompted most of Kosovo's former  
200,000-member Serb community to seek sanctuary in other parts of 
Yugoslavia. The majority of the province's population is ethnic 
Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, two Serb brothers were wounded when ethnic  
Albanians attacked Banje village in central Kosovo, Tanjug 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	French troops rushed to the scene and transported the two to the  
nearby French military hospital, Tanjug said. The agency said 
villagers demanded a meeting with French officers and threatened to 
leave the province if they could not be protected. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Serbs were wounded Friday night when ethnic Albanians  
hurled grenades from a car in a village west of Pristina, the 
private Yugoslav news agency FoNet said. The wounded were evacuated 
by Russian troops. Other Serb villagers barricaded the road, 
demanding international protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government has complained about NATO's failure to  
protect Serbs and warned that Moscow might withdraw its troops from 
Kosovo or change their role there if conditions become 
``unacceptable.'' It did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with NATO's inability to stop the attacks, Momcilo  
Trajkovic, a Serb community leader, suggested Saturday that 
peacekeepers establish all-Serb enclaves in areas of Kosovo where 
Serbs were in the majority before the Western bombing campaign 
against Yugoslavia began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Kouchner promised to study the proposal and present a written  
response Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO hopes that attacks will ease as the KLA gradually disarms  
under an agreement signed in June. The deal calls for final 
disarmament by Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest deadline was midnight Friday, when the KLA was to  
have surrendered 60 percent of its weapons. KLA military commander 
Gen. Agim Ceku claims the group met the deadline a day in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said they want to inventory the weapons before  
confirming the claim.

<HEADLINE>  Silverbulletday Wins Alabama Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- The beaten-favorite jinx in the  
Alabama Stakes was trampled Saturday under the flying hooves of 
Silverbulletday at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-5 betting choice simply ran away from six rivals as she  
became the first favorite to win the Grade I stakes for 3-year-old 
fillies since Sky Beauty in 1993. Four of the beaten favorites in 
the five previous runnings of the Alabama were odds-on. The other 
was even money. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth or fourth until a half-mile remained, Silverbulletday then  
was moved into third by Jerry Bailey. She was second and pressuring 
Strolling Belle approaching the quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Then -- whoosh! -- Silverbulletday was gone, and the end of the 1 1/4  
miles she was 9 lengths ahead Strolling Belle. Gandria was another 
3 lengths back and 6 1/2 lengths ahead of On a Soapbox. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome -- that's the word that says it best,'' Bailey said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really impressed with her performance,'' owner Mike Pegram  
said. ``She's a gift from heaven and a once-in-a-lifetime horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday finished in 2:02 3-5 under level weight of 121  
pounds after a final quarter in under 24 seconds. Although it had 
rained for most of the afternoon, the track was listed as fast and 
the rain virtually had stopped by the 4:45 p.m. post time for the 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the seventh win in eight starts and 13th in 15 career  
outings for Silverbulletday, trained by Bob Baffert. It also was 
her 10th straight win over fillies and her first at beyond 1 1/8 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that 1 1/4 miles might be too far for  
Silverbulletday after her seventh-place finish in the 1 1/2-mile 
Belmont Stakes on June 5. The Belmont, however, was against colts. 
Against fillies, she simply is in a league of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to keep her with the fillies,'' Baffert said. ``I  
think it's one of those things where we're enjoying her. With Real 
Quiet being out, you have to enjoy the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert trains and Pegram owns Real Quiet, the 1998 Kentucky  
Derby and Preakness winner and winner of the Pimlico Special and 
Hollywood Gold Cup this year. Real Quiet cracked a bone in his 
right front leg last Sunday and is finished for the year -- maybe 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram indicated Silverbulletday would next start in the Grade I  
Spinster on Oct. 16 at Keeneland, where she could face Banshee 
Breeze, the 1998 champion 3-year-old filly, who is unbeaten in four 
starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday paid $2.80, $2.50 and $2.10 and earned $240,000  
from a purse of $400,000, boosting her earnings to $2,601,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Strolling Belle, ridden by Mike Smith, returned $6.50 and $2.10.  
Canadian-bred Gandria, ridden by Shane Sellers, paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish after On a Soapbox were Adam's  
Time, Back in Shape and Brushed Halory. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Silverbulletday Wins Alabama Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- The beaten-favorite jinx in the  
Alabama Stakes was trampled Saturday under the flying hooves of 
Silverbulletday at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-5 betting choice simply ran away from six rivals as she  
became the first favorite to win the Grade I stakes for 3-year-old 
fillies since Sky Beauty in 1993. Four of the beaten favorites in 
the five previous runnings of the Alabama were odds-on. The other 
was even money. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth or fourth until a half-mile remained, Silverbulletday then  
was moved into third by Jerry Bailey. She was second and pressuring 
Strolling Belle approaching the quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Then -- whoosh! -- Silverbulletday was gone, and the end of the 1 1/4  
miles she was 9 lengths ahead Strolling Belle. Gandria was another 
3 lengths back and 6 1/2 lengths ahead of On a Soapbox. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome -- that's the word that says it best,'' Bailey said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really impressed with her performance,'' owner Mike Pegram  
said. ``She's a gift from heaven and a once-in-a-lifetime horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday finished in 2:02 3-5 under level weight of 121  
pounds after a final quarter in under 24 seconds. Although it had 
rained for most of the afternoon, the track was listed as fast and 
the rain virtually had stopped by the 4:45 p.m. post time for the 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the seventh win in eight starts and 13th in 15 career  
outings for Silverbulletday, trained by Bob Baffert. It also was 
her 10th straight win over fillies and her first at beyond 1 1/8 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that 1 1/4 miles might be too far for  
Silverbulletday after her seventh-place finish in the 1 1/2-mile 
Belmont Stakes on June 5. The Belmont, however, was against colts. 
Against fillies, she simply is in a league of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to keep her with the fillies,'' Baffert said. ``I  
think it's one of those things where we're enjoying her. With Real 
Quiet being out, you have to enjoy the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert trains and Pegram owns Real Quiet, the 1998 Kentucky  
Derby and Preakness winner and winner of the Pimlico Special and 
Hollywood Gold Cup this year. Real Quiet cracked a bone in his 
right front leg last Sunday and is finished for the year -- maybe 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram indicated Silverbulletday would next start in the Grade I  
Spinster on Oct. 16 at Keeneland, where she could face Banshee 
Breeze, the 1998 champion 3-year-old filly, who is unbeaten in four 
starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday paid $2.80, $2.50 and $2.10 and earned $240,000  
from a purse of $400,000, boosting her earnings to $2,601,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Strolling Belle, ridden by Mike Smith, returned $6.50 and $2.10.  
Canadian-bred Gandria, ridden by Shane Sellers, paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish after On a Soapbox were Adam's  
Time, Back in Shape and Brushed Halory. 
</P>
<P>
	On a Soapbox, ridden by Robby Albarado, had won the 1 1/2-mile  
Coaching Club American Oaks on July 24 at Belmont Park, but she was 
never in contention Saturday.

<HEADLINE> No Y2K Glitches With Navigation Tool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- It appeared to be smooth sailing  
Saturday for boaters and aviators who rely on a satellite-based 
navigation system that reset itself, which was expected to confuse 
older locator units. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Coast Guard here and the Federal Aviation  
Administration reported receiving no calls for stranded boats or 
airplanes having problems in determining their coordinates by using 
the Global Positioning System, or GPS. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just a regular weekend. It's actually been a very slow day,''  
said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Danny Phee. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA in Washington also had no reports of problems, said  
agency spokesman Les Dorr, noting that small, private plane pilots 
had been warned to check their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Time clocks on the popular GPS receivers reset to zero at 5 p.m.  
PDT Saturday, which could possibly confuse units made before 1993. 
Those units may take longer to pinpoint a location, be off in their 
calculations, or be unable to find the location. 
</P>
<P>
	GPS receivers determine location by using signals of three to 24  
satellites. To do this they need the exact time, which the system 
determines by counting the weeks since Jan. 5, 1980 -- up to 1,024. 
But GPS reached its maximum number of weeks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers offer upgrades. Otherwise, some receivers may  
think it is 1980 when the clock reset, according to the 
Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	GPS, originally designed for the military, is booming in the  
commercial market, often offered in luxury cars as a mapping 
device. Aviators and boaters have been using GPS for at least a 
decade and only in recent years have hikers begun to use hand-held 
units. 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide, private tow boat agency, Vessel Assist Association  
of America, based in Newport Beach, reported no GPS-related 
problems Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely not. We haven't had any troubles at all,'' said  
Steve Ryan, a dispatcher for Vessel Assist.

 *Alfons Bach    	
</P>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Industrial designer, architect and artist  
Alfons Bach, who helped create one the nation's first shopping 
malls, died Thursday. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Magdeburg, Germany, Bach studied architecture in Berlin  
and opened a design firm in New York City in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
	During a career that spanned seven decades, he worked on the  
Ridgeway Center, a pioneering shopping mall in Stanford, Conn., and 
designed the interior of Trans World Airlines' Constellation 
airliner for billionaire Howard Hughes, who owned TWA at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bach was a co-founder and national president of the American  
Designers Institute, which later merged with the Industrial Design 
Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``His biggest impact is he had hung in there the longest,'' said  
Carroll Gantz, a retired industrial designer who is writing a 
history of 20th century industrial design. ``He was one of the 
first generation designers and that makes him unusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bach's design clients included furniture maker Heywood  
Wakefield, carpet manufacturer Bigelow-Sanford, General Electric, 
Keystone Silver and Pacific Mills, a linen maker. 
</P>
<P>
	His drawings and papers are stored at Cooper-Hewitt, the  
National Design Institute of the Smithsonian Institution in New 
York and some of his works have been exhibited at the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in New York.

 *Robert Byck    	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Dr. Robert Byck, a Yale Medical School brain  
researcher who in 1979 gave Congress an early warning about 
smokable cocaine, died Aug. 9 of complications from a stroke 
suffered three days earlier. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1970s, Byck and a Yale associate, Dr. J. Murdoch  
Ritchie, were the first to show that the major component of 
marijuana -- tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC -- had a direct effect on 
nerve cells and was more dangerous than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly afterward, Byck and colleagues began a study on the use  
of coca paste in Peru that led him to predict a coming crisis in 
the use of smoked cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Byck told the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse  
and Control that smoking coca paste gives a very intense, and 
almost immediate, high. Byck said that the United States did not 
have an epidemic of freebase or coca-paste smoking but that the 
possibility of one strongly existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on the brink of a dangerous drug-use phenomenon,'' he  
said. ``We should do something about it as rapidly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Byck was born in Newark, N.J. He received his medical  
degree at the University of Pennsylvania and joined the Yale 
faculty in 1969.

</P>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Gus Girves, founder of the Brown Derby  
restaurant chain, died Thursday after a long illness. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Girves was born in Sommersworth, N.H., and later moved to Akron.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, Girves opened his first Brown Derby. He installed a  
huge bar in his first restaurant and sold liquor at cut-rate 
prices. The restaurant was open around the clock, and catered to 
war workers at the nearby Goodyear plant. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to open Brown Derby restaurants in Pennsylvania,  
Michigan, Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Girves, son of a Greek immigrant, was also known for his support  
of the Greek community in the Akron area.

</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Vera Krasovskaya, a Russian dancer who later  
became a renowned ballet historian, died Aug. 15 after a serious 
illness. She was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Krasovskaya began her career in the 1930s as a dancer at the  
Kirov Ballet, based at the Mariinsky Theater i n what was then 
Leningrad. She later studied at the city's Theater Institute and 
earned a doctorate in art criticism there in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Krasovskaya wrote extensively on ballet issues for Soviet and  
foreign publications and published a number of books, including the 
multi-volume ``Ballet Theater in Russia'' and ``Western European 
Ballet Theater.'' 

</P>
<P>
 *Donald Louis Mason    	
</P>
<P>
	HAWORTH, N.J. (AP) -- Donald Louis Mason, an FBI agent whose  
interest in art led to the creation of a loosely organized unit 
within the bureau's major theft squad in New York that targeted art 
thieves, died Aug. 10 of cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason's investigations included a widely publicized case in  
1976, when film director Otto Preminger reported the theft of a 
Kandinsky painting ``Leise Deutung'' (``Soft Interpretations''), 
from his New York office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason traced the painting from New York to Philadelphia, back to  
New York, and then to Basel, Switzerland, where it was seized and 
returned to Preminger. An advertising salesman was charged in 
connection with the theft. 
</P>
<P>
	After solving the case, Mason retired from the FBI and became a  
private consultant on art security. His clients included the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Newberry Library in Chicago and the 
Art Institute of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mason, a 25-year FBI veteran, had no formal art  
training, he frequented museums and ``was fascinated by all forms 
of art,'' his wife, Eleanor, told The New York Times for Saturday's 
editions.

</P>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Stanley J. Winkelman, the former  
head of Winkelman's department stores who also was known for his 
community involvement, died Thursday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving as a naval officer in World War II, Winkelman  
joined the family-owned business in 1946. His father and uncle 
formed Winkelman Brothers Apparel Inc. in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1966, when the company became publicly held, Winkelman's had  
62 stores. Ten years later, Winkelman became chairman and chief 
executive officer. He retired in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie Retail Inc. purchased the chain in 1983 and last year, in  
the midst of bankruptcy reorganization, said it would close all 
remaining Winkelman's stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Winkelman's community involvement started in the 1960s, when he  
called upon the Detroit Board of Education to hire more black 
teachers. In 1967, following the Detroit riots, he called for an 
investigation of the city's police department.

<HEADLINE> CDC Reports on Drug-Resistant Staph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Federal health officials are warning doctors  
about a drug-resistant bacteria that has killed four people and 
sickened scores of others in the Midwest and until recently had 
been confined to hospitals and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths of four previously healthy children in Minnesota and  
North Dakota from the bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, have 
prompted an investigation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no cause for panic, said Dr. Timothy Naimi, a CDC  
epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not in any way a widespread epidemic,'' Naimi said  
Friday. ``The risk to any individual of getting an infection from 
staph aureus is very low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors need to be aware of the bacteria when making  
decisions on how to test for infections and how to treat them. A 
colleague of Naimi's, Michael Osterholm, calling the infections ``a 
real wake-up call to clinicians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One-quarter of all humans carry staph bacteria, but  
drug-resistant infections were largely thought to be contracted 
only in hospitals and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths of the children, from diverse ethnic backgrounds and  
environments, indicate healthy people could be susceptible to the 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, two from Minnesota and two from North Dakota,  
ranged in age from 1 to 13. Two were white, one was black and one 
was American Indian. They died between 1997 and 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hundred people in the two states have become ill in the past  
two years after contracting staph infections resistant to 
penicillin and cephalosporin, drugs from the most common class of 
antibiotics, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kirk Smith of the Minnesota Department of Health said cases  
also have been reported in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Staph germs are passed through skin-to-skin contact but  
generally don't become a problem unless they enter the body through 
a cut or abrasion. Good hygiene such as frequent hand-washing can 
minimize the chance of infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The children who died were given the right antibiotics to treat  
their symptoms, but the doctors who treated them were not aware the 
drug-resistant strain had spread into the general population, 
Osterholm said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason the bacteria may have become resistant to some drugs  
is the overall overuse of antibiotics, North Dakota state 
epidemiologist Larry Shireley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As physicians in the medical community, we need to look at how  
we are prescribing drugs, to make sure that we are prescribing 
drugs appropriately and look at the drug resistance pattern when we 
treat,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Moore in Stable Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Bengals safety Kelvin Moore was in  
stable condition Saturday at a hospital in Pontiac, Mich., a day 
after he broke a vertebra in his neck while making a tackle in an 
exhibition game against the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore continued to have feeling in his arms and legs, team Dr.  
Robert Heidt Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's premature to make a final statement, but all indications  
are for an excellent recovery,'' Heidt said. ``He will, however, 
face an extended period of convalescence and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will not be able to play football this season. Beyond that,  
regarding football, it's too soon to speculate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 24, spent most of his rookie season on the Bengals'  
practice squad. He came in as an extra defensive back in passing 
situations during the first two exhibition games this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He will remain at POH Medical Center for another one to three  
days, then will be transferred to USC University Hospital in Los 
Angeles, near his family's home. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know in a situation like that,'' Bengals coach Bruce  
Coslet said Saturday. ``That's what you're wishing for and hoping 
for (a full recovery), but this is completely out of my realm. 
Until he goes through rehab, who knows? It's encouraging what they 
told us today. We'll just wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was carted off the Silverdome field after his head hit the  
knee of a Detroit wide receiver awkwardly during the third quarter 
of the Bengals' 16-0 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was delayed about 12 minutes as medical personnel  
placed him on a backboard, fitted him with a neck brace and carted 
him away. He soon regained sensation in his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's injury brought back memories of other football injuries  
involving members of the Bengals and Lions. Former Lions Mike Utley 
was paralyzed after landing on his head in a game in 1991 and 
Reggie Brown sustained a neck injury two years ago that forced him 
to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Bengals guard Scott Brumfield suffered a spinal cord  
concussion that put him in a wheelchair for weeks. He recovered to 
play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore signed with the Bengals as a rookie free agent from Morgan  
State last year. He played in the first two exhibition games, was 
waived and then signed to the team's practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was added to the active roster for the last four games,  
replacing Tremain Mack, and appeared on special teams, making three 
tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kept him around here last year. He's a smart kid and he's  
fast, he's strong, he's got the right size for the position, he's 
got the right instincts. It's just too bad this has got to 
happen,'' Coslet said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals allowed safety Myron Bell to stay with Moore and his  
family in Michigan when the rest of the team returned from the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just wanted to be there with him last night,'' Coslet said.  
``I told Myron to stay as long as you feel it's helpful and get 
back when you can. They're close friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long snapper Greg Truitt injured a knee in Friday night's game,  
which left the Bengals 0-2. An MRI on Saturday found a partial tear 
of the anterior cruciate ligament and torn cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals didn't know whether Truitt would be able to play  
this season.

<HEADLINE>  Taiwan Party Picks President Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Delegates of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist  
Party voted overwhelmingly today to support Vice President Lien 
Chan as their presidential candidate in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Running unopposed, Lien won 96 percent of the 2,071 votes cast  
for the nomination to succeed President Lee Teng-hui. 
</P>
<P>
	But 109 delegates did not cast their ballots. Seventy-six others  
voted for powerful politician James Soong, who broke rank with the 
Nationalists to run as an independent. Those ballots were declared 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The poll ... indicates our members are still united behind the  
party,'' Nationalist Party Secretary General John Chang said. ``We 
are very pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lien has won wide approval for his modesty, his moderate  
viewpoints and his knowledge of domestic and international affairs, 
Chang said. The party will officially name Lien its candidate for 
the March presidential race at a congress next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	But several Soong supporters publicly criticized Lee today for  
blocking other challengers and mobilizing party support to name 
Lien his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was but a melodrama put up by the Nationalists to  
legitimize the nomination,'' said delegate Sun Ta-chien. 
</P>
<P>
	Political observers say Lien is viewed as the candidate who can  
best continue Lee's popular mainland policy, promoting trade and 
cultural exchanges with China without sacrificing the island's 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lien is generally seen as aloof. The charismatic Soong, by  
contrast, has immense grassroots support. As a provincial governor 
between 1995 and 1998, Soong allocated funds and visited remote 
areas to resolve local problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Soong has led Lien and the third candidate -- popular former  
Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic 
Progressive Party -- in every media poll so far. However, Lien's 
popularity has been rising.

	Turkey Death Toll Tops 11,000  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- As the death toll passed 11,000, rescue  
workers fearing the spread of disease began setting up tent cities 
and organizing food distribution today for the tens of thousands 
left homeless by Turkey's massive quake. The toll is expected to 
keep rising as crews tackle mountains of rubble where possibly tens 
of thousands of bodies are buried. Five people were rescued today, 
including a 95-year-old woman. But for each miracle survivor, 
hundreds more corpses are recovered. Officials worried about 
outbreaks of typhoid fever, cholera or dysentery sprayed 
disinfectants and distributed water purification tablets in 
hard-hit areas.

	CIA Cuts Ex-Spy Director's Clearance  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a highly unusual move, the CIA pulled the  
security clearances for former Director John Deutch, unwilling to 
excuse his violation of agency rules by keeping secret files on an 
unsecured home computer. A CIA spokesman said yesterday he knew of 
no precedent for the action taken against Deutch, a former deputy 
defense secretary who spent 38 years in public service before 
leaving the CIA in December 1996. The decision to suspend Deutch's 
security clearances was made by CIA Director George Tenet, Deutch's 
successor.

	U.S. Army Cop Allegedly Kills Boss  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A U.S. military policeman shot and  
killed his superior early today at a base near the North Korean 
border and was arrested eight hours later, the U.S. Military 
Command said. South Korean Police said they believe Jacob M. 
Bowley, a private from the 55th Military Police Company at Camp Red 
Cloud, north of Seoul, was drunk at the time. Bowley was angry with 
the sergeant because she ordered a blood test on one of his friends 
to determine whether he consumed alcohol while he was off the base 
without permission, said South Korea's national news agency.

	Russia Claims 100 Rebels Killed

<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russia's military command said today  
that its forces have killed up to 100 Muslim rebels in a single day 
of fighting in the southern area of Dagestan, but President Boris 
Yeltsin's spokesman warned radio listeners that it is ``impossible 
to expect a quick solution'' to the uprising. Meanwhile, Russian 
troops managed to capture strategic heights near two villages in 
Dagestan earlier seized by the guerrillas. Air raids continued 
through the day today, and some woods in the area were on fire, the 
Interior Ministry said.

	Malaysian Opposition Leader Cleared

	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- An opposition leader accused of  
criticizing Malaysia's judicial system was cleared of contempt 
charges today after the prosecution failed to prove he made the 
critical comments, which were published on the Internet. High Court 
Judge Ariffin Jaka dismissed the contempt charge against Chandra 
Muzaffar. Chandra is the deputy president of the opposition 
National Justice Party and a close ally of ousted deputy prime 
minister Anwar Ibrahim. Defense attorneys argued that the contempt 
action was flawed because prosecutors were relying on material from 
the Internet.

	Online Sale of Hitler Book Stopped  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- German media giant Bertelsmann has stopped selling  
Adolf Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' in its online bookstore, a spokesman 
said today. BOL International's German services never offered the 
book, but its British and French services did, company spokesman 
Christof Ehrhart said. He said those sales were ended this week to 
block Germans from buying the book. Under German law, books 
espousing Nazi philosophy are banned from display or sale. 
Bertelsmann has asked its U.S.-based Internet partner, 
barnesandnoble.com, not to ship banned Nazi titles to customers in 
Germany.

	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai veterinarians may have to amputate  
an elephant's leg up to the knee and fit the animal with a 
prosthesis after he stepped on a land mine in the jungles of 
neighboring Myanmar. The 38-year-old pachyderm, named Motola, 
walked on a land mine as he was foraging for food on the rugged 
Thai-Myanmar border during a break from hauling logs. Vets are 
administering jumbo-size doses of painkillers. They also plan to 
hoist up the three-ton elephant with a crane or pulley to take the 
weight off his foot.

unprecedented four gold medals and Maurice Greene opened his quest 
for a rare sprint double at the World Championships today, easily 
winning their first-round heats in the 100-meter dash. Jones also 
advanced to the final of the long jump. Jones, who is seeking gold 
medals in the 100, 200, long jump and relay, will run her 
second-round heat in the 100 later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Davis Loses Bid for Archery Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Actress Geena Davis lost her bid to be  
an Olympic archer, but she said she loves the challenge and will 
try again in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I did well. I was very happy,'' Davis said Saturday  
after finishing 24th out of 28 women competing in the U.S. Olympic 
trial semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 43, who made it to the semifinals just two years after  
taking her first archery lesson, finished 24th out of 28 
competitors. The top 16 archers advanced to Sunday's second. 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, Don Rabska, said she was having trouble adapting to  
the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough for us because we never get to practice in the rain  
in California,'' Rabska said. ``It caught her a little off guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also said the first serious media attention in her two  
years as an archer distracted her a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ill-prepared for this onslaught,'' she said. ``It was  
like being at a premier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star of ``Thelma and Louise'' and ``The Accidental Tourist''  
-- for which she won an Oscar in 1988 -- was inspired to take up 
archery after watching Justin Huish win two gold medals at the 1996 
Olympics in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people knew of Davis' hobby until she finished 29th out of  
300 women in Ohio to qualify for the Olympic semifinals. On 
Saturday, reporters blanketed this small suburban park along with 
about 40 movie fans who watched from behind a rope, hoping to catch 
a glimpse of the actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said she loves to challenge herself and wants to stay with  
archery ``to see how good I can get.'' She said she will try out 
for the Olympics again in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Dykman, 45, a 1996 Olympian, and Denise Parker, a two-time  
Olympian, were among the group to advance, while Huish was among 
the 16 men to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykman has shot with Davis in California and said she thinks the  
media attention has been a little distracting to the actress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've kept it pretty low-key for her, and this is the first  
time it's exploded for her like this,'' Dykman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others archery enthusiasts say Davis' participation is giving  
needed recognition to a little-known sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think archery, and they think hunting and  
stuff,'' said archer Jessica Carlson, 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The field of competitors will drop to eight by Monday; they will  
compete next month in California for three team spots and one 
alternate spot at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee officials knew of no other actor who has  
gone on to the Olympics, although some Olympic athletes, like 
swimmer Johnny Weismuller, went on to make movies.

<HEADLINE> KKK Rallies on Cleveland's Big Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Ku Klux Klan rallied downtown Saturday a  
few blocks from a black family expo and hours before the Cleveland 
Browns first home game since 1995. Klan members exchanged insults 
with counter-demonstrators, but no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 members of a KKK faction called the American Knights of  
the Ku Klux Klan paraded around in hooded robes and gave racist 
speeches for about 80 minutes outside a downtown court building. 
</P>
<P>
	The KKK, protected by a chain link fence and rows of riot  
police, was outnumbered by roughly 300 counter-demonstrators who 
chanted slogans and held up anti-Klan signs from their own 
fenced-in protest area. 
</P>
<P>
	The event capped weeks of political rancor as Mayor Michael R.  
White, who is black, was criticized for failing to try and block 
the rally. The mayor said he despises the white supremacist group 
but was legally obligated to uphold the KKK's right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also worries that the rally would disrupt the Black  
Family Expo, a cultural festival being held just a few blocks away. 
But a steady stream of people came to that event anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you have people who are doing a positive thing in the  
community,'' said Lynette Bennett, 25, who is black, as she visited 
exhibits and booths set up by local companies and nonprofit groups. 
``Out at the rally, they're trying to get a whole negative thing 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rally also had little effect on football fans. They began  
trickling downtown in the afternoon to see the Browns, who are 
ending a three-season hiatus from the National Football League this 
year, and were playing the first game in a new stadium Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Security at the KKK rally site was tight. About 600 police  
officers were deployed in the downtown area and streets were 
blocked off to traffic.

<HEADLINE> July Was Hot, but Not a Record Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It wasn't a record month, but for the many  
folks who remember July as hot and dry -- you're right. 
</P>
<P>
	In 105 years of recordkeeping, it was the seventh driest July on  
record in the Central and Southeast states and the ninth driest in 
the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time it was the seventh warmest July in the  
Northeast and 10th warmest in the East North Central region of the 
country, the National Climatic Data Center reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That will come as no surprise to gardeners and farmers watching  
the crops and flowers wilt on the stem. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, residents of the East North Central States  
sloshed through their third wettest July on record. 
</P>
<P>
	A regional breakdown of rainfall and temperature for July:  
</P>
<P>
	--Northeastern states (New England, New York, Pennsylvania, New  
Jersey, Maryland and Delaware) averaged just 2.73 inches of rain 
for the month, well below the normal 3.81 inches. The record July 
low was 2.02 inches in 1968 and the record high was 6.57 inches in 
1897. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperature averaged 72.2 degrees. Normal is 69.3. The warmest  
July was 1958 at 73.8 degrees and the coldest 1962 at 66.1. 
</P>
<P>
	--East North Central states (Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and  
Michigan) averaged had 5.31 inches of rainfall in July, much more 
than the normal 3.61 inches. The dryness record is 0.85 inches in 
1936 and the wettest July was 1993 with 6.13 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperature averaged 72.8 degrees, topping the 70.2 normal. The  
hottest July was 1936 with 76.2 degrees and the coldest was 1992 at 
64.0 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	--Central states (Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky,  
Tennessee and West Virginia) had 2.54 inches of rain, well below 
the 4.25 inches of a normal year. The record low was 1.47 inches 
set in 1930 while the record for wetness was 8.27 inches in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	Average temperature of 78.4 topped the normal 75.3 degrees but  
failed to reach 1901's record 81.2. The coldest July on record was 
1947 at 71.9 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	--Southeastern states (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,  
Georgia, Alabama and Florida) had 4.03 inches of rain, compared 
with the normal 5.56 inches. The record low is a mere 2.94 inches 
in 1983 while the wettest year was 1916 with a hefty 11.55 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The average temperature of 80.1 degrees beat the normal average  
of 78.6. But 1993 still is the warmest July on record at 82.7 and 
1947 is the coldest at 76.3. 
</P>
<P>
	--West North Central states (Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota,  
South Dakota and Nebraska) averaged 1.75 inches of rain, below the 
normal total of 2.02. The record low is 1917 with 0.84 inches and 
1993 was the wettest at 5.56 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The average temperature of 69.7 degrees was just above the  
normal 69.5. The record high is 77.4 in 1936 and the low was 62.7 
set in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
	--Southern states (Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas  
and Mississippi) had 2.13 inches of rain, compared with 3.03 inches 
in a normal year. But the record low is 1.34 inches in 1980 and the 
wettest July was 1950 with 6.04 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	July was warmer than normal at 81.7 degrees, topping the usual  
81.3. The hottest July on record is 1980 at 85.9 and the coldest, 
1906 at 78.0. 
</P>
<P>
	--Southwestern states (Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico).  
</P>
<P>
	Monsoonal rains made it a wetter than normal July with 2.32  
inches, topping the typical 1.83 inches. The wettest July was 1911 
at 3.51 inches and the driest was 1911 with 1.00 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The average temperature of 73.2 was a bit cooler than the 73.6  
normal. The hottest July was 75.9 degrees in 1901 and the coldest 
70.1 in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	--Northwestern states (Washington, Oregon and Idaho) had a dry  
month with an average rainfall of just 0.41 inches, below the 
normal 0.73. That did not approach the low record of 0.16 set in 
July, 1953, though. The wettest July was 1983 with 2.05 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	July was colder than usual with an average temperature of 64.8  
degrees compared to the normal 65.9. The record for cold was set in 
1993 at 58.9 and the hottest July was 1906 at 70.6. 
</P>
<P>
	--Western states (California and Nevada) had 0.33 inches of rain,  
a bit less than the normal average of 0.34 in this region. The 
wettest July was 1984 with 1.18 inches of rain and 1903 has the 
record for the driest July with no rain whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature was a little cooler than usual at 73.6, compared  
to a normal 73.8. The record low is 69.0 in July 1903 and the 
hottest July was 1931 at 78.2.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Thurmond OK After Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Strom Thurmond, the nation's longest  
serving U.S. senator, collapsed at a university reception and was 
briefly hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, 96, told reporters gathered outside Palmetto Baptist  
Medical Center in Columbia that he felt good. 
</P>
<P>
	But he appeared unsteady on his feet as he walked to his car  
Friday evening, two hours after he was brought to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond was admitted after collapsing at a reception for a  
federal magistrate at the University of South Carolina, Thurmond 
spokesman John DeCrosta said. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina Republican had complained of being dizzy and  
overheated but never lost consciousness, DeCrosta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond was expected to attend a wedding today in Charleston,  
said state Sen. John Courson, a friend of Thurmond's. 
</P>
<P>
	First elected to the Senate in 1954, Thurmond became the oldest  
person to serve in the Senate at age 93. At age 94 he became the 
longest-serving senator ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond has been hospitalized briefly several times in recent  
years, including for a day in Washington after he became dizzy 
during a Promise Keepers rally in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That December, Thurmond spent several days in a military  
hospital for a respiratory infection and earlier that year he spent 
several days at a hospital in Washington recovering from the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	He often boasts of his good health and won favorable reviews for  
being alert and attentive while he served as the Senate's president 
pro tem during this year's hearings into the impeachment of 
President Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Pawtucket's Martinez Feels No Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) -- Ramon Martinez allowed six runs and six  
hits, including three home runs, in five innings in a 
rehabilitation start for the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news for Martinez was that he retired seven of the last  
eight batters he faced and felt no pain in his surgically-repaired 
right shoulder against the Buffalo Bisons. Buffalo won 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Los Angeles Dodger standout said he was nonetheless  
encouraged with his first start above the Single-A level in 14 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine. I'm making a lot of progress,'' said Martinez,  
who underwent rotator cuff surgery on his right shoulder in June 
1998 while with the Dodgers and has not pitched in the major 
leagues since. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I feel is a good thing. My location wasn't real  
consistent, but the last couple innings it was much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, 2-0 with a 2.00 ERA in eight rehab starts at Class-A,  
threw 77 pitches, 46 for strikes. He struck out three and walked 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez had an easy first inning, walking one batter. But the  
31-year-old right-hander gave up six runs and five hits in the 
second and third innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``My location was off in the those middle two innings,''  
Martinez said. ``That's the way it always was for me in the big 
leagues. It always takes me a while to get focused in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez finished strongly, retiring seven of the last eight  
batters he faced. He escaped the third inning with a groundout, 
pitched a 1-2-3 fourth inning and gave up an infield single to lead 
off the sixth inning before retiring the side on two strikeouts and 
a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was off in those two middle innings, but I found my location  
in the last couple innings and that's what I'm going to take away 
from this game,'' said Martinez, 123-77 with 3.45 ERA in 11 seasons 
with Los Angeles before signing with Boston in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez's velocity in his struggling second and third innings  
topped out at 86 miles per hour, according to scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'll ever throw 95 again like I could,''  
Martinez said. ``Maybe I can get up to 90 or 92. But you don't have 
to throw 95 to pitch in the big leagues, you have to have 
location.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston has been hoping to have Martinez join his younger  
brother, Pedro, on the Red Sox's roster for the stretch run of the 
regular season. Martinez said the goal remains very much in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I need one more start down here and then I'll be  
ready,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Keeps Eye on Foreign Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fruit growers cried foul when the government  
recently decided to ban one pesticide that they use and restrict 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	They fear foreign growers will keep spraying the chemicals on  
produce they ship to the United States, giving them an advantage 
over American producers who may have to use more expensive 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	But government officials say imported produce is just as safe as  
domestic varieties and that they won't let foreign producers get 
around U.S. restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll certainly be taking action against firms, whether  
domestic or imported, that aren't following the rules,'' said Terry 
Troxell, who is in charge of enforcing pesticide standards for the 
Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspections by FDA and the Agriculture Department seldom find  
violations of U.S. pesticide limits on either domestic or imported 
varieties, and in some cases, foreign produce even has fewer 
chemicals on it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, FDA found pesticide residue on 58 percent of the  
domestic fruit and 36 percent of the imported fruit it sampled. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 1 percent of the domestic fruit and 2.9 percent of the  
imported had residues that exceeded limits set by the Environmental 
Protection Agency. Officials say such violations are often minor 
and inadvertent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very rare that the imports have a worse pesticide problem  
than domestic produce,'' said Edward Groth, a scientist for 
Consumers Union, the research organization that publishes Consumer 
Reports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers Union analyzed four years of USDA inspection data,  
from 1994 to 1997, and found that pesticide residues varied widely 
depending on the year and the type of produce that was tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic peaches, apples, pears and green beans all had higher  
pesticide levels than imported varieties. Imports were higher when 
it came to Chilean grapes, Canadian and Mexican carrots, Mexican 
broccoli and tomatoes, Argentinian and Hungarian apple juice and 
Brazilian orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
	The study said U.S. peaches had 10 times the level of toxicity  
as Chilean peaches, largely because the domestic variety tested 
positive for methyl parathion, the chemical the EPA recently said 
it will ban from use on fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Traces of methyl parathion were found on U.S. apples in 1994,  
1995 and 1996 and on domestic grapes in 1994 and 1995. The chemical 
didn't show up on any apples imported from New Zealand or any of 
the Mexican grapes brought in during those years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to banning methyl parathion, EPA also is requiring  
growers to cut back on use of azinphos-methyl, which is used on 80 
percent of the nation's apples and a variety of other crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups contend that methyl parathion and other chemicals  
break down so quickly after they are applied that inspectors often 
can't find them. 
</P>
<P>
	But FDA officials say their inspection techniques allow them to  
catch minute traces of chemicals well after they are sprayed. 
Methyl parathion can be detected in amounts of 10 parts per billion 
-- 100 to 200 times below existing limits for the pesticide, 
according to FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA inspects fruits and vegetables as they are trucked  
across the border or shipped from domestic producers, while USDA 
tests produce the way consumers would use it at home, whether 
peeled, cooked or served whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups said there was no sound scientific basis for  
restricting either methyl parathion or azinphos-methyl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that foreign food is less safe. It's a fairness issue  
to growers,'' said Adam Sharp, director of agricultural chemical 
issues for the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA was acting under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, which  
requires it to evaluate tolerances for 10,000 pesticide uses. The 
law was intended to make sure there is a sufficient safety factor 
for chemicals ingested by children.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Remembers Courting Hillary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- As the president told it, it was a long  
ago love story he didn't want to be a part of so he just decided to 
walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Clinton, a law student at Yale University, had just broken  
up with a girlfriend and was on the rebound when he saw fellow 
student Hillary Rodham. 
</P>
<P>
	``And she was an interesting, compelling looking woman, so I  
followed her out of this class,'' Clinton told an audience at a 
dinner Friday on Nantucket Island that reportedly raised $100,000 
for his wife's expected run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I got right behind her and I said, 'No, this is nothing  
but trouble.' And I turned around and walked off. Didn't say a word 
to her. And then I kind of stalked her around the law school for 
two or three weeks, and I'd say, 'No, this is nothing but trouble,' 
and I'd walk off,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton later explained on Air Force One as it flew over the  
island toward his vacation headquarters on Martha's Vineyard, the 
``trouble'' he feared was romantic involvement at a time when he 
had just regained his independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I would fall in love with her, and I didn't want to  
fall in love,'' he told reporters, adding that he sensed it might 
just happen. ``Turned out to be right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story of the Clintons' courtship and its aftermath has been  
told many times. But Clinton recounted it again, with unusual and 
enthusiastic detail, for the 100 or so diners gathered around the 
swimming pool of a Nantucket estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had wandered to the rear of the plane to discuss his  
vacation with the press when a reporter's question prompted him to 
elaborate on his public musings about his love affair with Hillary. 
She stayed in the plane's forward cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no mention of whispered and admitted affairs  
during more than two decades of marriage or the impeachment trial 
grounded in Clinton's extramarital relationship with former White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton focused entirely on his ties with his future wife.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the romantic standoff came to a head in the Yale Library  
as he was resisting another student's attempts to recruit him for 
the university's law journal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton was distracted. ``All the time I'm staring at  
Hillary who is at the other end of the room, with a book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So in the middle of this guy's passionate entreaty for me to  
join the law journal, Hillary slams down the book and she walks 
across the library and says, 'Look, you have been staring at me for 
weeks -- and I've been staring back. So at least we ought to know 
each other's name.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't remember my name,'' the president said to laughter.  
</P>
<P>
	At the fund-raiser, he explained why she should succeed retiring  
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a state where 
neither one has ever lived. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1973, he and Hillary had dated for two years and the  
question arose as to whether she would follow him home to Arkansas 
or pursue a career amid the big city lights of Chicago or New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I wanted her to go with me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He added that he was ambivalent because he regarded her as  
someone with an ``enormous potential for public service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so afraid that I was taking away from her life and from  
this country the most gifted person I had ever known up to that 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I still haven't met anyone I thought was as gifted,'' the  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast forward to 1993 as Clinton and his wife prepare to leave  
the Arkansas governor's mansion and move into the White House. He 
asked her to decide what they would do and where they would go when 
his presidency ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so all she is really doing today is what I thought, for  
the benefit of the country and for the development of her own 
potential for service, maybe she should have been able to do in 
1973,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very glad she didn't do it then, and very glad she is  
doing it today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady, who stood beside her husband, made the most of  
his endorsement, saying she was eagerly ``pursuing the 
opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> New York Video Piracy Ring Busted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Video pirates offering current film titles  
including, ``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' and 
``Bowfinger'' saw the curtain fall on their operation last week, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police announced Friday that they have seized nearly 30,000  
counterfeit videotapes -- worth at least $150,000 -- and arrested 11 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring allegedly was run out of a warehouse in Brooklyn, where  
the copies were made, and a luggage storefront in Manhattan. Using 
hundreds of videocassette recorders, the ring was capable of 
producing 500 bootleg cassettes every two hours, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the tapes been sold on the street, they would have cost the  
movie industry $1.5 million in lost ticket sales at theaters and 
future video sales and rentals, Police Commissioner Howard Safir 
said.

<HEADLINE> Faldo Not Part of Ryder Cup Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Nick Faldo is being left off this year's  
Ryder Cup team, ending his streak of 11 straight appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Team captain Mark James told Faldo, whose 11 appearances and 23  
match wins are Ryder Cup records, that he wouldn't be a wild-card 
selection when the European side is announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bumped into Mark in the hotel last night and asked him -- he  
said I was too far down the ladder,'' said a dejected Faldo, who 
had openly campaigned to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, with six major championships, has played in every Ryder  
Cup since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, the 19-year-old Faldo beat Tom Watson in his match  
when the American was widely regarded as the world's best golfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie, Europe's top golfer of the 1990s, said Faldo  
should be on the team that faces the United States on Sept. 24-26 
in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team that plays in Brookline will be weaker without  
Nick,'' Montgomerie said. ``I would pick him, yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two golfers are playing the BMW Open, where European players  
are scrambling to qualify for the 12-man team. 
</P>
<P>
	While Montgomerie leads the Ryder Cup points list, Faldo has  
fallen out of the top 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo was angry that James didn't inform him he had no chance  
when the two were at the PGA Championship last week, saying he 
wouldn't have played the BMW as a last-ditch effort to save his Cup 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have done with a week off,'' said Faldo, 42, who  
believes his experience would help a European team that could have 
six rookies on it. 
</P>
<P>
	In perhaps his most memorable Ryder Cup match, Faldo beat Curtis  
Strange in 1995 for the key victory that lifted Europe past the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans Bernhard Langer and Ian Woosnam, key players on the  
teams that beat the United States in the last two competitions, are 
considered leading wild-card candidates this year.

<HEADLINE> New College Football Season Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lou shows up in Columbia, John Robinson in Vegas and it's June  
Jones in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Williams leaves, Ricky Williams stays.  
</P>
<P>
	Peter Warrick and Ron Dayne thought about leaving, wound up  
staying and now they're Heisman Trophy hotshots. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Jackson retires from ABC, Keith Jackson returns to ABC,  
but only in a regional sort of way. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite Auburn's best efforts to mess up a historic  
occasion, there will be a Bowden vs. Bowden matchup after all, 
giving college football its first father-son coaching showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The final season of the century looks to be a mosaic of  
fascinating vignettes rather than one overriding theme. Yet in the 
end, the same two teams that faced off in the Fiesta Bowl for the 
'98 national title could very well meet again for the '99 
championship in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's Bobby Bowden could care less about the  
preliminaries. The 69-year-old coach is ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get it on,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles open the season with the No. 1 ranking, while  
defending national champion Tennessee starts at No. 2. The Vols 
defeated the Seminoles 23-16 for their first national title since 
1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are loaded again, with the Seminoles boasting  
Warrick, who would have been a top NFL draft pick but wanted 
another chance to go out a champion. Also returning is a healthy 
Chris Weinke, back from a late-season neck injury, as well as seven 
starters from the nation's top-rated defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Vols coach Phillip Fulmer, who now makes $1 million a year after  
receiving a hefty raise, has 13 starters returning, including 
quarterback Tee Martin and a healthy Jamal Lewis, the talented 
tailback who missed much of last season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we said after the championship game was a  
prayer,'' Fulmer said. ``It went `Lord, let us stay hungry and 
humble.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On the day Lou Holtz arrived at South Carolina, more than 4,000  
fans greeted the former Notre Dame coach at Williams-Brice Stadium. 
Lou-mania was under way for a team coming off a 1-10 season -- its 
worst in 105 years of playing football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we'll win here,'' the 62-year-old Holtz said of a  
program with just one bowl victory. ``I just can't tell you when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Robinson resurfaces at UNLV two years after he was fired by  
Southern California. His mission, as well as June Jones' at Hawaii, 
is familiar -- win. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be easy for either former NFL coach. Hawaii has the  
nation's longest losing streak at 18 games; UNLV is right behind 
with 16 losses in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Another former NFL coach, Dennis Erickson, takes over at Oregon  
State, which is looking for its first winning season since 1970. 
Erickson, fired by the Seattle Seahawks, succeeded in college 
before, leading Miami to national titles in 1989 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 20 Division I-A teams open the season with new coaches.  
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, the Longhorns are without Heisman Trophy winner Ricky  
Williams, but they do have an ace of a quarterback in Major 
Applewhite (psst ... he better be good because freshman whiz Chris 
Simms -- Phil's son -- is waiting in the wings). At Texas Tech, 
though, the other Ricky Williams is back for his senior season 
after running for 1,582 yards and 13 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was probably asked about Texas' Ricky Williams at least once  
per interview,'' Tech's Williams said. ``It wold be nice for him to 
be mistaken for me someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Warrick, Wisconsin's Great Dayne passed on the pros and  
takes another crack at the Heisman. The 253-pound tailback needs 
1,717 yards to become the major-college career rushing leader, 
breaking the record set last season by the Longhorns' Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd like to break that rushing record and if he wins the  
Heisman Trophy, that's great,'' Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez said. 
``But his first goal will be to win the football game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Fiesta Bowl ended, Jackson said farewell to his TV  
audience, and the longtime voice of college football was set to 
ride off into retirement. But he's back, calling Pac-10 games 
exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle of the Bowdens came about by chance. With Terry  
Bowden still at Auburn, the Tigers and Seminoles agreed to open the 
'99 season with father vs. son. But Terry Bowden resigned under 
strange circumstances early last season, and Auburn bought its way 
out of the game for $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bobby Bowden's other coaching son, Tommy, led Tulane  
to an 11-0 season and was hired by Clemson, immediately setting up 
Bobby vs. Tommy on Oct. 23. In addition, if Florida State comes 
into Death Valley undefeated, Bobby Bowden will be going for career 
win No. 300. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the players will be hyped up more than my father and  
I,'' Tommy Bowden says. ``I'll just have to deal with the old 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State coach Joe Paterno has another topnotch team as he  
begins his 34th season as coach. The defense features no less than 
four potential All-Americans -- linebackers LaVar Arrington and 
Brandon Short, cornerback David Macklin and end Courtney Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame's Bob Davie returns knowing full well that four of  
his predecessors -- Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian, Dan Devine and 
Holtz -- won national titles in their third season as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The top three picks in the '99 NFL draft were quarterbacks -- Tim  
Couch, Donovan McNabb and Akili Smith. Daunte Culpepper and Cade 
McNown also went in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry, there are plenty of stars ready to step in,  
starting with Drew Brees of Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees threw for 3,983 yards and 39 TDs in leading the  
Boilermakers to an 8-4 season, including a 37-34 win over Kansas 
State in the Alamo Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Other top quarterbacks to keep an eye on include Joe Hamilton of  
Georgia Tech (2,166 yards, 17 TDs); Chris Redman of Louisville 
(4,042 yards, 29 TDs); the Vols' Martin (2,164 yards, 19 TDs); and 
Chad Pennington of Marshall (3,830 yards, 28 TDs). 
</P>
<P>
	The season opens next weekend with a pair of major games --  
Arizona at Penn State in the Pigskin Classic and Miami vs. Ohio 
State in the Kickoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of the Mobile Alabama Bowl, the postseason now  
has 23 bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo and Middle Tennessee State join the big leagues,  
boosting Division I-A to 114 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bowl Championship Series enters its second year after a  
mostly successful debut in selecting the teams to play in a 
national title game. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS standings are determined through four factors: a  
combined ranking in The Associated Press media poll and USA 
Today/ESPN coaches' poll; computer surveys; strength of schedule; 
and won-loss record. One difference this season is that eight 
computer ratings will be used instead of three.

<HEADLINE> New Plan Offered To Woo NFL to LA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Another plan has been offered to help bring  
the NFL to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa urged Gov. Gray Davis'  
former football representative on Friday to consider a plan in 
which the state would help pay for new parking structures around 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous plan proposed that parking revenues be used to pay  
back the $150 million in bonds issued to build the parking 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
	But National Football League owners have balked at the proposal,  
saying it would deprive the team of a large amount of income. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plan -- suggested by investment counseling firm Saybrook  
Capital -- would allow the team's owners to keep the parking 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The city would instead be reimbursed for the bonds by additional  
taxes generated by the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Chadwick, who submitted his resignation earlier this month  
as the governor's representative over conflicts with the league's 
demand for public funding, said he was skeptical of the new parking 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to think about this some more, about the impact on the  
state. That's what I told the speaker and the governor,'' Chadwick 
said. ``We can do this in a way that it doesn't cost the state 
anything, but it would not be profitable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Villaraigosa said he wants an audit of the new proposal to  
ensure the public won't end up paying for the parking structures 
without being reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line for all us elected is that it be at no  
taxpayer cost. We want to make sure the taxpayers are protected and 
the best way to do that is to have an independent audit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to win a franchise for the Coliseum has faltered in  
recent weeks, since the NFL expressed concerns that the state was 
unwilling to provide sufficient public funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has set Sept. 15 as the deadline for its decision.  
</P>
<P>
	The league has not yet seen the new proposal, and declined to  
comment on its specifications, NFL executive vice president Roger 
Goodell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is that we are working as hard as we can to put  
something together for Los Angeles,'' Goodell said. ``And we will 
continue to focus on that until (the deadline).''

	Turkey's Dead Could Rise to 40,000  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The official death toll from Turkey's  
earthquake stands at more than 12,000, but a member of the U.N. 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said it could 
possibly rise as high as 40,000. As hopes dim that more survivors 
will be found, authorities refocused their efforts on providing 
shelter for hundreds of thousands of people left homeless. Most of 
the 30,000 still missing are presumed to be trapped beneath rubble. 
Experts say people in such situations usually can survive only 72 
hours because of dehydration, or early yesterday in this case.

	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- People were given until sunup tomorrow  
to get off South Padre Island as Hurricane Bret took aim at the 
southern tip of Texas and neighboring Mexico. Coastal residents 
today stocked up at gasoline pumps and grocery stores, and building 
supply stores were overrun with customers wanting plywood, nails, 
flashlights and generators. Officials of popular South Padre Island 
ordered all 2,100 residents to pack and leave by 6 a.m. tomorrow. 
By this afternoon, Bret was located about 210 miles southeast of

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal investigators reportedly raided the Wall  
Street office of the Bank of New York in connection to a major 
international money-laundering scheme that authorities say involves 
the Russian mob. During Friday's raid, investigators seized the 
files of Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a senior vice president who 
supervised the bank's East European division, a source close to the 
bank told The New York Times in today's editions. As much as $10 
billion allegedly was laundered through the bank in what 
investigators say is an operation run by Russian organized crime,

	Yugoslav Opposition Showing Cracks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Efforts to unseat Slobodan Milosevic  
were set back when an opposition leader denounced rivals in the 
movement and said his followers would boycott joint rallies aimed 
at forcing the Yugoslav president to step down. Vuk Draskovic, head 
of the Serbian Renewal Movement, accused another opposition group 
led by Zoran Djindjic of pushing the country to civil war by 
refusing offers of early elections to end the political crisis that 
followed the 78-day NATO bombing campaign. Draskovic wants to 
accept the Milosevic government's offer of early elections this 
fall. Djindjic insists that Milosevic step down immediately and 
make way for a transitional government.

	Domenici Says Citizens Have Overpaid

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republicans' $792 billion package of tax  
cuts is the party's way of refunding money that citizens have 
overpaid, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici said 
today. A projected surplus over the next decade would leave $1.5 
trillion to give back to taxpayers, even after most of the money is 
reserved to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, the New 
Mexican Republican said in the party's weekly radio address.

	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Congo's third-largest town is now  
controlled by Rwandan troops who clashed with their Ugandan allies 
early this week, a Ugandan newspaper reported today. The 
government-owned New Vision newspaper said most of Kisangani was 
under Rwandan control except for the largest hotel, the Palm Beach. 
Rwanda says it has supported Congolese rebels to help root out 
Rwandan Hutu extremists fighting alongside Congolese President 
Laurent Kabila and who helped carry out the genocide of at least 
500,000 Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus in 1994.

	Younger Japanese Seek New Paths

	TOKYO (AP) -- A growing number of young people in Japan are  
trading the security of doing things by the book -- no questions 
asked -- for a much riskier venture: playing by their own rules. 
Teens are taking time out from nonstop studying to volunteer with 
the elderly or handicapped. Twentysomethings are giving up the 
safety of established corporations for the freedom of founding new 
companies. Studies say that even those taking the accepted path to 
success are putting more emphasis on getting jobs in fields they 
are interested in, despite less pay and prestige.

	Cubs Top Rockies With 2 Sosa Homers  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his major-league leading 50th and  
51st home runs today for his second two-homer game in as many days 
to lead the Chicago Cubs to an 8-6 victory over the Colorado 
Rockies. Sosa became the fourth player ever to post consecutive 
50-homer seasons, joining Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr. and Babe 
Ruth. And for the second straight year, Sosa hit Nos. 50 and 51 on 
the same day -- only this year it came after 121 games, nine games 
earlier than in 1998. Sosa now leads Mark McGwire by three home 
runs.

<HEADLINE> French Farmers Block McDonald's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Angry farmers dumped peaches and manure in front of  
McDonald's outlets Saturday in southern France to protest U.S. 
trade sanctions and the increasing domination of multinational 
agricultural corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions were the latest in a two-week campaign by farmers  
that has resulted in the arrest of five protesters charged with 
vandalizing a McDonald's restaurant under construction in central 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters driving tractors dumped tons of manure in front of a  
McDonald's early Saturday in Arles. The farmers are asking 
McDonald's to drop charges against the five farmers arrested last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, 100 farmers in the southwestern town of Montauban  
dumped peaches in front of a McDonald's and a large supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
	France's farmer's union, the Confederation Paysanne, has called  
for a wave of demonstrations at McDonald's restaurants to protest 
U.S. sanctions on a slew of products, ranging from Roquefort cheese 
to foie gras. The sanctions were slapped on European goods in 
retaliation to the European Union's decision to ban imports of U.S. 
hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	``Globalization is creating absurd economic conflicts,'' the  
union said in a statement, adding that the protests aim to ``allow 
farmers and others to feed themselves as they think best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers say they are targeting McDonald's as a symbol of  
globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, 400 fruit and vegetable growers blocked access to  
a supermarket and a McDonald's in Martigues. 
</P>
<P>
	The growers are complaining that French supermarkets are  
crushing their profits by paying low prices for their produce.

<HEADLINE> South Carolina Guard Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina guard Kevin Rivers will  
likely miss the rest of the season after injuring his knee in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel terrible for Kevin,'' coach Lou Holtz said Saturday.  
``I've never felt this bad. It was another foolish injury. We're 
not scrimmaging, not going live, but somebody gets out of position, 
falls on his knee when he's standing up. Until you become sound, 
these things seem to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who started eight of the Gamecocks' 11 games last season  
as a freshman, is the fifth lineman South Carolina has lost to 
injury. Tackles Melvin Page and Jason Cox have missed most of this 
week's practices with knee injuries, Cedric Williams is out with a 
shoulder injury and Kevin Johnson is out with a bruised calf. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz said he might have to move a tight end to tackle to shore  
up the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're so thin and now we lose Rivers. How many have we lost,  
and that was a problem to begin with?'' he said. ``When you're in a 
hole, stop digging. We've got to stop digging.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Billionaire May Buy Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- According to two NFL owners, Kirk Kerkorian, the  
owner of the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, has expressed an 
interest in buying the New York Jets, The New York Times reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	One owner, who was not identified by the Times, said the chances  
for Kerkorian, 82, to successfully buy the team are ``good if he 
really wants them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Potential owners can make a bid and those bids will be presented  
to the estate of former owner Leon Hess, which will accept the 
highest or most agreeable offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, in his will, barred any member of his family from  
participating in the team's future, ``either directly or 
indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever.'' Hess died in May at age 
85. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess' estate hired the investment firm Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Company  
to handle the sale. Financial experts have said that the Jets could 
be sold for $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerkorian is one of the richest men in the world, according to  
Forbes Magazine, with an estimated net worth of $3.8 billion. He 
built the Trans International Airline charter service following 
World War II and sold it in 1968 for $104 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to receive a prospectus book from Goldman, Sachs.  
</P>
<P>
	Other potential bidders for the team are real estate developer  
Samuel J. LeFrak, New York Mets co-owner Nelson Doubleday, New 
Jersey Devils owner John McMullen and Cablevision chairman Charles 
Dolan.

<HEADLINE> Radio Shaped Communications Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- On an otherwise unremarkable late October evening  
in 1938, many Americans relaxed at home, doing what they had become 
accustomed to since broadcasting had become popular a couple of 
decades earlier: They listened to radio. It was the Mercury 
Theatre's live broadcast of a concert from New York's Park Plaza 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	No one expected the urgent news flash.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program of dance music  
to bring you a special bulletin from the Intercontinental Radio 
News. At 20 minutes before 8 Central Time, Professor Farrell of the 
Mount Jennings Observatory, Chicago, Illinois, reports observing 
several explosions of incandescent gas occurring at regular 
intervals on the planet Mars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the next couple of hours, listeners across the country  
remained transfixed, some panicked, as details poured out of the 
radio about the Martian landing in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens Pomeroy, a grade-school boy at the time, remembers hearing  
the announcer talking to Professor Pierson about the rocket in the 
sky and the spaceship landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom got really upset,'' recalled Pomeroy, who now lives in  
Baltimore. His father, though, was immediately skeptical. ``Now if 
this is the real thing, it should be on the other stations,'' he 
said, and quickly scanned the dial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lo and behold,'' said Pomeroy, ``we heard Charlie McCarthy  
coming to us over the good old NBC Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Pomeroys and millions of others, it was a relief when  
Orson Welles' chilling broadcast of ``The War of the Worlds'' was 
revealed as fiction -- but it also reminded them of the awesome 
power of radio. 
</P>
<P>
	In this age of information overload, it's easy to overlook the  
grandparent of 20th century mass communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The clunky device that in its early days resembled a homemade  
science project filled with tubes and wires. The primitive tuner 
that people would fiddle to pick up a scratchy broadcast of ``Amos 
'n' Andy'' or a president's speech. The simple yet powerful 
precursor to television and the Internet. This was radio, which 
became the foundation on which the information revolution was 
built. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the legacies radio has established:  
</P>
<P>
	-- THE VOICE OF AUTHORITY: Radio's reach and power were such that  
anything heard over the airwaves was considered to be fact, said 
Chuck Howell, the curator of the Library of American Broadcasting 
at the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of it was that voice of authority -- this was something  
that did come into your home,'' said Howell. ``It was so glamorous 
and so high-culture -- radio had a real cachet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radio's assumed authority was a primary reason why the ``War of  
the Worlds'' resulted in a panic in some areas, with thousands of 
people contacting police -- even though newspapers had printed 
notice of it in their broadcast listings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lest one think that Welles' hoax was a unique experience that  
could not be repeated today, consider the effect the mass media 
still have on the average person. 
</P>
<P>
	One example: About a year ago, securities analyst Ralph  
Acampora, noted for his bullish attitude toward the stock market, 
made a pronouncement on the CNBC cable television network that the 
stock market run was over. The market, which had been struggling 
all day, promptly plunged as traders and investors across the 
country, independent of one another but reacting as one, sold 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	-- THE LOSS OF BOUNDARIES: Radio connected people over vast  
distances, enhancing a sense of regional or national unity. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, of course, we take for granted the eroding of boundaries  
that has been carried much farther by the Internet. But it was not 
always this way. 
</P>
<P>
	One radio pioneer, Fay Gillis Wells, described how she and her  
husband used to travel in the late 1930s doing a show called ``The 
Magic of RCA'' to help promote the wonders of short-wave radio. 
Sixty years ago, it was still astonishing that someone could speak 
in Los Angeles and be heard in New York almost instantaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would always have to synchronize watches ... so when they  
wanted him to speak at 2:17, he'd start,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did radio shrink the distances between people, it  
helped to bring them together. In the throes of the Depression in 
the early 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt began using regular 
broadcasts as a forum, and families gathered around the radio to 
listen. ``My dear friends ...,'' he would start each Fireside Chat 
before going on to explain the latest details of his New Deal. 
</P>
<P>
	-- INFORMATION, NOW: In a century of impatience and speed, radio  
allowed people to get the news immediately, rather than having to 
wait hours or days for the local daily or weekly newspaper. It 
became an invaluable propaganda tool, leaping enemy lines during 
World War II, slipping behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 2, 1920, Pittsburgh station KDKA announced that Warren  
Harding had won the presidential election in what is considered the 
first-ever commercial broadcast. From presidential elections to 
ball scores, radio news gathering progressed, relating key news 
events as they happened. Events such as the Hindenburg disaster in 
1937 showcased the medium in all its glory, a precursor to today's 
live TV news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC newsman Herbert Morrison was on the scene that day. ``Here  
it comes, ladies and gentlemen, and what a sight it is, a thrilling 
one, a marvelous sight. ... Oh, oh, oh. ... It's burst into flames. 
... It is burning, bursting into flames and is falling. ... Oh! ... 
This is one of the worst ... Oh! It's a terrible sight ... Oh! the 
humanity...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radio news broadcasting perhaps reached its apex during the  
coverage of World War II. While World War I was fought through the 
antiseptic pages of the country's newspapers, the brutality and 
atrocity of the Nazis' march across Europe was brought to life 
through radio by the compelling reporting of correspondents such as 
H.V. Kaltenborn, Edward R. Murrow and Eric Sevareid. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Michaels, a former CNN anchor, said listening to the  
wartime broadcasts on WEAF with his family was always compelling. 
``There was something about the voice on the radio that was 
extremely dramatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the added drama wasn't necessary. He was in  
Philadelphia when the Japanese surrender was announced over the 
radio, Michaels said. ``The family just went nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- THE POWER TO ENTERTAIN: Much of early broadcasting consisted  
of radio manufacturers' sometimes desperate efforts to fill air 
time so people would want to buy a radio to listen. Gradually, 
however, entertainers cultivated followings, helped tremendously by 
the introduction of network radio. Led by the National Broadcasting 
Company and Columbia Broadcasting System, the networks broadcast 
the same show everywhere in the nation at once. 
</P>
<P>
	People would make time to hear shows such as ``Our Gal Sunday''  
and ``The Goldbergs,'' just as people decades later carved out time 
to watch ``Seinfeld'' each week, said Susan Smulyan, an associate 
professor in the Department of American Civilization at Brown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could get professional quality entertainment without  
leaving the house,'' said Smulyan. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most popular shows of the late 1920s and early '30s,  
``Amos 'n' Andy,'' starred Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, two 
white men playing two black men in slapstick roles that offend 
modern sensibilities but were so popular then that more than half 
the listening public tuned in for the 15-minute show every evening. 
Restaurants stopped serving for that quarter hour; some movie 
theaters interrupted the film and piped the radio program into the 
cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just comedy and music that were popular. Horror and  
drama serials drew listeners back to the radio each week to hear 
the latest adventure of The Shadow or The Lone Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly who gets credit as radio's inventor is subject to  
debate, though a device patented in England in 1896 by Guglielmo 
Marconi became the most commercially successful. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of 1930, 12 million American households, or 40  
percent, had radios. A decade later, 35 million households, or 80 
percent, had a radio. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was no longer the only show in town. TV technology  
existed in the 1930s, but had not been able to flourish due to the 
prohibitive costs and the lack of television facilities through 
which to transmit the signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, however, with the end of World War II, the networks -- now  
three, with American Broadcasting Company taking over one of NBC's 
networks -- faced a choice: Continue investing money in radio, or 
start spending money on TV -- which offered everything radio had 
plus pictures. It was an easy decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Many entertainers liked the new medium, which allowed them much  
more leeway on how to perform. No longer were families gathering 
around the radio for the early evening drama -- now it was the TV 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the TV came into the house, the big Atwater Kent (radio)  
got relegated to the basement and was never heard from again,'' 
said Michaels, who worked as a page at NBC during the transition 
period. ``We still had network shows, but all the stress was on 
television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Age of Radio was nearing an end. But rather than  
dying out, radio reinvented itself, evolving to a localized format 
and filling the airtime with everything from rock 'n' roll to 
today's ranting talk shows. It's now a $15 billion industry, 
according to Radio Business Report. 
</P>
<P>
	With nearly 12,500 stations licensed by the Federal  
Communications Commission in the United States as the century nears 
a close, radio today is as big as ever, though different now. 
</P>
<P>
	Software such as RealAudio allows people to use their computers  
to listen to radio stations across the world. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum of listening experience, rival  
sports teams in small towns use the local radio station to make 
ironic song dedications to the opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like radio's ability to foster community and make people  
feel connected,'' said Smulyan, who heard some of those musical 
raspberries during a visit to Texas. ``It can bring different 
people together -- people who have lots in common, and people who 
have nothing in common.''

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Speaks to Youth Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Heavyweight boxing champion Evander  
Holyfield visited a center for young offenders and urged them to be 
proud of their roots, no matter how humble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not ashamed to tell people I came from the ghettos,'' said  
Holyfield, who was raised in an Atlanta housing project. ``It's not 
where you're at, it's where you're going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Friday at the Montgomery County Youth Detention Center,  
the seriousness was broken when one orange-jumpsuit-clad youth 
asked Holyfield about the ear-biting in his second fight with Mike 
Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Tyson bit both of his ears ``out of frustration,'' but  
he refused to ``bite back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to kick him, but I didn't,'' he said, tugging on his  
right ear and smiling. ``In the end, I made $35 million and (Tyson) 
lost $3 million and had to go to prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield was in Montgomery as part of a fundraising tour for  
The United Way.

<HEADLINE> Drought Drives Some Out of Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Drought ran Earl and Bobby Rogers out of  
the cattle business last week. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending years building their beef herd in eastern  
Kentucky, the brothers are being forced to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out of water. Out of pasture, too. Don't have enough hay  
to carry 'em,'' Earl Rogers, of Owingsville, said Thursday. ``You 
work eight or 10 years to get your brood stock up the way you want 
it, then something like this happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers are not alone -- livestock auctions are booming  
throughout the drought-stricken East. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Goolman has been putting in 20-hour days hauling livestock  
to markets in central Kentucky. ``Farmers are calling and begging 
for trailers,'' said Goolman, of Winchester. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't feed them, you can't keep them,'' said Everett  
Willoughby, who plans to sell 20 of his 70 dairy cows. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with trying to manage herds they no longer can feed, many  
farmers also are faced with grain, vegetable and tobacco crops that 
have been ravaged by dry weather. Drought-related losses to date 
total at least $1 billion, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Supermarket shoppers, however, will hardly notice, especially at  
major chains that buy produce on a national market, USDA Chief 
Economist Keith Collins said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest of the nation has such plentiful crops, and we had  
ample supplies to begin with,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the milk supply isn't affected because the areas of top  
production -- California and the upper Midwest -- have escaped the 
drought, said Chris Galen, a spokesman for the dairy lobbying group 
National Milk in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Drought has most seriously affected New England, the eastern  
Corn Belt and middle Atlantic states. Five entire states -- 
Kentucky, West Virginia, Delaware, Massachusetts and South Carolina 
-- have been declared disaster areas by the Department of 
Agriculture. So have parts of six western states and 16 other 
states east of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern New Jersey, the volume of cattle sales at  
Hackettstown Livestock Auction has increased by a third in recent 
weeks, manager Robert Shotwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing cattle that I know would not normally be coming  
to auction,'' Shotwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael O'Farrell sold half his black Angus calves at a loss in  
July at Hot Springs, Va. ``Enough is enough,'' he said. ``I'll 
probably sell the rest of the herd next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corn for livestock in southeastern Pennsylvania ``has pretty  
much been devastated,'' said Stan Guest, a farmer in Pottstown. 
``There's some forage there, but basically no ears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in West Virginia's Jackson County, ``you can get corn ...  
easier than you can find hay,'' farmer Owen McNeely said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture departments in Kentucky and several other states are  
running ``hay hotlines'' to put farmers needing hay in touch with 
anyone who has enough to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolls of hay, weighing 1,200 to 2,000 pounds, usually fetch $10  
to $12 apiece. The range now is about $15 to $20, ``which is not 
outrageous,'' said Doug Rathbun of the Kentucky Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The crunch will come this winter when more farmers need hay to  
feed their livestock, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rogers brothers won't face that problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Rogers sold 62 cows Wednesday for an average of $390.  
Before the drought, Earl Rogers said, they would have brought $650 
to $700 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``The packers know they've (farmers) got to sell. They can't  
take them back home,'' said Bill Arnett, assistant manager of 
Gateway Livestock Auctions in Mount Sterling, where the Rogers herd 
is being liquidated in phases. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a scorched-out pasture, you're faced with two  
difficult decisions: Pay more to buy feed on the market, or if you 
don't want to go that route, you cull the animal,'' said Galen of 
National Milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl Rogers echoes that, saying his choice was ``lose it now or  
lose it all later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others are gambling that conditions will change, among them Paul  
Colson, who says he'll hang on to his 75 dairy cows for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``By November, if I don't find hay, I'll start selling,'' said  
Colson, of Cynthiana.

	He likes record-holder Maurice Greene's chances in the dash. No  
surprise there. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boldon, whose mouth can run as fast as his legs, isn't sure  
his Los Angeles training partner can pull off a rare 100-200 sprint 
double. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 200 is definitely the most challenging for (Greene) and  
the 4x100 (relay) is probably the easiest -- if he gets the stick, 
they win,'' said Boldon, sporting a stud earring the size of a 
nickel in his left lobe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 100 he's going to win by 2 or 3 meters, but the 200 is  
going to be close. These guys are not going to let him have the 
200. I don't think he has the experience in the 200 to really blow 
them away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, working for broadcaster Eurosport at the championships,  
said he's troubled by the mounting number of doping cases shadowing 
the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad we can't talk about results more than doping. But  
I don't think that will change as long as this sport is the way it 
is right now,'' Boldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Track and field has been shaken in recent weeks by positive  
tests from such big-name athletes as Javier Sotomayor, Merlene 
Ottey and Linford Christie. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon said doping exams using blood samples, which the IOC said  
Friday will at least be tested at the Sydney Olympics, should be 
instituted immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't they start it tomorrow?'' he asked. ``What are we  
waiting for?'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GREENE WITH ENVY:* South African sprinter Bradley Agnew had the  
best view in the house for Greene's opening heat victory: the 
adjacent lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene took it easy and came home in 10.30 seconds, the  
21st-best time of the 10 heats, but enough to impress Agnew. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an amazing experience,'' Agnew said. ``In June, I was  
watching him in awe as he broke the world record, then a few weeks 
later there he is, in the lane next to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pulled me for the first five meters, then put on the  
afterburners and accelerated away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agnew finished fifth in 10.51, but squeezed into the second  
round because his time was one of the 10 fastest among runners who 
did not place in the top three in their heats. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *INTO THE FIRE:* Spaniards call the southern city of Seville the  
``frying pan'' for its blazing summers. Athletes here started to 
see why Saturday, as temperatures reached into the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting hot. I hope it's not going to get worse,'' said  
French sprint star Christine Arron, who won her opening heat in the 
100. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's burning up already,'' said Marion Jones, who opened her  
bid for four gold medals by competing in qualifying for the long 
jump and the dash. 
</P>
<P>
	She reached Monday's long jump final by registering 6.81 meters  
(22 feet, 4 1-4 inches) on her second effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could have done it on the first jump,'' Jones said,  
``so I could get out of here and take a little nap back at the 
hotel.''

<HEADLINE> Writer Fired for Uncertain Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Republic said Saturday it has  
dismissed a columnist because the newspaper's editors were unable 
to substantiate some of her quoted sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Amparano, a Republic reporter for five years, began  
writing ``Conversations'' in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have discovered that some of the people quoted in that  
column are untraceable,'' the Republic said in a four-paragraph, 
page-one announcement. ``We can't find them or prove they exist. 
Nor has Amparano been able to substantiate those sources to date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amparano denied any impropriety, the Republic said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment from Amparano on Saturday; her home  
telephone number is unlisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Wallace, managing editor of the Republic, said Saturday  
that the newspaper began investigating Amparano's work on Wednesday 
when vague newsroom rumors surfaced that some column material had 
been fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the allegations involved several columns but declined  
to say which ones or how many sources were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a little more work we want to do before we  
discuss specifics,'' Wallace said. ``We'll be talking about it in 
our paper soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The column, which ran three times a week in the Life section,  
featured interviews with average people in the community expressing 
their concerns and highlighting their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	The last column, on Wednesday, was about an adult softball game  
in suburban Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
	Amparano joined the Republic in 1993, covering minority and  
immigration issues. She began her journalism career in 1984 at The 
Associated Press in San Francisco. Later, she worked for The Wall 
Street Journal in Philadelphia and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Amparano's dismissal follows several other high-profile cases in  
which columnists were accused of fabricating sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, two Boston Globe columnists resigned after reports  
some column material was made up. Patricia Smith admitted to 
inventing characters in four of her columns. Mike Barnicle, long 
the newspaper's marquee columnist, resigned amid suspicions he 
fabricated a column about two children hospitalized with cancer.

<HEADLINE> College Student Convicted of Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A college student has pleaded guilty to  
illegally distributing thousands of pirated software programs, 
movies and pieces of music from his Web site, giving the government 
its first Internet piracy conviction under a 1997 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Levy, 22, was charged in February with violating the  
federal No Electronic Theft Act after investigators found the 
material had been distributed through equipment at his apartment in 
Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior at the University of Oregon entered his plea in U.S.  
District Court on Friday. Levy allowed the public to download the 
material for free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Levy's case should serve as a notice that the Justice  
Department has made prosecution of Internet piracy one of its 
priorities,'' said Assistant Attorney General James Robinson, the 
chief of the department's criminal division in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is theft, pure and simple,'' Robinson said  
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 law makes it illegal to reproduce or distribute  
copyrighted works such as software and digital recordings, even if 
it is distributed without charge. Such piracy cost companies an 
estimated $11 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI was tipped to Levy by university computer managers who  
saw an unusually high volume of traffic on one of its servers, 
computers that typically handle connections with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We watch all of our network connections because you have to  
monitor the traffic patterns overall for the campus to make sure 
there aren't any problems,'' said Joanne Hugi, director of the 
university's computer center. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the school does not monitor individual exchanges, but  
watches volume to make sure the system is working smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sitting here being cybercops,'' Hugi said.  
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor who handled the case said Levy was downloading  
huge amounts of software and digital recordings that he passed 
along to anybody who found his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tremendous amount of traffic,'' said Sean Hoar, an  
assistant U.S. attorney in Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the act, reproducing or distributing more than 10  
copyright works with a total value of more than $2,500 is a felony 
punishable by up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy is to be sentenced Nov. 22.

<HEADLINE> Landmark D.C. Cafeteria Survives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's capital is fickle when it comes to  
tradition. But one longtime Washington monument to a bygone era of 
cheap and tasty food has survived its near expiration with the help 
of supporters who included members of Congress and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Sholl's Colonial Cafeteria, a stalwart server of home-style  
cooking since 1928, has renewed its once-endangered lease at almost 
$30,000 less per year than the landlord wanted, averting financial 
straits that would have put the restaurant under. 
</P>
<P>
	The new lease was signed this week by proprietor George  
Fleishell, who serves up liver and onions, roast beef, soups, 
salads, vegetables, lemonade and nine kinds of pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourist buses regularly line up outside the entrance of Sholl's,  
downtown near the end of the K Street corridor that houses many of 
the city's lobbyists and lawyers, including some who are Sholl's 
regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., is also a loyal patron, and Sholl's has  
counted Harry S. Truman, George Wallace and Jimmy Carter among its 
customers. Sholl's also works with several homeless advocates and 
honors their meal vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	When Fleishell announced earlier this year that the rent  
increase would drive Sholl's out of business, its patrons launched 
a ``Save Our Sholl's Committee'' that garnered the national 
publicity that apparently made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleishell, the 71-year-old nephew of founder Evan Sholl, said  
Friday he had agreed to pay rent of $255,000 per year, up from 
$235,000 but less than the $282,000 the landlord wanted. (The 
landlord's identity is a bit of a mystery, and Fleishell dealt with 
rental agent Cushman &AMP; Wakefield.) 
</P>
<P>
	``They finally came around,'' Fleishell said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Bret Nears Tex-Mex Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) -- The first Atlantic hurricane this year  
gathered strength Saturday and churned through the Gulf of Mexico 
towards the Texas-Mexico border with 135-mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters upgraded Hurricane Bret to a Class 4 hurricane and  
said it could strengthen further before making an expected landfall 
sometime Sunday near Brownsville, Texas and Matamoros, Mexico, twin 
cities on the border. Hurricanes are categorized in five classes, 
the fifth being the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should already be making preparations,'' said Roberto  
Molleda, a meteorologist with the U.S. National Hurricane Center in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 p.m. EDT, Hurricane Bret was located about 155 miles  
southeast of Brownsville, Texas, moving north at about 10 mph, but 
the center said that pace could slacken as the storm takes a turn 
to the northwest over the next 6 to 12 hours, the center reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our forecast has the center of the eye of the hurricane coming  
ashore right at the Texas-Mexico border'' sometime Sunday afternoon 
or evening, Molleda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were extended to cover an approximately  
200-mile stretch of the Texas coast from the border to Port 
O'Connor. A hurricane watch covers another 75 miles north along the 
coast to Freeport. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, the warnings were in effect for a 160-mile stretch of  
Mexico's northern Gulf coast from Matamoros south to La Pesca. The 
watch extended another 200 miles south to Tuxpan. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Matamoros, a city of 360,000 across the border from  
Brownsville, rushed to tape up windows to keep them from being 
blown out by the storm. Sandbags were piled waist-high in front of 
a local Burger King restaurant, and stores were packed with 
residents buying food and drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	Matamoros Mayor Homero Zamora Ayala declared a state of alert  
for the city's 360,000 residents, and told local media that as many 
as 7,000 people would be evacuated from low-lying coastal areas 
there. City Attorney General Juan Martin Reina said 22 city buses 
had already been sent to bring 500 people from beach communities to 
an improvised shelter at a convention center. 
</P>
<P>
	``These communities are near the Gulf shore ... their houses are  
made of wood and could easily be flooded,'' Reina said. Gray clouds 
already lowered ominously over the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Leticia Jimenez, 39, stood in front of a food store on the  
outskirts of Matamoros with a shopping cart loaded with bottled 
water, batteries and canned food, and recalled Hurricane Gilbert, 
which devastated the area in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time we're taking more time to get prepared,'' Jimenez  
said, as last-minute shoppers jammed the store's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane could cause storm surges and coastal flooding 8 to  
12 feet above normal tides. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Bret could be the first major hurricane to hit the  
area since Gilbert in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	As it took aim at Texas' lower coast, officials of South Padre  
Island -- a popular resort island in the Gulf of Mexico -- ordered 
the 2,100 residents to pack and leave by sunup Sunday, Mayor Ed 
Cyganiewicz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Port Isabel, on the mainland side of the causeway  
to the low-lying barrier island, were told to evacuate by morning. 
School buses were being deployed to transport residents to inland 
shelters, Cameron County Judge Gilberto Hinojosa said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	If residents don't want to leave, Hinojosa said, ``then we hand  
out little body tags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to live if you stay on the island and the  
hurricane hits,'' he said. ``You're going to drown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previous hurricane warnings for the Mexican Gulf coast further  
south in the coastal state of Tamaulipas were downgraded to 
hurricane watches, but the threat of heavy rains remained along 
much of Mexico's coast. Tamaulipas residents were told to expect as 
much as eight to ten inches of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen Mexican ports along the Gulf were closed Friday to  
small and medium craft navigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret crossed the hurricane threshold Friday with maximum  
sustained winds of 75 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one of two major storms in the Atlantic. Late Saturday,  
Tropical Storm Cindy was 450 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands. 
It was moving west at 12 mph and had maximum sustained winds of 70 
mph, the Hurricane Center reported.

<HEADLINE> Smith's Agent To Talk With Bengals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Akili Smith's agent hopes that face-to-face  
meetings with the Cincinnati Bengals can break a contract impasse 
and get the first-round draft pick in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Leigh Steinberg plans to fly to Cincinnati on Sunday to  
jump-start negotiations, which have stalled over how Smith's 
contract will be structured. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback from Oregon was the third overall pick in the  
draft and is the highest pick left unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like it's got to be more productive being in Cincinnati  
than sitting in California watching the days roll off the clock,'' 
Steinberg said Saturday. ``We're acutely aware of the passage of 
time. I very much want to conclude this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals welcomed his visit, but gave no indication they were  
willing to substantially change their offer of a contract tied to 
performance. Steinberg is seeking a contract closer to the one that 
Cleveland gave quarterback Tim Couch, chosen two spots ahead of 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful we'll be able to get something done. Whether we  
do or not remains to be seen,'' said Katherine Blackburn, the 
team's executive vice president. ``But I do think it's a good 
step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides remain philosophically divided on how closely  
Smith's salary should be tied to performance. The Bengals gave 
contracts with voidable years to top draft picks Dan Wilkinson and 
Ki-Jana Carter earlier this decade and were unhappy with their 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg had little trouble negotiating those contracts. The  
impasse over Smith's contract has brought back memories of the 
protracted negotiations that cost quarterback David Klingler most 
of training camp in 1992. He also was a client of Steinberg's. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as if the Bengals march to their own drummer in sort of  
unilaterally removing themselves from the remainder of the National 
Football League,'' Steinberg said. ``It's the Bermuda Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here is a situation where we simply want Akili salaried in the  
same way that similarly situated quarterbacks have been in recent 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackburn welcomed the chance to go over the offers in person  
rather than over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we haven't been willing to necessarily do the Couch or  
(Ryan) Leaf deals and tried to explain to them the reasons why 
not,'' she said. ``We've tried to address the problems that come up 
with those contracts in a few different ways. So maybe we'll get a 
better chance to go over it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All along, the Bengals have envisioned Smith as a backup to Jeff  
Blake this season, which is the last of Blake's contract. Coach 
Bruce Coslet couldn't say Saturday whether Smith has missed too 
much practice time to allow him to be No. 2 once he signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody learns at a different pace,'' Coslet said. ``To say  
that at this point he could be the No. 2, I don't know. We'll have 
to see how fast he picks things up. This is all speculation right 
now.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Feds Raid Bank of New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal investigators reportedly raided the Wall  
Street office of the Bank of New York in connection to a major 
international money-laundering scheme that authorities say involves 
the Russian mob. 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's raid, investigators seized the files of Natasha  
Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a senior vice president who supervised the 
bank's East European division, a source close to the bank told The 
New York Times in Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	She and a bank vice president in London, Lucy Edwards, were  
suspended on Wednesday. Both women are married to Russian 
businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	British authorities also searched Ms. Edwards' home and office.  
Her husband, Peter Berlin, had authority over some accounts at the 
bank. Neither she nor her husband has been accused of any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	However, investigators told the Times that the couple may be  
involved in one of the largest money-laundering operations ever 
conducted in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as $10 billion allegedly was laundered through the bank  
in what investigators say is an operation run by Russian organized 
crime, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $4.2 billion passed through a single account in more than  
10,000 transactions between October and March, the newspaper said, 
citing unidentified investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York Co. is the nation's 15th largest.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the bank said it ``has been cooperating with the  
office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York 
in the confidential investigation of the use of bank facilities to 
transfer funds from Russia to other countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No funds were lost and there were no allegations of wrongdoing  
by the bank, according to the statement. The bank declined to 
provide further details.

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Carlos Hermosillo and Zak Ibsen each  
scored twice as the Los Angeles Galaxy defeated the New York-New 
Jersey MetroStars 4-1 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy's fourth consecutive win put Los Angeles (15-8)  
within three points of first-place Colorado in the Major League 
Soccer's Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars (5-19) lost their ninth in a row, tying a league  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermosillo scored the game's first goal in the eighth minute  
when he headed Greg Vanney's corner kick to the right of goalkeeper 
Mike Ammann. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine minutes later, Ibsen extended the margin by scoring inside  
the left post from eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermosillo's second goal gave the Galaxy a 3-0 lead in the 59th  
minute. Ammann tipped Jones' crossing pass from the right side of 
the penalty area, but Hermosillo converted the deflecton into an 
empty net from six yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars' Mark Chung scored on a penalty kick in the 72nd  
minute. Then Ibsen scored inside the left post from seven yards. 
Vanney finished with three assists.

<HEADLINE> Philly Mob Boss Expected To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- No one knows just what the future of the  
Philadelphia mob will be now that reputed leader Joseph ``Skinny 
Joey'' Merlino is in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Merlino's alleged predecessor, Ralph Natale, producing  
a bombshell this week by reportedly agreeing to testify for 
prosecutors, the gangland landscape could change dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unusual,'' Edwin Jacobs Jr., one of Merlino's  
attorneys, said Saturday. ``As far as I know, it's the first time a 
person identified as a head or a former head of an organized crime 
unit by the FBI has ever flipped sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Natale, who is currently in jail on federal drug conspiracy  
charges, has reportedly agreed to provide information on drug 
dealing, murders and political corruption in Philadelphia and 
Camden, N.J., after secretly meeting with federal authorities for 
about two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Such cooperation, reported this week by newspapers citing law  
enforcement officials, would make him the highest-ranking American 
Mafia figure ever to cooperate. It also marks a possible turning 
point for the future of the Philadelphia mob, which has endured a 
series of turncoats and other troubles in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ironically, one of the most outspoken critics of such a deal  
is Natale himself,'' Jacobs said. ``He's been very vocal in the 
past about using rats as government witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last 13 years, nearly a dozen initiated or ``made''  
members of the local crime family have turned into government 
witnesses. It was mobster Ronald Previte, a top Natale associate, 
who wore a hidden wire provided by the FBI, that led to the arrests 
of Natale, Merlino and four other Boston mob associates on drug 
charges in June. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, internal divisions erupted into a mob war that almost  
led to the assassination of then underboss Merlino. And most 
recently, Joseph Anthony Ligambi emerged as the new mob boss after 
just two years in the organization, a sign of the vacuum in the 
power leadership, according to law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, there's no true Mafia tradition practiced in  
Philadelphia anymore. There's just been an influx of younger men 
like Joey (Merlino) with no idea about how the traditional Mafia is 
supposed to be run,'' said mob criminologist and historian Celeste 
Morello, who lives in South Philadelphia. ``Many of the older men 
think 'This is not our Mafia anymore,' ... so there's no 'omerta' -- 
the Sicilian code of silence -- that's really been broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Natale has been quietly negotiating a deal with federal  
authorities since his arrest on federal drug charges two months 
ago, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Friday. He has been held in 
the Salem County Jail in southern New Jersey on charges that he 
operated a methamphetamine distribution ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Natale, a former leader of the New Jersey Bartenders Union,  
allegedly headed the Philadelphia crime family for four years 
before he was jailed in June 1998 for alleged parole violations. He 
previously had served two consecutive sentences totaling 27 years 
for an arson insurance scam and drug trafficking convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of Natale's June arrest on drug charges, he was  
serving time at an Ohio federal prison for the parole violations. 
The parole violations stemmed from several meetings he had with 
convicted felons, including Merlino, in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is Ralph doesn't want to die in jail,'' one  
unidentified investigator told the Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI refused to comment on the reported agreement Saturday,  
but Jacobs said he and Merlino believe it is true. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard ... he's been out of the federal court house in Camden  
meeting with the U.S. attorney and talking to FBI agents, 
apparently unbeknownst to his own attorney,'' Jacobs said. ``The 
only reason there can be is to cut a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Natale's attorney, Marc Neff, did not return telephone messages  
left at his office Saturday. He told the Inquirer in Friday's 
editions that he had heard the rumors but was unaware of any 
agreement. The assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, Barry 
Gross, also could not be reached for comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Natale is expected to corroborate some of the evidence and  
testimony offered by Previte, who recorded hundreds of 
conversations with mob figures for two years beginning in 1997.

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- NFL official Ron Liebsack suffered a broken leg  
and sprained knee Saturday night during the exhibition game between 
the Cleveland Browns and Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Liebsack, a side judge covering the goal line, had thrown a  
penalty flag when Browns running back Terry Kirby fell out of 
bounds, rolling up on Liebsack's left leg. The accident occurred 
late in the second quarter. 
</P>

	Liebsack laid on the ground for a few minutes and was eventually  
carted off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby caught a pass from Browns quarterback Ty Detmer in the  
middle of the field, cut outside and was trying to break into the 
end zone when he hit Liebsack. The Browns were called for holding

<HEADLINE> Republicans Say Bush Passed 1st Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nightmare, painted by a rival: Republicans  
for George W. Bush wake up next year, in the middle of a 
presidential debate with the Democratic nominee, and realize their 
guy is unready and unfit. 
</P>
<P>
	That fear, Lamar Alexander's parting shot at the Texas governor,  
now has been quieted by the simple fact that Bush survived his 
first campaign crisis, said Tom Rath, a field operative of 
Alexander's defunct campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not a GOP jittery -- publicly, at least -- about its  
runaway front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Out in the real world, at the grass roots, ``people feel  
relieved to see that it wasn't a house of cards that was going to 
crumble, that he has some steel in him, he didn't go off into a 
snit,'' Rath said from New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what Lamar was asking. How will George W. do in a  
debate, where you get something thrown at you that you didn't 
expect,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rath, now uncommitted, may someday seek a job in the Bush  
operation. But his review of Bush's performance over the past week 
echoed in random checks with Republican activists and officials 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent firestorm will strengthen Bush, said Arkansas Gov.  
Mike Huckabee, who announced his endorsement of Bush in the middle 
of the three-day eruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll make him bulletproof,'' Huckabee said.  
</P>
<P>
	First, Bush angrily lashed out Wednesday at reporters pressing  
to know, based on no allegation, whether he had ever used cocaine. 
The next day, he showcased his composure by convening a news 
conference on the matter, only to contort his denials around a 
confusion of 15- or 25-year standards used to investigate the drug 
use of prospective White House employees. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, Bush was back on message: My past is nobody's  
business as long as I've learned from my mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	A Time-CNN poll released Friday backed his assertion. Fully 84  
percent of Americans surveyed said any cocaine use in his 20s 
should not disqualify Bush from being president. And of the 54 
percent who were aware of the unsubstantiated talk about Bush and 
cocaine, half thought the governor had handled it well. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansans ``are saying that if this country let Bill Clinton  
take a walk, not with allegations but with admissions of wrongdoing 
..., I'll be doggoned if I'm going to let the press and the 
opposition party take down a man for something that hasn't even 
been alleged,'' said Huckabee. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois freshman Rep. Judy Biggert said she was at a state  
Capitol event with the Young Republicans, and all the sour talk 
there was about the news media, not Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really tired of the press and the media really  
hounding candidates,'' she said. ``What we see is just that the 
press is looking for any chink in the armor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has not yet made a presidential  
endorsement and has sounded supportive not only of Bush but of his 
rivals John McCain and Elizabeth Dole. On Thursday, he defended 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with the separation of a person's private life from  
their public duties,'' said the mayor, who has faced public 
questions about his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm interested in is what kind of job did he do as  
governor of Texas. I think he's done a great job as governor of 
Texas,'' said Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim DeMint, at the close of a week traveling his South  
Carolina district, said: ``I just hear, `Leave the guy alone.' I 
think he's setting a pretty good precedent about questions like 
this. If a credible person wants to come forward and challenge his 
integrity ..., he should answer it. But if it's just an abstract 
question, he's doing the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeMint, another freshman, added that the controversy will help  
Bush's image. ``He's not sensitive,'' DeMint said. ``He's still 
smiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield Nelson, a Republican national committeeman in Little  
Rock, Ark., said the only jitters within the party are coming from 
Bush's primary rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``His opponents would like for us to think that (some  
nervousness) is now taking place out there,'' Nelson said. 
``They're grasping for straws.''

<HEADLINE> Gulf Coast Residents Brace for Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Hundreds of people were given until  
sunup to get off South Padre Island on Saturday as Hurricane Bret 
took aim at the southern tip of Texas and neighboring Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service posted a hurricane warning for a  
120-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast from La Pesca, Mexico, to Texas' 
Baffin Bay, between Brownsville and Corpus Christi. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal residents stocked up at gasoline pumps and grocery  
stores, and building supply stores were overrun with customers 
wanting plywood, nails, flashlights and generators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We opened at 6 a.m. and at 10 minutes until 6 there were  
already lines out there,'' said Alma Ortiz at a Home Depot store in 
Pharr-McAllen, about 60 miles inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of popular South Padre Island ordered all 2,100  
residents to pack and leave by 6 a.m. Sunday, Mayor Ed Cyganiewicz 
said. Residents of Port Isabel, on the mainland side of the 
causeway leading to the barrier island, were given until 9 a.m. to 
evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	School buses were used to carry people to inland shelters.  
</P>
<P>
	If anyone refused to leave, ``then we hand out little body  
tags,'' said Cameron County Judge Gilberto Hinojosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to live if you stay on the island and the  
hurricane hits,'' he said. ``You're going to drown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some tourists remained on the beach at midday Saturday even  
though the sea was choppy and the sky was turning gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Veronica Nunez of Monterrey, Mexico, got in some last-minute  
kite flying with her husband and two daughters. ``We were supposed 
to leave tomorrow, but we have to leave this afternoon instead,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long lines of people waited to check out of beachfront hotels.  
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday afternoon, Bret was located about 210 miles  
southeast of Brownsville and was moving toward the north-northwest 
at 8 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain had started falling around Brownsville and 5 to 10 inches  
of rain was possible in south Texas, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was expected to have sustained wind blowing at up to  
110 mph by the time it makes landfall Sunday afternoon near the 
mouth of the Rio Grande, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hasn't been hit by a hurricane since Jerry killed three  
people in October 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the state's 367-mile-long coast has been struck by  
tropical storms since then, including Charley, which dumped 18 
inches of rain that killed 19 people in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Dont Tell the Kids Wins Sapling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Dont Tell the Kids took the lead at the  
start and then outdueled Outrigger to the wire for a one-length 
victory Saturday in the $200,000 Sapling Stakes at Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a strong ride by Jorge Tejeira, the 2-year-old colt  
covered six furlongs over a sloppy track in 1:10. The Bobby 
Durso-trained son of Carson City returned $8, $3.20 and $2.10 after 
surviving an inquiry and a claim of foul by jockey Pat Day, who 
rode the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Outrigger, who was looking to give trainer D. Wayne Lukas his  
ninth Sapling winner in the last 13 years, paid $2.40 and $2.10. 
House Burner finished another five lengths back in third and was 
$2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Dont Tell the Kids, whose sire won the 1989 Sapling, and  
Outrigger brushed slightly in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very, very happy,'' Durso said. ``Having the outside post  
was great. He didn't have to run hard to get position and that 
helped him finish better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tejeira, who last won a graded stakes in 1984 at Ak-Sar-Ben,  
said he came in a little bit in the stretch on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want that other horse to get brave on me and come  
back,'' Tejeira said after winning the Grade I stakes, which had a 
winner's share of $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $45,000 My Frenchman Stakes, L.B. On Tour set a track  
record in winning the five-furlong race over the sloppy track in 56 
seconds. The race was taken off the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Turner rode the winner, who is trained by Ben Perkins Jr.  
L.B. On Tour paid $4.80.

<HEADLINE> Report: Orca Bay Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Seattle businessman John  
McCaw's Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment, which owns the NBA's 
Vancouver Grizzlies, the NHL's Canucks and GM Place arena, is for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Gass, Orca Bay's vice president of communications,  
confirmed Saturday night that McCaw has put the three enterprises, 
estimated to be worth more than $330 million, up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``John has been looking for a minority partner for over a year  
now,'' Gass said. ``It's now reached the point where a minority 
partner is not necessary and he's prepared to sell both teams and 
the arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gass wouldn't speculate on what prompted McCaw to make the  
decision to sell, although Orca Bay has been losing millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Gass also couldn't comment on whether McCaw wanted to sell the  
three entities separately or wanted one buyer to take the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Canucks general manager Brian Burke said the possible sale won't  
impact the hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned this story doesn't change what Mr.  
McCaw has been trying to do for some time,'' he said. ``I don't 
have any cause for concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaw, who made millions when he sold his cellular telephone  
company in 1994, was first approached by former Canucks owner 
Arthur Griffiths about buying a share of the hockey team in the 
fall of 1993. McCaw eventually bought out Griffiths in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaw, who rarely gives interviews, sometimes is seen at center  
court of Grizzlies games or sitting behind the home bench at hockey 
games, always with a body guard nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	It's estimated McCaw has over $200 million invested in Vancouver  
sports interests. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview earlier this year, Steve Bellringer, Orca Bay's  
president and chief executive officer, said the combined losses of 
the Canucks, Grizzlies and the arena ``will be more than the mid- 
$20 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Orca Bay officials said the Canucks had lost $68  
million over the last three years but McCaw had no intention of 
selling or moving the team.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Video pirates offering current film titles  
including, ``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' and 
``Bowfinger'' saw the curtain fall on their operation last week, 
authorities said.

hundreds of videocassette recorders, the ring was capable of 
producing 500 bootleg cassettes every two hours, authorities said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 10 Years After Ban, Rose Still Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ten years after that gloomy day when Pete Rose  
walked away from baseball and promised to return soon, he's still 
trying to get back in. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's career hits leader has done jail time for failing to  
report income, opened restaurants, promoted Hit King pizzas, played 
host on sports talk shows and hopscotched the country for 
promotional appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	He has given his famous autograph thousands of times, scrawling  
it the same way he signed his lifetime ban for gambling on Aug. 23, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, he's made little headway toward getting back  
into baseball, which must happen if he's to become eligible for the 
Hall of Fame. The application for reinstatement he submitted two 
years ago is ignored by commissioner Bud Selig, who gives no 
indication he'll change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that in our society, 99 out of 100 guys are given  
another opportunity,'' Rose said. ``I'm the one out of 100 that's 
not being given another opportunity, which is mind-boggling to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A more relevant number might be 1-in-15. Rose is one of 15 who  
have received lifetime bans from the baseball commissioner. None 
has been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's up against history,'' said John Dowd, whose investigation  
of Rose in 1989 led to the ban. ``No one declared permanently 
ineligible has been readmitted, and I don't expect anyone would 
want to change history here. Why would anyone want to help Pete 
come back into the game?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question is what Rose has done to help himself get back,  
especially following five months in federal prison and three months 
in a halfway house in 1990-91; his sentence stemming from guilty 
pleas to two felony counts of failing to report income from 
autograph appearances; baseball memorabilia sales; and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	After Rose accepted the lifetime ban without a formal finding  
that he had bet on baseball, commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti said 
at a news conference the following day that Rose would have to 
``reconfigure'' his life to get back in. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig won't talk about the case other than to suggest that  
little has changed in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Bart's decision, you read all the things that led up to  
that. ... Nothing has changed any of that,'' Selig said. ``There's 
no appropriate reason to have any more comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Rose insists he has followed Giamatti's directive  
and turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do no more illegal gambling. I'm very selective of the  
people I associate with,'' Rose said. ``Based on my interpretation 
of what reconfigure means, I have reconfigured my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His reconfigured life includes legal gambling. His lawyer wishes  
it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be far better for Pete if he stayed away from  
casinos, if he not gamble at all,'' lawyer S. Gary Spicer said. 
``Having said that, look at the condition of this country's 
dependence upon gambling. Why should Pete be prevented from 
gambling like anybody else?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Rose admitted betting through bookies but denied he  
placed bets on baseball, contrary to Dowd's findings, an FBI 
analysis of Rose's fingerprints on betting slips, Giamatti's 
conclusions and the testimony of Rose's former associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after he accepted his ban, Rose's advisers urged him to  
get help. He saw the chairman of the psychiatry department at the 
University of Cincinnati, who concluded that Rose had a 
``clinically significant gambling disorder'' and should never 
gamble on anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose initially supported Dr. J. Randolph Hillard's diagnosis,  
agreeing he must avoid gambling completely. In the years that 
followed, he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he doesn't have a gambling problem, Rose has done  
promotional appearances at casinos and placed bets at race tracks. 
It leaves him vulnerable to suggestions that he's not dealing with 
his biggest problem, the one that got him in trouble in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I state my feelings, I'm (considered) in denial,'' Rose  
said. ``But I don't look at it like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig wouldn't say whether Rose's gambling is a major impediment  
to reinstatement. Dowd thinks it's an example of how Rose remains 
fundamentally unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other people who get in trouble in baseball are honest about  
it. That's the way they get redemption,'' Dowd said. ``Here, it's 
ridiculous. They just don't get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 58-year-old Rose would like to manage again -- he was  
managing the Cincinnati Reds when he was banned -- and he thinks 
someone would hire him if he were reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm totally convinced that there's a couple of teams out there  
that could really use my leadership, without being arrogant,'' Rose 
said. ``I understand how I can motivate people and deliver a 
message to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First, he has to convince Selig that he deserves a second  
chance. The odds are against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I wish that it all hadn't happened? Of course,'' Selig  
said. ``I always worry about the game, its image and its ethics. I 
know Bart felt the same way. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Going After Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A video featuring graphic footage of the  
bombings last year of two U.S. embassies in Africa are being 
released by the State Department in an effort ``to bring to 
justice'' the terrorists responsible for the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an instant, 224 innocent people died, murdered by  
terrorists,'' a voice says as the video begins. ``Here are the 
victims of these evil crimes: Mother, wife, daughter, father, 
husband, son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-second public service announcement features pictures of  
bloodied or burned bombing victims trying to escape from the 
rubble. One scene shows a person falling from the ledge of a 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	The video also features wanted posters of several alleged  
criminals, including Osama bin Laden, the charged mastermind of the 
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Among those killed were 12 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said it hopes the video, which was released  
in English, Arabic, French and Spanish, will ``bring to justice 
those responsible for the terrorist bombings of our embassies in 
East Africa, as well as to prevent future acts of terrorism 
worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department released the tapes earlier this month. It  
sent copies to every U.S. embassy, more than 250, with hope that 
officials there would work with host governments and local media to 
broadcast them. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of dollars in reward money already has been awarded for  
information leading to any arrests, according to the video. It 
encourages individuals with such knowledge to ``take a stand, 
protect the innocent,'' and contact U.S. officials.

<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- In a game that featured a league-record  
four red cards, D.C. United goalkeeper Mark Simpson stopped four 
shots and a penalty shot in the shootout period in a 3-2 victory 
Saturday night over the Miami Fusion. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. United improved its road record to a league-best 10-3 and  
its Eastern Conference mark to 14-1. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C.'s Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno converted their kicks  
in the shootout, while Miami's Henry Guiterrez, Welton, Tony Kuhn 
and Tyrone Marshall missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson hit Kuhn as he was moving past him, so Kuhn was awarded  
a penalty kick, which Simpson stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Lassiter opened the scoring with 29:10 left when he took a  
pass from Ben Olsen and knocked the ball past Fusion goalkeeper 
Garth Lagerway. It was the fourth goal for Lassiter in three games 
this year against the Fusion. 
</P>
<P>
	A minute later, Lassiter, who moved into a tie as the top scorer  
in the league with his goal, was ejected for extreme force. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lassiter out, the teams were at even strength for the first  
time since Miami's Leo Cullen got the game's first red card after 
just seven minutes of play. 
</P>
<P>
	Cullen was the first of three Fusion players to be ejected, also  
an MLS record. 
</P>
<P>
	With 25:25 to play, Miami's Jay Heaps was red-carded for  
clipping Jeff Agoos' foot on a tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over a minute later, Marshall beat Simpson in the lower  
right corner from 30 yards out to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 21:24 mark, Welton came down the right side, cut inside  
of defender Eddie Pope and beat Simpson to put the Fusion up, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope tied the contest with 4:42 remaining when he took a pass  
from Etcheverry and scored from point blank range. 
</P>
<P>
	The game's other red card occurred when Cullen was ejected.  
Nelson Vargas, who was being replaced in the Miami lineup, voiced 
his disagreement with the call to referee Rich Grady and was also 
given a red card. Since Vargas already left the contest, the Fusion 
did not have to play two men down.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Clark Likely Out for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- First baseman Will Clark will undergo surgery  
on his left elbow next week and will almost certainly be lost to 
the Baltimore Orioles for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore placed Clark on the 15-day disabled list Saturday.  
Clark, who has not played since Aug. 13, will have bone chips 
removed from his elbow during an operation planned for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently one of them has become lodged in the elbow and is  
keeping it from getting any better. Actually it's gotten worse 
lately,'' Orioles general manager Frank Wren said. ``We want to go 
ahead and get it done so going into next year we'll know he's fine. 
It's probably a four- to six-week procedure, especially for a 
position player. It will more than likely end his season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To fill Clark's place on the roster, Baltimore purchased the  
contract of outfielder Derrick May from Triple-A Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Clark was able to swing a bat this week but had  
difficulty throwing a ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``About two weeks ago he started to have discomfort in his  
elbow. He kind of played through it, but it got to the point where 
he couldn't get through it,'' Wren said. ``He got an injection in 
the elbow to cool it down. Unfortunately, over the last four days 
it not only didn't cool it down, but it's gotten worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark has been bothered by elbow problems throughout his 14-year  
career. Taped to his locker is a picture of several bone chips 
removed from his elbow during a previous operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been dealing with this since 1986. I've played my whole  
big league career with a broken elbow,'' he said. ``This not only 
affects my baseball play, it affects my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark hoped the cortisone shot would help, but it had little  
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the shot because I wanted it to calm down because I  
wanted to finish up the season. It wouldn't allow me to do that,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark left little doubt that his target date for returning is  
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have (surgery) now I can come back to the team and start  
rehabbing immediately. That would put me in a better position to be 
ready for next season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark signed a two-year, $11 million contract during the  
offseason. Asked to take over for the departed Rafael Palmeiro at 
first base, he has driven in only 29 runs in 77 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark has been on the disabled list seven times over the past  
four seasons. He missed a month earlier this year after breaking 
his thumb trying to field a grounder off the turf in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Conine will become the Orioles' everyday first baseman.  
</P>
<P>
	May, a nine-year veteran, was signed by the Orioles on June 3  
and assigned to Rochester. He hit .270 with five homers and 41 RBIs 
in 70 games.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his major-league leading 50th and  
51st home runs Saturday, becoming the fourth player to post 
consecutive 50-homer seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	With two out in the fourth against Colorado's John Thomson, Sosa  
hit a 1-2 pitch into the left-field bleachers to pull the Chicago 
Cubs within 2-1 of the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	With two on and one out in the sixth, Sosa smashed a 2-1 pitch  
from Thomson into the right field seats to give the Cubs a 5-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who also hit two homers Friday, now leads Mark McGwire by  
three home runs. McGwire did not homer Saturday and has 48 this 
season. It was Sosa's 39th career multihomer game and sixth this 
year 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, McGwire, Babe Ruth and Ken Griffey Jr. are the only  
players with consecutive 50-homer seasons. Sosa had 66 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa is ahead of last year's pace. In 1998, he hit his 50th and  
51st homers in the Cubs' 130th game; Saturday was the Cubs' 121st 
game.

<HEADLINE>  Egyptian Players Evacuated to Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Three Egyptian squash players competing in  
the Arab Games who were injured in a bus accident were evacuated 
Saturday to Cairo in an Egyptian military plane, diplomatic sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those flown back home on the orders of President Hosni  
Mubarak was Nesreen Nasha't who sustained a concussion and 
underwent three surgeries on her broken jaw and leg, said the 
sources, who did not wish to be identified further. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasha't was in stable condition after spending a night in the  
intensive care unit and was discharged, said officials at King 
Hussein Medical City hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a bus carrying several Egyptian athletes overturned,  
killing the Jordanian driver, whose name was not disclosed. Members 
of the Egyptian squash team were on an outing to the city of Madaba 
on their day off between matches at the Arab Games in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two players flown back with Nasha't were Iman Amir and  
Umniya Abdul Qawi, both of whom sustained bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Amir won the silver medal and Qawi the bronze in the women's  
squash championship on Thursday. Nasha't finished eighth in the 
individual championship, which ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt has already sent replacements for the three players and  
will continue participating in the team competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's state-run Petra news agency said King Abdullah II  
visited the Egyptians at the hospital earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's accident occurred outside Madaba, 20 miles southwest of  
Amman. The city is known for its Byzantine ruins featuring mosaic 
floors. It is also the site of Mount Nebo, where Moses is said to 
have sighted the promised land.

<P>
	BRISTOL, Conn., (AP) -- A 16-year-old amusement park worker died  
Saturday, hours after falling beneath a moving ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Henne was preparing to let passengers off ``The  
Tornado,'' at about 5 p.m. Friday when he fell and got caught under 
the spinning ride, said Richard Bisi, a spokesman at the Lake 
Compounce amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters freed Henne about 15 minutes later, and he was  
transported by helicopter to Hartford Hospital. He died about 3 
a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials have determined the ride did not malfunction,  
Bisi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ride was closed Saturday ``out of deference to Matthew's  
family and our team members who have worked with Matt this 
season,'' he said. The rest of the park remained open.

<HEADLINE>  Jones, Greene Set 100-Meter Paces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Marion Jones and Maurice Greene opened  
their bids for multiple gold medals with sensational times Saturday 
in the quarterfinals of the 100 meters at the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a special day for Jones, as her husband, C.J. Hunter, won  
the gold medal in the shot put for his first major international 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, seeking an unprecedented four golds, won her heat in a  
championship record 10.76 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, shooting for a rare sprint double and three golds, ran  
9.91, the sixth fastest time in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' time shattered the previous championship record of 10.82  
set by fellow American Gail Devers in 1993 in Stuttgart. She also 
bettered her season's leading previous best of 10.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four women in history have run faster, including Jones, who  
posted 10.65 last year. The late Florence Griffith-Joyner still 
holds the world record of 10.49, set in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 semifinals and finals are set for Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	A couple of hours after Jones' race, Hunter -- whom she married  
last October in Raleigh, N.C. -- won the shot put with a career best 
heave of 21.79 meters (71-6) on his final attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter bellowed and whipped his arms in a windmill motion when  
he saw the result posted on the board. 
</P>
<P>
	After being called for a false start, Jones blew away the rest  
of the field as she solidified her status as the overwhelming 
favorite for the sprint title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have asked for a better atmosphere, better  
weather,'' Jones said. ``The track is fast, fast, fast. Watch for 
some world records.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also qualifying for the semifinals in impressive style was  
American Inger Miller, who won her heat in a personal best 10.86, 
her first sub-11 since 1996. Greece's Ekaterini Thanos also ran 
10.86, a national record. 
</P>
<P>
	Others advancing included Devers and France's Christine Arron,  
both in 11 flat. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 100, Greene clocked his seventh sub-10 race of the  
year and showed signs he may be set to threaten the world record of 
9.79 he set earlier this year in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very fast final,'' Greene said.  
``Everybody's predicting I'll break (the record). We'll have to 
wait and see about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene outran one of his top rivals, Canada's Bruny Surin, who  
clocked 9.95. 
</P>
<P>
	``My coach (John Smith) told me, `Show 'em a little bit, but  
don't show 'em all of it,''' said Greene, who is also competing in 
the 200 and 400 relay. ``I believe I did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others winning their heats were Obadele Thompson of Barbados  
(10.04), Jason Gardener of Britain (10.04), Dwain Chambers of 
Britain (10.08) and Namibia's Frankie Fredericks (10.09). 
</P>
<P>
	The first gold medal of the championships went to Russia's Ilya  
Markov, who won the men's 20-kilometer walk in 1 hour, 23.34. 
Olympic champion Jefferson Perez of Ecuador took the silver, 45 
seconds behind, while defending champion Daniel Garcia of Mexico 
was third, another 12 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	The versatile Jones also advanced to the final of the long jump.  
She is seeking gold medals in the 100, 200, long jump and a relay. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long jump, Jones leaped 22 feet, 4 1-4 inches on her  
second attempt, a distance that automatically put her into Monday's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the most confident I've been all year (in the long jump)  
and pleased that I could get through qualifying on the second 
jump,'' Jones said. ``My rhythm is a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best long jump qualifier was Italy's Fiona May, the 1995  
world champion. May soared 23 feet, 1 1-4 inches, the second-best 
jump in the world this year, on her first try. 
</P>
<P>
	A third American attempting to win multiple medals, John Godina,  
began his bid for a third straight shot put title, qualifying for 
Saturday night's final with a heave of 67 feet, 10 3-4 inches, the 
best of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Toth, also of the U.S., had the second-best qualifying  
throw, 67 feet, 4 inches, and the other two Americans, Andy Bloom 
and C.J. Hunter, Jones' husband, also made the shot put final. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's opening event of the heptathlon, the 100 hurdles,  
France's Eunice Barber, the European champion, made a strong 
impression, winning her heat in a personal-best 12.89 seconds. The 
next-fastest time among the 22 competitors was 13.28 by U.S. 
champion Shelia Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American, Tiffany Lott-Hogan, was disqualified for two  
false starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber had another career-best in the second event, clearing  
1.93 meters (6-4), for a total of 2,286 points and a 185-point lead 
over runner-up Denise Lewis of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some big surprises in the men's hammer throw

<HEADLINE>  Jones, Greene Set 100-Meter Paces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Marion Jones and Maurice Greene opened  
their bids for multiple gold medals with sensational times Saturday 
in the quarterfinals of the 100 meters at the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a special day for Jones, as her husband, C.J. Hunter, won  
the gold medal in the shot put for his first major international 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, seeking an unprecedented four golds, won her heat in a  
championship record 10.76 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, shooting for a rare sprint double and three golds, ran  
9.91, the sixth fastest time in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' time shattered the previous championship record of 10.82  
set by fellow American Gail Devers in 1993 in Stuttgart. She also 
bettered her season's leading previous best of 10.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four women in history have run faster, including Jones, who  
posted 10.65 last year. The late Florence Griffith-Joyner still 
holds the world record of 10.49, set in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 semifinals and finals are set for Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	A couple of hours after Jones' race, Hunter -- whom she married  
last October in Raleigh, N.C. -- won the shot put with a career best 
heave of 21.79 meters (71-6) on his final attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter bellowed and whipped his arms in a windmill motion when  
he saw the result posted on the board. 
</P>
<P>
	After being called for a false start, Jones blew away the rest  
of the field as she solidified her status as the overwhelming 
favorite for the sprint title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have asked for a better atmosphere, better  
weather,'' Jones said. ``The track is fast, fast, fast. Watch for 
some world records.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also qualifying for the semifinals in impressive style was  
American Inger Miller, who won her heat in a personal best 10.86, 
her first sub-11 since 1996. Greece's Ekaterini Thanos also ran 
10.86, a national record. 
</P>
<P>
	Others advancing included Devers and France's Christine Arron,  
both in 11 flat. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 100, Greene clocked his seventh sub-10 race of the  
year and showed signs he may be set to threaten the world record of 
9.79 he set earlier this year in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very fast final,'' Greene said.  
``Everybody's predicting I'll break (the record). We'll have to 
wait and see about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene outran one of his top rivals, Canada's Bruny Surin, who  
clocked 9.95. 
</P>
<P>
	``My coach (John Smith) told me, `Show 'em a little bit, but  
don't show 'em all of it,''' said Greene, who is also competing in 
the 200 and 400 relay. ``I believe I did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others winning their heats were Obadele Thompson of Barbados  
(10.04), Jason Gardener of Britain (10.04), Dwain Chambers of 
Britain (10.08) and Namibia's Frankie Fredericks (10.09). 
</P>
<P>
	The first gold medal of the championships went to Russia's Ilya  
Markov, who won the men's 20-kilometer walk in 1 hour, 23.34. 
Olympic champion Jefferson Perez of Ecuador took the silver, 45 
seconds behind, while defending champion Daniel Garcia of Mexico 
was third, another 12 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	The versatile Jones also advanced to the final of the long jump.  
She is seeking gold medals in the 100, 200, long jump and a relay. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long jump, Jones leaped 22 feet, 4 1-4 inches on her  
second attempt, a distance that automatically put her into Monday's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the most confident I've been all year (in the long jump)  
and pleased that I could get through qualifying on the second 
jump,'' Jones said. ``My rhythm is a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best long jump qualifier was Italy's Fiona May, the 1995  
world champion. May soared 23 feet, 1 1-4 inches, the second-best 
jump in the world this year, on her first try. 
</P>
<P>
	A third American attempting to win multiple medals, John Godina,  
began his bid for a third straight shot put title, qualifying for 
Saturday night's final with a heave of 67 feet, 10 3-4 inches, the 
best of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Toth, also of the U.S., had the second-best qualifying  
throw, 67 feet, 4 inches, and the other two Americans, Andy Bloom 
and C.J. Hunter, Jones' husband, also made the shot put final. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's opening event of the heptathlon, the 100 hurdles,  
France's Eunice Barber, the European champion, made a strong 
impression, winning her heat in a personal-best 12.89 seconds. The 
next-fastest time among the 22 competitors was 13.28 by U.S. 
champion Shelia Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American, Tiffany Lott-Hogan, was disqualified for two  
false starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber had another career-best in the second event, clearing  
1.93 meters (6-4), for a total of 2,286 points and a 185-point lead 
over runner-up Denise Lewis of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some big surprises in the men's hammer throw  
qualifying. Among those failing to reach Sunday's final were the 
1-2 finishers at the 1996 Olympics, Balazs Kiss of Hungary and 
Lance Deal of the United States, along with Uzbekistan's Andrey 
Abduvaliyev, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist and 1993 and 1995 world 
champion, and Russia's Vasilly Sidorenko, the 1997 world bronze 
medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsten Kobs of Germany had the longest qualifying throw,  
258-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one thing could have stolen the stage Saturday from the  
world's No. 1 sprinters: the revelation of a drug case involving 
yet another big star. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of positive tests involving some of athletics' biggest

has been marred by all of this,'' said Jones, unbeaten since 1997 
in the two sprints.

<HEADLINE> Miller Entering Gourmet Soda Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Miller Brewing Co. is entering the gourmet soda  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-biggest brewer is assuming control of root  
beer, vanilla cream and orange cream produced under the Henry 
Weinhard's brand name. It acquired the sodas in April through its 
purchase of certain brands from the Stroh Brewery Co. 
</P>
<P>
	It marks the first time Miller has produced non-alcoholic  
beverages -- except for Sharp's, its non-alcoholic beer -- since the 
repeal of Prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's two largest rivals, Anheuser-Busch Inc. and Adolph  
Coors Co., do not produce sodas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view it as an opportunity,'' Miller spokeswoman Susan  
Henderson said Friday. She said the Weinhard sodas have had strong 
sales growth into this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The sodas are higher-prices specialty products sold primarily in  
Oregon, Washington and California. Miller plans limited 
distribution in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller last month hired new advertising agencies for its Miller  
Lite and Miller Genuine Draft beer as sales of its two biggest 
brands continued to slump.

<HEADLINE> GOP Picnic Draws 7,000-plus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VASHON, Wash.(AP) -- More than 7,000 people turned out Saturday  
to hear Republican presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Dole and John 
McCain stump at the GOP Picnic, a gala rivaling the recent Iowa 
Straw Poll in orchestration and glitz. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual gathering appeared undimmed by host Thomas Stewart's  
$5 million penalty last year for campaign-finance violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids were entertained by clowns and at a play park made of  
gigantic inflated animals, while their parents devoured free 
burgers and hot dogs. The crowd gave standing ovations to both 
candidates during the event at Stewart's cattle ranch on Vashon 
Island, about five miles west of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a wonderful victory for me in Iowa,'' Dole told the  
crowd. She finished third in the non-binding straw poll Aug. 14 
behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush and publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not spend millions of dollars, and it was pretty much a  
four-month effort,'' Dole said. Her campaign is relatively young, 
she said, because she undertook no political activity while she was 
president of the American Red Cross, a post she left in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole criticized the Clinton administration on several points,  
especially for what she described as its ineffective drug-control 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore ``have been AWOL  
when it comes to stopping the flow of illegal drugs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also criticized what she said were falling standards in  
education and, without mentioning any of Clinton's personal 
troubles specifically, repeatedly called for honesty and integrity 
at the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am willing to lead by example to affirm and promote those  
things that are right,'' Dole said. She emphasized her leadership 
experience from serving as President Reagan's secretary of 
transportation, as President Bush's secretary of labor and as head 
of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she favors a tax cut, local control of public schools  
and increased military preparedness, including stepped-up efforts 
toward a missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. McCain, R-Ariz., opened with a bit of self-deprecating  
humor regarding his six years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to remind you, it doesn't take a lot of talent to  
get shot down,'' he said. ``I intercepted a surface-to-air missile 
with my jet airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His booth on the ranch grounds featured a larger-than-life photo  
of a much younger McCain in his Navy pilot's jump suit. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain hammered on the themes of campaign-finance reform,  
increased military salaries and readiness, tax reform and local 
educational control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a weak and hollow military,'' he said. ``We have  
11,000 military families on food stamps, and that has got to 
stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Dole, he called for increased efforts toward developing a  
missile-defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Event host Stewart, Washington's largest contributor to  
Republican campaigns, pleaded guilty in March 1998 to laundering 
contributions through employees of Food Services of America, a 
subsidiary of his Seattle-based holding company, Services Group of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was fined $5 million, placed on home detention and  
ordered to perform community service. He declined to be interviewed 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Davis Loses Bid for Archery Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Actress Geena Davis lost her bid to be  
an Olympic archer, but she said she loves the challenge and will 
try again in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I did well. I was very happy,'' Davis said Saturday  
after finishing 24th out of 28 women competing in the U.S. Olympic 
trial semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 43, who made it to the semifinals just two years after  
taking her first archery lesson, finished 24th out of 28 
competitors. The top 16 archers advanced to Sunday's second. 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, Don Rabska, said she was having trouble adapting to  
the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough for us because we never get to practice in the rain  
in California,'' Rabska said. ``It caught her a little off guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also said the first serious media attention in her two  
years as an archer distracted her a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ill-prepared for this onslaught,'' she said. ``It was  
like being at a premier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star of ``Thelma and Louise'' and ``The Accidental Tourist''  
-- for which she won an Oscar in 1988 -- was inspired to take up 
archery after watching Justin Huish win two gold medals at the 1996 
Olympics in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people knew of Davis' hobby until she finished 29th out of  
300 women in Ohio to qualify for the Olympic semifinals. On 
Saturday, reporters blanketed this small suburban park along with 
about 40 movie fans who watched from behind a rope, hoping to catch 
a glimpse of the actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said she loves to challenge herself and wants to stay with  
archery ``to see how good I can get.'' She said she will try out 
for the Olympics again in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Dykman, 45, a 1996 Olympian, and Denise Parker, a two-time  
Olympian, were among the group to advance, while Huish was among 
the 16 men to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykman has shot with Davis in California and said she thinks the  
media attention has been a little distracting to the actress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've kept it pretty low-key for her, and this is the first  
time it's exploded for her like this,'' Dykman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others archery enthusiasts say Davis' participation is giving  
needed recognition to a little-known sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think archery, and they think hunting and  
stuff,'' said archer Jessica Carlson, 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The field of competitors will drop to eight by Monday; they will  
compete next month in California for three team spots and one 
alternate spot at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee officials knew of no other actor who has  
gone on to the Olympics, although some Olympic athletes, like 
swimmer Johnny Weismuller, went on to make movies.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Boys Fashioned for Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Raising boys to be strong and silent is promoting  
the outbreak of mass school shootings and a broader, smoldering 
climate of despair among male teen-agers, experts suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a national crisis of boys in America,'' said  
William Pollack, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	He and several other researchers on Friday discussed violent  
boys at the annual meeting of the American Psychological 
Association. They were responding partly to public concern over 
recent mass killings at schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher before  
committing suicide at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. 
Other school shootings have struck Georgia, Mississippi, Kentucky, 
Arkansas and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in such crimes is statistically small. There were  
two school homicides with multiple victims in 1992 but six last 
year -- and they were largely at suburban schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of victims increased from four to 16.  
</P>
<P>
	The psychologists said American boys are still reared largely in  
keeping with the traditional code of male toughness, which 
encourages boys to take action but squelches expressions of feeling 
and gestures of physical affection by and toward boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can punch one another, but you can't really have an  
affectionate touch,'' said Dan Kindlon, a psychologist at Harvard 
School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said cross-cultural studies demonstrate a clear  
link between violent societies and those that treat children with 
little physical warmth, according to University of Miami researcher 
Tiffany Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some boys who are not allowed tears, they will cry with  
their fists or they will cry with bullets,'' added Pollack. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychologists said such rearing makes it hard for boys to  
handle adversity and lays the foundation for a spectrum of 
depression and violence among teen-agers ranging from male bullying 
to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychologists pressed for big changes in how parents and  
educators treat boys. 
</P>
<P>
	They said parents should give physical affection freely to boys,  
allow them to show their feelings and reject the widespread belief 
that boys are inherently more violent than girls. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychologists urged educators to foster friendlier schools,  
provide more counseling and -- despite worries about false 
accusations of sex abuse -- not shirk from physically comforting a 
hurt child.

<HEADLINE> Writer Fired for Uncertain Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Republic said Saturday it has  
dismissed a columnist because the newspaper's editors were unable 
to substantiate some of her quoted sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Amparano, a Republic reporter for five years, began  
writing ``Conversations'' in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have discovered that some of the people quoted in that  
column are untraceable,'' the Republic said in a four-paragraph, 
page-one announcement. ``We can't find them or prove they exist. 
Nor has Amparano been able to substantiate those sources to date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amparano denied any impropriety, the Republic said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment from Amparano on Saturday; her home  
telephone number is unlisted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republic said it would be reviewing its editing procedures.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are alarmed that this could happen and that our editing  
procedures didn't unearth it sooner,'' the newspaper said. ``We 
expect our reporters and editors to adhere to the highest 
journalistic practices. When these expectations are not met, we are 
hurt and our readers are hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper did not specify which columns or quotes had come  
into question. 
</P>
<P>
	The column, which ran three times a week in the Life section,  
featured interviews with average people in the community expressing 
their concerns and highlighting their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	The last column, on Wednesday, was about an adult softball game  
in suburban Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
	Amparano joined the Republic in 1993, covering minority and  
immigration issues. She began her journalism career in 1984 at The 
Associated Press in San Francisco. Later, she worked for The Wall 
Street Journal in Philadelphia and New York.

<HEADLINE> No Y2K Glitches With Navigation Tool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- It appeared to be smooth sailing  
Saturday for boaters and aviators who rely on a satellite-based 
navigation system that reset itself, which was expected to confuse 
older locator units. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Coast Guard here and the Federal Aviation  
Administration reported receiving no calls for stranded boats or 
airplanes having problems in determining their coordinates by using 
the Global Positioning System, or GPS. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just a regular weekend. It's actually been a very slow day,''  
said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Danny Phee. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA in Washington also had no reports of problems, said  
agency spokesman Les Dorr, noting that small, private plane pilots 
had been warned to check their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Time clocks on the popular GPS receivers reset to zero at 5 p.m.  
PDT Saturday, which could possibly confuse units made before 1993. 
Those units may take longer to pinpoint a location, be off in their 
calculations, or be unable to find the location. 
</P>
<P>
	GPS receivers determine location by using signals of three to 24  
satellites. To do this they need the exact time, which the system 
determines by counting the weeks since Jan. 5, 1980 -- up to 1,024. 
But GPS reached its maximum number of weeks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers offer upgrades. Otherwise, some receivers may  
think it is 1980 when the clock reset, according to the 
Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	GPS, originally designed for the military, is booming in the  
commercial market, often offered in luxury cars as a mapping 
device. Aviators and boaters have been using GPS for at least a 
decade and only in recent years have hikers begun to use hand-held 
units. 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide, private tow boat agency, Vessel Assist Association  
of America, based in Newport Beach, reported no GPS-related 
problems Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely not. We haven't had any troubles at all,'' said  
Steve Ryan, a dispatcher for Vessel Assist.

<HEADLINE> Biographer: Sagan Smoked Marijuana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The late astronomer and author Carl Sagan  
was a secret but avid marijuana smoker, crediting it with inspiring 
essays and scientific insight, according to Sagan's biographer. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the pseudonym ``Mr. X'', Sagan wrote about his pot smoking  
in an essay published in the 1971 book ``Reconsidering Marijuana.'' 
The book's editor, Lester Grinspoon, recently disclosed the secret 
to Sagan's biographer, Keay Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson, a writer for the San Francisco Examiner, revealed the  
marijuana use in an article published in the newspaper's magazine 
Sunday. ``Carl Sagan: A Life'' is due out in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find that today a single joint is enough to get me high ...  
in one movie theater recently I found I could get high just by 
inhaling the cannabis smoke which permeated the theater,'' wrote 
Sagan, who authored popular science books such as ``Cosmos,'' 
``Contact,'' and ``The Dragons of Eden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the essay, Sagan said marijuana inspired some of his  
intellectual work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can remember one occasion, taking a shower with my wife

<HEADLINE> Computer Glitch Delays Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMDALE, Calif. (AP) -- Air traffic controllers had to rely on  
memory to guide airplanes during a computer problem that also 
delayed scores of flights across the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	A new computer system was down for about three hours, forcing  
delays of up to 90 minutes for nearly 140 flights at five airports 
Thursday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the computer failure has not been determined.  
</P>
<P>
	The computer at the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center  
in Palmdale guides flights north of the U.S.-Mexico border, over 
central California, Nevada and the Pacific Ocean. It failed at 5:07 
a.m. and was fully restored at 8:05 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Mitch Barker in Seattle said controllers relied on  
their memories to identify planes on their screen and they were 
guided to their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	No airplanes were in danger, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Palmdale center is the fifth in the United States to begin  
using the new computer system installed last year as part of a 
nationwide $425 million FAA modernization.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Kills 17 in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- A bomb exploded at a party south of the  
capital, killing 17 people, including two children, and wounding 12 
others, security officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was thrown into the middle of a celebration late Friday  
in the small town of Ouzera, 60 miles south of the coastal capital, 
Algiers, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one claimed responsibility for the attack. Authorities have  
blamed recurring violence on Islamic insurgents, who have been 
fighting to topple the government of the northern Africa country 
since 1992. That was the year the military-backed government 
canceled elections that the Islamic Salvation Front was set to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's attack came just after President Abdelaziz Bouteflika  
had called a national referendum for Sept. 16 on a peace plan 
intended to end the insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his election in April, Bouteflika has taken several steps  
to end the conflict, including acknowledging officially that 
100,000 people had been killed in the insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medea region, near to the attack site in Ouzera, is  
considered to be the territory of Armed Islamic Group leader Antar 
Zouabri, who has rejected Bouteflika's policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The radical Armed Islamic Group has claimed responsibility for  
many massacres since the insurgency began.

<HEADLINE>  Actress Bids for U.S. Archery Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Geena Davis found out she was a good  
shot on a movie set. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old actress is now ranked 22nd in the nation in  
women's archery and is competing this weekend to qualify for the 
next Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have learned as an adult that I'm fairly athletic,'' Davis  
said Friday as she practiced for semifinals of the U.S. Olympic 
trials, which began this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of ``Thelma and Louise'' and ``The Accidental Tourist''  
-- for which she won an Oscar in 1988 -- has surprised archers with 
her quick rise in a sport that doesn't normally capture much 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Camera crews on Friday surrounded Davis, wearing a floppy blue  
hat and sunglasses, as she calmly fired off 60 arrows to a target 
70 meters away. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she would make the team, it would be unbelievable for our  
sport,'' said Denise Parker, the top-ranked woman in the nation. 
``The question is, does she want to be in the spotlight in this 
environment?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis discovered she had great aim while training to fire  
handguns for her part as an assassin in 1996's ``The Long Kiss 
Goodnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She kept her hobby a secret from Hollywood and the public,  
despite winning a tournament or two, until she finished 29th out of 
300 women in Ohio to qualify for the Olympic semifinals. Four of 
the 32 semifinalists dropped out, making Davis one of 28 competing 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	That number will drop by Monday to eight women who will compete  
next month in California for three team spots and one alternate 
spot at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' coach Don Rabska, an archer for more than 30 years, said  
she has mastered a concentration during her acting career that 
helps her as an archer. Archery, he said, is all about finesse and 
mental toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has been practicing five hours a day, shooting about 300  
arrows. She had a target range set up on the set of her latest 
film, ``Stuart Little.'' She also goes to the gym five days a week 
to work out on the treadmill and lift weights. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Davis: ``I don't feel that I've yet discovered how good I  
can get.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Sign Place-Kicker Boniol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Disappointed with their place kicking during  
the preseason, the Cleveland Browns signed veteran Chris Boniol on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boniol, who has kicked for Dallas and Philadelphia in his  
five-year career, was released by the Eagles earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He had an impressive workout for the Browns on Friday, Dwight  
Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations said Saturday 
before the Browns opened their new $283 million stadium with an 
exhibition game against the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Boniol, 27, was not in uniform for Saturday's game, but will  
begin working out with the team on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has not given up on kickers Danny Kight or Phil  
Dawson, but Clark said the team's place kicking duties were ``wide 
open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first two exhibition games, Dawson was 2-for-2 on field  
goals, including the game-winning kick in overtime against Dallas 
in the Hall of Fame Game. 
</P>
<P>
	Kight was 1-for-2, missing a 46-yarder at the end of regulation  
against the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Boniol made 27 of 28 field goal tries for the Cowboys in 1995, a  
96.4 percentage, the second highest in league history.

<HEADLINE> Teen Accused of Stealing 16 Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) -- A 15-year-old girl apparently didn't  
think it strange that her boyfriend drove a different car every 
time he came to visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did. They arrested the girl's teen-age beau on Thursday,  
accusing him of stealing 16 cars in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	All the cars were stolen from the same area at the same time of  
night, beginning in early June, and were recovered the next day, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was cracked with the use of records from cellular phone  
calls made from some of the stolen cars. Police said the calls led 
them to the girl's home in Hamden, some 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year-old suspect, whose name was not released because of  
his age, was charged with multiple counts of larceny and criminal 
mischief.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Coast Residents Brace for Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Hundreds of people were given until  
sunup on Sunday to get off South Padre Island as Hurricane Bret 
took aim at the southern tip of Texas and neighboring Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service posted a hurricane warning for a  
120-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast from La Pesca, Mexico, to Texas' 
Baffin Bay, between Brownsville and Corpus Christi. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal residents on Saturday stocked up at gasoline pumps and  
grocery stores, and building supply stores were overrun with 
customers wanting plywood, nails, flashlights and generators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We opened at 6 a.m. and at 10 minutes until 6 there were  
already lines out there,'' said Alma Ortiz at a Home Depot store in 
Pharr-McAllen, about 60 miles inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of popular South Padre Island ordered all 2,100  
residents to pack and leave by 6 a.m. Sunday, Mayor Ed Cyganiewicz 
said. Residents of Port Isabel, on the mainland side of the 
causeway leading to the barrier island, were given until 9 a.m. to 
evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	School buses were used to carry people to inland shelters.  
</P>
<P>
	If anyone refused to leave, ``then we hand out little body  
tags,'' said Cameron County Judge Gilberto Hinojosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to live if you stay on the island and the  
hurricane hits,'' he said. ``You're going to drown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some tourists remained on the beach at midday Saturday even  
though the sea was choppy and the sky was turning gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Veronica Nunez of Monterrey, Mexico, got in some last-minute  
kite flying with her husband and two daughters. ``We were supposed 
to leave tomorrow, but we have to leave this afternoon instead,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long lines of people waited to check out of beachfront hotels.  
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday afternoon, Bret was located about 210 miles  
southeast of Brownsville and was moving toward the north-northwest 
at 8 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain had started falling around Brownsville and 5 to 10 inches  
of rain was possible in south Texas, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was expected to have sustained wind blowing at up to  
110 mph by the time it makes landfall Sunday afternoon near the 
mouth of the Rio Grande, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand prison inmates joined other Texans headed for  
higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said  
3,175 prisoners in far South Texas were being sent by bus more than 
100 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials hoped to complete emergency evacuations from Willacy  
County State Jail in Raymondville and Segovia Unit and Lopez State 
Jail in Edinberg by 5 a.m. Sunday. The inmates will be housed at 
the McConnell, Garza East and Garza West units in Beeville, and in 
the Connally Unit in Kenedy. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 p.m. EDT, Bret was located 195 miles southeast of  
Brownsville, Texas, and was moving north-northwest at 8 mph. A turn 
to the northwest was expected within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hasn't been hit by a hurricane since Jerry killed three  
people in October 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the state's 367-mile-long coast has been struck by  
tropical storms since then, including Charley, which dumped 18 
inches of rain that killed 19 people in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Water Leak Closes Malibu, Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photos    	
</P>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Ritzy eateries and other businesses stood  
empty Saturday at the peak of the summer beach-going season in this 
star-studded enclave as officials turned people away and repaired a 
leaky water main that left the town dry. 
</P>
<P>
	As the morning fog lifted, ``CLOSED'' signs hung in the darkened  
windows and parking spaces abounded along normally jammed Malibu 
streets, home to the rich and famous, including Barbra Streisand, 
Johnny Carson and Martin Sheen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing fine without water; I'm not doing well without  
customers,'' said Carter Crary, owner of Malibu Divers, a small 
shop on the Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu's main thoroughfare. 
Crary said he expected to lose ``thousands and thousands'' of 
dollars over the dry weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street, the football-sized parking lot at Duke's  
restaurant and bar stood empty. A sign in the window read: ``Due to 
the current lack of water in Malibu, Duke's is unable to open for 
business at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaks, caused by natural land movement, were found in the water  
main Thursday. Officials turned off the system, depleting reserves 
by Friday night. The lack of water forced the closure of a 20-mile 
stretch of Pacific Coast Highway from Topanga Canyon Road to Los 
Posas Road at Point Mugu for health and safety reasons, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The road may remain closed until Wednesday, said Los Angeles  
County fire Capt. Steve Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 5,000 residents and businesses along this 27-mile-long  
strip of beachfront paradise, lined with multimillion-dollar homes, 
went without water overnight and were encouraged to boil water once 
faucets began flowing again late Saturday, said Melinda Barrett, 
spokeswoman with the county's public works department. 
</P>
<P>
	A steady stream of BMWs and Volvos pulled up to a parking lot at  
Pepperdine University -- one of two sites where county officials 
distributed free 5-gallon jugs of drinking water. A row of 20 tall, 
green port-a-potties offered some relief to the wealth and the 
less-fortunate alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``Malibuites are tough,'' said Mary Fitzgerald, a 30-year  
resident, as she loaded water tanks for her horses in the trunk of 
her Volvo. ``It's inconvenient, but it's doable.''

<HEADLINE> Elliott Has Kidney Complication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott was  
back in surgery Saturday after doctors realized the kidney he 
received from his brother in a transplant was not properly 
connected. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Methodist Surgery and Transplant Hospital noticed  
early Friday morning that urine was leaking from the place where 
the kidney and the bladder meet. The transplant was performed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's organs were quickly repaired, the hospital said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year NBA veteran needed the kidney because of an illness  
called focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. Essentially, Elliott's 
kidneys were unable to filter waste out of his blood. 
</P>
<P>
	So Elliott's older brother, Noel, stepped in. Noel Elliott was  
released from the hospital Friday, four days after donating one of 
his kidneys to his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say Sean Elliott, 31, will be released next week.

<HEADLINE> Gun Dealer Seeks McVeigh Firearm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A gun dealer wants a piece of history -- the  
pistol that Timothy McVeigh had when he was stopped for a traffic 
violation after the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Livingston, owner of Pat's Pawn and Gun in Ogden, Kan., sold  
the .45-caliber Glock pistol and a TEC-9 pistol to McVeigh before 
the 1995 bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	He says McVeigh wrote a bad check to pay him $291.22 for the  
TEC-9, and a small-claims court judge in Riley County, Kan., 
awarded him $450.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for McVeigh sought to settle for $332, but Livingston  
sent back their check. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want anybody else's money,'' Livingston told The Daily  
Oklahoman on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	What he does want, Livingston said, is the Glock, since McVeigh  
apparently no longer owned the TEC-9 when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston plans to file a lien with the federal government  
asking that the Glock be released from evidence as payment of 
McVeigh's debt to him. However, McVeigh's conviction is still under 
appeal and evidence generally remains in court custody until all 
appeals are final. 
</P>
<P>
	``He owes me, not these ... attorneys or anybody else,''  
Livingston said. ``He bought a gun. So, to me, it's fair that I get 
a gun back and that (the Glock) is the only one he owns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the bombing on April 19, 1995, which killed 168  
people, a state trooper stopped McVeigh because his car had no tag, 
then arrested him after finding the Glock in McVeigh's jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's the most valuable gun in the world because it  
caught him,'' Livingston said.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Say Riggleman Stays for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs general manager Ed Lynch tried to  
end rumors that manager Jim Riggleman would be fired by committing 
to Riggleman through the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Riggleman is going to manage this club and we're going to  
evaluate the situation at the end of the season,'' Lynch said 
before Saturday's game between the Cubs and Colorado Rockies. 
``Hopefully we'll play to a level in the next few weeks where this 
is a dead issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riggleman's job status has been rumored to be in jeopardy  
because of the team's dramatic downslide. The Cubs were 32-23 
entering play on June 9 and in second place in the NL Central. 
Since then, the Cubs have gone 19-46 for a 51-69 overall record and 
last in the division. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a distraction to me,'' Riggleman said of the rumors.  
``I think it might have been a distraction for some of the players. 
We've all got a chance in the next five weeks to earn our 
stripes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs players welcomed Lynch's announcement.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very smart by Ed Lynch to stop the distraction,''  
Chicago's Sammy Sosa said. ``Every day we came here and heard the 
rumors. That's a great decision (to keep Riggleman). He's a great 
manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're losing, that's constantly going to be asked and  
talked about,'' said first baseman Mark Grace. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Riggleman responsible for the team's poor play?  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' Grace said. ``His players just haven't done  
the job for him. Why? I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one could have predicted pitchers Steve Trachsel going 4-14  
or Kevin Tapani falling to 6-11 or closer Rod Beck, pitcher Kerry 
Wood and leadoff batter Lance Johnson getting hurt, or Gary Gaetti 
batting a feeble .188, Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how much these guys are dying,'' Grace said. ``What can  
you do? Go out, be professional and battle your butt off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace did his part to motivate his teammates. On Saturday, he  
posted a note that he would reward players but only if the team 
wins. A home run is worth $100, an RBI $50, a hit $20, a run scored 
$50 and moving runners up $10. Beck will pay pitchers $100 for each 
win, $100 for each save, $50 for a hold, $20 for a strikeout and 
$20 for a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing else has been motivating the boys,'' Grace said. ``The  
key is only in wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs have not seen too many of those.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, we still have to go out and play well,''  
said second baseman Mickey Morandini. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is what Lynch and Riggleman are looking for.

<HEADLINE>  Comets Carry On Without Perrot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Coach Van Chancellor remembers the day  
Kim Perrot showed up to open tryouts for the Houston Comets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-5 point guard out of Southwestern Louisiana hadn't  
been taken in the WNBA draft, and Chancellor didn't think she was 
as good as those who had. 
</P>
<P>
	But Perrot stood out among 150 people in the sweaty high school  
gym. 
</P>
<P>
	``You brought your 15 best friends and put them every 20 feet  
around the court,'' Chancellor told her. ``Everywhere I went, you 
heard them say, `I know you're going to keep Kim Perrot, coach.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And he did, inviting Perrot and another player to training camp.  
</P>
<P>
	But Chancellor still wasn't convinced Perrot could do the job.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought she was a little wild,'' he said. ``She thought I  
was a conservative Mississippi coach who didn't appreciate the 
flair for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He brought in other point guards, but Perrot outplayed them and  
was signed as a developmental player. She was promoted to the 
Comets' active roster in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through half a season yanking her in and out. She never  
did quit me or get mad,'' Chancellor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot didn't give up off the court, either.  
</P>
<P>
	She was diagnosed with lung cancer in February. Eventually the  
cancer spread to her brain and after a seven-month battle, she died 
Thursday in Houston. Perrot was 32. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped the Comets win consecutive WNBA championships and in  
the process became what Chancellor called the best defensive player 
in the league, despite never winning the defensive award. 
</P>
<P>
	``But no question in my mind, for two years running the best at  
stopping the ball,'' he said. ``She could guard 94 feet better than 
anybody I've coached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets played their first game Friday night since Perrot's  
death, losing 68-64 to the Los Angeles Sparks after rallying to tie 
the game with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very proud of the Comets,'' Chancellor said. ``We just  
fought and played our heart out and did everything that you humanly 
could do to win a game under the most difficult conditions ever in 
the history of women's basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Cynthia Cooper, Perrot's best friend, chose not to play  
and didn't dress. The league's two-time MVP missed her first game 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely missed her not playing, but at the same time,  
given the circumstances, we were just glad that she came,'' said 
Comets forward Sheryl Swoopes, who scored 25 points. ``She 
definitely helped us get through this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets had a game Saturday night at Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
	Many in the Forum crowd of 13,116 -- largest of the season -- wore  
a snippet of white ribbon above their hearts in Perrot's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Several fans displayed hand-lettered signs saluting Perrot. One  
read ``Kim Perrot, 4Ever in Our Hearts.'' Another read ``Go Comets 
Go. May you have strength and fortitude. Our prayers are with 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot was remembered in a brief halftime video that opened with  
her stealing the ball and scoring on a fingertip roll. Her smile 
was prominent in highlights from last season's WNBA championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kim was a wonderful person,'' Comets reserve center Tammy  
Jackson said. ``You can't take away the energy that she brought to 
this team, the love she brought to this team. She was something 
special to each individual person. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what the mood was, you knew Kim was going to come in  
and try to bring a smile or get you to laugh. It's going to be 
missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A public service to celebrate Perrot's life will be held Monday  
at Second Baptist Church in Houston, with several players 
participating. She will be buried Tuesday in her hometown of 
Lafayette, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when the team might recover from its grief, Chancellor  
said it would be a ``long time, when you lose someone like her.''

<HEADLINE> Gypsy Clan Suspected in Man's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was a reversal of tradition: On this wedding  
day, the bride carried the groom across the threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	She had to, authorities say. The 85-year-old husband-to-be was  
woozy and oblivious to the surroundings as he was lugged into a 
storefront Harlem church in August 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``voodoo reverend'' presided, conducting the first wedding of  
his career. The lone witness later became a police informant; he 
missed the ceremony but signed the marriage license anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty-two days later, newlywed Andrew Vlasto had swapped the  
marriage license for a death certificate, killed by a fatal 
cocktail of prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlasto's relatives met his wife at his deathbed. They soon  
suspected their new in-law, Sylvia Mitchell, was responsible for 
putting Vlasto there. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities now say they were right.  
</P>
<P>
	This spring, just months before the sixth anniversary of her  
wedding, the 33-year-old Mitchell was accused of killing Vlasto 
while looting his $500,000 estate. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged beneficiary was an infamous gypsy clan suspected of  
killing six elderly men on both coasts, then plundering their 
estates of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manhattan district attorney will prosecute Mitchell, who has  
pleaded innocent. But it was the dead man's nephew who first 
investigated Vlasto's death, first linked it to the other cases and 
then refused to let the case disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to make this a cause celebre, to show people around  
the country what's going on here. These people are killers,'' says 
the nephew, Jim Vlasto, once New York Gov. Hugh Carey's press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Vlasto was a perfect target, his nephew says. He was  
elderly, reclusive, wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a business. Killing people, getting their assets,'' Jim  
Vlasto says evenly. ``They know that if they act quickly enough, 
they can be in and out before anybody notices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vlasto noticed. Without him, those words could have been his  
uncle's epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Vlasto, an immigrant who arrived from Greece in 1945,  
settled comfortably into his new home. 
</P>
<P>
	His family founded America's first Greek-language newspaper in  
1894, and Andrew spent 29 years working there. He became prominent 
in the Greek Orthodox church and local politics, but stayed in 
touch with his family in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	In retirement, Vlasto rarely strayed far from the West 24th  
Street apartment where he lived alone. He strolled to nearby Greek 
diners and cafes for a bowl of soup or a glass of wine. He always 
paid cash; he owned no credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	He never wrote a check for more than his $250 monthly rent.  
</P>
<P>
	``A Spartan existence,'' Jim Vlasto remembers, one that belied a  
six-figure bank account and real estate holdings in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, in a local McDonald's, Vlasto met a young, dark-haired  
fortuneteller named Sylvia Mitchell. They chatted; she apparently 
failed to mention her man, Ephrem Tene-Bimbo, or their two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Ephrem was a member of the Tene-Bimbo family, a gypsy clan  
chronicled in Peter Maas' 1974 book ``King of Gypsies.'' Though 
most of the family now lived in California, Ephrem and Sylvia -- 
known to neighbors as Tom and Tina Goldman -- had a Manhattan 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until spring 1993, Mitchell said later, that her  
romance with the octogenarian bloomed. She recalled a whirlwind 
courtship, followed by an Aug. 19, 1993, wedding. Police Detective 
Michael Lentini, after an investigation, noted that ``Andrew Vlasto 
was unable to walk on his own'' on the day of the nuptials. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's version was more romantic.  
</P>
<P>
	The 85-year-old ``wanted very much to marry me,'' she said at a  
deposition after his death. ``He loved me and he wanted to give me 
the security of marriage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The honeymoon? Investigators gave this scenario:  
</P>
<P>
	Man and wife returned home, where wife established a joint bank  
account and acquired an ATM card. Within a month, $70,000 was 
funneled from Vlasto's account to an Atlantic City casino. Within 
two months, another $9,500 was withdrawn from ATM machines -- 19 
withdrawals at the maximum of $500 each. 
</P>
<P>
	All this was unknown to the Vlasto family, which was  
increasingly unable to reach Andrew. Mitchell was feeding him a 
steady diet of Valium, codeine and barbiturates, all provided by a 
cooperative pharmacist. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no more walks through the neighborhood, no more  
visits to sidewalk cafes. Disoriented and disinterested, Andrew 
Vlasto was a prisoner in his own apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	In early October, Andrew's alarmed relatives in Greece called  
Jim Vlasto with their worries. On Oct. 15, he and a friend went to 
his uncle's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andrew at doctor,'' read a sign on the door.  
</P>
<P>
	A series of phone calls led the nephew to Bellevue Hospital. For  
the second time in a month, he soon discovered, his uncle was 
hospitalized with a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vlasto rushed to Bellevue's intensive care unit, where he  
was barred from seeing Andrew -- on orders from his uncle's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``What wife?'' a stunned Vlasto remembers asking.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vlasto went to court, trying to save his uncle's life and  
assets. His efforts came too late on the first count; Andrew died 
Nov. 10, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife mourned by opposing an autopsy and staking claim to his  
estate. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vlasto, the dapper son of a Greek immigrant, was a  
well-known and well-liked New Yorker. He'd worked as spokesman for 
a pair of prominent local leaders, Carey and New York City Schools 
Chancellor Joseph Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	His work had introduced him to the city's elite. After his uncle  
died, Vlasto called Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau 
to lay out his suspicions about Sylvia Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vlasto demanded an autopsy. Despite Mitchell's protests, the  
hospital agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	After the autopsy, Mitchell shipped the body to a Greenwich  
Village funeral home and allowed the family just a one-hour 
viewing. Then Andrew Vlasto was buried in New Jersey in an unmarked 
grave, his nephew says. 
</P>
<P>
	It took five months to get the autopsy results. On April 24,  
1994, it was revealed that Andrew Vlasto died from what a 
prosecutor later called ``a cocktail of narcotic drugs'' -- a fatal 
mix of Valium, barbiturates and codeine. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, a nasty court battle was under way over his estate.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vlasto, the consummate public relations man, turned private  
investigator. He traced dozens of phone calls from his uncle's 
apartment to the Tene-Bimbo home. Eventually, he filled a file 
drawer with prescription records, autopsy reports, bank records and 
subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1994, in the middle of the estate battle, Vlasto read a  
newspaper story about a series of San Francisco deaths that echoed 
his uncle's demise. The May-December romances ended with funerals 
for five elderly men, all wooed by younger women. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Coast suspects were linked to the Tene-Bimbo family,  
authorities said. Vlasto was the first to make the connection with 
his uncle's case. In notes he kept about the probe, Vlasto wrote, 
``JV (Jim Vlasto) turns info from San Francisco to DA ... DA talks 
to SF police ... investigation takes new turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The West Coast probe, known as the ``Foxglove'' case, dated from  
1984. Eventually, eight people were indicted for stealing more than 
$1 million in property and cash from the victims' estates. The 
victims, between 87 and 94, were allegedly overdosed with the drug 
digitalis. The defendants in the San Francisco case are due back in 
court this October to answer the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vlasto stepped up his court fight, kept feeding his evidence  
to the Manhattan district attorney. (Prosecutors declined to 
comment on the role Vlasto's investigation played in the case.) 
Mitchell suddenly backed off her claim; an August 1994 agreement 
protected most of Andrew's estate, and she slipped off to Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vlasto felt the case was moving along.  
</P>
<P>
	But it took another five years, working with seven assistant  
district attorneys, before a 10-count indictment for manslaughter, 
grand larceny and perjury was returned this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Why so long?  
</P>
<P>
	``The time between the death and the indictment came as a result  
of an extensive investigation,'' says Sara Frank, spokeswoman for 
the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlasto disagrees. He says the case was given low priority even  
though, according to advocates for the elderly, senior citizens are 
increasingly the targets of scams. 
</P>
<P>
	``This all could have been done four years ago,'' Vlasto says.  
``The evidence is all the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, who now has four children with Tene-Bimbo, was  
arrested in Nevada. She waived extradition and returned to New York 
on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, Barry Fallick, expresses confidence she will be  
acquitted and reunited with her family. If he's wrong, Mitchell 
faces up to 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vlasto never mentions Mitchell by name -- ``that woman'' is  
his term of choice. Although he hopes for a guilty verdict, he 
feels that rescuing his uncle's estate and generating public 
attention already constitutes a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell avoided a murder charge because prosecutors believe the  
slaying was accidental. ``We may have overdosed him,'' she 
reportedly told a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mitchell sits in a New York jail, Andrew Vlasto's body  
remains in an unmarked grave. None of Vlasto's relatives has 
visited his uneasy resting place. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the trial is over, James Vlasto vows, he will visit the  
grave, then take his uncle home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to fly him back to Greece,'' Vlasto says, ``and bury  
him with our family.''

<HEADLINE> Gulf Coast Residents Brace for Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Coastal residents stocked up at  
gasoline pumps and hardware stores Saturday as Hurricane Bret 
threatened to end Texas' decade-long string of hurricane-free 
summers. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was posted Saturday for a 120-mile stretch  
of the Gulf Coast from La Pesca, Mexico, to Texas' Baffin Bay, 
between Brownsville and Corpus Christi. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Shell station inland in Harlingen, Ruben Ramirez bought  
bottles of water he said would be his only preparation for the 
storm. ``Everything else I leave up to the Lord,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No evacuations were ordered. However, surf was on the rise and  
Cameron County authorities warned that the causeway linking the 
popular recreational area of South Padre Island to the mainland 
would be closed late Saturday if wind reached gale force of about 
39 mph as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron County parks were closed Saturday and emergency  
officials urged people to move high-profile recreational vehicles 
off the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want any surfers out there,'' county Emergency  
Management Coordinator Desi Najera said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain was expected to move ashore during the night and 5 to 10  
inches of rain was possible in south Texas, the National Weather 
Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday Saturday, Bret was still centered about 235 miles  
southeast of Brownsville, the weather service said. It was moving 
westerly toward the Mexico coast, but even if it moved into Mexico 
rather than turning northward, it would still dump heavy rain along 
the lower Rio Grande Valley on the U.S.-Mexico border,. 
</P>
<P>
	Landfall was possible Sunday afternoon or evening, said  
meteorologist Joseph Wanja at the National Weather Service office 
in Brownsville . 
</P>
<P>
	County officials said about 6,000 sandbags had been filled as a  
precaution, and an additional 10,000 would be ordered for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get a jump on this thing because it's so close  
to us, because it could increase its forward movement speed,'' 
Najera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hasn't been hit by a hurricane since Jerry killed three  
people in October 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the state's 367-mile coast has been struck by tropical  
storms since then, including Charley, which dumped 18 inches of 
rain that killed 19 people in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Report: Feds Raid Bank of New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal investigators reportedly raided the Wall  
Street office of the Bank of New York in connection to a major 
international money-laundering scheme that authorities say involves 
the Russian mob. 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's raid, investigators seized the files of Natasha  
Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a senior vice president who supervised the 
bank's East European division, a source close to the bank told The 
New York Times in Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	She and a bank vice president in London, Lucy Edwards, were  
suspended on Wednesday. Both women are married to Russian 
businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	British authorities also searched Ms. Edwards' home and office.  
Her husband, Peter Berlin, had authority over some accounts at the 
bank. Neither she nor her husband has been accused of any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	However, investigators told the Times that the couple may be  
involved in one of the largest money-laundering operations ever 
conducted in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as $10 billion allegedly was laundered through the bank  
in what investigators say is an operation run by Russian organized

<HEADLINE>  Turkey Quake Survivors Defy Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Seven people who had been buried alive  
in the rubble of Turkey's quake for four long, hot days were saved 
Saturday, rewarding the faith of relatives who kept vigil even 
after experts said the odds of survival were slight. 
</P>
<P>
	A French team pulled an 11-year-old girl from the wreckage of a  
four-story building to applause and cheers of from onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
	American and Swiss teams saved an elderly woman in the hard-hit  
town of Izmit. Also rescued were a 10-year-old Israeli girl -- whose 
first wish was for a soda with a straw -- a 95-year-old woman; two 
sisters, ages 10 and 19; and a 9-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescues kept hope alive for relatives of the tens of  
thousands of people still missing following Tuesday's 7.4-magnitude 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet for every miracle survivor, hundreds of corpses are pulled  
from the rubble each day. The official death toll climbed by more 
than 2,000 Saturday to top 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say people trapped in such situations usually can  
survive only 72 hours because of dehydration, and the deadline in 
this case passed early Friday. The almost-tropical heat across the 
country this week only made conditions worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Some foreign rescue teams were leaving.  
</P>
<P>
	A Dutch team left Adapazari on Saturday, and a British team was  
preparing to depart. ``The reason we came here was to save people. 
That has ended,'' Edward Pearne, head of the British crew, was 
quoted by the Anatolia news agency as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss Disaster Chain also announced it would be going home  
Monday, having found no one alive since Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli girl, Shirin Franko, was ``practically in very good  
condition'' after having spent 98 hours trapped in the wreckage of 
a seven-story building, Dr. Eugene Leibovitz said. The Israeli 
military pediatrician examined her on site in Cinarcik, a small 
resort town 30 miles across the Sea of Marmara from Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	She was ``talking, conscious, and even ... joking,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A few hours earlier, rescuers had recovered her twin brother's  
body from the debris. Their father and grandparents were still 
buried and presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 130 Israeli soldiers were working with dogs, drills,  
and floodlights to search the site throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
	The twins' mother, Iris, had been anxiously standing by,  
watching the Israelis work since shortly after she herself was 
pulled from the rubble by locals on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother moved forward as the rescuers carefully extracted the  
girl from the ruins and placed her on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers poured water over Shirin's head, and Leibovitz gave  
her a quick exam, looking into her mouth and throat. She was 
extremely dehydrated and said her eyes hurt, her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirin, after being brought out of the ruins, asked rescuers,  
``Do you have a Coca Cola with ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With lemon?'' one of the rescuers asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Franko answered. ``With a can and a straw, or maybe a  
bottle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Yalova, another resort, crowds cheered when the French  
specialists pulled out 11-year-old Merve Ekinci. Her father, 
shaking with emotion, jumped out of an ambulance that had rushed 
him to the site to see her. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, a grimace of pain on her face, was wrapped in a  
blanket and rushed to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in the ruins of another vacation home in the same town,  
a 95-year-old woman was rescued by a Turkish team, weak but alive, 
and also taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	In the region around Izmit, near to where the epicenter was  
located, American and Swiss teams together saved another elderly 
woman from the ruins. 
</P>
<P>
	A unit of a Miami-Dade rescue team spotted the Swiss rescuers  
working on a site as they were traveling through the area. The 
dozen U.S. rescuers helped lift the woman from the wreckage and 
give first aid to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was in serious condition, but was able to talk,'' said  
Rafael Pozo, the team's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Another French team down the coast in Golcuk rescued two  
sisters, ages 19 and 10, with the help of Turkish volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	And a Greek rescue team pulled a 9-year-old boy alive from a  
collapsed building in Degirmendere, near Izmit, after a 17-hour 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very difficult operation but in the end we returned  
the boy to his family,'' a spokesman for the Greek team, Mihalis 
Panousopoulos, told Greece's state-run NET television.

<HEADLINE> Perrot Service To Be Held Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A memorial service will be held Monday for  
Houston Comets point guard Kim Perrot, who died Thursday after a 
long battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas A&AMP;M women's basketball coach Peggie Gillom was among those  
in the room when the 32-year-old Perrot died at a Houston hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillom was an assistant coach with the WNBA's Comets before  
taking the job at Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillom told KPRC-TV on Friday that she had gone to be with  
Perrot during her alternative treatment in Tijuana, Mexico. They 
returned together last weekend to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was fighting it to the end,'' Gillom said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gillom said Perrot touched so many lives, but she prefers that  
her friend be remembered for her on-the-court talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see Kim in the bed suffering. I don't see Kim and her  
last breath. I see Kim Perrot on that floor, telling the Houston 
Comets what to do and schooling the rest of her opponents and being 
a pest,'' Gillom said. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service has been scheduled for 11 a.m. Monday at  
Second Baptist Church.

<HEADLINE>  Actress Bids for U.S. Archery Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Geena Davis found out she was a good  
shot on a movie set. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old actress is now ranked 22nd in the nation in  
women's archery and is competing this weekend to qualify for the 
next Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have learned as an adult that I'm fairly athletic,'' Davis  
said Friday as she practiced for semifinals of the U.S. Olympic 
trials, which began this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of ``Thelma and Louise'' and ``The Accidental Tourist''  
-- for which she won an Oscar in 1988 -- has surprised archers with 
her quick rise in a sport that doesn't normally capture much 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Camera crews on Friday surrounded Davis, wearing a floppy blue  
hat and sunglasses, as she calmly fired off 60 arrows to a target 
70 meters away. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she would make the team, it would be unbelievable for our  
sport,'' said Denise Parker, the top-ranked woman in the nation. 
``The question is, does she want to be in the spotlight in this 
environment?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis discovered she had great aim while training to fire  
handguns for her part as an assassin in 1996's ``The Long Kiss 
Goodnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She kept her hobby a secret from Hollywood and the public,  
despite winning a tournament or two, until she finished 29th out of 
300 women in Ohio to qualify for the Olympic semifinals. Four of 
the 32 semifinalists dropped out, making Davis one of 28 competing 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	That number will drop by Monday to eight women who will compete  
next month in California for three team spots and one alternate 
spot at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' coach Don Rabska, an archer for more than 30 years, said  
she has mastered a concentration during her acting career that 
helps her as an archer. Archery, he said, is all about finesse and 
mental toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has been practicing five hours a day, shooting about 300  
arrows. She had a target range set up on the set of her latest 
film, ``Stuart Little.'' She also goes to the gym five days a week 
to work out on the treadmill and lift weights. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Davis: ``I don't feel that I've yet discovered how good I  
can get.''

<HEADLINE> Low-Key Lawyer in Military Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- His law office is not much bigger than a  
storage room tucked away on the second floor of a two-story brick 
building. His name is not even among the attorneys listed on the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Spinner has no business cards set out in the foyer. He has  
no staff of investigators or researchers. His only employee is a 
part-time one -- his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner is so low-key that he sometimes surprises even his own  
clients expecting an entourage when he arrives to defend them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is everybody?'' a client once asked him when he arrived  
in Tokyo with only his briefcase and one bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well,'' he replied, ``this is all you get.''  
</P>
<P>
	Although he has been practicing law for 20 years and has at  
least 200 cases under his belt, Frank Spinner is not exactly a 
marquee name. This is not Johnnie Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the world of military law, he's a star. In the past five  
years as a civilian defense lawyer in military cases, the former 
career officer has been at the center of one high-profile case 
after another, many of them politically charged with sex and 
scandal and headlines: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Kelly Flinn, the B-52 bomber pilot whose affair with a married  
man led to demands she be discharged, which in turn led to a 
national debate about gender equality and morals in the armed 
forces; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Army Gen. David Hale, accused of seducing the wives of his  
officers; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Marine Capt. Richard Ashby, who faced court-martial this year  
in the deaths of 20 people at an Italian ski resort after his 
low-flying fighter jet severed a gondola cable. 
</P>
<P>
	The limelight is something new for the 48-year-old Spinner, who  
served as an Air Force lawyer before retiring in 1994 with the rank 
of lieutenant colonel. 
</P>
<P>
	His clients say he is an able, experienced counsel who is not  
afraid to take on the establishment and who knows how to use the 
press to plead their cases to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	His detractors within the military perceive him as sometimes  
using the press to make the military justice system look bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure they understand that my intent is just to  
represent my client and then engage in a public debate and let the 
public decide what they will,'' Spinner says. 
</P>
<P>
	The word has spread that he represents his clients so well, both  
as an attorney and friend, that he has to pass some of his cases 
off to other attorneys. ``I don't even have my cards out,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	And he adds, joking: ``I'm a 20-year overnight sensation.''  
</P>
<P>
	The truth is, he says, ``I never had a dream I want to grow up  
and be a lawyer some day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner once planned to become a pilot. At another stage, his  
strong faith pointed him toward the seminary and a career as a 
minister, following in the footsteps of his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Spinner, 70, who now lives in La Veta, Colo., is a  
retired Presbyterian pastor. He retired from the Air Force as a 
personnel officer in 1972, then entered the seminary. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a strong influence in my life,'' says the son.  
</P>
<P>
	But then, in 1974, just as he was thinking of getting out of the  
Air Force and studying divinity himself -- with further plans to 
return as a military chaplain -- the Air Force offered him a deal he 
couldn't turn down: law school and a chance to get out of remote 
Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota where he was a missile launch 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	In return he would spend a career in the Air Force, which was  
having trouble keeping lawyers in the service. He received his law 
degree in 1977 from St. Mary's University School of Law in San 
Antonio, Texas, where he was born. Eventually, he wound up teaching 
law at the Air Force Academy from which he resigned as a cadet in 
1970 to get married. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of work, he participates in services, prayer and  
fellowship at the Fairfax Covenant Church, just down the road from 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really keeps my feet on the ground and focused on the  
really important things in life,'' he says. ``When you're in the 
middle of a hurricane -- and some of these cases have been like 
hurricanes because of the publicity and press -- it really is 
important that you know what the ultimate values are. If I ever 
lose my sense of direction, then I'm not sure I can be effective 
for my clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the Hale and Ashby cases, he attended a religious  
group's conference for attorneys and their spouses, which he called 
refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's through that that I can keep my marriage strong and my  
law practice strong,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was acquitted in March of involuntary manslaughter in the  
ski gondola deaths. But he was convicted in May of obstruction of 
justice for helping get rid of a videotape shot during the flight. 
He was sentenced to six months in confinement at Camp LeJeune, 
N.C., and dismissal from the Marines. Spinner is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Anderson, Ashby's mother, who sat through both trials,  
calls Spinner ``a man of God . . . He believes in Rich and his 
innocence. Frank and his family opened their home to Rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said in an e-mail response to written questions that he  
hired Spinner over other high-profile attorneys because a family 
friend, also an attorney, recommended him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew Frank had the experience ...,'' said Ashby. ``We also  
like that he was a devout Christian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby recalled that the first time they met, Spinner made him  
feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I could trust him,'' Ashby said. ``I felt like he truly  
believed in my innocence. I also felt he didn't just want to defend 
me, but wanted to get to know me as a person and a friend. I needed 
that because I would be trusting him with my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Ashby said, Spinner could ``argue a point on the fly as  
if he had practiced it all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner says his highest profile case was that of Lt. Kelly  
Flinn, the United States' first and only B-52 woman pilot. In 1997, 
she was facing a possible court-martial on charges of adultery and 
disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
	The then 26-year-old pilot was charged with having an affair  
with a married civilian, lying about it to superiors and disobeying 
an order to end it; she was also charged with fraternization for a 
brief affair with an enlisted man. 
</P>

	Flinn initially held out for an honorable discharge, which would  
have allowed her to fly in the reserves; the Air Force sought a 
general discharge, under honorable conditions. In the end it came 
down to whether Flinn would face a jail sentence if the case went 
to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't guarantee that she would not get jail time, and so  
she had to factor that into her consideration,'' recalls Spinner, 
who advised taking the general discharge. In the end, that's what 
she did. Flinn declined to comment for this article. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of heavy press coverage of that case, it was  
revealed that Spinner had sent to the Secretary of the Air Force a 
list of cases of officers who he says had engaged in comparable 
misconduct but who had not been tried by court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never intended to disclose the identities,'' he says. ``I  
think it helped but it also was combined with what I saw as public 
pressure to achieve a reasonable outcome . . . because people in 
their own experience questioned whether this was the type of case 
that would go to a court-martial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner knows how to use the press, say military prosecutors,  
including Maj. Mike Mulligan, chief of criminal law for the III 
Armored Corps at Fort Hood, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Kelly Flinn was a press victory,'' Mulligan says. ``I  
think he got out in front of the story that he wanted to tell ... I 
don't think Kelly Flinn was a sex case. I think Kelly Flinn was 
about disregarding orders, about lying, and if you ask John Q. 
Public what Kelly Flinn was about, it was a sex case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulligan was Spinner's adversary in the Hale case, and the  
prosecutor says, ``I consider him a student of the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hale case ended in a plea bargain under which the general  
was heavily fined but escaped prison time. Admitting sexual 
involvement with the wives of officers serving under him, he 
pleaded guilty to seven counts of conduct unbecoming an officer and 
one count of making false official statements. 
</P>
<P>
	The case that first brought Spinner to prominence was that of  
Air Force Capt. Jim Wang. Wang was charged with dereliction of duty 
in an accidental, ``friendly fire'' shootdown of two Black Hawk 
helicopters that killed 26 people over Iraq in April 1994. A 
military jury cleared him a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang had never heard of Spinner but hired him on the  
recommendation of his military counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't after high profile,'' Wang said in a recent  
telephone interview from his current duty station at Scott Air 
Force Base in Illinois. ``We were after an individual that knew the 
ins and outs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wang says they were able to capitalize on good media relations.  
``I know that's one of the things that he takes advantage of,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner also makes good use of the military counsel assigned to  
his clients for preliminary work, including two lieutenant colonels 
in the Hale case. The availability of military counsel is one 
reason he does not have a large staff. The other is that he doesn't 
want the headaches of running an office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I travel to the cases so I'm working out of their offices most  
of the time,'' says Spinner. ``I'm a strong team player. On 
occasion, some of my clients have said, `I'm not sure I trust my 
military lawyer. I may want to fire him.' I say, `No, we're a 
team.' They know the local territory and the judges and the 
personalities at their base and in their offices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner adds his own expertise. ``I understand military juries.  
I understand military commanders. I know where the skeletons are 
buried in the military justice system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military attorneys, alternating between service as defense  
counsel, prosecutors and judges, feel pressures that civilian 
lawyers do not, Spinner says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a certain reluctance to be too outspoken because  
you're really part of the system,'' he says. ``There may be 
concerns about promotion, about my next assignment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph E. Cazenavette, an attorney who worked with Spinner in  
the Air Force and who now practices civilian law in the same 
building, says when Spinner steps into a case the opposition gets 
uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know,'' he says, ``that when Frank enters the scene, it  
could be a high profile case that will become media noise. They 
don't like the light shining on them. They'll go to any end to try 
to dispense with the case...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why does he embrace the media?  
</P>
<P>
	Spinner says: ``I see it as we're waging a war. We're fighting  
for my client in court but we're fighting for my client's 
reputation out of court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helping with the media and with running his office when he is on  
the road -- 80,000 frequent flyer miles a year -- is the youngest of 
his three daughters, Heather, 24, a finance major at George Mason 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	When he retired from the Air Force, he thought he would be  
playing golf. ``My wife had a good income,'' he says. ``With her 
income and my retirement pay from the Air Force we're in six 
digits. So what I'm making from my law practice is just gravy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Paula, a senior cost analyst with a private firm, has  
accepted his frequent absences, going back to his days in the 
military. ``She knows that this is my passion and she respects 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner feels he's doing just what he should. ``If I were not  
doing what I'm doing now, I would probably be in some form of 
Christian lay work. That would be my next choice. If I was 
faithful, and if God put me here to do this type of work, then he 
would bless my work. I believe that's happened.''

<HEADLINE>  NFL Official Hurt in Cleveland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- NFL official Ron Liebsack suffered a broken leg  
and sprained knee Saturday night during the exhibition game between 
the Cleveland Browns and Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Liebsack, a side judge covering the goal line, had thrown a  
penalty flag when Browns running back Terry Kirby fell out of 
bounds, rolling up on Liebsack's left leg. The accident occurred 
late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Liebsack laid on the ground for a few minutes and was eventually  
carted off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby caught a pass from Browns quarterback Ty Detmer in the  
middle of the field, cut outside and was trying to break into the 
end zone when he hit Liebsack. The Browns were called for holding 
on the play.
