<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Diamond Embargo Mulled  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Britain is proposing that the U.N.
Security Council impose a diamond embargo on Sierra Leone to
prevent rebels from financing their renewed war against the
government, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is expected to circulate a draft resolution in the next
few days recommending an embargo be imposed on all diamond sales
that aren't certified by the government, British and U.S. officials
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There is no certification process in place now, so the embargo
would cover all diamond exports from the war-weary West African
nation until a program certifying the government origin of the
diamonds is created, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The council is considering the embargo as a way of strangling
the Revolutionary United Front rebels' access to money and weapons.
The London-based organization Global Witnesses estimates that
rebels earned $200 million a year from 1991-1999 in diamond sales,
which they used to buy arms. They have used the supplies to break a
peace agreement signed last year and resume fighting against the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels control roughly 90 percent of the country's diamond
mines, with many of the gems passing through neighboring Liberia
and into the world's diamond markets. The rebels took 500 U.N.
hostages last month, two days after the United Nations announced it
was deploying to the key diamond-mining town of Koidu, which is
held by the RUF.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how the council would deal with the Liberian
trade, since President Charles Taylor, an ally of RUF leader Foday
Sankoh, was instrumental last month in securing the release of the
captured U.N. peacekeepers. The British official said the council
would have to create a monitoring mechanism to ensure the ban is
being respected -- including by Taylor -- and to spotlight any
violations.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 5, Tigers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Francisco Cordova took a shutout into the
eighth inning to win his third consecutive start as the Pittsburgh
Pirates beat the Detroit Tigers 5-1 in a rain-delayed game Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova (4-4) allowed one run and six hits in seven-plus innings
after sitting through a rain delay of 2 hours, 1 minute before the
game. He walked two and struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova pitched out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the sixth
and escaped after putting runners at second and third with nobody
out in the second.
</P>
<P>
   He left in the eighth inning after walking Rich Becker and
giving up a single to Rob Fick.
</P>
<P>
   Wil Cordero had three hits, including his ninth home run, as
Dave Mlicki (2-7) lost his second consecutive start.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero got a two-out single in the first and scored on Brian
Giles' triple. Cordero homered in the third and the Pirates' third
run scored on first baseman Rob Fick's error in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Giles doubled in the seventh off reliever Allen McDill and
scored on John Vander Wal's single. Luis Sojo had a RBI single
later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova gave up a single to Bobby Higginson and a double to Dean
Palmer to start the second inning. He struck out Damion Easley, got
Deivi Cruz on a soft liner and struck out Javier Cardona.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova allowed a double, single and walk in the sixth but
struck out Palmer and got Easley to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   After Cordova left, Jose Silva gave up a sacrifice fly to Juan
Encarnacion, then struck out two batters.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Tigers were without Juan Gonzalez, who fouled a ball
off his left foot in Sunday's game. ... Cardona singled in the
fifth for his first major league hit. It was his second game and
third at bat. ... Pirates 2B Warren Morris left the game in the
fourth with a bruised right ankle, the result of a foul ball. ...
Vander Wal left with a mild concussion after he was kneed in the
head by 2B Easley on a double play pivot in the seventh. ... The
announced paid attendance was 12,479 but there weren't more than
1,000 people in the stands when the game started at 9:06 p.m.

Indonesia Quake Rescue Intensifies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BENGKULU, Indonesia (AP) -- The search for survivors and victims of a massive
earthquake intensified Tuesday on the island of Sumatra, where victims lay three
to a bed outside a ravaged hospital and rumbling aftershocks kept scared
survivors outdoors. Officials on the Indonesian island reported downed
communications and desperately stretched emergency services in the wake of the
quake, which crushed many victims when their poorly built houses caved in on
them while they slept. The official death toll stood at 58 on the Indonesian
island. However, a local newspaper claimed 94 had died in Sunday night's
magnitude 7.9 quake.

Kids' Behavioral Problems Said Soar
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- New research suggests that the number of U.S. youngsters with
emotional and behavioral problems soared in the past two decades, in part
because of more poor and single-parent households. The findings, echoing other
recent studies, are based on surveys of pediatricians on more than 21,000
patients. The researchers said it is not a case of doctors getting better at
recognizing and diagnosing emotional and behavioral problems. Instead, they said
there is a real increase in such problems among youngsters. The researchers
found that problems such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression
and learning disabilities more than doubled from 1979 to 1996.

   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- President Clinton on Monday praised the announcement

entomb the plant forever. It comes atop about $200 million the United States has
already spent to improve nuclear safety in Ukraine. The April 26, 1986, accident
spread radioactive material over much of Europe. The Ukrainian government has

many more killed in the massive cleanup operation and others who later died of

<HEADLINE> Devils 3, Stars 1  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The kids from New Jersey are one victory away from
giving the old man the going-away gift he wanted: the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's kiddie corps got goals from rookies John Madden and
Brian Rafalski in a momentum-swinging flurry in the third period
and the Devils beat the Dallas Stars 3-1 Monday night for a 3-1
lead in the Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils can claim the Stanley Cup for the second time in five
years -- and for outgoing owner John McMullen -- by winning Game 5
Thursday night in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fifteen wins doesn't get you a Stanley Cup; 16 does,'' said
Rafalski, who was playing for a different cup last spring, for the
Finnish championship. ''But we don't want this series to drag on
any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the 82-year-old McMullen, who is already disliked
in Texas for once threatening to sell the Houston Astros. Hours
after deciding to sell the Devils to the YankeesNets conglomerate
in mid-March after 18 years of ownership, he made an unusual and
very personal locker room plea to his players: Please win the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   One more victory, and they will.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not businessmen, we're players,'' goaltender Martin
Brodeur said. ''We're sorry Dr. McMullen has to sell the team. We
want to win it for him, all of us do, but we can't get distracted
from what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as coach Larry Robinson predicted they could, the Devils
stole into ever-confident Dallas to win both games against a
veteran team that rarely loses at home and was coming off a road
victory in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got our heart ripped out from us a little bit tonight,''
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Stars have dug themselves a hole nearly
as big as the Lone Star State. Only one team in 58 years, the 1942
Toronto Maple Leafs against Detroit, has rallied from a 3-1 deficit
to win the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to make history here,'' Brenden Morrow of the Stars
said. ''We've been playing through adversity all year and playing
well under pressure. And we've got a lot of pressure right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a comeback can happen, of course; only two weeks ago, New
Jersey rallied from just such a deficit to win the Eastern
Conference finals against Philadelphia. The Devils are 6-1 since
starting that comeback, with four victories on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having come through a series ourselves when we were down and
seemingly out of it, we know it can happen,'' said Robinson, a
former assistant coach who replaced the fired Robbie Ftorek with
eight games left in the regular season. No Stanley Cup-winning
coach has been hired so late in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had won 11 of its last 12 home playoff games before
losing 2-1 in Game 3 Saturday, then lost a lead -- and, possibly,
the Cup -- in a three-goal span of 3 minutes, 41 seconds in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's comeback from a 1-0 deficit -- Dallas was 11-0 when
leading after two periods -- was remarkably swift and stunning and
caused some of the Stars' towel-waving faithful to turn on their
own team. Unless the Stars win Thursday, it was their last home
game of the season, a predicament their fans clearly did not
expect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went from quite a high to quite a low in a short period of
time,'' Hitchcock said. ''To give it away that quickly ... the
thing that has dominated is their ability to defend is better than
ours right now, and they're turning them into offensive
opportunities. All three goals were made off terrific defensive
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Brylin made sure the Stars couldn't protect the 1-0 lead
generated by Joe Nieuwendyk's power-play goal late in the second
period, scoring on a 4-on-2 break 2:27 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Malakhov dropped the puck into the slot for Alexander
Mogilny, whose shot rebounded directly to Brylin for his second
goal of the series and third of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal clearly deflated the Stars -- they had begun to dominate
play after going without a shot for 12 minutes of the second period
-- and re-energized the Devils, who are 9-2 in playoff road games.
</P>
<P>
   Even an interference penalty on Colin White didn't disrupt the
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Madden, stopped on a nearly identical play less than a minute
before, raced down the right side and sailed a shot by Ed Belfour,
who had shut out the Devils for the first 42:27. Madden had a
league-high six shorthanded goals during the season after scoring
23 shorthanded goals in college at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't play like rookies, they play like veterans,''
Devils defenseman Scott Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, Rafalski, yet another rookie
upstaging the Stars' cast of highly paid and long-productive
veterans, sealed it. He skated to the puck in the neutral zone and
got loose on a breakaway to beat Belfour at 6:08.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw some space behind (defenseman) Sergei Zubov and just
took off,'' said Rafalski, who played in Europe the last four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, Rafalski made a couple of defensive mistakes that led
to goals by Brett Hull and a 2-1 Stars victory but, Rafalski said,
''You've got to put it behind you. They only won one game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were fined $10,000 Monday by the NHL for not showing
up for media interviews Sunday. Hitchcock must be wondering if
fines aren't warranted for not showing up for the biggest game of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we could have bought us some time with the two days
off (before Game 5), but they've got the momentum now,'' Hitchcock
said. ''You go from such a level of confidence to 'Boom!'''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey had been almost impenetrable on the power play for
the entire playoffs, allowing four goals in 59 chances and killing
off three earlier in the game, until Nieuwendyk came out of his
scoring slump.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, last year's playoff MVP but scoreless for five games
since linemate Jamie Langenbrunner got hurt, got free in the crease
to put a backhander by Martin Brodeur off Darryl Sydor's slap shot
from the left circle at 18:02 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   But while Nieuwendyk finally scored, the Stars' other big names,
including Hull and Mike Modano, again were shut out by Brodeur, who
had an eventful night in goal despite facing only 17 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the NHL worried, TV ratings for the finals are low --
about one-third those for Sunday's Blazers-Lakers NBA game -- and
the scoring is even lower in this series for two teams that have
perfected the neutral zone trap.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the last two games, while featuring only seven goals,
have been surprisingly up-and-down, with lots of flurries -- the
biggest of all by New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to try to take it to them again on Thursday,''
Rafalski said. ''When a team is down 3-1, and we were in that
situation the last round ... hopefully, we will learn from Philly's
letdown and take advantage of the situation.''

<HEADLINE> Kids' Behavioral Problems Said Soar  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The number of U.S. youngsters with emotional and
behavioral problems has soared in the past two decades in part
because of more poor and single-parent households, a new study
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that problems such as attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression and learning
disabilities more than doubled from 1979 to 1996. Such conditions
were identified in 6.8 percent of all doctor visits in 1979 and in
18.7 percent of visits in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which appear in the June issue of the journal
Pediatrics and echo those in other recent studies, are based on
surveys of pediatricians on more than 21,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in doctor training in identifying such problems did
not account for the increases, said Dr. Kelly Kelleher of the
University of Pittsburgh and Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, the
study's lead author.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the highest identification rates were for doctors who
trained in the 1970s and before.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest instead that most of the change was due to
''an increase in problems and the kinds of patients they're
seeing,'' said Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were associated with increases in the proportions of
single-parent families and Medicaid enrollment from 1979 to 1996,
the researchers said. Fifteen percent of patients in the 1979 study
lived in single-parent homes, compared with 22 percent in the 1996
study. Just 6 percent of the earlier patients were on Medicaid,
compared with 18 percent of the 1996 patients.
</P>
<P>
   However, pediatricians are geared primarily to deal with
''acute'' problems in which ''children come in, the doctor gives
them medicine, the children go away,'' Kelleher said. Doctors will
be ineffective unless the system is restructured to allow
pediatricians to act more like mental-health professionals and
spend more time with chronic ailments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors examined data from a 1979 survey of 30 Rochester,
N.Y.-area pediatricians, and compared the results with 1996 data
from a government-funded study of 395 pediatricians nationwide. A
total of 21,065 patients ages 4 to 15 were involved.
</P>
<P>
   The largest changes were in attention deficit/hyperactivity,
which increased from 1.4 percent to 9.2 percent, and emotional
problems such as anxiety and depression, which increased from a
negligible amount to 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Lavigne, chief psychologist at Children's Memorial Hospital
in Chicago, said that despite the researchers' findings, some of
the increase can probably be attributed to pediatricians getting
better at recognizing the problems.
</P>
<P>
   The study ''means that doctors before must have been
underestimating the problem,'' Lavigne said. ''Chances are they've
increased their ability to recognize them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez hit a three-run homer and Edgar
Martinez followed with a solo shot as the Seattle Mariners beat the
Colorado Rockies 6-2 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured the American and National League players of
the month in May -- Edgar Martinez and Todd Helton. Martinez had the
better day with a double and his 18th homer. Helton went 0-for-4 to
lower his major league-leading average to .410.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez went 3-for-3, and is 5-for-7 with a double, a triple
and a home run over the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele (6-2) allowed one unearned run and five hits in seven
innings to win his fourth straight decision. He matched his season
high with seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 2-1 in the fourth, the Mariners jumped on Colorado
starter Masato Yoshii (1-7) for four runs after two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson singled, Mike Cameron doubled him to third and
Rodriguez followed with his 16th homer. Martinez followed his
homer, the third time the Mariners have hit back-to-back home runs
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii allowed six runs and eight hits in 3 2-3 innings. Scott
Karl pitched the final 4 1-3 innings for Colorado, allowing no runs
and two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin opened the game with a single off Sele. He stole
second and advanced to third on a throwing error by catcher Dan
Wilson. Neifi Perez followed with a sacrifice fly to make it 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle answered in the first with a run. Henderson walked,
stole second, advanced to third on a flyout and scored on a wild
pitch. Yoshii walked three in the first but escaped a bases-loaded
jam by getting David Bell to foul out.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez singled to start the third, advanced to third on a
double by Martinez and scored on John Olerud's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Mayne hit a solo homer in the ninth off Jose Mesa for
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Helton is hitting .500 at home and .327 on the road. ...
Martinez is hitting (11-for-29) with four homers and eight RBIs
against the Rockies. ... Martinez's first-inning walk was the 900th
of his career. ... The crowd of 25,582 is the second smallest ever
in 70 games at Safeco Field. ... Seattle's first five batters went
9-for-18 (.500). ... Yoshii's 3 2-3 innings matches his shortest
outing of the season. ... The Rockies are 1-5 in Seattle, and this
was their first game at Safeco Field.

<HEADLINE> Old Kosovo Leader Builds New Ones  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the search for leaders with
enough stature and experience to guide Kosovo into an uncertain
future, Kosovo Albanians are turning to an old guard former
communist who once ran the province for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmut Bakalli used to run the place as head of the Kosovo wing
of the communist party until he was fired in 1981 for allegedly
failing to prevent Albanian student riots.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old Bakalli says he's too old to run for public
office or challenge the younger generation of would-be leaders,
many of whom began their careers in the student movement which cost
Bakalli his job.
</P>
<P>
   However, political insiders here are turning to Bakalli for his
advice and his insights into Balkan politics. He is re-emerging as
a player in the political scene and taking on the role of elder
statesman in a society which honors men who have managed to stick
it out over time.
</P>
<P>
   That makes him important in Kosovo, where several people claim
the mantle of ethnic Albanian leadership and where no one has
clearly emerged to take on that role.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a charismatic leader in Kosovo,'' Bakalli said,
chuckling over the understatement. ''But it doesn't mean they
aren't good leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for leaders is critical in this southern province of
Yugoslavia that is only barely coming to grips with democratic
development, recently emerging from a decade of oppression under
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic after the fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   The furtive steps toward democracy are that much more critical
for Kosovo now, as it enters preparatory stages for local elections
in the fall. Western leaders hope the race for municipal offices
will start the process of having someone emerge whom the province's
ethnic Albanians --and perhaps its Serbs -- will actually follow.
</P>
<P>
   In a study clogged with a stuffed Albanian eagle, a 5-foot brown
bear and a dozen other mounted animal heads, Bakalli, whose twin
passions are politics and hunting, leans forward, taps his long
cigarette holder against an ashtray and offers predictions for the
tangled world of Kosovo politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''My vision is that the Serbs and the Albanians will live
together,'' he told The Associated Press. ''But the Serbs have to
change something in their heads -- that they are citizens of
Pristina, not of Belgrade. They haven't grasped that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among his critics, Bakalli wins esteem in some respects for
being the last strongman that people remember as actually being
strong, the man who refused to back down to Yugoslavia's leaders
who fired him because he wouldn't let army tanks roll onto
Pristina's streets during the 1981 unrest.
</P>
<P>
   He was part of the Kosovo Albanian delegation to the failed
Rambouillet peace talks last year and talked about the necessity
for international mediation before the negotiation process even
started. When the talks in France failed, he talked of the
importance behind NATO's coming to Kosovo, long before the bombings
even began.
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect this man,'' said Baton Haxhiu, chief editor of the
province's most prestigious newspaper, Koha Ditore.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's active leaders, meanwhile, haven't exactly galvanized
the population.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Rugova led a campaign of passive resistance against
Milosevic and emerged as Kosovo's most popular leader according to
a Gallup poll in February. But since NATO troops and U.N. officials
took over Kosovo last year, he has shunned the spotlight and
avoided the risk of making unpopular political positions.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Hashim Thaci, the former political leader of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, emerged from the war as a hero but saw his
support erode because of his association with the ineffectual and
often hapless U.N. mission, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   And now there is a third factor: Ramush Haradinaj, a former KLA
commander whose profile has risen of late, particularly after a
beating he received in a scuffle with NATO peacekeepers won him
sympathy among ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Bakalli said he's helped Haradinaj with the nuts and bolts of
organizing a political party, mostly because he believed people in
Kosovo needed a third choice. Bakalli's influence on Haradinaj is
clear in the 31-year-old leader's pronouncements about the need for
peaceful coexistence between Kosovo's Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bakalli the politician knows he himself wouldn't have
much of a chance of winning any election contest, tainted as he is
by his communist past. He sees himself as more of a link between
Kosovo's past and its dreams of an independent future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to make a movement of people for tolerance between
ethnic groups in general and to one another, between people and
political parties -- every time we speak,'' he said. ''If we don't
do that, I'm afraid ... we will lose our individual chance for
prosperity.''

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Shakes Central Turkey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook central Turkey
early Tuesday, killing at least two people and sending residents
miles away running from their homes in panic, the Anatolia news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven other people were injured in the magnitude 5.9
quake, mostly from jumping out of windows and off balconies, the
agency said, quoting Interior Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
   The quake's epicenter was the town of Cerkes in Cankiri
province, some 60 miles north of the capital, Ankara, Istanbul's
Kandilli Observatory said. It lasted about 30 seconds and was felt
in several central provinces and along the Black Sea coast.
</P>
<P>
   One person was killed in Cerkes after jumping from a building,
Anatolia said. Another was killed in the town of Cubuk, near
Ankara, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cankiri, people fled their homes and police were warning them
not to return, private newschannel NTV reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''A loud noise woke us up and we rushed to the street,'' Zeynep
Gokmen told Kanal D television. ''Everyone rushed to the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people also left their homes in Ankara, where the
temblor was strong enough to rattle walls.
</P>
<P>
   Two powerful earthquakes struck northwestern Turkey in August
and November killing more than 18,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Vote To Test Independence  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After three years of virtual
independence, Montenegro faces elections that will measure the
strength of the Yugoslav republic's pro-Western leadership and its
rivals who support Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The test comes Sunday when voters in the capital of Podgorica
and coastal town of Herceg Novi choose municipal officials.
Although the elections are local, the outcome will have major
implications for all of Yugoslavia since one-third of Montenegro's
voters live in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing by President Milo Djukanovic's Democratic Party
of Socialists would reaffirm popular support for his pro-Western
policies and solidify his grip on power despite opposition from
Milosevic and his allies in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic faces an intense challenge from the Socialist
People's Party, headed by Yugoslavia's prime minister and Milosevic
ally, Momir Bulatovic. A strong showing by Bulatovic's party would
raise questions whether Djukanovic can resist pressure from
Belgrade or continue policies which have made Montenegro all but
independent of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   More is at stake than simply mayoral and city council posts.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the right time to get rid of this government of
traitors,'' Bulatovic said at a recent rally. He accused Western
powers of ''trying to destroy the historic brotherhood of the
Montenegrin and Serbian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1998, Djukanovic has steered a difficult
course between Montenegrins who remain loyal to Belgrade and those
who want the republic of 600,000 people to declare full
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have their own armed forces. Djukanovic controls the
republic's 20,000-member police force, which is equipped with an
array of weaponry. The pro-Milosevic Yugoslav armed forces maintain
an army group in Montenegro along with naval forces since
Montenegro is Yugoslavia's only outlet to the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Those troops, estimated at 25,000, constitute the most important
remaining symbol of federal authority, albeit a strong one.
</P>
<P>
   While federal army troops rarely venture outside the barracks,
the pro-Djukanovic police are always present on the streets,
stopping cars and checking identity papers of anybody remotely
suspected of being a possible troublemaker sent by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures did not help Djukanovic's top security adviser,
Zoran Zugic, who was shot dead last week outside his apartment in
Podgorica. No arrests have been announced, but many Montenegrins
suspect Milosevic's regime played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the assassination, Djukanovic met with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who reiterated American
support to his government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the election campaign has brought out hardline
supporters from both the pro and anti-Belgrade camps. The rhetoric
suggests that the two camps are so far apart that they may be
irreconcilable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yugoslavia is dead,'' says Miomir Mugosa, Djukanovic's close
aide and his party's candidate for Podgorica mayor. ''We are not
separatists. We simply cannot tie our future to the war crimes
suspect, to the man notorious for spreading death and
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Milosevic camp ridicules Djukanovic's promises of a
''better life'' for Montenegrins and his links to foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been a better life, but only for a small majority in
the government and their clans,'' says Predrag Bulatovic, the
pro-Belgrade camp's candidate for Podgorica mayor. He is no
relation to Prime Minister Bulatovic.
</P>
<P>
   The mayoral candidate Bulatovic says that the fact that
international sanctions against Yugoslavia do not apply to
Montenegro is a proof that ''the United States and NATO, the powers
that just want to use Montenegro to accomplish own interest in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Bitterness among the pro-Belgrade supporters grew after last
year's NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, which included targets in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing, Djukanovic took a major step toward
independence by introducing the German mark as the alternative
currency. The Yugoslav dinar has since become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   More than $100 million of Western loans and aid have come to
Montenegro over the past three years while Yugoslavia's main
republic, Serbia, languishes in international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Mugosa praised the government's market reforms and efforts
toward privatization, criticized as a sham by opponents. He pointed
out that the average monthly salary in Montenegro is $110, compared
to less than $50 in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need peace to accomplish our projects, we need stability
and the trust of the international community,'' Mugosa said.

<HEADLINE> Agent in Elian Raid Explains Role  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- ''I never purposely pointed my weapon at Elian
Gonzalez'' or his rescuer Donato Dalrymple, says the armed Border
Patrol agent photographed confronting the terrified 6-year-old
Cuban boy during an April raid in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The agent said Dalrymple voluntarily released Elian ''without
any sort of a struggle'' as the agent put his hand ''firmly against
Mr. Dalrymple's chest'' to control his movements, according to
government documents released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photograph of the goggled, fatigue-clad
agent holding an MP-5 submachine gun prompted sympathizers of
Elian's Miami relatives and others to criticize the raid as an
excessive show of force. The relatives said they were terrorized.
</P>
<P>
   With the relatives defying a government order to give Elian to
his father, raiders snatched the boy April 22 at 5:15 a.m. when
Cuban exile protesters outside the Miami home had dwindled to a few
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department released written after-action reports by
the six tactical unit officers who entered the house, but continued
to withhold their names.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the six reports together, the agents said they used no
profanity, no team member threatened to shoot anyone, team members
made no threats to use force against anyone in the home, no one
inside the home was pushed to the floor or held to the floor, and
Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, was not touched in any way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, no pepper spray or other chemical irritants were
used inside the house, three locked doors were broken open only
after occupants did not open them as requested, and the fire
selector of the MP-5 in the photograph was in the safe position,
making it ''virtually impossible to fire the weapon
inadvertently,'' the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The agent in the photograph was the team leader, a former
Special Forces tactical instructor.
</P>
<P>
   After team member 4 kicked open the door to the bedroom where
Elian was, the team leader said, ''I identified myself and ordered
people in the room not to move.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I had both hands on my weapon with the weapon grounded to my
right shoulder,'' the agent said. ''I was using the 'third eye'
search technique.
</P>
<P>
   ''This technique ensures that the muzzle of the weapon is
pointed in the same general direction that the weapon handler is
looking. This search method enhances officer safety by providing
for quick reaction to a threat and is standard operating procedure
for tactical units.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Diaz, the freelance photographer on assignment for the AP
who took the dramatic pictures, remembers more about the sounds
than the sights of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I hear is that kid's crying,'' Diaz said two weeks later.
''The most awful cry you could ever hear in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz also said he vividly remembers the mournful sounds coming
from the crowd outside. A New York native of Cuban descent, Diaz
had gained the trust of the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
during the preceding months.
</P>
<P>
   The team leader saw the AP photographer against the bedroom's
far wall and out of the corner of his eye ''saw someone peek out of
the closet and then disappear back into the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I ... pulled the door open until I could see inside the
closet,'' the agent said. He saw a boy held by a man who turned out
to be Dalrymple, who had helped fish Elian out of the Atlantic
Ocean last Thanksgiving. ''Dalrymple shouted, 'Don't take Elian.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''When I determined that Mr. Dalrymple was not a threat, I
immediately went into a defensive controlling posture,'' the agent
said. ''I moved my left hand from the foregrip of my weapon and
placed it (my hand) firmly against Mr. Dalrymple's left chest
area'' and shouted to other team members.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I was doing this, I diverted the barrel of my weapon
downward and away from Mr. Dalrymple, creating distance between him
and my weapon. I was using my left hand to control Mr. Dalrymple's
movements and to defend myself against a possible physical
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent said the widely published photograph ''does not
present a clear rendition of the entire event.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While my weapon was being pointed in the general direction I
was searching, I never purposely pointed my weapon at Elian
Gonzalez or Mr. Dalrymple,'' he said. ''I was looking into the
closet to determine whether or not a threat existed. Immediately
upon determining that no threat existed in the closet, I
transitioned to a defensive posture.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple handed Elian to team member 4, while the team leader
was pressing on his chest. Team member 4 said, ''There was no
struggle and I did not have to pull Elian away from Mr. Dalrymple.
Mr. Dalrymple released Elian at the same time I put my hands on
Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Team member 4 pivoted and handed Elian to a female agent. The
entire team then hurried out of the house.

<HEADLINE> Violence Reported in Solomon Islands  </HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Fighting broke out Tuesday
between rival islanders in the Solomon islands, which were thrown
into a crisis a day earlier when armed rebels seized the prime
minister and demanded his ouster, officials in New Zealand said.
</P>
<P>
   One fight involving about 1,000 people was reported near
Henderson Field, the airport outside the Solomon Islands capital of
Honiara, according to a New Zealand official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting had died down after a couple of hours and although
New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff characterized it as ''more
of a skirmish than a battle'' with only four people known to have
been wounded, he was worried about an unstable situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a clear warning that things could get much worse quite
quickly,'' Goff told The Associated Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist reached by telephone in the Solomon Islands said
fighting had broken out both east and west of Honiara, and at least
four people were believed to have been wounded from one side.
</P>
<P>
   The official and the journalist both spoke to the AP only on
condition their names not be used.
</P>
<P>
   The reported fighting came a day after Prime Minister
Bartholomew Ulufa'alu was seized -- the latest move in inter-island
fighting that has shaken this nation for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomons are located 2,230 miles northwest of Wellington and
1,600 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia. The Malaita Eagle Force
and the Isatabu Freedom Movement rebel groups have been fighting
for 18 months on the nation's main island of Guadalcanal -- the
scene of a fierce battle between U.S. and Japanese forces in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Isatabu force has been fighting to push thousands of
migrants from the nearby island of Malaita off of Guadalcanal. The
Malaita rebels are resisting the Isatabu's effort, and at least 50
people have been killed or left missing in the fighting and 20,000
forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Honiara, located on Guadalcanal, is largely populated by
Malaitans, including Ulufa'alu -- who is viewed by some Malaitans as
a turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Andrew Nori, a spokesman for the Malaita rebels who has
been identified in some reports as the attempted coup leader, said
Monday that Ulufa'alu was being held at home in ''protective
custody'' after being captured by six gunmen from the Malaita Eagle
Force.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seizing Ulufa'alu, the Malaita rebels overran
police stations and the Government Telecommunications Center in
Honiara early Monday, Australian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the government caucus of the Solomon Islands
reconvened a meeting to consider a motion that could oust Ulufa'alu
from office -- the Malaita rebels' goal.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu showed up at the meeting accompanied by two armed
guards who had seized him. He told a reporter for the Solomon
Islands Broadcasting Co. ''I'm all right,'' according to a report
placed on the broadcaster's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu had offered last week to resign as his support
dwindled, but the necessary government meeting never took place
because officials from around the sprawling island nation did not
arrive on time.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand diplomats in Honiara were trying to broker
conciliatory talks, but information out of the Solomon Islands was
scarce because telephone and air links had been cut off after the
series of rebel raids on Monday. At least some telephone services
were restored by Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaita rebels had at least four of their men wounded in
Tuesday's fighting, and they were brought to hospitals in Honiara,
the Solomon Islands journalist said. It was not clear if there had
been any casualties on the Isatabu side, the journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent coup attempt was the second in the South Pacific in
weeks. In Fiji, armed rebels are still holding the deposed prime
minister and more than 30 other people seized in a raid on
parliament on May 19.

<HEADLINE> Secret Money Invading Politics  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At crucial moments in the presidential
campaign, George W. Bush has benefited from millions of dollars in
advertising paid for by mysterious groups and secret donors.
</P>
<P>
   Similar ads have also boosted Vice President Al Gore, but they
generally were done by well-established organizations with a clear
agenda. Still, their donors remained secret, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new form of political warfare that's quickly becoming the
tool of choice for people looking to influence Election 2000, made
possible by a once-obscure provision in the tax code that lets
anyone form a group and spend money on campaign-style ads without
saying who's paying for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's the most dangerous loophole that's ever come
along, period,'' said Larry Makinson of the Center for Responsive
Politics, which advocates tighter campaign finance laws. ''It
offers the ability, for the first time, for groups to have complete
anonymity.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, advocates like Makinson were mostly disturbed
by ''soft money,'' the unlimited, unregulated donations to
political parties, the details of which are publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   Other nonprofits face restrictions on their political
activities; these new groups do not.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission is considering a proposal to
require the new groups, known as 527s, to disclose their
contributors. Democrats on the panel welcomed the potential change,
while their Republican counterparts ranged from skeptical to
outright opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The groups were named after section 527 of the tax code, created
in 1974 for political groups to enjoy certain tax advantages
without publicly disclosing anything about themselves. These groups
fall outside the purview of the FEC by declaring that they engage
in issues, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   To operate legally, they cannot coordinate their activities with
candidates who benefit from their ads, and all sides insist there
is no communication between them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no connection between us and the Bush campaign --
none, zero, nada,'' said Diana Banister, a spokeswoman for the
Coalition to Protect Americans Now, which is funded by a wealthy
conservative activist, Helen Krieble.
</P>
<P>
   Banister said it was a coincidence that a day before Bush gave a
major speech promoting a missile defense system her group began
running $200,000 worth of ads with the same message and criticizing
Gore for not supporting the program.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats don't buy the denials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly there's been such advertising on the other side,''
Gore said Monday when asked about sniping over which party was
taking advantage of ad loopholes, such as 527s. ''That's a loophole
that they've been exploiting that we have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign says plenty of left-leaning groups -- led by the
AFL-CIO -- help Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the free market of ideas, both sides are well
represented,'' said spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   So far for Gore, the Sierra Club, an environmental group and one
of the first to create a 527 spin-off, is in the midst of an $8
million ad campaign aiding Democrats running for Congress and
attacking Bush on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League,
another well-established group, also has run anti-Bush ads and
plans more.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the missile defense ads weren't the only ones to come
at a convenient time.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the Republican primary contest, Bush backers braced for
a barrage of negative ads from Steve Forbes, who had used his
personal fortune in a similar fashion against Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-emptive attack, the moderate Republican Leadership
Council aired $100,000 of ads warning Forbes not to go negative and
followed with another $100,000 buy later on.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes noted that the RLC included many Bush supporters and
donors, and he complained to the FEC that it must have been a
coordinated effort. The RLC maintains it was not.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to March 7 and the Super Tuesday contests that
would probably settle what had become a fierce fight between Bush
and Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Republicans for Clean Air surfaced with $2.5 million
in ads in New York, Ohio and California supporting Bush and bashing
McCain on the environment. The group, which had not previously
existed, was funded by Texas entrepreneurs Sam and Charles Wyly --
brothers who had donated more than $200,000 to Bush and helped him
raise even more.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said there was no coordination with Bush's campaign,
but McCain complained to the FEC. He stands by the complaint,
despite his recent endorsement of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should be ashamed,'' McCain said last week. Asked if he
was sure the Bush camp had coordinated with these other groups, he
said: ''I'm positive of it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he has not discussed the issue with Bush; they
disagree on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC is still investigating the McCain and Forbes complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's outside support has continued beyond the primaries as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after wrapping up the GOP nomination, a group of California
Republicans calling themselves Shape the Debate began running TV
ads accusing Gore of being a hypocrite. Led by former Gov. Pete
Wilson, the group includes several Bush supporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain predicted that lesser-known groups also will begin
popping up to support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to see a dramatic increase on both sides,'' he
said. ''There will always be smart, unscrupulous people who will
find ways around campaign finance laws.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Seeks Arafat To Speed Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With Israel hinting of territorial concessions
but complaining of delays by Yasser Arafat, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is meeting with the Palestinian leader as she
tries to move the Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are there, ready to roll up our sleeves,'' Albright told
reporters at Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office on Monday.
''There really is a historic opportunity, and we have to pursue it
full speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, on the second day of a three-day swing through the
region, was traveling to Ramallah in the West Bank for a meeting
today with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she was returning to Jerusalem for sessions with
Barak and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy. The return visit was
announced only Monday after Albright and Barak met for more than
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in Monday's talks, Barak suggested he was ready
to return more territory to Palestinian control than previously
offered to conclude a final accord over such sensitive problems as
Jerusalem's future and how much land Arafat would have for a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Concessions could involve about 93 percent of the West Bank,
closer to Arafat's initial demand for Israel to cede 99 percent of
the territory won from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Barak already has virtually conceded establishment of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned at a news conference about reports that he had
determined retention of the Jordan Valley was no longer essential
for Israel's security, Barak said a land-for-peace trade-off was
complicated. He said it was too early to talk about areas Israel
intended to keep.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, we need security and a settlement presence along
the Jordan Valley,'' he said, ''but the details can be decided only
through negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has offered to dismantle settlements containing up to
60,000 Jewish settlers as part of a peace deal. And in a televised
interview Monday, he said it would be a historic achievement if he
could reach an agreement with Arafat that would keep 150,000 of the
200,000 Jewish settlers on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   And while he said ''the more ground we have, the better,'' Barak
accused Arafat on television of ''a certain amount of
foot-dragging'' in the prolonged and tedious negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have urged both leaders to
negotiate courageously, but the Americans insisted they were making
no separate proposals to cut through the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard very clearly Prime Minister Barak's commitment to an
agreement, and the discussions (with Albright) focused on how to
get there,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who accompanied President Clinton on his trip to
Russia, passed up his stop in Ukraine to follow up a meeting
between the president and Barak last week in Portugal and Clinton's
telephone talk from there with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Albright aims to set up a three-way summit for Clinton with
Barak and Arafat and to prod the Middle East leaders toward
agreement by their promised mid-September deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official, traveling with the secretary of state to
Israel from Moscow, said at least one more Albright trip to the
Middle East could be expected before a three-way summit.
</P>
<P>
   At Albright's request, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
agreed to meet with her Wednesday in Cairo. He will be in the
Egyptian capital with several other Arab foreign ministers for a
conference. Albright also will see Foreign Minister Youssef bin
Alawi of Oman and President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Israel and Syria broke down in January over
whether Israel would give up land all the way to the Sea of Galilee
if it returned the Golan Heights to Syria. Israel won the strategic
high ground in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Clinton was meeting today in Washington with
King Abdullah of Jordan. If Israel turns over Jordan Valley
territory to the Palestinians, it could have an impact on Jordan's
security. The majority of Jordanians are Palestinian.

<HEADLINE> Americans Urged To Be Aware of Dams  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The roaring mass of water and debris seemed to
charge out from the giant video screen, loud and frightening, a
small sample of what it might have been like 111 years ago when
floodwaters destroyed Johnstown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   As the privately owned South Fork dam gave way, it sent a wall
of water-lubricated debris downstream to Johnstown -- a mass of
railroad cars, broken trees and buildings, barbed wire, farm
animals and implements and dead and dying people all churning
wildly together.
</P>
<P>
   For a gathering of dam safety experts who recently viewed a
video presentation on Johnstown, one the nation's most infamous
flood disasters, it raised a sobering question: Could a failed dam
cause such a tragedy again, claiming more than 2,000 lives?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the answer may be yes.
</P>
<P>
   Dam failures are rare and there have been few deaths in recent
years. Even in massive floods like Hurricane Floyd's inundation of
North Carolina last summer, just 36 dams failed and those that did
were mostly small and claimed no lives.
</P>
<P>
   But some 80,000 dams dot the United States, some large and
others small, many of them old and in need of repair. Some 9,326
dams are rated as ''high-hazard,'' meaning that if they should fail
for any reason, loss of life and serious property damage would
result.
</P>
<P>
   ''Johnstown was the past, North Carolina is the present. Today
... we look to the future,'' says James Lee Witt, director of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 40 percent of the high-hazard dams have an emergency
action plan for people to follow, according to Witt.
</P>
<P>
   ''The failure not only to operate and maintain safe dams, but
also to plan in advance for failure, can have catastrophic
consequences,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Witt spoke to the dam safety experts in the ballroom of
Washington's Willard Inter-Continental Hotel -- the same spot where
American Red Cross founder Clara Barton was feted in 1889 after
spending months tending to the Johnstown victims.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't even know there are many dams nearby,
officials said. But they have been created by farmers, small
businesses, cooperatives, homeowners associations, utilities and
others to provide water for power, irrigation, recreation and a
variety of uses.
</P>
<P>
   While the giant federal dam and power projects are the best
known, some 95 percent of the nation's dams are regulated by state
authorities, explained Edwin Fiegle II of the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources, who is president of the Association of State Dam
Safety Officials.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina has the most high-hazard dams, 874, according to
FEMA and the state dam safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   Being designated as high-hazard does not mean that a dam is
deficient or in danger of failing. Rather it indicates the
potential for damage and loss of life if the dam should fail
because of flooding, earthquake or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   With 818, Texas ranks second in high-hazard dams, followed by
Pennsylvania, 735; Ohio, 502 and California, 392.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 1,449 dam failures in the United States in the
past 150 years, the association reports.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the Buffalo Creek Dam in West Virginia in 1972
killed 125; the 1976 failure of the Teton Dam in Idaho claimed 11
lives and the failure of the Kelly Barnes Dam in Georgia killed 39
students and college staff in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The annual dam failure rate was nearly 29 in 1996 and 1997, the
agency said. In the first half of the 1990s the rate was 68 per
year, but that was pushed upward by the 234 dam failures in 1994
floods in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Fiegle said a survey by the state dam safety officials produced
an estimate that, nationwide, $40 billion of work is needed to
maintain and improve current dams.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 3, Padres 2, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- John Jaha's two-out single in the 10th
inning drove home the winning run, lifting the Oakland Athletics to
a 3-2 win over the San Diego Padres on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The A's began the rally with one out in the 10th when Carlos
Almanzar (1-2) hit Randy Velarde with a pitch. Jason Giambi walked
and closer Trevor Hoffman relieved Almanzar. Velarde stole third
before Ben Grieve grounded to first baseman Dave Magadan, who threw
out Velarde at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Jaha then lined a single to center off a 1-1 pitch from Hoffman
and Giambi scored just ahead of a throw from Ruben Rivera. Oakland
improved to 7-4 against San Diego since interleague play began.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego had a scoring chance in the top of the 10th. Kory
DeHaan reached second base when his sharp grounder got by third
baseman Eric Chavez for an error. After Al Martin grounded out and
advanced him to third, Jason Isringhausen (3-2) intentionally
walked Tony Gwynn and then induced Phil Nevin to ground into an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Neither starter figured in the decision after each had flirted
with a no-hitter in the earlier innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier went seven innings and allowed three hits,
including Ruben Rivera's two-run homer in the seventh that sailed
into the left field seats to produce the first runs of the game. He
struck out five and walked seven.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Eaton, who won his big league debut against Milwaukee last
Tuesday, blanked the A's on one hit until the bottom of the
seventh. He issued a leadoff walk to Matt Stairs and Miguel Tejada
followed with a line-drive homer over the left field wall to tie it
at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Both Appier and Eaton had no-hitters going through the first
four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The game's first hit didn't come until Rivera singled with two
outs in the top of the fifth, ending a string of 13 straight outs
by Appier.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde doubled with one out in the sixth to break up Eaton's
no-hit bid. Eaton went 6 1-3 innings and allowed two runs on four
hits while striking four and walking five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: San Diego RF Eric Owens left the game with a bruised right
thumb in the seventh inning. He injured it while attempting to
bunt. DeHaan replaced him. ... When Owens stole second base in the
second inning, it snapped a six-game streak in which the Padres had
not stolen a base, their longest drought of the season. ... Eaton
is the 10th rookie to be on the Padres roster already this year.
Only the Anaheim Angels (12) have employed more rookies than the
Padres. ... The A's, who drew more than 40,000 fans in each of the
last three interleague games against the San Francisco Giants, drew
10,187 for the series opener against the Padres. ... The A's have
used 49 starting lineups through the first 57 games of the year.

<HEADLINE> OAS Passes Resolution on Peru  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- The Organization of American States has
voted to work on strengthening democracy in Peru but stopped short
of questioning the South American nation's tainted presidential
election or imposing sanctions -- a decision likely to anger human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The organization of 34 Western Hemisphere nations made the
decision after participating foreign ministers spent much of Monday
-- the second day of a three-day OAS meeting -- focusing on Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution the ministers passed takes no punitive steps
against Peru. It notes, though, that problems in the voting that
re-elected President Alberto Fujimori showed deficiencies in Peru's
electoral process and democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said it was more important to join other OAS
states in trying to promote democracy in the region than to push
for a tougher response.
</P>
<P>
   ''The focus of our attention today must be on resolving this
crisis of credibility in Peru,'' said Thomas Pickering, the U.S.
undersecretary of state for political affairs. He said the U.S.
government reserves the right to impose sanctions if Peru resists
the OAS push for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was re-elected in a runoff election May 28 that
featured himself as the only candidate. His opponent boycotted the
runoff, alleging the election was rigged, and independent monitors
refused to observe the vote because it failed to meet basic
international standards of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's resolution was authored by host Canada. It orders an
investigative mission of two -- OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria
of Colombia and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy --
to leave for Peru ''immediately'' to work on ways to strengthen
democracy there. Specific study issues include reforming the
electoral process and bolstering freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy said he and Gaviria would go to Peru prior to
Fujimori's inauguration July 28, when opposition groups plan to
hold a major protest rally in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Debate before the vote pitted Peru and some Latin American
allies that oppose foreign intervention in election issues against
the United States and others seeking a harsh response to
irregularities in the Peruvian voting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Latin America as a whole is affected by any backsliding with
respect to democracy by any of our countries,'' Marie Alvear of
Chile said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the resolution was a compromise. Peruvian Foreign
Minister Fernando Trazegnies said his country welcomed the OAS
delegation as a forward-looking mission that would avoid any
consideration of the recent election.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was likely to disappoint groups that wanted the
OAS to suspend Peru or otherwise pressure it to hold new elections.
Human rights groups have warned that protests and violence could
follow if the OAS failed to take strong action.
</P>
<P>
   No protesters turned up at the downtown Windsor meeting site on
Monday, a day after demonstrations by more than 2,000 anti-free
trade activists led to 41 arrests. But at another venue where an
OAS luncheon was held Monday, scores of demonstrators linked arms
and sat down in the rain to block delegates in three buses from
getting inside.
</P>
<P>
   Police had to pick up some of the protesters to clear the road.
No arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The protests Sunday were the largest in memory at an OAS
gathering and brought the group face-to-face with the anti-free
trade movement that disrupted a World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle in December. The same movement sparked street clashes at an
International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington earlier this
year.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Denies Taking Lie Test  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson said he never took a polygraph
test about his ex-wife's murder, but is willing to take one now
even though ''no lie detector test is going to change anyone's
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson also said he plans to talk to the public for a fee
through an Internet connection within the next few weeks. Part of
the money, he said, would go to various charities, including The
Innocence Project, which works to free wrongly convicted prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always wanted to be able to talk directly to the
public,'' Simpson said in a telephone interview Monday night with
The Associated Press. ''It's amazing how many people don't know the
facts of my case.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, responding to comments attorney F. Lee Bailey made at a
court hearing that he halted a polygraph test Simpson was being
administered, the former football player said he and Bailey are on
the best of terms and Bailey has been trying to arrange for a
lie-detector test to be done now, perhaps in a pay-per-view TV
format.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lee and I talk all the time,'' Simpson said. ''He's one of my
biggest supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simpson said he's convinced that if he passed a lie detector
test no one would pay any attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''No lie detector test is going to change anyone's mind,'' he
said. ''When I pass it, they'll say what they said about the
Ramseys and the nanny. Do you notice anyone saying they're
innocent?''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys and English au pair Louise Woodward supposedly
passed lie detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys are still said to be suspects in the 1996 killing of
their 6-year-old daughter. And Woodward was convicted in 1997 of
murdering an 8-month-old by violently shaking him and slamming his
head into a hard object. Her conviction was eventually reduced to a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you pass it nobody pays any attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said the current flap appears to be part of a feud
between Bailey and attorney Robert Shapiro. Both men were part of
Simpson's defense team in his 1994 criminal trial which resulted in
his acquittal for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald
Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent civil trial he was held liable for the murders.
</P>
<P>
   In Naples, Fla., where Bailey is embroiled in a battle to keep
his law license, he told of a dispute with Shapiro who took Simpson
to see a lie detector expert two days after the killings of Nicole
Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Clarifying his earlier remarks, Bailey said Monday: ''Shapiro
called me in the middle of a polygraph test where all the responses
were wild. I read those charts, they are not a polygraph test.
Shapiro took the charts, so no one else has ever been able to
review them, but I stopped the test for the simple reason that you
never, never test anyone for killing a spouse or a child within two
or three days of the event.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who is reputed to be an expert in the polygraph, said he
stopped the test because of Simpson's emotional state, not because
of the answers he was giving.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has never to this date been tested by anyone, although he
has a standing offer to do so under certain conditions,'' Bailey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said he sat down with a lie detector expert, was hooked
up to a machine and was asked inconsequential questions ''to show
me how it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He asked me if Nicole and I were married,'' he said. ''He
never asked me if I murdered Nicole. Nobody could say this was a
legitimate test.''

<HEADLINE> Court Mulls Wash. State Parent Laws  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disputes between parents and grandparents over
what's best for children are as old as time, but one such dispute
has yielded a potentially far-reaching Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has the nation's highest court had so much to say
about something increasingly difficult to define: the ''average
American family.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision Monday, the court said Washington state
trampled on parents' ''fundamental right'' to raise their families
free from government interference by enacting a law aimed at
helping grandparents and others win visitation rights.
</P>
<P>
   Just what the ruling means for grandparents-visitation laws in
all 49 other states remains to be seen, as does its impact for
non-traditional families that split and turn to courts to referee
battles over custody and visitation.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Shapiro, national legal director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, hailed the decision as ''a victory for
nontraditional families nationwide ... particularly significant for
single-parent families, lesbian and gay and low-income parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Harlow, deputy legal director of the Lamba Legal Defense
and Education Fund, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very important decision for lesbian and gay families
who are at the forefront of family law changes,'' she said. ''The
court adopted a sound middle course in this case, one that not only
appropriately respects the rights of parents but acknowledges that
no hard-and-fast rule should govern every single family dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the court's six separate opinions in the Washington
state case mention such families. But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
the main opinion's author, said, ''The demographic changes of the
past century make it difficult to speak of an average American
family. The composition of families varies greatly from household
to household.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, in dissent, said the ''conventional
nuclear family ... is simply not the structure or prevailing
condition in many households.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy added a statement that advocates for nontraditional
families are sure to seize on in future cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The importance of the familial relationship, to the
individuals involved and to the society, stems from the emotional
attachments that derive from the intimacy of daily association, and
from the role it plays in promoting a way of life through the
instruction of children as well as from the fact of blood
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some pre-existing relationships, then, serve to identify
persons who have a strong attachment to the child with the ...
motivation to act in a responsible way to ensure the child's
welfare. ... In the design and elaboration of their visitation

   What's that mean? If up to Kennedy, even a fit and competent
parent who objects to having someone else play a part in a child's
life sometimes could be forced to do so -- even if the person
seeking visitation is not related by blood.

<P>
   Lawyers for adoptive parents and other non-biological caregivers
already are giving the court's latest word on family law a thorough
reading.
</P>
<P>
   That means it likely will not be the court's last word.

<HEADLINE> Gore Preaches on Folding Chair  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The famously wooden Vice President Al Gore
jumped up on a folding chair, gesticulating and vigorously
preaching in a growling voice to Democrats that they must regain
control of Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   The growl began as a flattering imitation of the speech patterns
of Rep. Charles Rangel, D-NY, who was celebrating his 70th birthday
and is in line to chair the powerful House Ways and Means Committee
should Democrats oust the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   It continued throughout the 10-minute speech, with Gore's face
turning red from the effort of shouting sans mike to 210
high-rolling Democrats who had paid at least $10,000 a person to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people say this is the strongest economy in the history
of the United States of American, NO one disputes it, NO one
disputes it,'' Gore yelled. ''Those of us who worked to make that
happen are the ones who are now saying it's not GOOD ENOUGH.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Gore sat down, then bounded back atop the chair,
banged his water glass with a knife to quiet the crowd and
introduced Rangel, who climbed onto his own chair.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Harry Belafonte and boxing promoter Don King were among
attendees of the dinner, and an earlier reception, that raised at
least $3 million, according to John Del Cecato, a spokesman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That's a record for the committee -- outside Washington, where
$7.3 million was raised at an annual dinner in March.

Indonesian Quake Deaths at 103
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BENGKULU, Indonesia (AP) -- The official death toll from Sumatra's massive
earthquake rose to 103 on Tuesday as the search for victims intensified despite
rumbling aftershocks that kept scared survivors outdoors. Police feared the
number of casualties could rise even further once authorities reach remote
areas, including a tiny island closest to the epicenter of the earthquake, which
struck on Sunday night. Many were crushed as they slept when their poorly built
homes caved in. The magnitude-7.9 quake cut off communications and electricity,
and closed the area's main airport.

Kids' Behavioral Problems Said Soar
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- New research suggests that the number of U.S. youngsters with
emotional and behavioral problems soared in the past two decades, in part
because of more poor and single-parent households. The findings, echoing other
recent studies, are based on surveys of pediatricians on more than 21,000
patients. The researchers said it is not a case of doctors getting better at
recognizing and diagnosing emotional and behavioral problems. Instead, they said
there is a real increase in such problems among youngsters. The researchers
found that problems such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression
and learning disabilities more than doubled from 1979 to 1996.

   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- President Clinton on Monday praised the announcement

entomb the plant forever. It comes atop about $200 million the United States has
already spent to improve nuclear safety in Ukraine. The April 26, 1986, accident
spread radioactive material over much of Europe. The Ukrainian government has
blamed the disaster for at least 8,000 deaths, including 31 killed immediately,
many more killed in the massive cleanup operation and others who later died of
cancer and other radiation-related illnesses.

Sierra Leone Diamond Embargo Mulled

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Britain is proposing that the U.N. Security Council

to circulate a draft resolution in the next few days recommending an embargo be
imposed on all diamond sales that aren't certified by the government, British
and U.S. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. There is no
certification process in place now, so the embargo would cover all diamond
exports from the war-weary West African nation until a program certifying the
government origin of the diamonds is created, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Orbador Leads in Mexico City Race  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Six years ago, he rose to national prominence
when what was widely seen as fraud cost him the Tabasco state
governorship, and he organized thousands of people to blockade the
governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, he appeared in national newspapers bleeding from the
forehead while leading a massive protest to stop Mexico's
state-owned oil company from contaminating poor farmers' cocoa
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Neither protest resulted in any major changes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is waging a new battle as
candidate to govern the Western Hemisphere's largest and possibly
most complex city. The battleground is bigger, but this time it
seems he may win.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks ago, a federal elections court narrowly voted against
revoking his candidacy for allegedly failing to meet the five-year
residency requirement. Now, the Tabasco state native leads his two
major rivals by 20 percentage points in the polls as he seeks to
become Mexico City mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a nonconformist,'' said Hugo Vargas Guzman, a
28-year-old taxi driver, weaving his green Volkswagen bug through
traffic, fruit carts, bicycles and pedestrians. ''I think it's a
plus that he's not from here. We need someone who is going to bring
in new ideas, because everything needs to change in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one third of Mexico City's 9 million people live in
poverty. Pollution hovers around twice the acceptable limit on the
best of days. Crime is so bad that even middle-class families hire
security guards for their homes. And the infrastructure is
crumbling so badly that entire neighborhoods recently flooded with
raw sewage.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of this former Aztec imperial seat is one of the most
important, visible and criticized elected officials in Mexico. Up
until 1997, the mayor was hand-picked by the president, who since
1929 has been a member of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Enshrining a new era of power-sharing, the center-left
Democratic Revolution Party won the first mayoral election three
years ago with the landslide victory of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who
resigned last year to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Obrador was president of Democratic Revolution when
Cardenas was elected. He resigned to run for mayor. With Cardenas
trailing far behind in the presidential polls, Lopez Obrador now is
battling for the life of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ''These elections are crucial for the Democratic Revolution
Party,'' said analyst Alfonso Zarate. ''It's almost a question of
survival for the party because it has no chance at the presidential
level, but it must keep the capital in order to stay alive.''
</P>
<P>
   To recover the capital, the ruling party has turned to party
veteran Jesus Silva Herzog, who contends Lopez Obrador is part of
the problem, not the solution.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent televised debate, Silva Herzog blamed him for the
constant demonstrations that clog traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''He started the trend of bringing the conflicts of other states
to Mexico City. Don't forget that Andres Manuel brought us the
janitors of Tabasco, that he took over the oil wells and that he
blocked highways,'' Silva Herzog said. ''That's how all this
disorder began.''
</P>
<P>
   A former treasury secretary and ambassador to the United States,
Silva Herzog has largely campaigned on his extensive experience in
government. That asset, analysts say, has also been his downfall in
a city hungry for change.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative National Action Party candidate, Sanitago Creel, a
lawyer-turned-congressman who proposes economic reform and better
tax collection, also has struggled despite the fact that city
residents overwhelmingly favor his party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Obrador seems to have had success by concentrating on the
working-class population, vowing to bring the government closer to
the people.
</P>
<P>
   ''There won't be luxury offices. We will lower salaries of
high-level public servants. We won't buy late-model vehicles. We
won't use bodyguards,'' Lopez Obrador said. ''We can't have a rich
government and a poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   He has carried out an exhaustive run that is headed toward 1,000
campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is an excellent candidate, but the question is whether he
will be a good mayor,'' Zarate said. ''Lopez Obrador has no
experience at governing and this is very complex city.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents believe a rabble rouser is exactly what this city
needs and didn't get when Cardenas snatched the mayorship from the
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people felt disappointed by Cardenas because they
expected an abrupt change in the government,'' Zarate said. ''But
Cardenas is an intellectual who may be honest and efficient, but
who has never shined as a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, his administration went after crooked police
officers and investigated former top officials, leaving a general
sense that the city is less corrupt than it was under the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   For some, that was not enough for a city bursting at its seams.
</P>
<P>
   In a poor neighborhood, a city hospital's intensive care section
is so crowded that doctors hop over patients who have been left
lying on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought things were going to get better, but nothing has,''
said Evelia Prado Herrera, 62, waiting for a nurse to tend to her
in the chaotic hospital. ''We need someone who can renovate this
city.''

<HEADLINE> Flames Poised To Hire Button as GM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta(AP) -- Craig Button, one of the architects of
the defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars, was expected to be
introduced today as the new general manager of the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames called a news conference for noon EDT to make a
''major'' announcement concerning the organization's management.
</P>
<P>
   TSN reported Monday night that the Flames were going to hire
Button, the Stars' director of player personnel, as GM.
</P>
<P>
   The Calgary Sun said sources confirmed that Button will be
hired.
</P>
<P>
   Button, 37, has spent the last 12 seasons with Dallas, two in
his current role and the previous six as the team's director of
scouting.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal native has deep roots in hockey. His late father,
Jack, was an NHL general manager; his mother, Bridget, worked for
Punch Imlach and the Toronto Maple Leafs; and his brother, Tod, is
a scout for the Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Former Leafs coach Mike Murphy was considered a front-runner for
the GM's job, but Murphy said Monday night after arriving at the
Stanley Cup finals that he was told by the Flames he wasn't getting
the post.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary Flames co-owner Harley Hotchkiss said last week that the
process of hiring a new general manager was in its ''final
stages.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the TSN report, Lanny McDonald, currently Calgary's
vice president of corporate development, would become Button's boss
as the team's new vice president of hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ESPN hockey analyst Barry Melrose speculated that
Roger Neilson, the out-of-favor coach in Philadelphia, will become
the Flames' new coach.
</P>
<P>
   However, Neilson said Monday he knew nothing of any such
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's news to me,'' he said. ''If the decision goes down that I
will not be head coach of the Flyers, then certainly I'll be asking
permission to talk to other teams, and certainly the Flames will be
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't even named a general manager, yet. I have no
knowledge of this.

<HEADLINE> Destiny Calls Lakers In Finals  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers need four victories to
embrace their apparent destiny. The Indiana Pacers need four wins
to avoid their apparent fate.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Finals pit the league's latest royalty against a
longtime member of its old guard. Starting with Game 1 on
Wednesday, the Lakers will try to take their biggest step toward
becoming the game's next great team, while the Pacers try to earn
the only honor missing from a lengthy run among the league's elite.
</P>
<P>
   The star-powered, high-gloss Lakers spent the season as the
NBA's main event. Their swagger and skill seemingly mark them as
the heirs to the Chicago Bulls' vacated dynasty. They have a
mastermind coach in Phil Jackson, the inherent glamour of their
hometown and their franchise's playoff legacy of six championships.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, the Lakers appear to have a limitless future,
with two of the game's superstars, one just reaching the prime of
his career, the other probably years from it. Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant became basketball's newest royal couple this season,
when they finally turned their potential into results.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are expecting a lot of us, but it's no more than we
expect of ourselves,'' Bryant said. ''We haven't ever minded being
the favorites. We want that position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers spent the season fighting the tick of their
basketball clocks. Age, a decade of playoff frustration, the
imminent departures of coach Larry Bird to retirement and several
players to free agency -- everything signals Indiana is almost
certainly making its last run at a title.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've accomplished a whole lot in the course of our time
together, and we've lost to some teams for whatever reasons,''
point guard Mark Jackson said. ''No shame in that. Fortunately, we
don't have to worry about that again, because we knocked through
the door this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana reached its first finals by earning the Eastern
Conference's best record and the top playoff seed. That meant New
York and Miami -- the Eastern teams thought to pose the toughest
potential challenge to Los Angeles -- had to slug it out in the
conference semifinals. The Pacers disposed of the injury-depleted
Knicks in six games last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were cruising toward the finals before the Portland
Trail Blazers erased a 3-1 series deficit with two victories.
Portland even led by 15 points in the fourth quarter of Game 7
before Los Angeles mounted a stirring comeback for an 89-84
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But with the drama of the conference finals behind them, the
Lakers look formidable again. Unlike New York or Miami, the Pacers
seem ill-equipped to deal with O'Neal. And as the Lakers proved all
season, when the league MVP plays unfettered, they are close to
unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just a very big, strong man that has a lot of athletic
ability,'' Bird said. ''You have to try to switch up things on the
defensive end, but we don't want to get carried away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you start doing a lot of crazy things against Shaq, all
of a sudden Glen Rice is a big factor. ... You can't let other guys
step up and break your back.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's aging roster and general lack of athletic ability are
the main reasons the Lakers are a strong favorite in the series.
The Pacers' struggles against quicker, more athletic teams such as
Los Angeles were clear all season.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of the playoffs, only a desperate 3-pointer
by Travis Best in the waning moments of Game 5 saved Indiana from a
series loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, who play an up-tempo style
similar to that of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bird doesn't like double-teaming defensive schemes because his
team's slow rotations frequently leave opponents open for jumpers.
He'll have no choice against O'Neal, who has pounded Indiana center
Rik Smits throughout their careers.
</P>
<P>
   But as dominating as O'Neal can be, the Pacers have their own
offensive star who has been winning playoff games nearly by himself
since Shaq was in college. Reggie Miller, returning to his hometown
to face his favorite childhood team, has his biggest stage yet to
be the man opposing fans love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always been a goal of mine to get to the finals and
perform, but it's going to even be sweeter to play against L.A. at
home,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's standout defense notwithstanding, the Blazers proved
the Lakers have serious weaknesses stopping opponents on the
perimeter. Steve Smith and Scottie Pippen scored at will from
outside during much of the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Portland destroyed the Lakers' indestructible
veneer by stretching them to seven games. Despite the odds the
Pacers face, they enter their first finals knowing their task is
not impossible -- that their title hopes are no more improbable than
the Lakers' aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a very attractive team,'' Mark Jackson said. ''(But)
I never thought any team in this league was invincible. Everybody
can be beat. They're well aware of it, and so are we.''

<HEADLINE> Horse Trainer Eddie Gregson Dies  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The apparent suicide of trainer
Eddie Gregson, who saddled 1982 Kentucky Derby winner Gato Del Sol,
has stunned Southern California's horse racing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gregson, 61, died Sunday of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot
wound. His body was found by his wife, Gail, in his South Pasadena
office, police Sgt. Mark Miller said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said no foul play is suspected. He said police believe
Gregson's death was a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody at the track is in complete horrified shock,''
trainer Jenine Sahadi said. ''He was a father figure to a lot of
people and that's why it's so unexpected. He was always laughing
and loved to tell stories and loved to hear stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi said she joked with Gregson on Sunday after he saddled
one of his horses at Hollywood Park. Crows, a 3-year-old, finished
third, beaten by two heads. Street Cat, a 2-year-old filly racing
for the first time, was seventh in her race.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame trainer Bobby Frankel said he knew of no reason why
Gregson would kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you get depressed when you lose, but it's got to be
something else. I thought his life was pretty normal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a real good guy, an honest person and very intelligent.
He's a very good trainer. The horses came first with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi, who saddled her first Kentucky Derby starter last month,
said Gregson had been particularly kind to her husband, trainer Ben
Cecil.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did whatever he could to help him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He tried with younger people to make them believe in racing.
He wanted everybody to respect racing and respect the animals. He
wasn't afraid to speak out about things that he thought were
wrong,'' Sahadi said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregson, who lived in Pasadena, went to his office in the
evening after racing ended at the Inglewood track.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he didn't come home and didn't answer the phone, she went
to check on him,'' Miller said. ''He was found by her.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Mrs. Gregson told police that her husband had been
facing personal problems unrelated to racing.
</P>
<P>
   ''She knew he had been depressed and unhappy for some time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gato Del Sol, a 21-1 long shot in the 1982 Kentucky Derby,
provided Gregson with his biggest victory. He also trained Super
Diamond, winner of the 1986 Hollywood Gold Cup, who retired in 1989
as the third richest California-bred thoroughbred.
</P>
<P>
   Gregson had 13 victories from 79 starts and earnings of $433,909
last year, with Controlled being his lone stakes winner in the Boo
La Boo at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Among Gregson's other major stakes wins were the 1995 Hollywood
Turf Cup with Royal Chariot, the 1989 San Antonio Handicap with
Super Diamond and the 1978 Santa Barbara Handicap with Kittyluck.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Gregson had served as an officer of the
California Thoroughbred Breeders Association and was the current
president of the California Thoroughbred Trainers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Born Aug. 7, 1938, Gregson grew up on his family's ranch and
breeding farm in Ventura County. He graduated from Stanford
University before taking out his trainer's license in 1969 with a
string of horses from Noble Threewitt's stable. Gregson began his
own stable in Southern California in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Gregson also dabbled in acting, working under contract to Warner
Bros. and 20th Century Fox. He appeared in the 1958 war film ''The
Naked and the Dead'' with Cliff Robertson and Raymond Massey.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife and two children.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets With Jordan King  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After telling eastern Europeans that the
struggles of building open economies on the ruins of communism will
pay dividends in future prosperity, President Clinton was back at
the White House today, conferring with a leader from the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   The Oval Office meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan was the
only event on Clinton's schedule, a day after his return from a
week in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That was his 48th foreign journey as president; his 49th is
later this week, to Tokyo, for the funeral of a Japanese prime
minister and to meet with his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to Washington from Kiev, Ukraine, Monday night,
ending a journey in which he repeatedly urged openings to the West
for and by Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   At weekend summit meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin
and in a speech to the Russian parliament on Monday, Clinton said
European unity and institutions should not end at the borders of
the old Soviet Union, but should reach to Moscow and Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   He had sounded the same message to western Europe, in meetings
and speeches in Lisbon, Berlin and Aachen, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The finale was in Kiev, to tens of thousands of Ukranians in the
broad plaza and mall of St. Michael's Square.
</P>
<P>
   ''From Lithuania to Poland to the Czech Republic, those who
chose open societies and open markets like you started out with
sacrifice but they ended up with success,'' Clinton said. ''I
believe Ukraine has the best opportunity in a thousand years to
achieve freedom and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a presidential performance with a holiday air. Ukranian
rock stars played to the crowd standing in the hot sun, in a
sweeping mall between golden domed cathedrals. A giant American
flag hung over them, hundreds of yards down the mall from the
yellow and blue draped platform where Clinton spoke. The Odessa
Symphony Orchestra was on the plaza at the other side of the
platform. Clinton smiled, kept time and waved at the side of the
conductor when they played ''Take Me Out To The Ball Game.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke through an interpreter, urging Ukranians to rally in
support of democracy and a reformed, market economy. ''Communism
has lost in Ukraine but a full commitment to free-market democracy
has not yet won,'' he said. ''Do not give up. Keep on fighting.
Boritesya poboroete.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he went to the crowd, shaking hands campaign style along
the barrier in front of the platform. As he finished and headed
home, the bells of blue and white St. Michael's Cathedral, just
rebuilt, rang out over the square.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, with Clinton beside him at the presidential palace,
President Leonid Kuchma announced that the last part of the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant will be closed on Dec. 15, more than
14 years after the worst atomic power accident in history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced $78 million in U.S. aid for the shutdown, and
said he will seek additional international help for Ukraine. He
promised an additional $2 million in American aid for safety
measures at other Ukranian nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   Then the presidents and their official parties toasted the
moment in champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to make a rapid round trip to Tokyo to attend the
funeral on Thursday of Keizo Obuchi, who died of a stroke on May
14. The Kyodo News Agency said Clinton would hold talks with the
new prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, while he is in Toky.

<HEADLINE> Bosnians in Iowa Face More Strife  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN BIEMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- Mirsad Causevic lost some of the best years
of his life to war. Then he lost his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having made a new life in this town along the Mississippi
River, he and about 110 other refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina are
facing the loss of their jobs when a meatpacking plant is sold.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he and other refugees plan to do next, Causevic
grimaces. He has faced the question far too many times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knows?'' he said. ''That's very hard to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have brought a new perspective to the rich farmland
and forest-covered hills of northeastern Iowa. About 220 Bosnians
had moved to the community by 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''By Dubuque's standards of diversity, this is a major paradigm
shift,'' said Joe Featherston, who works in refugee resettlement
with Catholic Charities in Dubuque. ''I've been working in this
organization 21 years and it is the most diverse this community has
ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   War broke out in Yugoslavia about the time Causevic finished
high school, in 1991. He was pressed into military service.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Yugoslavia was dissolved and 200,000 people
were either dead or missing. More than 2 million people were made
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ''My generation is a lost generation,'' Causevic said, sipping
thick Bosnian coffee at his Dubuque apartment. ''They had no chance
to get jobs because of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   When it ended in 1995, Causevic was forced to leave his native
Bosnia-Herzegovina, its economy left in tatters by the war.
</P>
<P>
   Causevic, 27, is among about 107,000 refugees from the former
Yugoslavia who have come to the United States since 1992, the State
Department estimates.
</P>
<P>
   As of last year, 4,611 Bosnians were registered with the Iowa's
Bureau of Refugee Services. State officials don't know how many
additional refugees have moved to Iowa from other U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Causevic moved to Dubuque in 1998 to work for Farmland, the
second Bosnian to do so. He started on the production line, but his
hard work and rapidly improving English earned him a promotion to
manager, as well as interpreter, trainer and recruiter for other
Bosnians.
</P>
<P>
   Featherston said changes were required in the city's medical and
social services, courts, law enforcement and schools to accommodate
the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Thom Determan, English as a Second Language supervisor for
Dubuque's public schools, said his program has grown threefold
since 1998. There were suddenly about 40 Bosnian students and
Determan had to hire another ESL teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity has enriched Dubuque's schools, Determan said. He
recalls the time a Bosnian child described in class his experience
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids were just spellbound,'' he said. ''They never could
imagine a child being through this kind of horrific situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as this community of 58,000 had begun adjusting to its new
members, Featherston said, Farmland announced it would lay off up
to 1,100 workers by this Friday to retool the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything looked like it was going along just so well and the
proverbial rug just got pulled out from under us,'' Featherston
said. ''I really thought we had a kind of permanence in the
making.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnians are considering their options: try to find new jobs
in Dubuque; wait for the renovated plant to reopen next year and
hope to be hired back; or move to other towns with meatpacking
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Leary, a supervisor of a free employment training program,
said many Bosnians have expressed interest in intensive ESL and
job-training courses, in fields as diverse as truck driving and
computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Bernau, an employment consultant for the Greater Dubuque
Development Corp., said officials hope to keep the laid-off
workers, especially since unemployment has dropped below 2 percent
in the Dubuque area.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Farmland's impending layoffs, the corporation
sponsored a job fair on May 9. Many Bosnians were among the 1,000
people who perused booths set up by dozens of employers and job
service agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian community likes Dubuque and doesn't want to leave,
Causevic said. They like the river. They like the hills. And they
like the security they feel, especially for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is actually an excellent place for kids,'' he said. ''My
boy feels free to go out and play with other kids when he gets home
from school. I don't have to worry like in big cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Causevic concedes that language is a factor in the employability
of Bosnians. He said employers also are uncertain of their
immigrant status and whether they might leave.
</P>
<P>
   For refugee Mehmet Dojic, 26, staying in Dubuque depends on
where his next paycheck comes from. ''Maybe I stay, maybe I go. If
I find a new job, I will stay. If not, I will go,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Giants 5, Angels 4, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his major league-leading
24th home run with two outs in the 11th inning, giving the San
Francisco Giants a 5-4 victory over the Anaheim Angels Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds 13th homer in his last 17 games helped the Giants overcome
a blown save by Robb Nen, who couldn't hold a 4-2 lead in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds drove a 1-0 pitch from Shigetoshi Hasegawa (4-1) that
barely made it over the 18-foot wall in right center. Bonds' 24
homers match the most he's ever had before the All-Star break.
Fifteen of Bonds' homers have either tied the game or given San
Francisco the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Fultz (2-1) pitched 1 1-3 innings for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Nen entered with a 4-2 lead in the ninth and allowed a two-out
RBI single to Mo Vaughn. Tim Salmon followed with a bouncer that
went off the left leg of Nen for an infield hit, and the pitcher
threw the ball into right for an error that allowed pinch-runner
Orlando Palmeiro to score from first with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Nen, who has three blown saves in 12 chances, pounded a fist
into the grass in front of the mound after the play. With two on,
he struck out Troy Glaus, sending the game into extras.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is 8-3 against Anaheim in interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Scott Schoeneweis allowed four runs and seven hits in
6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Livan Hernandez, winless in 10 road starts since last Aug. 21 at
Milwaukee, gave up two runs and seven hits in seven-plus innings,
leaving with a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Rodriguez escaped a two-on jam in the eighth, fanning
Bengie Molina and Scott Spiezio.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent hit a double in the first that gave him an NL-best 38
RBIs on the road. The Giants made it 4-0 in the second on Bobby
Estalella's RBI double, Calvin Murray's run-scoring groundout and
Bill Mueller's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim scored on the bottom half on Spiezio's RBI grounder.
Kevin Stocker hit a run-scoring double in the seventh, his first
RBI in nine at-bats since joining the Angels last week.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The victory was Dusty Baker's 585th as Giants manager,
moving him within one of Roger Craig for the most since the team
moved to San Francisco in 1958. ... Darrell Miller, the former
Angels catcher and now the team's director of player development,
won't be attending Wednesday's and Friday's games. He'll be about
35 miles up the freeway at Staples Center watching his brother,
Indiana's Reggie Miller, play the Lakers in the NBA Finals. ...
Schoeneweis, whose failure to allow a bunt by Baltimore's Jeff
Conine to roll foul on May 17 resulted in a hit, apparently learned
his lesson. In the third, he patiently waited until a bunt by Ramon
Martinez went foul, then struck him out on the next pitch. ...
Estalella picked Adam Kennedy off second in the second. He has 24
RBIs in his last 23 starts behind the plate.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Head: Lindros Dad Not Welcome  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers plan to retain their
rights to Eric Lindros, although the team isn't sure where Lindros
will play next season.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers general manager Bob Clarke, speaking to reporters for the
first time since the Flyers were eliminated from the Eastern
Conference finals on May 26, said the team will make an $8.5
million qualifying offer to Lindros before July 1 to keep him from
becoming a free agent. But Clarke didn't rule out a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll call around to see who's interested,'' Clarke
said. ''We're going to make him the qualifying offer; who knows
what happens after that?''
</P>
<P>
   What won't happen, the GM insists, are any more dealings with
Carl Lindros, the former team captain's father-agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he comes back, he can't have his dad calling us,'' Clarke
said. ''Every time something happens, his parents get involved:
coaches have to be fired, trainers have to be fired, players have
to be traded. He just has to be responsible for his own play.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he comes back, it's going to be as his own self. We don't
want his mom and dad. We've had enough of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lindros has suffered six concussions over the past 27
months, and four in the past five months, Clarke believes there are
teams who would be interested in the 27-year-old center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of those concussions were diagnosed over the telephone,''
Clarke said. ''Nobody can really tell you about concussions. There
are such a wide variety of medical opinions on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers also plan to make a decision sometime later this week
on a coach for next season. Craig Ramsay is the favorite. The
Flyers finished the regular season 16-8-1 under Ramsay after coach
Roger Neilson was forced to step aside due to bone-marrow cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson served as a special assistant to Ramsay once he returned
on April 10. He has told Clarke he does not want to return to the
team in any capacity but head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson, asked Monday night about a report he would be hired as
oach of the Calgary Flames, said he knew nothing about such a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's news to me,'' said Neilson, reached at his Ontario home.
''If the decision goes down that I will not be head coach of the
Flyers, then certainly I'll be asking permission to talk to other
teams, and certainly the Calgary Flames will be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't even named a general manager yet. I have no
knowledge of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers lost in the Eastern Conference finals to New Jersey,
blowing a made three games to one lead.

<HEADLINE> Stars Lose Hunger, Game  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars know what they need to do to beat
the New Jersey Devils, because they've done it every game of the
Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, they've had trouble doing it for 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas outplayed New Jersey for two periods of Game 4 Monday
night, digging in the corners for pucks and fighting for every inch
of ice to take a one-goal lead. But three goals on three shots in a
span of 3 minutes, 41 seconds sent the Devils to a 3-1 victory and
a similar lead in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars must win Game 5 Thursday night in New Jersey to keep
alive any chance for the Cup to be brought back to Dallas. They
must win the next three -- which they've yet to do in any round this
postseason -- to claim ownership of the trophy for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible,'' center Mike Modano said. ''It's been done
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars teased themselves into thinking they had a chance to
even the series by showing the extra gear coach Ken Hitchcock
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Skill players were throwing their bodies around, no one was
giving up on loose pucks and the defense was limiting New Jersey to
long shots that goalie Ed Belfour clearly saw.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner returned from a five-game absence and played
through a painful knee injury. Joe Nieuwendyk also reappeared,
scoring for the first time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won every battle for two periods,'' forward Jon Sim.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the throttle got jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Great puckhandling and positioning in front of the net led to
New Jersey's first goal, a shorthanded breakaway produced another,
then came the knockout goal while the Stars were still trying to
figure out what happened on the first two.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not what they're doing, it's breakdowns on our part,''
forward Mike Keane said. ''Unfortunately, every mistake we made
tonight ended up in our net.''
</P>
<P>
   The barrage ended Dallas' 7-0 record when Nieuwendyk scores a
point; a streak of nine straight wins following playoff losses; and
Belfour's run of 14 straight home playoff games without allowing
more than two goals. The Stars were 11-0 in postseason when leading
after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got our heart ripped out from us a little bit today,''
Hitchcock said. ''We went from quite a high to quite a low.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' resilience has been tested before. The Stars trailed 2-1
in the 2000 Western Conference finals, 3-2 in last year's
conference finals and 1-0 in last year's finals. Nowhere in there,
though, is a two-game comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Of all teams, New Jersey is the least likely to squander such an
opportunity. After all, the Devils just saw Philadelphia fold in
such a situation, so they know exactly what not to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not tired and we are not worn out,'' Hitchcock said.
''We are getting beat by a hell of a hockey club right now.''

<HEADLINE> Court Curbs Grandparents' Rights  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Wash. (AP) -- Jenifer Troxel has 10 grandchildren,
but the ones most on her mind are the two she hasn't seen in more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling whether she or her husband, Gary, will see
their granddaughters again following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that declared Washington's visitation law too broad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still have hope,'' Mrs. Troxel said after Monday's 6-3
decision, speaking to reporters at her rural home about 65 miles
north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to see them, period,'' added her husband. ''I
don't see why we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls' father, Brad Troxel, committed suicide in 1993. After
his death, the girls' mother, Tommie Granville, limited their
visits with their paternal grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels, both 60, went to court seeking more time with
10-year-old Natalie and 8-year-old Isabelle. They were eventually
awarded visitation of one weekend a month, one week during the
summer and four hours on the girls' birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. Supreme Court said the state law went too far
in allowing any person to win a court-ordered right to see a child
any time such visitation was found to be in a child's best
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The decision threatens visitation orders won by the Troxels and
other grandparents in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've gotten essentially back to the beginning, so let's just
let these children see their grandparents and get on with their
life,'' said the Troxels' attorney, Mark Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Granville did not return a message left at her home in
Anacortes, about 12 miles west of Mount Vernon. Her lawyer,
Catherine Smith, declined to say whether the grandparents would be
allowed to see the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a matter of negotiation, and I think that's one
thing the Supreme Court made clear,'' Smith said. ''It's not going
to be decided in the media, and I hope everyone will honor my
client's rights to make these decisions privately, including the
Troxels.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court did not give parents absolute veto power over who
gets to visit their children, disagreeing with part of a ruling by
Washington's highest state court that appeared to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And in finding the state law ''breathtakingly broad,'' Monday's
decision said nothing to directly endanger grandparent-visitation
laws in all 49 other states.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the decision is that states must be very careful
in helping grandparents and others with close ties to children win
the right to see them regularly against parents' wishes. Perhaps
most notably, it gave grandparents nationwide no special status in
visitation cases.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bullock of the conservative Institute for Justice praised
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''While one can hardly avoid sympathizing with grandparents who
wish to have contact with their grandchildren, the Supreme Court
thankfully remained focused on the state law's sweeping intrusion
into the family realm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, courts will be advised not to make use of the
visitation law, said Maureen Hart, an assistant attorney general.
The law could be rewritten by the Legislature, which begins its
next session in January.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the court did not invalidate narrower visitation
laws ''reinforces the notion that there is room for more tailored
approaches that provide to parents the deference the court believes
the constitution affords them in raising their children,'' Hart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Troxels say they would be satisfied to take
Granville's last visitation offer of one afternoon per month, made
before the case went to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ''If one afternoon is what we get, we will be happy with that,''
said Jenifer Troxel. ''We just want to be able to see our
grandchildren.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Quake Deaths at 103  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENGKULU, Indonesia (AP) -- The official death toll from
Sumatra's massive earthquake rose to 103 on Tuesday as the search
for victims intensified despite rumbling aftershocks that kept
scared survivors outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Police feared the number of casualties could rise even further
once authorities reach remote areas, including a tiny island
closest to the epicenter of the earthquake, which struck on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The government emergency task force said 64 bodies had been
recovered from rubble in Bengkulu town on Sumatra's southwest
coast. The rest were killed in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many were crushed as they slept when their poorly built homes
caved in. The quake cut off communications and electricity, and
closed the area's main airport.
</P>
<P>
   In Bengkulu town, tens of thousands of people spent Monday night
outdoors, too afraid to return to damaged homes in case another big
quake struck. More than 300 aftershocks have been recorded since
the initial quake hit.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the town of 250,000 had no electricity supply. Its
airport was closed because of damaged communications.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're too scared to go indoors again. What can we do now?
Everything has gone,'' said Zohr Mahyum, whose house was reduced to
a pile of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 badly injured patients -- some two or three to a
bed -- were being treated in the parking lot of the devastated Young
General Hospital. Doctors performed emergency operations under
plastic sheeting. Twelve patients had died from quake-inflicted
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of the town, the hospital's badly cracked walls and
caved-in roof was testament to the severity of the temblor, which
was centered beneath the Indian Ocean, only 60 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got all patients and staff out immediately after the quake.
It's unsafe inside,'' said physician Budi Mulana. ''We are finding
things very difficult. We have only two days supply of medicines
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Blood supplies also were running low and medical equipment was
lost under the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of homes in Bengkulu were damaged or destroyed, police
and witnesses said. Major buildings had cracked walls. Smaller
structures collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The walls of my house fell in. I pulled my three boys from the
rubble. They are hurt, but they are alive, thank God,'' said one
patient, who goes by the single name of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Police said teams of rescuers, including police and soldiers
along with local people, had stepped up search efforts. Two navy
ships were bringing emergency supplies. Rescue personnel were being
deployed from other parts of Indonesia, and some foreign countries
had offered assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone services and roads in some parts of the region
remained cut Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest fears center around tiny Enggano island, about 125
miles southeast of Bengkulu town and closest to the quake's
epicenter. Initial reports said as much as 90 percent of its
buildings were flattened.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia. Even so, Sunday night's
tremor was one of the most powerful recorded here in several years.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was felt across much of western half of the
archipelago nation. People in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, more
than 310 miles to the southeast, as well as in the neighboring
island state of Singapore fled their apartments after high-rise
buildings swayed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, said the quake's
epicenter was about 20 miles beneath the floor of the Indian Ocean
-- very shallow in geological terms.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no report of a tsunami, a massive wave caused by
an earthquake or volcanic eruption. In December 1992, a magnitude 7
earthquake triggered a tsunami that killed about 2,500 people on
the southeastern island of Flores.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. agency put the strength of Sunday's quake at 7.9. The
Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Service said it measured
7.3.

<HEADLINE> SEC Warns on Variable Annuities  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the plus side, they offer lifelong payments
to investors, guaranteed death benefits and deferred taxes. But
federal regulators warn that variable annuities, an increasingly
popular way to save for retirement, also have pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday issued an
''investor alert'' and a brochure on its Web site to help investors
understand the benefits, costs and risks of variable annuities,
which combine features of mutual funds and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came as Paul Roye, director of the SEC's Investment
Management Division, told an industry group that SEC inspectors
have been gathering information on sales of variable annuities from
brokerage firms and financial advisers around the country with an
eye to possible sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A variable annuity is a contract between an investor and the
company selling it in which the company agrees to make periodic
payments to the investor, beginning immediately or at some future
date. The investor buys a variable annuity contract by making
either a single purchase payment or a series of payments.
</P>
<P>
   The payments to the annuity holder vary and are determined by
the performance of the underlying investments. The instruments are
tax-deferred, which means annuity holders pay no taxes on the
income and investment gains from their annuities until they
withdraw their money.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the SEC says, the benefits of tax deferral will
outweigh the costs of a variable annuity only if it is held as a
long-term investment to meet retirement and other long-range goals.
</P>
<P>
   Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) retirement plans,
which offer tax deferral at no cost, are often more advantageous
than variable annuities, the SEC notes.
</P>
<P>
   The agency issued this advice:
</P>
<P>
   --IRAs: If an investor buys a variable annuity through a
tax-advantaged retirement plan such as an IRA or 401(k), he or she
will get no additional tax benefit from the variable annuity.
Investors should consider buying a variable annuity in that
situation only if it makes sense because of the annuity's other
features, such as lifelong payments and a guaranteed death benefit.
</P>
<P>
   --Charges: Before they invest in a variable annuity, consumers
should make sure they understand the charges that come with it,
including sales charges, mortality charges, administrative fees and
expenses of the mutual fund investment options.
</P>
<P>
   --Exchanges: Investors who own a variable annuity and are
considering exchanging it for another one should weigh the decision
carefully. An investor who makes the exchange often loses the
ability to withdraw money without paying substantial charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey, the head of the variable annuities trade group, said he
fully supported the SEC's efforts ''to educate the public about
annuity products.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Annuity products should be sold with full disclosure,'' he
said in a telephone interview.

<HEADLINE> French Heads Aims to Shorten Term  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE GANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- President Jacques Chirac said he would move to
reduce the presidential term from seven years to five, but wants to
put the issue to the French in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The process should be finished by the end of September, he said,
adding that he would halt everything if opponents used the occasion
to seek wider changes or incite political instability.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want an initiative that would change our institutions
and put into question what is most precious -- stability,'' Chirac
said in a television interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the president's office term -- which would require the
constitution be revamped -- has long been a thorny issue, with
successive presidents refusing to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Political opponents issued a chorus of objections to Chirac's
limitations, saying a constitutional revision should be an occasion
for wider debate.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac also said he did not want to see a limit on the number of
times a head of state could be re-elected under a five-year
mandate. French presidents are currently limited to two mandates, a
maximum 14-year term. The system has been in effect since 1873.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac had long resisted a growing move to reduce the
presidential term, calling it ''an error'' in July.
</P>
<P>
   His change of heart followed growing pressure from Socialist
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who said the change was ''essential
to the modernization'' of French political life.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac and Jospin are likely contenders in the next presidential
election in 2002, when the shortened term would take effect. Chirac
will be 69 then.
</P>
<P>
   The president opted to put the issue to a referendum after both
houses of parliament approve a bill specifying the change. Polls
show large public backing for the idea.

<HEADLINE> Court Curbs Grandparents' Rights  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Wash. (AP) -- Jenifer Troxel has 10 grandchildren,
but the ones most on her mind are the two she hasn't seen in more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling whether she or her husband, Gary, will see
their granddaughters again following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that declared Washington's visitation law too broad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still have hope,'' Mrs. Troxel said after Monday's 6-3
decision, speaking to reporters at her rural home about 65 miles
north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to see them, period,'' added her husband. ''I
don't see why we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls' father, Brad Troxel, committed suicide in 1993. After
his death, the girls' mother, Tommie Granville, limited their
visits with their paternal grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels, both 60, went to court seeking more time with
10-year-old Natalie and 8-year-old Isabelle. They were eventually
awarded visitation of one weekend a month, one week during the
summer and four hours on the girls' birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. Supreme Court said the state law went too far
in allowing any person to win a court-ordered right to see a child
any time such visitation was found to be in a child's best
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The decision threatens visitation orders won by the Troxels and
other grandparents in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've gotten essentially back to the beginning, so let's just
let these children see their grandparents and get on with their
life,'' said the Troxels' attorney, Mark Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Granville, who did not return a message left at her home in
Anacortes, told The New York Times she considered the case a ''huge
waste of time, money and emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm relieve we finally won,'' she said in today's editions.
''It's a victory over every parent in the country. But I'm just not
sure what we'll do as far as their requests for visits.''
</P>
<P>
   She said there would have been no problem had the grandparents
not sought extended visits. Granville's lawyer, Catherine Smith,
also declined to say whether the grandparents would be allowed to
see the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a matter of negotiation, and I think that's one
thing the Supreme Court made clear,'' Smith said. ''It's not going
to be decided in the media, and I hope everyone will honor my
client's rights to make these decisions privately, including the
Troxels.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court did not give parents absolute veto power over who
gets to visit their children, disagreeing with part of a ruling by
Washington's highest state court that appeared to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And in finding the state law ''breathtakingly broad,'' Monday's
decision said nothing to directly endanger grandparent-visitation
laws in all 49 other states.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the decision is that states must be very careful
in helping grandparents and others with close ties to children win
the right to see them regularly against parents' wishes. Perhaps
most notably, it gave grandparents nationwide no special status in
visitation cases.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bullock of the conservative Institute for Justice praised
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''While one can hardly avoid sympathizing with grandparents who
wish to have contact with their grandchildren, the Supreme Court
thankfully remained focused on the state law's sweeping intrusion
into the family realm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, courts will be advised not to make use of the
visitation law, said Maureen Hart, an assistant attorney general.
The law could be rewritten by the Legislature, which begins its
next session in January.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the court did not invalidate narrower visitation
laws ''reinforces the notion that there is room for more tailored
approaches that provide to parents the deference the court believes
the constitution affords them in raising their children,'' Hart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Troxels say they would be satisfied to take
Granville's last visitation offer of one afternoon per month, made
before the case went to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ''If one afternoon is what we get, we will be happy with that,''
said Jenifer Troxel. ''We just want to be able to see our
grandchildren.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 50
points in today's early going. Advancers and losers are evenly
split on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead four points and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index is down three points.

<P>
   Wall Street is digging in for what appears to be another ho-hum

</P>
<P>
   As with yesterday, there's little information to drive the
markets today.
</P>
<P>
   The lone piece of economic data is essentially a repeat --
worker productivity rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That's unrevised from the government's earlier estimate for the

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Sunshine'  </HEADLINE>
By MATT WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the title. Over the course of its disturbing
yet often invigorating three hours, ''Sunshine'' inhabits some of
the darkest areas of human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   That much is to be expected from Istvan Szabo, the gifted
Hungarian filmmaker who has explored -- in movies such as ''Colonel
Redl'' (1985) and the Oscar-winning ''Mephisto'' (1981) -- the
Faustian pact that humans often strike in order to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   With ''Sunshine,'' Szabo takes on nothing less than the
turbulent history of 20th century Europe, as refracted through
three generations and 150 years of the Hungarian-Jewish
Sonnenschein family.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Fiennes, in his most demanding screen performance in
years, plays three very different men across three different
periods, and clearly delineates each.
</P>
<P>
   Their common bond: survival in a changing political and social
climate in which -- Szabo and co-screenwriter Israel Horovitz
suggest -- simply existing day to day exacts a price.
</P>
<P>
   The result sometimes veers toward soap opera. Still, there's no
denying the rare ambition of a film with intelligence and empathy
to burn: You go in expecting a history lesson and emerge impressed
-- often against the odds -- by the shifting hues of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The film has barely begun its flashback narration before the
meaning of the title becomes clear. Emmanuel Sonnenschein (David de
Keyser), the tale's great-grandfather, has made his fortune from a
family recipe for an herbal tonic known as ''Sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonnenscheins, it seems, are on the way up, having
progressed from village tavern-keepers to city lawyers, with
Fiennes' Ignatz embodying the social ascent. Among other things,
he's keen to change the family name to the less-Jewish-sounding
Sors.
</P>
<P>
   A famously severe magistrate, Ignatz's private life is colored
by an illicit marriage to cousin Valerie (Jennifer Ehle), whom he
once loved as a sister and then nearly destroyed by deriding her as
a whore.
</P>
<P>
   Life in the public eye isn't much easier. Ignatz embraces a
defiant assimilationism that proves a troubling touchstone for the
family members who come after.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation provides the film's truly enduring
sequences, pushing the film forward from the collapse of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire and into the charnel house of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes reappears as Adam Sors, the youngest son of Ignatz and
Valerie, a brilliant swordsman whose path to Olympic fencing glory
includes his conversion to Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   His newfound religion notwithstanding, Adam meets a grisly fate.
Even those inured to images of Holocaust atrocities may find this
character's end near-impossible to watch.
</P>
<P>
   His death, in turn, leaves Adam's son Ivan (Fiennes again) to
confront issues of vengeance and retribution. His own circumstances
include a secret liaison with a married policewoman (Deborah Kara
Unger, in the film's least convincing role), and he finds an
unlikely ally in a fiercely anti-fascist Communist (a mustachioed
William Hurt).
</P>
<P>
   From there, it's on to the toppling of Stalin and the Hungarian
uprising, larger events always sifted through the Sonnenscheins'
traumatized -- yet possibly redemptive -- lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sunshine'' is sufficiently dense that it defies thumbnail
synopsis, and some filmgoers may surrender to it as a sweeping
epic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the film's more than 150 speaking parts, special attention
must go to the real-life mother-daughter team of Rosemary Harris
and Jennifer Ehle, playing older and younger versions of the same
person.
</P>
<P>
   Ehle, who just won the best-actress Tony Award for her
performance in Broadway's ''The Real Thing,'' sets ''Sunshine's''
narrative course early by remarking that the family is ''already
doomed to hell.'' With that comment in mind, Harris' emergence as
Valerie's older, widowed self is doubly moving, since the character
has acquired a sense of serenity and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie, by the end, is said to possess ''the gift of breathing
freely,'' after decades of imprisonment and tumult. From grief,
Harris suggests, can come a kind of grace. In a film suffused with
sorrow, Harris' lovely performance lets in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sunshine'' is a Paramount Classics release, co-produced by
Robert Lantos and Andras Hamori. A hefty 180 minutes, the film is
rated R.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Market averages were mixed in early trading
today as investors searched for direction in a quiet market.
Continued interest in technology stocks helped the Nasdaq stay in
positive territory for a fourth straight session
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 61.63 to 10,753.67.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 15.18 to 3,836.94, but the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 3.16 to 1,464.47.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell $1.063 to $131.50. The company said it will delay the
launch of its integrated processor, code-named Timna, because of a
conflict with standard memory. The processor, which was expected to
debut in the second half of this year, has now been delayed until
the first quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But a broad range of technology stocks advanced today. Qualcomm
rose 2 to 69\ and PMC-Sierra rose $6.375 to $193.50.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Nasdaq, Starbucks rose $2.50 to $38.125. The coffee
company will be added to the Staandard &AMP; Poor's 500 on Wednesday,
prompting many index-fund managers to buy the stock so that their
portfolios will continue to mirror the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard fell $3.125 to $117.25, contributing most to the
drop in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues barely outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 134.69 million shares, ahead
of Monday's sluggish pace.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume remained fairly low as investors opted to wait
for more information on the strength of the U.S. economy before
taking significant new positions. The next potentially
market-moving report will reach traders on Friday, when the Labor
Department releases the Producer Price Index.

   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.2 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was down 0.8 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was

<HEADLINE> Treasury Secretary To Visit Africa  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers will visit
five African nations during a weeklong trip designed to highlight
the Clinton administration's call for greater international support
for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Summers plans to meet with government and business leaders in
Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa, Mozambique and Egypt starting on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday to a United Nations conference, Summers said
the administration would be pushing to make assistance to poor
nations a top priority for this year's Group of Eight economic
summit in Okinawa in July. President Clinton will join leaders of
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Russia at the
annual gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to make such issues as fighting the
AIDS virus in Africa and forgiving debt for the world's poorest
nations top priorities for rich countries in an effort to combat
critics who have charged that globalization has left millions of
poor people behind.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the United Nations Conference on Women and
Development in New York, Summers said that problems in poor nations
were being exacerbated by the HIV epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of the 16 million deaths from AIDS to date, 14 million have
been in Africa,'' Summers said. ''Last year, the combined wars in
Africa killed 200,000 people. AIDS killed 10 times that number. Yet
it is estimated that 90 percent of the illness and death that
HIV/AIDS will bring to Africa are still to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the United States would be pushing at the upcoming
economic summit for greater international assistance to combat
AIDS, provide debt relief for the world's 40 poorest countries and
boost World Bank spending on education in poor nations, especially
on projects to educate more women.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Summers noted that one of the reforms the
United States is pushing is for the World Bank to target its loans
to countries with a good track record on use of international
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must more often decline to provide assistance to corrupt or
uncommitted governments -- in Africa or anywhere else -- that lack
the desire or the capacity to invest those resources for the good
of all of their people,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   The African stops on Summers schedule include Abuja, Nigeria, on
June 11-12; Lagos on June 13; Dar es Salaam on June 14; Pretoria,
June 15; Maputo, Mozambique, on June 16-17 and Cairo on June 18.

<P>
   Analysts said investors appeared to be regrouping after sharp
gains last week. The Nasdaq, which had been battered in March and
April, soared a record-breaking 19 percent last week as investors
flocked back to the technology stock that dominate its ranks. The
Dow, which hadn't suffered as badly, rose 4.8 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market's doing extremely well after last week's screamer,
which set us up for a little profit-taking,'' said Ralph Bloch,
chief market analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St.

</P>
<P>
   Yet while some investors were indeed cashing in stocks to
capture gains, more stocks were rising than falling in the overall
market.

the sign of a market engaging in a healthy pause.''

<HEADLINE> Donaldson Offers Lighter Side on Web  </HEADLINE>
By ANICK JESDANUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- On a recent show about Sports Illustrated's
swimsuit models, Sam Donaldson donned 3-D glasses found in the
magazine. He chatted with supermodel Daniela Pestova and showed
video from the shoot.
</P>
<P>
   On other segments, Donaldson bantered with actress Tracey Ullman
about her new bed and her passion for sleeping. He exchanged double
entendres with comedian Jon Stewart. He recited lyrics to Limp
Bizkit's hip-hop tune ''Nookie,'' sans profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the same Sam Donaldson who reported from the White House
on Jimmy Carter's peace efforts and Ronald Reagan's bullet wounds?
Is this the same Sam Donaldson who interviews the nation's top
political leaders each Sunday on ABC's ''This Week''?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson is much looser on his Internet-only news program,
which has just expanded from three to five shows a week. It airs at
12:30 p.m. Eastern on ABC News' Web site, although it's available
any time after that.
</P>
<P>
   Because the show draws a younger audience, producers can book
hipper guests and Donaldson can express wit rarely seen on news
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you approach a hard news subject, such as interviewing
the secretary of state about Kosovo, you do it quite seriously,''
Donaldson says. ''On the Web, we're not doing hard news. I'm able
to be looser, if looser means not having to watch every word.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he says, ''If I'm kidding around with (comedian)
Janeane Garofalo, why would I act as if I were interrogating Ronald
Reagan about whether he was selling arms to Iran?''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Panos, a consultant who studies Internet news shows,
worries about credibility. Will viewers who see a goofy Donaldson
on the Web take his serious interviews on TV seriously?
</P>
<P>
   ''Once they've seen it, the cat's out of the bag,'' Panos says.
''People aren't sophisticated enough to handle the expansion of his
human dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson and his producers disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's as credible, accurate as ever, but he is also forthright
to a degree people are perhaps not used to seeing,'' says Steve
Jones, executive producer for ABCNews.com. ''What you're seeing on
the Webcast is more truly reflective of Sam. He has a mischievous
side, playful, yet extremely inquisitive.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the line between entertainment and journalism? Jones
does not see a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Entertainment to me is a program that has a single, often
diversionary goal,'' he says. ''What Sam Donaldson does is not
escapist entertainment. It's the presentation of information but in
an engaging way.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the first news veterans with a regular Internet show,
Donaldson is a pioneer. He initially hesitated, he says, but then
recognized that at age 66 he was unlikely to succeed Peter Jennings
as the evening news anchor. Donaldson believes others will join him
''once they see it is the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewership for the Net show remains in the thousands rather than
the millions typical for network TV. Yet Donaldson says he and his
network are committed to it. ''This is a major effort. Why would a
company do this just to put me out to pasture?''
</P>
<P>
   Jones says ABC cares more at this point about understanding the
new medium than about making money. Begun in September, the
20-minute program includes one commercial break -- Donaldson jokes
that it costs $3.25 a spot.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson's early Web shows took more of a hard-news approach.
But when the show booked politicians, viewership dropped. And few
bothered to watch Ernest Hemingway's son, even though Donaldson
considered the segment ''smashing.''
</P>
<P>
   The main lesson so far: Although it's a television program
broadcast over the Net, don't make it appear too much like one.
Adapt the program to the online audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to know about Metallica's suit against Napster far
more than they want to know about George W. Bush's plan for foreign
policy,'' Donaldson says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the show emphasizes high-tech guests and topics, as well as
such pop icons as Ullman and Garofalo. To keep shows relevant to
Web users who may watch them days or weeks later, the show no
longer recaps top stories.
</P>
<P>
   Usually produced live, it lets viewers participate through
informal surveys, e-mail, chat and discussion boards. Donaldson
personally answers some of the messages and reads audience
questions on the show. The show fits in a 2-inch computer window,
with jerky, grainy video.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it looks and feels like ''This Week'' and other news
programs on television -- an approach some industry insiders
question.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Brown, editor in chief of MSNBC.com, believes that
merely bringing TV to the Internet is like showing newspapers on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   But Donaldson believes Web viewers will watch a TV-like show
that is compelling. That is where his looser format comes in.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sports Illustrated segment, he flipped through the
swimsuit issue. He asked pointed questions about whether the
magazine promotes sexism, but also joked with a female producer,
''Where's your swimsuit, Vanessa?'' He inquired about President
Clinton's magazine subscriptions through White House reporter Josh
Gerstein.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson says he may have gone too far with the swimsuits;
although that segment was one of the most-watched, he concedes
viewers were ''there for the cheesecake.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to get a larger audience, but not at any price,
not in any way,'' he says.

   '20/20': Most Americans readily accept that alcoholism is a
''disease'' whose only treatment is abstinence. But now those views
are being challenged and the means of treatment questioned. ABC
News medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman examines the
conventional theories about drinking, opening the door on a heated
debate in the medical and treatment communities. This special
edition of ''20/20'' looks at bold new ways to approach the problem
and calls for a re-examination of long-accepted views. It airs
Wednesday at 10 p.m. Eastern.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Market averages were mixed today as investors
searched for direction in a quiet market. Continued interest in
technology stocks helped the Nasdaq stay in positive territory for
a fourth straight session.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 68.94 at 10,746.36.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 19.94 to 3,841.70, but the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 2.86 to 1,464.77.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors appeared to be regrouping after sharp
gains last week. The Nasdaq, which had been battered in March and
April, soared a record-breaking 19 percent last week as investors
flocked back to the technology stock that dominate its ranks. The
Dow, which hadn't suffered as badly, rose 4.8 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market's doing extremely well after last week's screamer,
which set us up for a little profit-taking,'' said Ralph Bloch,
chief market analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while some investors were indeed cashing in stocks to
capture gains, more stocks were rising than falling in the overall
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some good underlying strength,'' Bloch said. ''That's
the sign of a market engaging in a healthy pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell 31.25 cents to $132.25. The company said it will
delay the launch of its integrated processor, code-named Timna,
because of a conflict with standard memory. The processor, which
was expected to debut in the second half of this year, has now been
delayed until the first quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But a broad range of technology stocks advanced today. Qualcomm
rose $1.375 to $68.625 and PMC-Sierra rose $3.219 to $190.348.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Nasdaq, Starbucks rose $2.50 to $38.125. The coffee
company will be added to the Staandard &AMP; Poor's 500 on Wednesday,
prompting many index-fund managers to buy the stock so that their
portfolios will continue to mirror the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan fell $4.125 to $133, contributing most to the Dow's
decline.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Egan meets with mediator to try to settle sexual abuse cases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- New York Archbishop-elect Edward Egan
met with a federal magistrate to try to settle more than 20
lawsuits filed against the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport by
people who claim they were molested by priests, the Connecticut
Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was seen meeting Monday with U.S. Magistrate William I.
Garfinkle, the newspaper said Tuesday, citing sources it did not
identify.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the diocese confirmed that Egan agreed to meet
with Garfinkle in the hope of settling the suits, the Post said.
Lawyers for both the diocese and the plaintiffs had picked
Garfinkle as a mediator some time earlier, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Drohan, a spokesman for the diocese, told The Associated
Press on Tuesday that he could not comment. Cindy Robinson, a
lawyer whose firm has brought most of the lawsuits, also declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was named archbishop of New York on May 11, a week after
the death of Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   In lawsuits filed against the diocese, 23 people claim they were
sexually assaulted by six current and former priests in the
Bridgeport diocese.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuits, the alleged sexual assaults date back
to the late 1960s, when the plaintiffs were either altar boys or
members of diocesan youth organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Egan did not become bishop of the Bridgeport diocese until 1988.
The lawsuits claim he knew about the incidents when he took office
but took action to keep them secret.
</P>
<P>
   The diocese has repeatedly denied that Egan tried to cover up
alleged abuse by priests.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not true. As soon as allegations were made ... he took
immediate action,'' Drohan said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits are currently pending in Waterbury Superior Court.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Land Declared Toad Habitat  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 500,000 acres in Southern California,
scattered from San Diego to Monterey, will be declared critical
habitat for the endangered Southwestern arroyo toad, potentially
limiting development in some areas, federal officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The action, expected to be formally announced Thursday, is the
result of consent agreement involving a lawsuit by several
environmental groups, who accused the Interior Department of
violating the Endangered Species Act by not promptly making habitat
designations.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service is expected to make
dozens of new habitat designations to protect rare species this
year because of pressure from the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan to protect the arroyo toad, the Fish and
Wildlife Service will declare 478,400 California acres as critical
habitat for the species. About half of the acres are private land
and the rest managed by federal, state or local governments,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-inch long arroyo toad, which once could be found
throughout the Southern and Central California watersheds, breeds
in slow-flowing rivers and shallow, gravelly pools. It's range now
is believed limited to 22 drainage areas with an estimated 75
percent of its original area of habitat having been eliminated by
dam construction, urbanization and human activities, according to
the National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The critical habitat designation by the Fish and Wildlife
Service will include portions of Monterey, Santa Barbara, Ventura,
Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside and San Diego
counties, including lands within four national forests, according
to agency officials, who spoke on condition of not being further
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The designation does not establish a special preserve or refuge
for the species and in most cases will not directly affect how
property owners use private land unless an action involves federal
money or a federal permit, officials said. However, some developers
might be affected when they seek federal wetland permits, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the land singled out for protection of the arroyo toad
already is designated critical habitat for another endangered
species, the California gnatcatcher. The critical habitat
designation does not include lands that are part of a formal
Habitat Conservation Plan that under agreement with the government
already requires certain management programs aimed at protecting
rare species.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny gray toad was put on the endangered list in 1994 under
the federal Endangered Species Act, which requires that the
government promptly designate what habitat is needed for the
species survival. When the Interior Department failed for years to
make such a designation, the Center for Biological Diversity, based
in Tucson, Ariz., filed a lawsuit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Fish and Wildlife Service agreed in federal court
in San Francisco in response to the lawsuit to make a critical
habitat designation. The court set a June 1, 2000 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   For an area to be designated critical habitat it must be
determined by biologists to be essential for the conservation of a
threatened or endangered species, although the species does not
necessarily have to be found on the land. Once a designation is
made, special land management is required to protect the species,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials also emphasized that not all the land within
a designated habitat boundary will require special management. For
example existing roads, shopping areas and other populated areas
within the boundary are not expected to serve as habitat for the
toad, so would require no special consultation with the Fish and
Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Some details of the planned designation were first reported
Tuesday by the Los Angeles Times.

<HEADLINE> Washington Opera May Be Renamed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Opera, headed by Artistic
Director Placido Domingo, will soon be officially known as the
National Opera, if the House has its way.
</P>
<P>
   The House cast a voice vote Tuesday to rename the 44-year-old
opera company, and it would join the National Symphony Orchestra,
which also performs out of the Kennedy Center, with the national
designation.
</P>
<P>
   Bill sponsor Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., said the opera
company ''has achieved the stature of a world-class company'' and
the new name would give it national prominence, increase ticket
sales and improve fund-raising prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Opera has earned a position of leadership in the
musical world without the government support typical in most world
capitals, he said. The new designation, which must still be
approved by the Senate, would not bring federal funding or
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the National Opera will set an example for the

   The Washington Opera requested congressional approval of the new
name even though, as a private company, it doesn't need such
legislation to make the switch, Goodling said. However, his office
said the federal designation would give the company an important
boost in prestige.
</P>
<P>
   The opera, founded in 1956 by Day Thorpe, music critic for the
now defunct Washington Star newspaper, has become one of the
nation's most successful and prolific.
</P>
<P>
   It has 80 performances in the 2000-2001 season and earns 65
percent of its budget through ticket sales, with the remaining 35
percent coming from contributions. The ticket sale-to-contribution
ratio is the highest of any opera company in the country.

   The House on Tuesday also took up resolutions praising the
United States Philharmonic Society and recognizing the importance
of African-American music to global culture.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Shakes Turkey; 3 Dead  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORTA, Turkey (AP) -- A strong earthquake struck rural central
Turkey on Tuesday, collapsing homes and killing two people,
including a beekeeper crushed to death by falling stones as he
slept.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people were injured in villages just north of Turkey's
capital, Ankara. The magnitude 5.9 quake destroyed or damaged some
4,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was centered on Cerkes, a town in the green hills 60
miles north of Ankara, in Cankiri province.
</P>
<P>
   Cankiri lies close to the North Anatolian Fault, the source of
two strong earthquakes that leveled parts of northwestern Turkey in
August and November, killing more than 18,000 people and destroying
thousands of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue teams rushing to the area had to zigzag through roads
that were blocked by huge rocks that tumbled from the hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, rain began to fall, further hampering rescue
efforts and frustrating workers trying to set up tents for those
made homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The quake startled residents of Ankara and was strong enough to
cause hairline cracks in the parliament building, in some rooms
from floor to ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Orta Karga, beekeeper Ahmet Arslan was crushed
when the roof and a wall of his home collapsed onto his bed after
the quake struck shortly after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stones ... covered his body like a grave,'' said Huseyin
Bayram, a neighbor who dug out Arslan's body.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 people were injured in the town of Orta and its
surrounding villages, which include Orta Karga. Most of those
injured were hit by bricks or collapsed chimneys, said Mehmet Ali
Yaman, a doctor who treated the injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shook so hard, I threw myself out of the window,'' said
Ramazan Aydin, who injured his back in the fall. ''I panicked so
much I didn't know what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said that the death toll might have been higher, but
many people were either awake and out of their homes at morning
Islamic prayers or in the fields tending their sheep.
</P>
<P>
   The quake damaged electricity and telephone lines in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In Yuva, the village fountain was spewing mud-colored water
after the quake.
</P>
<P>
   In Cubuk, just outside of the capital of Ankara, a 17-year-old
boy was killed when a three-story building collapsed, said the
town's mayor, Mustafa Gokmen. The boy's brother was pulled from the
debris injured but alive, and three other members of the family
were also injured. At least 14 other people were also injured in
the town.
</P>
<P>
   The semiofficial Anatolia news agency reported early Tuesday
that one person died after jumping from a building, but later said
that person had survived with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thankfully, the number of lives lost is very low,'' Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit said in Oslo. He decided against cutting
short his visit to Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The government, severely criticized for its slow response during
the two earlier quakes, was better organized this time. It moved
quickly to send helicopters to assess the damage, set up crisis
centers to coordinate rescue operations and dispatched mobile
kitchens, medical centers, blankets and tents.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Clash With NATO Peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRACANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs angry over a grenade attack
swarmed around a British general Tuesday, prompting his bodyguards
to fire into the crowd, escalating tension in a community
increasingly restive over NATO's inability to protect it. One
person was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage in this Serb enclave comes after a surge of attacks
Kosovo's Serb community claims are intended to drive them and other
minorities from the province. Eight people have died in the past
week, and many Serbs say peacekeepers have failed to ensure their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb delegation plans to travel Wednesday to U.N. headquarters
in New York to demand self-rule for Serbs in Kosovo and better
security, according to the independent Yugoslav news agency FoNet.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles in this monastery town just south of the capital,
Pristina, escalated quickly Tuesday. At midmorning, an attacker
drove alongside the market in the center of town and hurled a
grenade, witnesses and NATO-led peacekeepers said.
</P>
<P>
   Furious that NATO troops did not prevent the attack, a crowd
gathered and began to stone Swedish peacekeepers who form a huge
share of the contingent stationed in the town.
</P>
<P>
   The mob pulled people out of cars, beat them and set the
vehicles on fire. Drivers and others, reportedly ethnic Albanians,
retreated to the town's 14th century Serbian Orthodox monastery for
refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the British sector, Brig. Richard Shirreff
rushed to the scene to calm the crowd of several hundred. The mob
closed around him and took the weapon of one of his bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Others in his security detail fired shots into the air and one
into the crowd, injuring one person, NATO officials said. NATO-led
peacekeepers originally reported three people were injured, but
later revised the figure downward.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were attacked,'' Shirreff said. ''We had to fire shots to
protect ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Local Serbs stood outside the monastery throughout the day,
watching cars, trucks and vans smolder. They called out to
reporters to express their outrage over the grenade attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was thrown right in front of KFOR,'' said Dragan
Stojanovic, 48, using the acronym for the NATO peacekeepers' Kosovo
Force. ''How come they weren't able to stop that car? Aren't they
ashamed?''
</P>
<P>
   The local Serb National Council condemned the grenade attack,
claiming it was only the latest act from a ''wave of organized
Albanian terrorist groups seeking to expel Serbs from Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have repeatedly told KFOR that the market in Gracanica is a
dangerous site ... but NATO found no solutions for the problem,''
Father Sava Janjic told Yugoslavia's private Beta news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the medical center in Gracanica, Zorica Nedeljkovic,
told Beta that a total of 12 Serbs were injured -- eight in the
grenade attack and four in the subsequent clash with NATO-led
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The melee comes at a sensitive political moment for the
province's Serbs, just days before the anniversary of the arrival
of NATO-led peacekeepers, who took over Kosovo after a 78-day air
war to end Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's repression of
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   As the date of the anniversary has drawn closer, moderate Serbs
have grown more impatient with their increasing isolation in
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Study: Teens Need More Exercise  </HEADLINE>
By RANDALL CHASE
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Schools need more mandatory physical
education classes and parents need to unplug TVs and video games,
say researchers who concluded that most young Americans,
particularly blacks and females, are far too sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide study of adolescent physical activity was
conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina and
published in the June issue of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Lead author Penny Gordon-Larsen blamed the problems on the
decline in comprehensive physical education curricula in U.S.
schools and habitual TV viewing and video-game playing among
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though it's a particular problem for minorities, it's a
problem for all kids,'' said Gordon-Larsen, a postdoctoral fellow
at the university's Carolina Population Center.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters who don't get enough exercise could be at greater
risk for problems such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon-Larsen and her colleagues analyzed data on more than
17,700 middle school and high school students from a 1996
population center survey of adolescent health and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Based on self-reported data, students were grouped by levels of
activity and inactivity. Activity was characterized by frequency,
from zero to five times a week, and by intensity, with activities
such as cycling and martial arts ranking higher than less strenuous
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Inactivity was characterized by the number of hours spent each
week watching television or videos and playing video and computer
games.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also studied environmental and demographic
variables, finding that involvement in physical education classes
and use of community recreation center were key to healthy activity
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, youngsters who had PE class five times a week were more
than twice as likely to be highly active. Those who had PE one to
four times a week were 44 percent more likely to be highly active.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that PE had such a dramatic impact was a big
surprise,'' Gordon-Larsen said. ''We knew it had an impact, but we
had no idea that is was this strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one-fifth of the youngsters surveyed were enrolled in a PE
class, and 15 percent of the youngsters had PE five times a week.
Middle school students were more likely than high school students
to take PE, and males more likely than females.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goran of the Institute of Prevention Research at the
University of Southern California said the study helps quantify
factors thought to be associated with inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that we've known that children are less active,'' he
said. ''I think this may be one of the first studies that shows
this can be partially explained by environmental constraints or
environmental factors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a seemingly contradictory finding, blacks were more likely
than whites to be enrolled in PE classes and use recreation
centers, but were found to be less active.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little confusing; we really need more information to
understand why that is happening,'' said Gordon-Larsen.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some highly active youngsters could simultaneously be
considered highly inactive, based on their television viewing
habits.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Pate of the University of South Carolina's School of
Public Health said the trend toward fewer PE requirements in high
schools, as outlined in a 1996 report by the U.S. surgeon general,
is only one factor in childhood inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think solving this problem is nearly as simple as
saying, 'Let's get kids in PE classes more frequently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Educators must ensure that students enrolled in PE actually
participate, and that they learn the physical and behavioral
skills, including time management and goal-setting, they will need
later, Pate said.

<HEADLINE> Korean Refugees May Have Been Hit  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military investigators have found a formerly
secret Air Force document stating that U.S. planes, responding to a
request by the Army, strafed columns of civilian refugees
approaching American lines during the chaotic early days of the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon on Tuesday, officials said they do not doubt the
authenticity of the document but have yet to corroborate the
assertion that Air Force planes carried out Army requests for
strafing of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear,'' Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley
said of the memo. ''We have no reason to doubt the authenticity of
the memo. We just can't find any further information that will
direct us in a particular direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The document was dated July 25, 1950 -- one month after the war
began with a communist North Korean army invasion of South Korea.
It adds to statements from U.S. veterans and documents uncovered by
The Associated Press last year indicating that as American troops
retreated toward the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, the U.S.
military deliberately fired on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force memo also emphasizes that U.S. ground commanders
were fearful their lines were being infiltrated by groups of
civilian refugees that might include or be controlled by North
Korean soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The document was first reported by CBS News on Monday. A copy on
file at the National Archives was provided to the AP today.
</P>
<P>
   The Army opened an investigation into reported U.S. killings of
civilians in South Korea last year after the AP quoted U.S.
veterans and South Korean survivors saying American GIs carried out
a mass killing of civilians July 26-28, 1950, at the hamlet of No
Gun Ri. Ex-GIs spoke of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead. The South
Koreans say 300 were shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   The newly released Air Force document was written one day before
the No Gun Ri incident began and coincides with earlier AP reports
that the shooting of civilians at No Gun Ri began with an aerial
strafing. The Air Force document makes no mention of specific
places or numbers of civilians strafed.
</P>
<P>
   In its report last fall, AP reported that declassified military
documents showed general orders had been issued to shoot at
civilians who crossed front lines. ''Fire everyone trying to cross
lines. Use discretion in case of women and children,'' said an
order issued by the Army's 1st Cavalry Division headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Army has said it is not investigating the reported
aerial strafing of Korean civilians, Quigley said investigators
uncovered the Air Force memo in a search for any documents that may
shed light of events around the time of No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no particular reason to connect this to No Gun Ri and
perhaps there is no connection. We just don't know that yet,''
Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force memo is titled, ''Policy on Strafing Civilian
Refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is reported that large groups of civilians, either composed
of or controlled by North Korean soldiers, are infiltrating U.S.
positions,'' the memo says. ''The army has requested that we strafe
all civilian refugee parties that are noted approaching our
positions. To date, we have complied with the army request in this
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo was signed by Air Force Col. Turner C. Rogers, the
deputy chief of staff for operations for the 5th Air Force. It is
addressed to ''Gen. Timberlake.'' Quigley said that referred to Lt.
Gen. Edward Timberlake, who was vice commander of the 5th Air Force
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers noted the sensitivity of the problem of stopping civilian
refugees from passing through U.S. lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our operations involving the strafing of civilians is sure to
receive wide publicity and may cause embarrassment to the U.S. Air
Force and to the U.S. government in its relations with the United
Nations,'' Rogers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not understood why the army is not screening such
personnel or shooting them as they come through, if they desire
such action,'' he wrote, adding that the Air Force believed ''more
suitable targets'' were available for the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers recommended that a policy be adopted whereby Air Force
planes would not attack civilian refugee groups ''unless they are
definitely known to contain North Korean soldiers or commit hostile
acts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a story in December, the AP cited after-mission reports from
the Korean War that showed U.S. Air Force pilots sometimes
questioned their targets. In one, pilots said a Korean group
strafed at an airborne controller's instruction ''could have been
refugees.'' In another declassified report they said their target
''appeared to be evacuees.''

<HEADLINE> China Official To Visit Yugoslavia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A top Chinese official will visit
Yugoslavia next week in a sign of support for embattled President
Slobodan Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   Li Peng, the speaker of China's parliament and second-ranking
member of the ruling Communist Party, will make the official visit
June 11-13, according to a statement from Yugoslav authorities that
was carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Li will address the Yugoslav parliament during a session on June
12, Beta news agency reported
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the Chinese lawmaker will meet
Milosevic, who has been politically isolated by the United States
and its allies and indicted by the United Nations war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   China is one of the few countries maintaining ties with
Milosevic's government following last year's NATO bombing of the
country. Milosevic visited China in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   China opposed the NATO bombing that included a mistaken hit on
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade that killed three Chinese citizens.
The incident led to tensions in U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   Tanjug said Li's meetings with Yugoslav officials will focus on
relations between the two countries and international issues.

<HEADLINE> Louima grilled about civil suit  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Taking his familiar spot on the witness stand,
Abner Louima told a jury Tuesday that he was suing the police
officer sitting at the defense table even though the officer was
not among those who tortured him in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Francisco Rosario, is on trial in Brooklyn federal
court for allegedly lying to FBI agents investigating the notorious
assault in a precinct bathroom. Louima also has named Rosario -
along with several other officers, the city and the police
department - in a lawsuit seeking $155 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you believe that it will help your civil case if Officer
Rosario is convicted here?'' Rosario's attorney, Richard Levitt,
asked Louima.
</P>
<P>
   ''That, I don't know,'' Louima replied.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination on the trial's second day sought to
portray Louima as a professional victim eager to tailor his
testimony to the needs both of criminal prosecutors and his own
civil suit. Federal authorities are giving him $2,000 a month for
living expenses while he recovers from the attack and serves as
their star witness.
</P>
<P>
   Louima's suit, filed in 1998, claims that officers at Brooklyn's
70th Precinct conspired to create a ''blue wall of silence and lies
to obstruct justice.'' It also charges police and union officials
with condoning an ''environment in which the most violent police
officers believed they would be insulated'' from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In three criminal trials, including Rosario's, Louima has
testified about an ordeal stemming from his arrest in a street
brawl outside a Brooklyn nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner was handcuffed and taken to the precinct. There,
Officer Justin Volpe - mistakenly believing Louima had punched him
- sought revenge by sodomizing the prisoner with a broken
broomstick and threatening to kill him if he reported it.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, who pleaded guilty, is serving 30 years. A jury convicted
a second patrolman, Charles Schwarz, of pinning Louima down during
the assault; he and former officers Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese
were later convicted of conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario, 35, and his partner - both roving plainclothes officers
- happened to be filling out paperwork in a holding cell area when
Volpe threw a battered Louima, his pants still down, into a cell
following the assault, authorities said. Prosecutors allege the
partners conspired to lie to FBI agents as part of a cover-up -
first by saying they were never there, then by claiming Louima's
escort was not Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt admitted Monday in opening statements that Rosario at
first tried to mislead authorities to protect himself - a mistake,
he argued, that does not rise to a federal offense.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer also said his client honestly believed another
officer had put Louima in the holding cell. He noted that other
witnesses, including Louima, had given conflicting statements about
the identity of the officer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Levitt confronted Louima with state grand jury
testimony in which he indicated Schwarz had put him in the cell.
Several months later, while in front of a federal grand jury,
Louima changed the story to make that officer Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   Louima admitted meeting with federal authorities behind closed
doors at least 10 times between the two grand juries. But he
insisted his testimony was based on memory, not coaching.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 42; Nasdaq Down 18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today as investors
took some profits after three consecutive strong sessions. Banking
and retail stocks fell as investors realized that an economic
slowdown may keep inflation at bay, but will also hurt certain
business sectors.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 41.78 at 10,773.52.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower, having given up early
gains. The Nasdaq composite index was down 18.11 to 3,803.65, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 8.20 to 1,459.43.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three sessions, stocks have risen on investors'
hopes that the economy has slowed enough to persuade the Federal
Reserve to stop raising interest rates. But today, investors
changed tacks, selling stocks that are seen as vulnerable to
economic slowdowns.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan fell $4.125 to $133, contributing most to the Dow's
decline. Merrill Lynch analyst Judah Kraushaar told clients that
periods of rising interest rates have typically been bad for
investment banking revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Also, shares of many prominent retailers fell as investors
reasoned that signs of a slowdown in consumer spending could mean
retailers will see revenue and profits slide. Circuit City plunged
$12.688 to $39.438 after saying that sales were flat in May.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Circuit City's warning convinced investors that
other retailers will also struggle in the coming months. Wal-Mart
fell $1.313 to $58.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, analysts said investors appeared to be
regrouping after sharp gains last week. The Nasdaq, which had been
battered in March and April, soared a record-breaking 19 percent
last week as investors flocked back to the technology stock that
dominate its ranks. The Dow, which hadn't suffered as badly, rose
4.8 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market's doing extremely well after last week's screamer,
which set us up for a little profit-taking,'' said Ralph Bloch,
chief market analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while some investors were indeed cashing in stocks to
capture gains, more stocks were rising than falling in the overall
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some good underlying strength,'' Bloch said. ''That's
the sign of a market engaging in a healthy pause.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Raises on tap for governor and other elected officials  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The salary for governor's office will
nearly double in 2003, and other elected officials will get raises
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The pay raise boosts the governor's salary from $78,000 to
$150,000 - the first increase for the office since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland, whose current term expires in 2002, signed
the pay raise bill last Thursday. Unlike other bill signings, no
notice was given to reporters that Rowland had signed the bill.
Officials from Rowland's office called that an unintentional
oversight, and said the information was posted on the Internet
Friday and made available outside the governor's press secretary's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the raises by reporters Tuesday, Rowland brushed off
reports that the increase would make Connecticut's governor one of
the highest-paid state leaders in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen comparisons,'' Rowland said. ''But that's not true -
not when you compare it to what the other salaries are going to be
two more years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki and California Gov. Gray Davis
currently top the list of highest-paid governors.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Compensation Commission, which sets salary levels
for elected officials in California, in March approved an increase
to the governor's salary to $175,000 a year, effective in December.
Davis has said he will decline the increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut increase passed without debate last month,
winning approval in the House of Representatives 97-53, and in the
Senate 20-15, in the waning hours of the 2000 legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also boosts the salaries of the lieutenant governor,
secretary of the state, attorney general and treasurer, which were
last raised in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file members of the state's part-time General Assembly
- who voted themselves a $5,100 raise in 1998 - are getting another
increase. Their $21,788 salaries are climbing to $28,000 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their salaries, House members receive $4,500 a
year in travel expenses. Senators get $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Andrew Roraback, R-Goshen, voted against the raises.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we could have voted just on the governor's salary, I would
have voted 'yes' in a heartbeat,'' he said. ''But only two years
have passed since the legislative raises, and the magnitude of the
new raise is large.''
</P>
<P>
   The salaries of the Senate president pro tempore and House
speaker will be raised from $30,108 to $38,689. Minority leaders
will get $8,000 raises.
</P>
<P>
   Judges' salaries also going up. The Supreme Court chief
justice's pay would be raised in 2002 from $140,582 to $149,582,
and the chief court administrator's salary will be boosted from
$134,738 to $143,738.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court judges will make $125,000 in 2002, $9,000 more
than they will earn in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Late Nigeria Dictator Kin Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A Swiss judge said Tuesday he has indicted the son
of the late Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha in connection with a
billion dollar money-laundering investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Georges Zecchin told The Associated Press he traveled to Lagos,
Nigeria, last month to issue formal charges against Mohammed
Abacha, who is in prison on a murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   He said Abacha was accused of money-laundering, fraud,
mismanaging public funds and belonging to a criminal organization.
</P>
<P>
   Zecchin also has indicted Abacha's London-based partner,
Abubakar Atiku Bagudu.
</P>
<P>
   To date, some $670 million linked to Sani Abacha has been frozen
in Swiss banks accounts, Zecchin said. Luxembourg also has frozen
$600 million, and more money is being held in Britain. The Nigerian
government has said it believes Sani Abacha also had accounts in
Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   Zecchin said he estimated that up to 100 banks could be involved
in the case. He added that Swiss investigators were trying to link
the exit of money from Nigeria to the arrival of money in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria alleges that Sani Abacha and his accomplices
systematically plundered the Nigerian Central Bank and hid the
money in overseas bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha's five-year rule ended in June 1998 after he died of an
apparent heart attack. His police state was notorious for its
brutality and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Abacha is charged with killing human rights campaigner
Kudirat Abiola, who was ambushed in her car and gunned down in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola was the wife of the late Moshood Abiola, who was presumed
to have won Nigeria's 1993 presidential elections. But the military
annulled the vote shortly before Sani Abacha seized power. Abiola
died of heart failure while in police custody in July 1998, one
month after Abacha's death.

<HEADLINE> Putin's Defense Plan Eases Tension  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal to
work with NATO and Europe on an anti-missile defense system
released some of the tension building in Europe over fears that the
U.S. plan to build its own system would spur a renewed arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Critical to the shift in mood, albeit slight, was Putin's tacit
acknowledgment in the proposal that a threat by rogue states does
exist -- in essence validating the United States' chief reason for
pursuing its own national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the French Foreign Ministry acknowledged some
common ground had been reached, while emphasizing France shares
Russia's concerns that the U.S. plan is a threat to the goal of
global disarmament. Germany also is among the chief critics of
Washington's go-it-alone proposal, fearing a destabilizing shift in
military balance.
</P>
<P>
   Putin floated the idea of jointly developing a shield with the
United States ahead of President Clinton's arrival in Moscow on
Saturday. He appeared to reiterate the idea in Rome on Monday,
proposing working ''with Europe and NATO to create an anti-rocket
defense system for Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   However, his meaning was vague enough to raise concerns about
whether he was trying to drive a wedge between the United States
and Europe by seeking an independent deal with Europe at a time of
great sensitivity among the trans-Atlantic allies about the future
of European defense.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has urged Europe to spend more on
defense, it also is concerned by European plans to develop the
capability to respond to crises without U.S. support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest political threat to the United States is the
European Union in terms of world power and domination,'' said Paul
Beaver, an arms expert at Jane's Missiles and Rockets in London.
''If the EU and Russia were to get together, it would bring the
world back into a bipolar situation again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Putin is going to get too chummy with America.
His interest is to work together with the Europeans. He may well
try to spice up life.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian newspapers portrayed Putin's proposal as an attempt to
enhance Russia's sagging prestige by enlisting Europeans in a
counter-effort. Typical was La Repubblica, which said that by
broaching the idea in Rome Putin ''was looking for a prestigious
forum for his constructive antagonism toward the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Corriere della Sera compared Putin to a salesman trying to quash
the competition by frantically peddling his own ''product.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking full details of Russia's proposal, however, officials
and analysts declined to speculate on whether the proposal was
technically feasible. NATO welcomed ''the cooperative spirit,'' but
said it didn't have enough information to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the Russian plan would use upgraded anti-aircraft
missiles to destroy enemy nuclear missiles just after launch. The
American system, by contrast, would use more advanced rockets to
destroy warheads in space or as they descend.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says the Russian plan for a joint defense
would not be adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Russia says its plan would fit in the framework of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty because of its lesser capabilities.
The United States wants to amend the treaty, a move Moscow
staunchly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   One key impediment to launching a joint project with the United
States would be the issue of intelligence sharing. ''The levels of
infrastructure that must be shared are very, very sensitive, and at
the highest levels politically,'' Beaver said, adding that the
United States is unlikely to agree to such an exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of actual hardware, the Russians may have something
to offer,'' Beaver said, referring to the V2500 antiballistic
missile system that they announced two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He described it as ''a tactical, moveable system. ... It appears
to be better than anything there is in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, editorial comment appeared to indicate that European
resistance to Washington's plans has not been fully eased -- and
that sympathies lie more with Russia's concerns than with American
fears.
</P>
<P>
   ''That Mr. Putin showed a degree of understanding for the
concerns of the United States on this issue will not stop him from
stirring up the opposition to American plans when he makes his
first formal visit to European capitals, especially as he can
expect his views to find resonance,'' the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung wrote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That is likely to be the case when Putin meets next week in
Berlin with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who already has warned
Clinton of starting an arms race.

<HEADLINE> It's a drive-by attack on Pirro's auto deductions  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A couple of Ferraris, a couple of
Mercedes Benzes, a Bentley and several sport utility vehicles
tooled through the testimony of an Internal Revenue Service agent
Tuesday at the tax evasion trial of Albert Pirro, husband of the
Westchester district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In general, said agent John Dennehy, the cars were for the
Pirros' personal pleasure, not for business, and should not have
been used to generate tens of thousands of dollars in tax
deductions for Pirro's companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro and his brother Anthony are accused of disguising more
than $1 million in such personal expenses as business write-offs.
The 3-week-old trial has provided a glimpse at the lavish lifestyle
of the district attorney and her husband, which prosecutors say was
partially supported with cash that should have gone to the
government. Jeanine Pirro is not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy, prompted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Cathy Seibel,
listed vehicle after vehicle, noting how each was used as a
business expense and the reasons he concluded that the deductions
should be disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he gave Pirro the benefit of any doubt, allowing all
deductions for any vehicle that he could not prove was entirely for
personal use.
</P>
<P>
   But that left plenty, he said:
</P>
<P>
   -A 1984 Ferrari, listed on an insurance document as for Albert
Pirro's personal use, was deducted by his law firm for loan
payments and depreciation.
</P>
<P>
   -The 1989 Mercedes that carried Jeanine Pirro's judicial license
plates had its lease payments deducted by the Ferris-Pirro
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   -A 1990 Toyota 4Runner that was shipped to Florida - where the
Pirros have a vacation home - was written off for car payments and
depreciation by the law firm.
</P>
<P>
   -A 1992 Mercedes driven by Jeanine Pirro's mother and serviced
near her home in Elmira was ''accounted for as if a company car''
by Distinctive Properties of Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   -A 1994 Ford Explorer should have been added to Albert Pirro's
income that year, but instead was treated as a company asset by the
law firm, which deducted interest payments and depreciation.
</P>
<P>
   -Similarly, the $123,000 cost of a 1995 Ferrari purchased by the
law firm should have been added to Pirro's income, since it was for
his personal use and was sent down to Florida. Instead, the law
firm took the deductions and Pirro did not report the income.
</P>
<P>
   Other vehicles mentioned included the Bentley, a Chevrolet
Tahoe, a Jeep Cherokee and a Ford Bronco.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 Mercedes came in for special scrutiny, including a
computerized slide show that showed seven different companies
involved in the financing. Prosecutors said in pretrial papers that
the financing was ''an empty financial transaction, a sham'' used
by Albert Pirro to mask fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro has emphasized that when he learned of the tax
investigation, he had his tax returns redone and paid back nearly
$1 million in back taxes and interest. Judge Barrington Parker
reminded the jury Tuesday that for a criminal conviction, the
government must prove there was ''intent to evade a substantial
amount of taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy may have been addressing that when he testified that in
examining the records of Anthony Pirro, who was Albert Pirro's
accountant, he saw that in 1992 deductions were reduced by $40,000
because they were personal; in 1994, by contrast, all expenses
listed as ''personal'' in Anthony Pirro's ledger were nevertheless
deducted.

<HEADLINE> Small Party Exits Poland Coalition  </HEADLINE>
By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A small liberal party dropped out of its
2{-year-old coalition with Poland's fractious Solidarity bloc on
Tuesday, frustrated over the government's failure to push through
key reforms needed to get Poland into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   After the Freedom Union's move, the Solidarity's political
leaders will try to run a government without a majority in
parliament, raising the possibility of early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Solidarity ''is taking full responsibility for governing
Poland,'' the bloc's political chief, Marian Krzaklewski, said
after a leadership meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He said Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek would soon nominate
candidates to replace the Union's five departing Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup followed an announcement by Freedom Union leader
Leszek Balcerowicz, who also is finance minister, that his party
was abandoning efforts to salvage the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Buzek, 59, remains the longest serving prime minister in the
tumultuous transition years since Poland toppled communist rule in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear how Solidarity will fare without a majority in
the already contentious parliament. Its leaders are hoping to avoid
early elections because polls suggest they would be won by the
Democratic Left Alliance, a coalition of former communists.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their chronic feuding, the coalition partners had
managed to carry out broad reforms in social security and health
care and to accelerate the restructuring of ailing communist-area
industries. They also launched EU membership talks and presided
over Poland's landmark entry into NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Work on key legislation has stalled in recent months, however,
and the two sides finally fell out over disagreement on who should
replace Buzek, whom the Union blamed for not rallying Solidarity
legislators behind reform measures demanded by the EU.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Union ordered its ministers to resign from the
Cabinet two weeks ago, but they had agreed to continue working
while party leaders struggled to negotiate a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Solidarity proposed Krzaklewski as Buzek's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   But the Freedom Union contended he would be no more effective
than Buzek and would be distracted by his plans for a long-shot run
for the presidency this fall against incumbent Aleksander
Kwasniewski, an ex-communist who has become Poland's most popular
politician.
</P>
<P>
   ''The negotiations were leading nowhere. Our partners had no
intention to reach agreement,'' said Freedom Union spokesman
Andrzej Potocki.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government can count on our support wherever it will
continue our joint efforts,'' Potocki said. ''We will not destroy
the government for the fun of being in opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Boguslaw Grabowski, a central bank economist who was briefly
considered as a possible Buzek replacement, said Solidarity faced a
''very difficult task'' and a test of its commitment to economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he saw no threat to Poland's economy, the most
successful in the former Soviet bloc, or to billions of dollars of
investment poured in by Western firms, especially from Germany and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Changes Korea Death Toll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has revised yet again its count
of Americans who died in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Although the latest tally from the report, Service and
Casualties in Major Wars and Conflicts, put the total at 36,913,
the Pentagon said Tuesday that revisions made last week changed it
to 36,516.
</P>
<P>
   The main change: 432 deaths that had been in the ''non-battle''
category for Korean War losses -- meaning troops lost to accidents,
illness and other non-combat causes -- were shifted to a separate
category of U.S. military deaths that occurred elsewhere in the
world during the three-year war.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said there were 2,830 ''non-battle'' deaths in
Korea, not the 3,262 it had reported previously. It also increased
the number of combat deaths in Korea by 35, to 33,686. This number
has changed many times over the years, but only slightly. In 1974,
for example, it stood at 33,629.
</P>
<P>
   The war, in which U.S. and United Nations forces fought on the
side of South Korea against communist North Korea and its Chinese
and Soviet allies, began June 25, 1950, and ended in a truce July
27, 1953.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Pentagon said a U.S. government
delegation will open negotiations with North Korea on Wednesday on
recovering remains of American servicemen who were lost in battle
in North Korea during the war. Slightly more than 8,100 U.S.
servicemen are unaccounted for from the war.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, to be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, are to last for
three days, spokesman Larry Greer said.

<HEADLINE> Unilever to buy Bestfoods for $20.3 billion, creating world's largest food company </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Bestfoods, the maker of Skippy peanut butter and
Hellmann's mayonnaise, agreed Tuesday to be purchased by European
conglomerate Unilever for $20.3 billion, creating the largest food
company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The final offer of $73 a share, made nearly a month after
Unilever first courted Bestfoods of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., was 11
percent higher than Unilever's original unsolicited bid of $18.4
billion, or $66 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever will also assume about $4 billion in debt as part of
the deal. The companies estimate their combination will lead to
savings of up to $750 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Their combined revenue in 1999 of about $52 billion easily
surpasses that of Nestle SA, which had $46 billion in sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bestfoods surged nearly 10 percent Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange, up $6.188 to $69.188. Shares of Anglo-Dutch
conglomerate Unilever rose 75 cents to $51.125, also on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts praised Bestfoods' deft handling of the
negotiations to achieve a higher price for their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was somewhat high-stakes poker, but in the end it worked,''
said Mitchell Pinheiro, an analyst at Philadelphia-based Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Others said it was worth the higher price.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever will benefit by obtaining Bestfood's long menu of
well-known brand names, which also includes Knorr soups and Thomas'
English muffins,said PaineWebber analyst John O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the acquisition provides Unilever with significant
inroads into emerging markets where Bestfoods already has
established a presence.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Knorr soups rank number one in market share across
much of Latin America and Asia. The same is true for Bestfoods'
corn oil and starches products.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval in both Europe
and the United States, is expected to be completed by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Bestfoods spurned Unilever's original offer, saying
the bid was too low and that Bestfoods preferred to remain
independent.
</P>
<P>
   But Unilever, which owns Lipton teas, Ragu sauces, Vaseline, and
Pepsodent toothpaste, and which recently bought Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice
cream business, was persistent, discreetly keeping channels of
communication open.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bestfoods officials remained coy, refusing to confirm
or deny speculation that the company was talking with several other
large food companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since rejecting Unilever's original offer, Bestfoods was widely
rumored to be in negotiations to sell all or part of its operations
to Diageo PLC, which owns of Pillsbury baking products and was
formed by a merger between Grand Metropolitan PLC and Guinness PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Then reports surfaced over the weekend that Bestfoods was close
to acquiring long-ailing Campbell Soup for $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But most observers who follow the company said Bestfoods was
likely using the speculation as a bargaining ploy to extract a
higher offer from Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, conjecture grew that pressure was mounting on
Bestfoods executives to accept a sweetened bid from Unilever in the
belief that Bestfoods officials would have trouble justifying
objections to an offer of more than $70 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is expected to act as a catalyst for future
partnerships in the long-dormant food products sectors, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the huge multinational companies that are looking
to expand their markets through acquisitions of smaller companies
know they will need to add strong brand names, similar to those now
owned by companies like Bestfoods, Heinz and Campbell Soup.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor adding to the apparent urgency of large food
companies to purchase smaller ones has been consolidation within
the retail grocery store sector. As grocery chains have merged and
become larger and stronger, food companies have realized that they
must keep pace in order to negotiate prices and product placement
with stores on an equal footing.

<HEADLINE> NKorea Defectors Doubtful on Summit  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Reunions of separated families are
likely to be a prominent topic in a summit this month between the
leaders of South Korea and North Korea. But Chang In Sook, 59,
doubts she'll get a chance to see one of her sons again.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Chang is a North Korean defector living in the
South, a class of citizen that the totalitarian government in
Pyongyang brands guilty of treason.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea might agree to more reunions of relatives who
haven't seen each other since the 1950-53 Korean War or earlier.
But it is doubtful that it would grant such a favor to North
Koreans who dared flee their poor and repressive homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Chang hasn't seen one of her four sons for two years and doesn't
even know if he's alive. Her saga began in 1990, when another son,
who had been studying in Ukraine, defected to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Chang, an architect, and her children had lived
relatively comfortable lives as highly educated citizens in
Pyongyang. The defection ruined all that.
</P>
<P>
   Angry officials stripped Chang's other three sons of jobs or
expelled them from schools and they were moved to a barren border
town. In 1998, they illegally crossed into China, but one son was
left behind, arrested because of a tip-off by his in-laws about the
escape plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never spend a day without thinking of him,'' Chang said.
''He is always in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Several million North Koreans fled to South Korea after the
peninsula divided in 1945 and during the Korean War, and most have
not heard from their relatives in the North. Some temporary
reunions have been held, mostly in China with the help of brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The June 12-14 summit between South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, will be the
first-ever meeting between leaders of the South and North. But
feelings are mixed among the nearly 1,000 North Koreans who have
defected to South Korea since the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a show directed by Kim Jong Il. If you have lived in the
North, you would know,'' said Kim Ok Ran, 42, who defected to South
Korea in 1997 with her son and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who works for a charity organization for North Korean
refugees in China and other nations, said the North is unlikely to
change its policies in any significant way.
</P>
<P>
   Chung Nam, Chang's youngest son, echoed that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ''South Koreans are just too excited about the whole thing. They
just don't understand how things work in North Korea. Its policy
has not changed, only the tactics,'' said Chung, 26, who is
studying mass media at a Seoul university.
</P>
<P>
   He expects the North to take offers of economic aid from the
South while remaining largely closed to outside influence.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's economy went into a freefall after the collapse of
the former Soviet Union stripped it of key trade partners and aid
providers. Then its inefficient collective farm industry was hit by
bad weather beginning in 1995, leading to widespread famine.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the North's economy has hit bottom and has shown
small signs of improvement, but food shortages remain common.
</P>
<P>
   Not all North Korean defectors are negative about the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although it might not immediately benefit us defectors, I, for
one, have great expectations for the summit,'' said Kim Soon Young,
23, who works for a wedding event company.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who defected to South Korea with her parents and two
sisters in the summer of 1998, has aunts and uncles on her mother's
side in the North.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Free Funds for Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Judd Gregg agreed Tuesday to release $50
million for U.N. peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone after
receiving assurances from the administration that it no longer
envisions a role for rebel leader Foday Sankoh in efforts to reach
a peace settlement
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh and his allies are widely accused to committing numerous
atrocities during long years of civil war in Sierra Leone. He
signed a peace agreement 11 months ago that ensured him a role in
government, then repudiated the accord this past spring when he
took up arms again. He was arrested last month in the Sierra Leone
capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg, who had been single-handedly holding up the money,
announced his decision in a speech from the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire Republican had drawn sharp criticism from the
administration and from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for
putting holds not only on funds for Sierra Leone but also for
Kosovo, East Timor and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gregg released his hold on $40 million for U.N.
operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee overseeing
State Department expenditures, Gregg used his power to block the
funds even though the money had been appropriated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The combined total of the holds on the four peacekeeping
operations was $368 million.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Philip Reeker welcomed Gregg's
action, calling it a positive development. ''This will allow us to
help invigorate the U.N. process there in Sierra Leone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg decided to release the Sierra Leone money after receiving
assurances from Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, about U.S. policy toward Sierra Leone and toward
Sankoh in particular.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gregg, Holbrooke said the United States does not
believe that Sankoh ''should play any role whatsoever in the future
political process in Sierra Leone. ... He must be held accountable
for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke also promised U.S. support for efforts to seize Sierra
Leone's lucrative diamond mines from the control of Sankoh's
forces, known as the Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as three weeks ago, the State Department said Sankoh
had a ''chance to play a positive role'' in resurrecting the peace
agreement that he signed almost a year ago and then violated.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. position on Sankoh began to harden days later following
his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gregg said Holbrooke's comments on Sankoh and
other aspects of the situation in Sierra Leone give him reason for
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we will recognize him (Sankoh) for what he is, a war
criminal, and treat him as such,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg put the hold on the Sierra Leone money last month at a
time when Sankoh's rebels were holding about 260 U.N. peacekeepers
hostage. All have since been released. Gregg had indicated he would
tie release of the funds to release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg's multiple holds drew the wrath of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who described the action as a ''grave
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Troublemakers in these regions cannot simply be wished away,
they must be contained, captured, convicted or converted, which, in
every case, requires resources,'' Albright said in a speech last
month.

<HEADLINE> State law part of drive to save newborns from abandonment  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Meriden Police Chief Robert E. Kosienski
wishes a state law allowing mothers to give up their newborns at a
hospital emergency room - no questions asked - had come 12 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe then, he said Tuesday, one young woman might not have left
her 71/2-pound, blue-eyed baby boy in a parking lot to freeze to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''If David Paul's mother had known about the law, there's a good
chance she may have taken advantage of it,'' Kosienski said of the
child, who police named after he was found. ''There's that window
to save the baby's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland last week signed the law to create ''safe
havens'' for newborns at risk of abandonment, a measure supporters
say gives scared young mothers a new option and saves babies'
lives. It takes effect Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   At least 28 states have either adopted or are considering
similar legislation this year alone, according to the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Under Connecticut's law, passed by the Legislature unanimously,
parents can leave a baby under 31 days old at the emergency room of
any hospital in the state. The parent will receive an
identification number and has 30 days to ask the court to be
reunited with the child. Otherwise, parental rights will be
terminated and the adoption process begun.
</P>
<P>
   If the baby has not been abused, the mother cannot be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frequently we have babies having babies ... and they panic,''
said state Rep. Ann Dandrow, R-Southington, who sponsored the
legislation. ''If they knew of other options, they would take
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials cannot say how many newborns are abandoned every year.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, compiling figures
from media reports, said there were reports of 105 infants
abandoned in ''public places'' in 1998, including 33 who were dead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the only other recent year for which figures were
compiled, there were 65 infants abandoned in public places - eight
of them dead.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NCSL, states that have approved or considered
infant abandonment legislation this year include California,
Florida, New York and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But some child welfare advocates say the programs are likely to
do little for the women targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of our girls are not going to walk into a hospital, where
there are security guards and cameras, to drop off a baby,'' said
Angel Waters, of Project Cuddle, a Costa Mesa, Calif.-based
organization which operates a 24-hour hot line to prevent
abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   James Dinnan, who prosecuted the 1995 case of a 16-year-old
Cheshire girl who gave birth at home and threw the baby in the
trash, said she and women like her probably would not seek the help
the law allows. Amanda Beckett, who was convicted of second-degree
manslaughter and served seven months in prison, never told anyone
she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ''When these people become pregnant, it's too late,'' said
Dinnan, now a senior assistant state's attorney in Meriden.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say the programs ensure no support for the women,
ignore the role of the father and may actually encourage women to
abandon a baby if they are unhappy with its sex or if it has
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say that if just one mother takes advantage of the
program, that's one less newborn dead and one less woman sent to
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some critics say 'wait and see how it's working elsewhere,''
said Jodi Brooks, a television news reporter in Mobile, Ala., who
founded a program in her community in 1998. ''Every time we wait,
there's a chance of losing another life.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the program for infants less than three days old began in
Mobile, one baby has been rescued from a trash pile, another two
have been turned in at hospitals, and two teen-age girls have
received counseling that guided them through successful
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said some programs suffer because the legislation leaves
unexpected holes.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Hospital Association has already asked state
officials for guidance on some questions unanswered in the law,
said spokeswoman Carrie Brady. The questions include how to handle
babies who appear to be more than 31 days old and how to determine
whether the person giving up the child has the mother's permission
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''We support it in principle, but there are some implementation
issues,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Carrey Had a Crush on Zellweger  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hot Hollywood celebrity couple Jim Carrey and
Renee Zellweger didn't experience love at first, or second, or even
third sight.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until after they finished filming the upcoming ''Me,
Myself &AMP; Irene'' that Zellweger finally succumbed to the smitten
Carrey's charms.
</P>
<P>
   While making the movie, ''he became very important to me as a
friend,'' the 31-year-old Zellweger said in the July issue of
Vanity Fair. ''I mean, we had had some fun together.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey, 38, had met Zellweger over dinner at a mutual friend's
house about two years ago. He fell for her during filming, but
Zellweger's affections grew a bit slower.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was there for work,'' Zellweger said. ''All I know is that
once he was gone I missed him. Badly. So maybe I was falling in
love.''

<HEADLINE> Document:US Planes Strafed Refugees  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military investigators are searching for a
link between an Air Force memo on strafing of refugees in the early
weeks of the Korean War and reports that American GIs gunned down
large numbers of civilians at a village called No Gun Ri during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   The memo is dated July 25, 1950, the day before the alleged
atrocities at No Gun Ri. The memo said Air Force planes had strafed
columns of civilian refugees at the request of Army commanders, but
it lacked details such as locations of the strafing, exact dates
and the number of people involved.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, said
investigators have no reason to question the document's
authenticity but have yet to find other evidence to confirm that
strafing occurred. Neither have they determined whether the
strafing was related directly to what happened at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still looking for something that would either tell us
for sure, yes or no, that there is a tie,'' Quigley said. ''It's
kind of fuzzy right now in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Army investigators found the Air Force memo while searching for
documents that may provide information about events around the time
of No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no particular reason to connect this to No Gun Ri, and
perhaps there is no connection. We just don't know that yet,''
Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said they are deferring to the Army on all
matters related to the No Gun Ri investigation, even if they
involve Air Force records.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force memo adds to statements from U.S. veterans and
documents uncovered by The Associated Press indicating that as
American troops retreated toward the southern tip of the Korean
peninsula in the chaotic opening weeks of the war, the U.S.
military deliberately fired on civilian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the memo emphasizes that U.S. ground commanders were
fearful their lines were being infiltrated by civilian refugees who
might include or be controlled by North Korean soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The document was first reported Monday by CBS News. A copy on
file at the National Archives was provided to the AP.
</P>
<P>
   The Army opened its investigation after the AP quoted U.S.
veterans and South Korean survivors as saying soldiers carried out
a mass killing of civilians July 26-28, 1950, at No Gun Ri. Ex-GIs
spoke of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead. The South Koreans say
300 were shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force memo is titled, ''Policy on Strafing Civilian
Refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is reported that large groups of civilians, either composed
of or controlled by North Korean soldiers, are infiltrating U.S.
positions,'' the memo said. ''The Army has requested that we strafe
all civilian refugee parties that are noted approaching our
positions. To date, we have complied with the Army request in this
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo was signed by Air Force Col. Turner C. Rogers, deputy
chief of staff for operations for the 5th Air Force. It is
addressed to ''Gen. Timberlake.'' Quigley said that referred to Lt.
Gen. Edward Timberlake, who was vice commander of the 5th Air Force
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said investigators had interviewed Rogers, but Quigley
would not reveal what Rogers told them.
</P>
<P>
   In his memo, Rogers noted the sensitivity of the problem of
stopping civilian refugees from passing through U.S. lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our operations involving the strafing of civilians is sure to
receive wide publicity and may cause embarrassment to the U.S. Air
Force and to the U.S. government in its relations with the United
Nations,'' Rogers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not understood why the army is not screening such
personnel or shooting them as they come through, if they desire
such action,'' he wrote. The Air Force believed ''more suitable
targets'' were available for the air campaign, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers recommended that a policy be adopted whereby Air Force
planes would not attack civilian refugee groups ''unless they are
definitely known to contain North Korean soldiers or commit hostile
acts.''

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cops Find Alleged Picasso  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Police have recovered a painting believed
to be a stolen Picasso and arrested six people in the city of
Izmir, news reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork -- said to be the 1908 oil painting ''La Fermiere''
(The Farmer's Wife) -- was recovered after two Syrians and four
Turks attempted to sell it to undercover police for $6.5 million,
private television station NTV reported.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish police and Interpol were searching for the painting's
original owners, Izmir Police Chief Hasan Yucesan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not say when the painting was stolen or when it was
recovered. They believe the painting was stolen from a Middle
Eastern country.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of three art experts determined it was an original
painting by Pablo Picasso, the Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''The painting is Picasso's,'' Yucesan said. ''It's original,
and its back is signed.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting will be stored at the state art museum in Ankara
until its owner is found, Culture Ministry spokesman Nafiz Sahin
said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Church Boosts ID Card Protest  </HEADLINE>
By DEREK GATOPOULOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- In a major challenge to the government,
the leader of Greece's powerful Orthodox Church urged supporters
Tuesday to take to the streets to fight plans to stop recording
religion on state identity cards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We turn to the people and call on them to demonstrate against
efforts to make Greece a nonreligious country,'' Archbishop
Christodoulos said. ''The faithful public oppose this attempt to
push religion into the margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Christodoulos said protest rallies will be held in Athens and
the northern port of Thessaloniki later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, announced after a nine-hour meeting of the church
hierarchy, was the latest salvo in a showdown between the Socialist
government and the clergy and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute erupted two weeks ago, when Premier Costas Simitis
said religion will be deleted from ID cards to conform with privacy
protection laws. Fingerprints, profession and spouse's name will
also be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Simitis turned down an offer from Christodoulos
for talks to seek a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Dimitis Reppas said no change in policy
would result from the church's decision to hold protests.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church is Greece's official religion and wields
considerable influence in public life.
</P>
<P>
   Church supporters say stating one's religion on ID cards is an
important symbolic gesture that recognizes the church's role in
preserving Greek identity during years of foreign domination and
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   But the government and leaders of non-Orthodox faiths in Greece
say the measure is outdated and breeds prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Greece's main opposition conservative party has urged the
government to accept a church-proposed compromise and make
recording of religion voluntary. But the issue has divided
lawmakers across party lines.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gets Big Network TV Coverage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The network evening news shows have devoted
more stories to Elian Gonzalez than to any other nonelection story
since the O.J. Simpson case, according to a study by the Center for
Media and Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   During comparable time periods, coverage of the 6-year-old
shipwreck survivor exceeded that of the Columbine tragedy, the
Oklahoma City bombing, and the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr. and
Princess Diana combined, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian's story has been especially alluring, combining a
photogenic boy, family ties and serious international political
issues,'' CMPA President Dr. Robert Lichter. ''The story was a
current events cocktail, with equal parts People magazine and Wall
Street Journal-type story lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ''big three'' networks, ABC was responsible for more
than 38 percent of the boy's coverage, CBS more than 34 percent and
NBC with more than 26 percent of the total stories, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Election 2000, the study found that the Gonzalez case
has dominated the network newscasts this year, surpassing the next
six stories combined: rising gas prices, the New York Senate race,
the war in Chechnya, the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, Pope
John Paul II's trip to the Middle East and the Justice Department's
continued battle with Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the networks aired 431 stories on Simpson, who was
acquitted of the murder of his ex-wife and a friend, while so far
this year, the networks have aired 363 stories about Gonzalez's
plight, the research found.

   By comparison, there were 336 stories on the Oklahoma City

Princess Diana in 1997 and 161 on the death of Kennedy last year,

<HEADLINE> After years of trying, city on verge of getting public toilets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - After years of debate about whether providing
public toilets would be more harmful than helpful, the city is
finally prepared to take the plunge by spending $5 million to
install at least 50 privies around town.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the budget deal worked out this week between the City
Council and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the city will spend $1 million
the fiscal year beginning July 1 and $4 million the next year to
build the commodes. The first toilets could be operational within
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the City Council passed the budget 48-0, including
funding for the commodes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear yet how much the toilets will cost to use or to
maintain or where they will be placed. Some of the city's cost will
likely be offset by advertisements placed on the structures housing
the commodes.
</P>
<P>
   For years, city officials have debated whether to install public
toilets. After concerns were raised about the cost of such an
effort and the safety of those using the facilities, the issue went
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, City Council Speaker Peter Vallone - who was
impressed by public toilets he saw during a European vacation -
pushed hard for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue of public toilets has been sitting dormant for
years, the victim of bureaucracy, politics and inefficacy,'' said
Vallone. ''Finally, I said enough is enough. ... New York is a
world class city and our citizens and visitors deserve this very
basic service.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley casts vote for Gore, promises to campaign for Democrats  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) - Three months after dropping out of the
presidential race - and out of sight - Bill Bradley quietly cast
his vote Tuesday for former foe Al Gore and said he will resume a
public role campaigning for Democrats this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he is negotiating with Gore officials about his
role at the Democratic National Convention in August but has not
decided what instructions to give his 412 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the midst of very productive discussions with the
Gore campaign, so I'll leave it at that,'' Bradley said in a brief
interview with The Associated Press after voting in the New Jersey
primary in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will actively campaign for Democrats this year. Asked
whether that includes Gore, he replied, ''Uh, that's ... sure,
yeah, by all means.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Bradley has resisted the Gore camp's eagerness to
schedule a joint appearance of the former rivals. Bradley aides
said such a campaign event is in the works - and certain to happen
before the convention - but not imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who did not win a single state in his challenge to
Gore, could have expected a victory in New Jersey, the state he
served in the U.S. Senate for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   But he dropped out of the race March 9, three months before the
Garden State's primary, and Tuesday's ballot offered Democratic
voters only one alternative to Gore: Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., who
has run for the Democratic nomination in every presidential
election since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he pulled the lever for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When the former senator dropped out of the race, he said he
would support Gore's bid for the White House despite believing Gore
ran a campaign of ''distortions and negativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked that day whether that meant he was ''endorsing'' Gore,
Bradley said, ''It's your call.'' Adviser Anita Dunn told reporters
the distinction was semantic, not political, because Bradley
believes ''you support people and you endorse checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bradley has made no public appearances or public
comment on the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee has tried to use that against
Gore, keeping a running count of the number of days ''since Bill
Bradley refused to endorse Gore March 9th.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Tuesday he does not believe there is a need for
another statement of his backing for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said I'd give him my full support, and that's what I will
do,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has spent the past months ''traveling, talking to
people, writing, thinking things through.'' He is also writing a
book but declined to describe the topic.
</P>
<P>
   He has caught up on his movie-watching, saying a recent favorite
was ''East-West,'' the French film that received an Oscar
nomination for best foreign-language picture.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has sent letters to longtime supporters asking them for
a new infusion of money for his political action committee, Time
Future Inc. Bradley formed the PAC after leaving the Senate in 1997
and used it in subsequent elections to support Democratic
congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just gives us flexibility to campaign this fall,'' he said,
''and it gives flexibility to anything else I do politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say they do not know if Bradley has decided on a future
course in politics - pushing for a Cabinet position should Gore
win, for instance, or planning another presidential run should Gore
lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's 56,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's campaign spokesman.
''He's got a long time ahead of him. He's taking a look at what all
his options might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley drove himself to the elementary school that served as
his polling place, parallel parked, then walked inside under a
large umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters were disappointed that his name was not on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have loved to have seen Bradley for president,'' said
Sari Kramer, a clinical psychologist. ''I worked for him, my
daughter worked for him. But I guess the country's not really ready
for true moral leadership. We still want a politician. We don't
want a thoughtful intellectual - yet.''

<HEADLINE> Justices Back Rule of Law Elsewhere  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One-third of the Supreme Court appeared before
an international audience Tuesday to promote the rule of law in
other nations. One justice's suggestion: put court decisions on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to see written opinions of high courts around the
globe, written, interpreted in several languages and put on Web
sites so that the world can see what you're doing,'' Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor said at a World Bank-sponsored conference on legal and
judicial development.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said it is important for judges on
the new European Court of Human Rights to ''begin writing decisions
which have the capacity and the power to inspire and to persuade.''
</P>
<P>
   Nations' economies depend on having a fair and effective legal
system, because without it people will not invest there, added
Justice Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy told the audience that while the U.S. legal system took
hundreds of years to develop, other nations that lacked independent
judicial systems until now must act quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are entitled to democracy, they are entitled to
legitimacy, they are entitled to a recognition of their humanity,
and they are entitled to it now,'' Kennedy said. ''We have to teach
that law is a liberating force and it's not an oppressive force.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer said the idea is not to impose one country's legal system
on another country, and his colleagues acknowledged that the U.S.
system has its flaws. Asked whether local judges who are elected --
rather than appointed -- are vulnerable to political power and less
independent, O'Connor answered with a simple ''yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy added, ''It will never change, and what you must do in
the United States is to teach the public ... the necessity of
strong, courageous, principled judges who are entitled to be
re-elected despite unpopular decisions, and if the American public
doesn't understand that, it's in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how courts can be made more accessible to the poor,
Kennedy said legal aid programs provided a ''necessary safety valve
for the stability of government'' by allowing the voice of the poor
to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   A free press also is necessary, Breyer said. U.S. federal judges
are required to file financial disclosure forms every year, an
exercise he called annoying but necessary to convince the public
''that everything is above board.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Eyes Abortion Pill Regs  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is considering rules for use of
the abortion pill RU-486 that could restrict access to that
early-abortion option, Planned Parenthood's director said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration said in February it would
approve the sale of RU-486, also known as mifepristone, once some
final, but undisclosed, requirements were met.
</P>
<P>
   The pill's sponsor, the nonprofit Population Council, last week
told abortion providers the FDA is proposing some curbs on the
pill's use, said Gloria Feldt, national president of Planned
Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply concerned that FDA is considering restrictions
that in my view would virtually assure that very few doctors would
ever make mifepristone available,'' Feldt said Tuesday. Planned
Parenthood is a family planning group that favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   She said the biggest concern is an FDA proposal that physicians
allowed to administer RU-486 must be part of a registry, which she
said would deter doctors worried about anti-abortion violence from
offering the pill.
</P>
<P>
   Feldt said the FDA also is considering long-term health tracking
of at least some RU-486 recipients, something she called
unnecessary because half a million European women have used the
pill successfully since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the FDA's recent proposals are more restrictive than
we had expected,'' said Sandra Waldman, speaking for the Population
Council. She would not be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   But Waldman stressed that FDA discussions over the pill's use
have just begun and no requirements are complete.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show RU-486 is 95.5 percent effective in causing
abortion when taken within the first 49 days of pregnancy. But a
very small percentage of patients required additional surgical
treatment or blood transfusions, something the FDA must consider in
determining how the pill should be used. One question is how to
ensure women return for an exam to be sure the pregnancy was
terminated.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Population Council in 1994 received U.S. marketing
rights to RU-486 from the original French manufacturer, which
feared an anti-abortion boycott.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Talks To Head to D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians agreed Tuesday to
resume negotiations after a two-week lapse, but despite prodding by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright they remained far apart on
terms of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Jerusalem, one of the main issues, has not been
formally discussed, a senior U.S. official said. Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak wants it to be taken up later, said the
official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not close to an agreement,'' Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said. He said it was not clear that the Palestinians
wanted to move toward the agreement the two sides promised by
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, Yasser Arafat demanded Israel make good
on a promised third pullback on the West Bank and said Israel
should quit the West Bank under 1967 and 1973 U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will
reopen their talks in the Washington area early next week, and
Arafat will call on President Clinton at the White House June 14.
</P>
<P>
   There is a slight chance Barak might join them for a three-way
summit, but ''there is too much to do, and we are not there yet,''
the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, with King Abdullah II of Jordan at his side,
Clinton said, ''We're working at it, and I'm encouraged.'' But he
added: ''You know, it's not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The president pledged to do whatever he can to further peace.
''We're down to the difficult issues and difficult decisions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After talks with Clinton, Abdullah met with members of Congress.
The king told reporters he thought peacemaking between Israel and
the Palestinians generally is moving the right direction. ''I think
that people keep looking at the pessimistic side of things,'' he
said. ''You're going to have obstacles in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian talks would last about a week. The
Washington-area location was not disclosed and may be kept secret
even after senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators begin their
discussions, the official who briefed reporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright underscored the negotiations' precarious stage. ''We
are at a moment of truth when it is necessary for us all to roll up
our sleeves and work,'' she said. ''The United States is prepared
to help, but ultimately, the hard decisions have to be made by the
parties themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   These include how much territory the Palestinians are to get
from Israel for a state and whether its capital will be in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, after calling on Arafat at his office in the West Bank
town of Ramallah, said he pledged ''to do his part'' to conclude an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there are those who say that the negotiations cannot
succeed in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations,'' Albright said.
''Those voices belong to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has accused Arafat of foot-dragging, an accusation
Palestinian negotiators have hurled at Israelis in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat dismissed the complaint. ''We have demonstrated over and
over our many flexibilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat declined to say, however, whether the talks had reached a
point where a three-way summit hosted by Clinton would be useful.
And while he spoke in praise of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin as a partner in a joint quest for peace, Arafat would not say
whether he has changed his mind about Barak, whom he had praised
similarly in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not prepared to answer this question,'' the Palestinian
leader said, ''because I believe this question tends to destroy the
Palestinian-Israeli relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright concluded her talks in Jerusalem with a second meeting
with Barak. On Wednesday, she flies to Cairo to meet with Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak among other Arab leaders at a conference there.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said at the start of Albright's three-day
trip to the region that it would require at least one more visit to
arrange a three-way summit in the United States, and even then
there are bound to be differences remaining between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets With Jordan King  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After telling eastern Europeans that the
struggles of building open economies on the ruins of communism will
pay dividends in future prosperity, President Clinton was back at
the White House today, conferring with a leader from the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with King Abdullah II of Jordan at his side, said he is
encouraged by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's announcement
today that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will return to the
Washington area early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working at it and I'm encouraged,'' Clinton said before
an Oval Office meeting with Abdullah. ''You know, it's not going to
be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright announced the shift after meeting in Ramallah, on the
West Bank, with Yasser Arafat. She also said the Palestinian leader
would call on Clinton at the White House June 14.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left open the possibility of a Camp David-style summit
together with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're down to the difficult issues and difficult decisions,''
Clinton said as he pledged to do whatever he can to further peace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to Washington from Kiev, Ukraine, Monday night,
ending a journey in which he repeatedly urged openings to the West
for and by Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   That was his 48th foreign journey as president; his 49th is
later this week, to Tokyo, for the funeral of a Japanese prime
minister and to meet with his successor.
</P>
<P>
   At weekend summit meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin
and in a speech to the Russian parliament on Monday, Clinton said
European unity and institutions should not end at the borders of
the old Soviet Union, but should reach to Moscow and Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   He had sounded the same message to western Europe, in meetings
and speeches in Lisbon, Berlin and Aachen, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The finale was in Kiev, to tens of thousands of Ukranians in the
broad plaza and mall of St. Michael's Square.
</P>
<P>
   ''From Lithuania to Poland to the Czech Republic, those who
chose open societies and open markets like you started out with
sacrifice but they ended up with success,'' Clinton said. ''I
believe Ukraine has the best opportunity in a thousand years to
achieve freedom and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a presidential performance with a holiday air. Ukranian
rock stars played to the crowd standing in the hot sun, in a
sweeping mall between golden domed cathedrals. A giant American
flag hung over them, hundreds of yards down the mall from the
yellow and blue draped platform where Clinton spoke. The Odessa
Symphony Orchestra was on the plaza at the other side of the
platform. Clinton smiled, kept time and waved at the side of the
conductor when they played ''Take Me Out To The Ball Game.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke through an interpreter, urging Ukranians to rally in
support of democracy and a reformed, market economy. ''Communism
has lost in Ukraine but a full commitment to free-market democracy
has not yet won,'' he said. ''Do not give up. Keep on fighting.
Boritesya poboroete.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he went to the crowd, shaking hands campaign style along
the barrier in front of the platform. As he finished and headed
home, the bells of blue and white St. Michael's Cathedral, just
rebuilt, rang out over the square.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, with Clinton beside him at the presidential palace,
President Leonid Kuchma announced that the last part of the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant will be closed on Dec. 15, more than
14 years after the worst atomic power accident in history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced $78 million in U.S. aid for the shutdown, and
said he will seek additional international help for Ukraine. He
promised an additional $2 million in American aid for safety
measures at other Ukranian nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   Then the presidents and their official parties toasted the
moment in champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to make a rapid round trip to Tokyo to attend the
funeral on Thursday of Keizo Obuchi, who died of a stroke on May
14. The Kyodo News Agency said Clinton would hold talks with the
new prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, while he is in Toky.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses Congress on Funds  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton chided Congress for failing
to approve emergency money for ''pressing national needs,''
including relief for victims of Hurricane Floyd, help for Colombia
to battle drug traffickers and support for U.S. troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked Congress for $5.5 billion for these and other
items that he says cannot wait for next year's budget. The House
approved $13 billion in March, but the Senate chose to break up the
request and attach pieces to next year's spending bills, which
already were being written.
</P>
<P>
   The president's request includes money to do safety maintenance
on the air traffic control system, provide housing help for Floyd's
victims in North Carolina and battle forest fires, especially in
the West. It also includes emergency assistance for families who
struggled through the winter with high heating oil costs and now
face expenses for fans and air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The national interest in Colombia -- and in the other things
that I itemized -- just cries out for action,'' Clinton said. ''This
is funding for pressing national needs, where delay means putting
American families in hardship and our national interests at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Clinton's complaint, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said he favors approving anti-drug money for
Colombia but opposes handling the emergency requests in a single
piece of legislation. He said he fears it would attract spending on
lawmakers' pet projects and push the bill's price tag far above the
total of the president's emergency request.
</P>
<P>
   Lott promised to try to find a faster way to approve the money
for Colombia, which he acknowledged was bogged down in a
slow-moving foreign aid bill. ''We'll look for another vehicle to
which that can be attached,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Lott isn't convinced it will pass. ''I don't know where
the votes are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
blamed Clinton for the budget problems. He said that the president,
without authorization from Congress, has tapped defense accounts
for action in places like Kosovo, forcing lawmakers to find ways to
replenish accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can go blow his wind out all he wants as far as I'm
concerned,'' Stevens said. ''He has not been a fair president in
dealing with the financing of this government. He has caused us
increased costs by the way he's handled this money.''

<HEADLINE> Non-Combat Zone Medals Rethought  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said Tuesday it is reconsidering
the recent practice of awarding Bronze Star medals -- one of the
highest military honors -- to service members not involved in action
within a combat zone.
</P>
<P>
   The question arose after the military newspaper Stars and
Stripes reported last weekend that its review of Bronze Star
citations for the U.S. air campaign against Yugoslavia last year
showed that a majority went to servicemen far from the combat zone.
</P>
<P>
   At least five Bronze Stars, for example, went to Air Force
officers at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., home of the B-2 bombers
which flew roundtrip missions to the Balkans. None were pilots,
since the Defense Department criteria for awarding Bronze Stars
specifically says they are not for ''participation in aerial
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars and Stripes also said Bronze Stars were awarded to three
colonels in Germany who worked on overflight clearances and basing
rights in Europe for U.S. aircraft supporting the air campaign in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, which had the most people situated in the combat zone
-- but no one engaged in actual combat -- awarded no Bronze Stars,
the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon regulation on awarding Bronze Stars says they can
be given to a military member who ''distinguishes himself or
herself by heroic or meritorious achievement or service'' under any
of three circumstances:
</P>
<P>
   --''While engaged in an action against an enemy of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   --''While engaged in military operations involving conflict with
an opposing foreign force.''
</P>
<P>
   --While serving with friendly foreign forces in which the United
States is not a belligerent party.
</P>
<P>
   It does not say the military member must be present in the
combat zone, and Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said it
is up to the Air Force and other services to decide how to
interpret the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Air Force and Navy defended their Bronze Star awards as
appropriate under existing criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley was asked whether the Pentagon is reviewing the
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll take a look at them,'' he replied. ''I don't have any
sense at this point that the services have somehow inappropriately
applied the criteria, but we'll take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, spokeswoman Lt. Col. Catherine Abbott said the Pentagon
was reconsidering whether the Bronze Star should, as a matter of
policy, be awarded to service members who are not engaged in action
in a combat zone. She said it was not yet clear whether the Bronze
Stars awarded for the Kosovo campaign might be rescinded.

<HEADLINE> US Probes Mexico Activist Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said Tuesday it is
looking into reports that a Mexican activist has offered $10,000 to
anyone who kills a U.S. Border Patrol agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take such threats extremely seriously,'' said State
Department spokesman Philip Reeker.
</P>
<P>
   The bounty was offered by Carlos Ibarra Perez, president of the
Citizens Defense Committee, which contends that undocumented
Mexican aliens are being mistreated in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was made after a Border Patrol agent killed an
undocumented immigrant two weeks ago in Brownsville, Texas, and
reports surfaced of threats by vigilantes against immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Ibarra Perez expressed anger at the treatment of illegal
immigrants near Douglas, Ariz., where armed ranchers have patrolled
the border, guarding against trespassing and vandalism by
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said the United States is ''very much committed to
working with the Mexican authorities to promote border safety.''
</P>
<P>
   At a high-level Washington meeting last month, the United States
and Mexico agreed to intensify efforts to curb the smuggling of
Mexicans into Arizona and their illegal detention by vigilante
groups once they cross the border.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 80; Nasdaq Drops 65  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mostly lower Tuesday as investors
collected profits after a three-day winning streak. Financial and
retail issues fell as investors worried that an economic slowdown
would hurt those business sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Many stocks drifted between gains and losses as investors waited
for a new catalyst for the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that you can make a whole lot out of the market's
activity until the next time we have some concrete news to trade
off of,'' said Charles White, president and portfolio manager at
Avatar Associates in New York. ''There's nothing definitive or
compelling right now that's going to give the market direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 79.73 to close at
10,735.57.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower, having given up early
gains. The Nasdaq composite index fell 65.39 to 3,756.37 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 9.79 to 1,457.84.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks had risen in the past three sessions on investors' hopes
that the economy has slowed enough to persuade the Federal Reserve
to stop raising interest rates. But Tuesday, investors changed
strategy, selling stocks that are seen as vulnerable to economic
slowdowns.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan fell $3.75 to $133.375 contributed most to the Dow's
decline. Merrill Lynch analyst Judah Kraushaar told clients periods
of rising interest rates have typically been bad for investment
banking revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of many prominent retailers also fell as investors
reasoned that signs of a slowdown in consumer spending could mean
retailers will see revenue and profits slide. Circuit City plunged
$12.625 to $39.50 after saying sales were flat in May.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Circuit City's warning convinced investors that
other retailers will also struggle in the coming months. Wal-Mart
fell $1.188 to $58.125.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, analysts said investors appeared to be
regrouping after sharp gains last week. The Nasdaq, which had been
battered in March and April, soared a record-breaking 19 percent
last week as investors flocked back to the technology stock that
dominate its ranks. The Dow, which hadn't suffered as badly, rose
4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market's doing extremely well after last week's screamer,
which set us up for a little profit-taking,'' said Ralph Bloch,
chief market analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while some investors were indeed cashing in stocks to
capture gains, more stocks rose than fell in the overall market for
much of the session.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some good underlying strength,'' Bloch said. ''That's
the sign of a market engaging in a healthy pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks that fell prey to profit-takers included Sun
Microsystems, which lost $4.313 to $83.875.
</P>
<P>
   But a broad range of technology stocks advanced. Microsoft rose
$2.75 to $69.625 and Healtheon/Web MD rose $1.313 to $20.063.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Nasdaq, Starbucks rose $1.875 to $37.50. The coffee
company will be added to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 on Wednesday,
prompting many index fund managers to buy the stock so that their
portfolios will continue to mirror the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume remained fairly low as investors opted to wait
for more information on the strength of the U.S. economy before
taking significant new positions. The next potentially
market-moving report will reach traders Friday, when the Labor
Department releases the Producer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   A benign report could propel the market higher, White said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a boatload of cash on the sidelines,'' he said. ''More
evidence of a slowdown could be material for a very strong summer
rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Composite volume totaled 1.13 billion shares on the New York
Stock Exchange, compared with 1.02 billion in the previous session.
Advancing issues on the exchange outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9
margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.65 to close
at 511.65.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.2 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.7 percent, France's CAC-40 lost
1.0 percent, and Britain's FT-SE 100 index closed fractionally
higher.

<HEADLINE> Insurgent legislator angry at Silver  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A state assemblyman, angry at Speaker
Sheldon Silver for allowing debate on controversial legislation at
the same time as Italian-American lawmakers were to meet for an
annual dinner, said Tuesday it wouldn't have happened if he were
black, Hispanic, Irish or Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Seminerio, a Queens Democrat, said that ''in his little
mind, he thought he was getting even with me'' for supporting
former Majority Leader Michael Bragman's recent unsuccessful
attempt to oust fellow Democrat Silver from the Assembly's top job.
</P>
<P>
   Seminerio was among the organizers of the annual dinner for the
Italian-American state legislators. More than 400 people had
tickets to Monday night's event at an Italian-American community
center in nearby Troy, Seminerio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never happens with the Black and Puerto Rican caucus or
with Irish affairs,'' Seminerio said. ''And if is a Jewish holiday,
he (Silver) is out of here by 1 o'clock in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver, an Orthodox Jew, carefully observes the Jewish sabbath
and other holy days.
</P>
<P>
   At about the time people were to gather for the Italian-American
dinner at 6 p.m. Monday, the state Assembly was asked to begin
debate on a series of bills designed to reduce the number of
incidents where police shoot or beat innocent citizens.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate dragged on, Seminerio incurred the wrath of the
Assembly's black and Hispanic members - who were speaking
passionately in favor of the bills - by asking for a motion to
adjourn the Assembly so members and their families could go to the
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Seminerio then asked for a slow roll call of members to show his
frustration as Monday night's session continued. The chamber did
not complete its work until after 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By the time most Assembly members got to the event, ''all the
people were gone, all the ceremonies were over,'' Seminerio said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver dismissed Monday night's brouhaha.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't explain Tony Seminerio,'' the speaker told WROW-AM in
Albany Tuesday. ''I think he's been around here a long time and
feels he can do what's good for Tony Seminerio.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver spokeswoman Patricia Lynch later said the work of the
Assembly was delayed into the early evening Monday because sponsors
of the legislation had arranged to have the families of several
well-publicized cases of police shootings in New York City come to
Albany to promote the measures. The family members were late, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no ulterior motive,'' Lynch said. ''That was a very
important package of bills, bills that matter a great deal to a
number of our members.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Seminerio's charge that Silver is inconsiderate of
Italian-Americans but not of Jews, Irish or minority legislators,
Lynch said she had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken, conservative Seminerio has frequently run afoul
of Silver and other Democrats. He has often endorsed Republicans
rather than Democrats and has said of this year's highest-profile
Democratic candidate: ''If Satan ran against Hillary (Clinton), I'd
vote for Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   Seminerio was one of 19 Democrats who voted May 22 in favor of a
motion that could have led to balloting for a news speaker. Most
Democrats stuck with Silver and he retained his post.
</P>
<P>
   Seminerio said the Italian-American legislators' association is
active in Albany, meeting once or twice a month while the
Legislature is in session. The association has around 60 members,
he said.

<HEADLINE> State Senate passes pesticide notification bill  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Legislation that would give counties and New
York City the option of adopting laws governing how neighbors are
to be notified when pesticides are in use won passage Tuesday in
the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, local governments that opt to adopt laws would
require homeowners and businesses to give two days advance
notification to neighbors when spraying pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The distance of advance notification would vary according to the
height of shrubbery being sprayed. Notice would be required to
property owners within 150 feet where vegetation being sprayed is 5
feet tall or greater. For spraying vegetation less than 5 feet
tall, property owners within 15 feet would have to be made aware.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also require retailers to post informational
signs if they are selling general-use pesticides for residential or
commercial application. In addition, the bill would establish
penalties for violation of the local laws.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Carl Marcellino, a Nassau County Republican and the
bill's sponsor, predicted that ''most counties'' would eventually
opt into the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they have a right as a local municipality to
determine their own fate,'' Marcellino said. ''I believe they'll do
the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 56-2, generated some debate on the Senate
floor because it did not require all counties to adopt the rules.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Dollinger, who voted against the measure,
said that the bill would allow municipalities to add on to existing
rules, resulting in non-uniform laws governing different parts of
the state. The Rochester Democrat said he favored the Assembly
version of a notification bill - passed in January - which made it
mandatory for all municipalities to adopt the laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this (the Senate's) bill goes quite far
enough,'' Dollinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcellino said Dollinger's assumption is ''wrong'' because the
issue is one ''strictly to be done by the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Assembly bill, the Senate version also doesn't
include schools or daycare centers and doesn't require homeowners
to give advance notice when granular pesticides are used.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Eric Schneiderman, D-Manhattan, introduced an
amendment that would have made the Senate bill more similar to the
Assembly bill, but the amendment was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Marcellino said schools would be notified in advance if spraying
is done around their property line and that other decisions
regarding pesticide use should be up to local school boards.
</P>
<P>
   He added that advance notice is not necessary when homeowners
apply granular pesticides because there is no risk until after the
pesticide is used. When that happens, homeowners would have already
put up warning signs required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Marcellino said he hopes the Assembly and Senate will iron out
differences and reach a compromise before the legislative session
ends later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly sponsor of the bill, Democrat Thomas DiNapoli of
Nassau County, agreed and added, ''We remain optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, the bill would go into effect March 1, 2001.

<HEADLINE> NATO Accused of Kosovo War Crime  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amnesty International accused NATO forces
Tuesday of unlawfully killing civilians in Kosovo and branded one
attack that killed 16 as a war crime.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said the allegations were ''baseless and ill-founded'' but
acknowledged it made some mistakes that led to civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''NATO forces violated the laws of war leading to cases of
unlawful killing of civilians,'' the U.S. chapter of the human
rights group said in releasing a 60-page report.
</P>
<P>
   ''NATO did not always meet its legal obligations in selecting
targets and in choosing means and methods of attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The report came just days after the chief U.N. war crimes
prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, said there was no basis for a U.N.
investigation into allegations of NATO war crimes. Del Ponte said
Friday that ''although some mistakes were made by NATO ... there
was no deliberate targeting of civilians or unlawful military
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amnesty International report examined a number of attacks in
the 78-day bombing campaign, including those that struck railroad
bridges, convoys of displaced civilians and the headquarters of
Serbian state television.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bombing of the headquarters of Serbian state radio and
television, which left 16 civilians dead, appears to have been a
deliberate attack on a civilian target and as such constitutes a
war crime,'' said William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty
International USA.
</P>
<P>
   ''Civilian deaths could have been significantly reduced if NATO
forces had fully adhered to the laws of war during Operation Allied
Force.''
</P>
<P>
   The group said in some of the other attacks, NATO did not
suspend bombing after it was evident that civilians were struck.
And in two other instances, NATO did not take ''sufficient
precautions'' to minimize civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said in a statement reacting to the report that it
''scrupulously adhered to international law, including the law of
war, throughout the conflict and made every effort to minimize
civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement repeated, however, acknowledgment that ''among
over 10,000 bombing missions, in a few cases mistakes were made, or
weapons malfunctioned, leading to civilian deaths or injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We deeply regret such incidents,'' NATO said. ''But such
incidents must be weighed against the atrocities that NATO's
actions stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty based its conclusions on ''available evidence, including
NATO's own statements'' from a February meeting with officials of
the alliance and from NATO's operation reports.
</P>
<P>
   The report also drew information from the International
Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights.

<HEADLINE> Bush Retirement Plan Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An opposition group of private experts said
Tuesday that George W. Bush would need to couple his proposal for
new Social Security investment accounts with benefit cuts or new
spending to plug the retirement program's impending cash shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded with a pledge to maintain benefits for current
and near retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should not be misled,'' said Robert Ball, one of Social
Security's first administrators, who joined the economists and
academics at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican presidential contender who was campaigning
in Augusta, Ga., promised to keep Social Security the same for
current and near retirees. But he said ''to make sure there is a
Social Security system for the younger generation, we must think
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Republican Sens. Phil Gramm of Texas
and Judd Gregg of New Hampshire rushed to Bush's defense at a news
conference of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever we do on investments ... we are much better off by
having that amount of wealth to help us pay for these benefits,''
Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said an alternative proposal by Bush's Democratic
presidential rival, Vice President Al Gore, is ''a shell-game
approach to solving the Social Security problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore favors pumping interest savings from paying down the debt
into Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, appearing Tuesday on ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' said
he opposes private investment of a portion of the taxes used to
fund Social Security because ''it doesn't offset the funding
shortfall. It makes it a lot worse because Social Security writes
checks to those who are retired with money that is contributed each
week and each month by people who are now working.''
</P>
<P>
   The private experts criticizing Bush included Henry Aaron, a
former Carter administration official, now at the Brookings
Institution; Alicia Munnell, a former member of President Clinton's
Council of Economic Advisers, now a Boston College professor, and
Princeton University economics professor Alan Blinder. Munnell and
Blinder have made campaign appearances with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, they said that if nothing is done, a single
average-earning American turning 30 in 2002 can expect retirement
benefits 21 percent lower than what Social Security now promises
because of a cash shortfall that will develop as baby boomers
retire.
</P>
<P>
   If some Social Security payroll taxes are diverted into personal
investment accounts, as Bush has proposed, the shortfall would
increase in the short term. In the long term, the return on young
workers' individual investments would help close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers and experts agree some shortfall would remain,
however.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, legislation to create personal investment
accounts -- including separate bills sponsored by Gramm and Gregg --
typically includes other changes, such as a higher retirement age
or cash infusions to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has not said what he would do, and supports
creating a bipartisan congressional commission to help make such
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the opposition report said that, under Bush's
partial plan, the remaining Social Security benefit shortfall for
people now nearing age 30 could be 20 percent -- nearly the same as
if nothing were done. It also said Bush's five-year, $483 billion
tax cut proposal could rule out government surpluses as a future
source of cash to fill that hole.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm argued that high investment returns could greatly improve
Social Security's financial standing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will investment solve the whole problem? I think it will, but
we won't know until we make the investment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Aaron said there was potential for bad investments to
worsen the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our analysis shows that workers with individual accounts under
this plan would generally not do better than under the current
system, but would be exposed to significant financial risk,'' he
said.

Jury rehears testimony in boy witness case
dlfons
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - The jury in the trial of a man accused
in the murders of an 8-year-old boy and his mother spent Tuesday
rehearing testimony from witnesses and listening to the judge
repeat portions of his instruction on the law.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler is accused of arranging the murders of Leroy
''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   The boy had been scheduled to testify against Peeler in another
murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Peeler, 28, asked his younger brother, Adrian,
25, to kill the mother and son to silence the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Peeler will stand trial later. Both brothers face the
possibility of the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors began their deliberations at about 2:45 p.m. Monday after
hearing instructions from Superior Court Judge G. Sarsfield Ford.
Less than an hour later, they sent the judge a note asking for the
complete testimony and statements of 14 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the jury narrowed down their request to portions of
that testimony. Jurors heard a court clerk read back excerpts of
testimony from five witnesses, including Josephine Lee, the state's
star witness.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who lived across the street from B.J. and his mother,
testified that she overheard Russell ask his brother to kill the
pair. Lee also claimed she acted as a lookout and heard the boy cry
out for his mother as Adrian Peeler chased them up the stairs of
their home and shot them to death on Jan. 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's defense lawyers, however, showed the jury letters Lee
wrote in which she denies knowing anything about the murders and
claims she lied about the Peelers' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   At the jury's request, the judge on Tuesday reiterated portions
of his instruction on the four charges against Peeler, including
murder, conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of capital
felony. The jury was also given a written outline of the elements
of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The jury was expected to rehear additional testimony Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Links With Defector  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- An Iranian defector fabricated claims that
Iran was involved in two deadly anti-American terrorist attacks in
order to gain asylum in the West, Iran's intelligence minister was
reported as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Yunesi also denied that the defector's claim that he had
once worked for Iran's secret service.
</P>
<P>
   The defector, who identified himself as Ahmad Behbahani, told
the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' that he was an intelligence
official involved in Iranian terrorism operations for more than a
decade before his defection to Turkey. He is currently seeking
asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the establishment of Iran's (intelligence) ministry, no
person named Ahmad Behbahani has been working with the ministry,''
the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Intelligence
Minister Yunesi as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Yunesi's predecessor, Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi, also told
Iranian radio he had never come across Behbahani during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   An Iranian dissident journalist who three weeks ago broke the
news about Behbahani's defection said Monday that like other
Iranian agents, the defector was known in the intelligence
community in Iran as Abdollahi or Hosseini. Ali Reza Nourizadeh,
who broke the story on his Web site and in the London-based Kayhan
weekly, said Behbahani is probably using an assumed name now to
hide his real identity from Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Behbahani told ''60 Minutes'' he was the mastermind behind the
1988 bombing of Pan Am 103, but that claim appeared exaggerated
after Turkey said the defector was only 32 -- likely too young to
have led such a complex operation.
</P>
<P>
   But Behbahani, who did not appear on camera in the television
interview, looked older in a published photo seen later, and CBS
told The Associated Press the defector had said he was born in
1962. The Mujahedeen Khalq, an Iraq-based opposition group, claimed
Behbahani was in his mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
   Yunesi said that Behbahani's own statements cast doubt on his
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''The contradictory statements of this person prove the
falseness of his claims since he claims to have been imprisoned in
Iran in 1998 while claiming to be a top official with the Iranian
(intelligence) ministry in the same period,'' IRNA quoted Yunesi as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those Iranians who wish to be granted asylum in Western
countries usually try to achieve their aims through libelous
statements or slander against the Islamic Republic of Iran,''
Yunesi said.
</P>
<P>
   Behbahani told CBS that he proposed the attack on Pan Am flight
103 that killed 270 people and that he brought on board a radical
Palestinian terrorist living in Syria, then imported and trained
Libyan operatives to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   The program said his motive was to avenge a U.S. Navy cruiser's
mistaken shooting down five months earlier of an Iranian passenger
plane over the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   But Yunesi denied Iranian involvement in that or any other
terrorist incident, saying ''Iran opposes terrorism in any shape
and form.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Libyan defendants are on trial in the Netherlands for the
Dec. 21, 1988 Pan Am bombing, which killed all 259 persons aboard
the plane and 11 more on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland. Law
experts in the Netherlands said Behbahani's statements were
unlikely to affect the outcome of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Behbahani also said Iran planned the 1996 bombing of a U.S.
barracks in Saudi Arabia. The attack killed 19 U.S. Air Force
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, Ahmed Jibril, leader of the radical Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, who has previously
been suspected of involvement in the Pan Am bombing, also dismissed
Behbahani's charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''These accusations are not new. Any time there is a need to
exert new pressure on the Palestinian opposition, this roaming
accusation is revived,'' a PFLP-GC statement quoted Jibril as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Iranian radio, Jibril said he doesn't know
Behbahani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that he is a mercenary and a traitor who has put
himself at the disposal of the espionage agencies of the global
arrogance to enable them to take advantage of him in pursuit of
their own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a U.S. State Department official, who spoke on
condition he not be named, expressed strong doubt about Behbahani's
credibility. The official said he was not at liberty to discuss the
reasons why.

<HEADLINE> Donor's ex-aide admits obstructing campaign finance investigation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The former aide to a major political donor
pleaded guilty Tuesday to obstructing a Justice Department
investigation into campaign contributions made by her boss, David
Chang.
</P>
<P>
   The plea by Audrey Yu came on the day she and Chang were to
stand trial. Chang pleaded guilty on Friday to illegally donating
$53,700 to the successful 1996 Senate campaign of then-Rep. Robert
Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   Like Chang and others from Bergen County who have pleaded
guilty, Yu has agreed to cooperate with the Campaign Financing Task
Force.
</P>
<P>
   Yu, 32, faces six to 12 months in prison but could get probation
for pleading guilty to a single charge of conspiring with Chang to
obstruct justice by backdating a document from Bright &AMP; Bright, a
Chang company.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her plea bargain, Yu acknowledged that she lied to a
federal grand jury last year when she said she did not see shredded
documents at the Englewood Cliffs offices of another Chang company,
Hudson Realty Management Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Chang operates several trading companies, including Bright &AMP;
Bright, Nikko Enterprises Inc., and Panacom in the former
congressional district of Torricelli, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli spokesman Richard McGrath said they had no comment on
Yu because her activities did not involve the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yu had faced 10 counts, including obstruction and lying to the
grand jury. Unlike those against Chang, none of the charges
involved arranging or coordinating illegal ''conduit'' donations.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers filed with Yu's plea said her admissions do not
include other information she has given to prosecutors. Officials
did not disclose details on that information Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yu is among 25 people charged by the task force. Six, not
including Yu, have admitted wrongdoing regarding Torricelli
fund-raising efforts. None of the six has implicated the New Jersey
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli is not accused of any wrongdoing. He has maintained
he was unaware of the improper donations. All such money is donated
to charity, he has said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli raised $9.2 million to defeat Rep. Richard A. Zimmer
in 1996. His fund-raising ability led to his appointment as
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At his plea, Chang acknowledged conspiring to break donation
laws with Cha-Kuek ''Charles'' Koo, an executive with a South
Korean conglomerate; Berek Paul Don, a former Bergen County
Republican leader; and Don's former law partner, Carmine Alampi, a
Democratic leader in Bergen County; and unnamed others.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules bar corporate contributions. Individuals can
contribute up to $2,000 to a candidate during an election cycle -
primary and general election. Reimbursements are not permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Chang and Koo admitted evading restrictions by secretly repaying
''straw donors'' - those who supposedly made the contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Don and Alampi pleaded guilty last year to charges related to
soliciting $11,000 worth of donations to the Torricelli campaign,
which Chang admitted he reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, 57, of Cresskill, also admitted he collected $21,000 for
the Torricelli campaign in December 1996, improperly reimbursing
donors with Bright &AMP; Bright money.
</P>
<P>
   Koo pleaded guilty on Thursday to recruiting eight ''straw''
donors at Chang's behest, and Chang on Friday admitted that he gave
Koo $20,000 in cash to reimburse those donors.
</P>
<P>
   Koo, 54, of Alpine, a South Korean citizen, is president of LG
Group's executive office for the Americas in Englewood Cliffs. The
LG Group is one of South Korea's largest conglomerates.

<HEADLINE> Latest bid by NU, ConEd for merger fails to gain state support  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - In its effort to gain the state's
approval of their planned merger, Northeast Utilities and
Consolidated Edison Inc. of New York made a new proposal Tuesday to
Connecticut regulators that promises a extended rate freeze, and
new jobs in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Richard Blumenthal called the plan
inadequate, and said it does not guarantee rate cuts for
Connecticut consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a week ago approved the
merger, but negotiations toward state support of the deal stalled
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The $7.5 billion deal would create the country's largest
electric and gas distribution company, with more than 6.4 million
customers in New York and New England.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal before the state Department of Public
Utility Control, promises a rate freeze until 2006, a reduction of
regulatory assets by $50 million upon closing of the merger, the
creation up to 600 new jobs in Connecticut, and improved customer
service and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also agreed to submit to an independent study of
the unregulated electricity market for two years following approval
of the merger. And they promised to work with the state Department
of Environmental Protection to preserve as open space, land that
might be sold off after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ''The latest proposal seems to be an effort to meet my concerns
about the merger's effects on consumers, our economy, and our
environment,'' said Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. ''It
contains some positive concessions, but clearly it does not go far
enough to provide the benefits and safeguards that I believe are
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said he will continue to push the DPUC to reject the
merger unless the utilities come up with a more detailed plan that
includes a firm commitment to rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The latest offer does not make any commitments regarding
environmental protection and no specific commitment to open space
preservation, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal also wants the companies to promise not to make
customers pay for executive severance packages, which he claims
could cost up to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   The federal panel approved the proposed merger without comment
after the utilities allayed concerns about the effect it would have
on competition.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said they have already spun off most of their
power-generation assets in order to comply with electric
deregulation laws. NU sold its fossil fuel plants in Connecticut
and Massachusetts well above book value and has put its Millstone
nuclear power plants up for auction.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders from both companies have already approved the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   The merger still needs approval from regulators in Connecticut,
New York and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month the DPUC has been negotiating with the
utilities over rate cuts, job protections, corporate donations,
land preservation and other benefits for customers and the state.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission must also approve the deal.

<HEADLINE> NRC, Activists Clash on Cleanup  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Environmental activists clashed
with a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission official Tuesday over
cleanup plans that could leave buried some of the radioactive
depleted uranium rounds mistakenly fired on the Navy's Vieques
bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk of leaving a few buried in the ground is minimal,''
Luis A. Reyes, the commission's regional director, told a news
conference attended by several activists. ''It should not cause
problems in the bombing range because it is an area restricted to
the public.''
</P>
<P>
   His announcement outraged environmentalists who have been
demanding the Navy clean up 263 rounds mistakenly fired from two
Marine Corps Harrier jets on Feb. 19, 1999, in violation of federal
law and Navy regulations that restrict their use to combat zones.
The Navy recovered 57 rounds last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are accomplices with the Navy ... to harming the health of
the people of Vieques,'' Sarah Peisch of Puerto Rico's private
Environmental Protection Center told Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said the ammunition was only slightly radioactive and that
toxic particles may cause diseases if they get into the lungs or
other parts of the body. Prolonged contact would cause a
sunburn-like injury, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said the cleanup equipment the Navy uses can penetrate
only 10 inches into the sandy ground while the ammunition, designed
to explode through an armored tank, may be buried much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy would have to excavate a 200-foot by half-mile strip to
find all the ammunition, he said. The commission would order that
only if President Clinton orders the Navy out of Vieques, he said.
Clinton has promised he would do that if residents vote to expel
the military in a referendum expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   The commission would begin collecting soil, water and plant
samples on Wednesday to determine if any radioactive residue
reached civilian areas, he said. The island's biggest town is 11
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission had no plans to test after military maneuvers
resume with shells and dummy bombs, probably later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   That brought objections from Doug Rokke, a former Pentagon
consultant on depleted uranium who has backed Vieques militants:
''If those rounds are still coming in and blasting up dust and
those (depleted uranium) particles, then we are looking at a
serious and continuing hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy notified the commission about the February 1999
accident but failed to tell the Puerto Rican government. The news
surfaced only three months later through an unrelated Freedom of
Information Act request from an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the accident, a Marine F-18 jet dropped two
bombs off target in the range and killed a civilian guard.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents fueled resentment against the live bombings on a
20-mile-long island inhabited by 9,300 people. Protesters invaded
the range and camped out there for a year until federal agents
forced them out last month.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori To Welcome OAS Mission  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori said Tuesday he
will welcome an Organization of American States mission to advise
on strengthening Peru's democracy as long as it doesn't question
his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The objective of the OAS is to promote and consolidate
representative democracy, respecting the principle of
nonintervention,'' Fujimori told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS general assembly voted Monday to send a mission composed
of its secretary general, Cesar Gaviria, and Canadian Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers debated what course of action to take
after a May 28 presidential runoff election that was boycotted by
Fujimori's opponent, who claimed it would be fraudulent
</P>
<P>
   The OAS ruled out imposing sanctions and stopped short of
questioning the election's outcome, which an OAS mission and other
international monitors refused to observe, saying a fair result was
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In Buenos Aires, Argentine President Fernando de la Rua
expressed support for the OAS mission, but suggested any economic
sanctions on Peru would serve no useful purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions ''aren't going to hurt the electoral process, just the
people,'' he said. But de la Rua echoed many Latin American leaders
in have expressing his ''concerns'' about the tainted re-election
of Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ''What worries me most is what has gone on in this electoral
process,'' he said in the interview at the Government House in
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said the outcome of the OAS meeting was neither a
defeat nor a victory for his government.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the OAS election observer mission that left Peru
two days before the May 28 ballot concluded that the election
process was characterized by merely by ''irregularities, not
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy said Gaviria and he would go to Peru before Fujimori's
July 28 inauguration, when opposition groups plan to hold a giant
protest rally in Lima. Specific issues they will study include
reforming the electoral process and bolstering freedom of the
press.
</P>
<P>
   Debate before the OAS vote pitted Peru and some Latin American
allies that oppose foreign intervention in election issues against
the United States and others seeking a harsh response to
irregularities in the Peruvian voting.

<HEADLINE> New York travel writer missing in Jamaica  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEGRIL, Jamaica (AP) - A New York-based travel writer has gone
missing from Jamaica's Negril resort, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Kirschhoch, 29, was last seen singing and dancing around
11 a.m. on May 30 in the lobby of the Sandals Beaches Negril hotel,
a police statement said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman resembling Kirschhoch was reportedly seen later that day
at Alfred's Bar and Restaurant in the resort town, but police said
they were unable to confirm whether that was the missing travel
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Fred Kirschhoch, is offering a reward for
information leading to her whereabouts, the U.S. Embassy said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschhoch, a writer for the U.S. Frommer's Travel Guides,
arrived in Jamaica at Montego Bay on May 24 with three other
reporters en route to visit a Cuban resort of the Jamaican-based
Sandals resort chain, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cuban trip was canceled, she and a colleague, Tanya
Grossinger, took up the company's offer to stay at its Negril
hotel, and went there the following day, according to the embassy.
The colleague left May 27 and Kirschhoch was supposed to leave the
Caribbean island June 1, police said.
</P>
<P>
   When she did not return to the hotel to check out, managers
entered her room and, finding her luggage, travel documents and
other personal effects, alerted police.

<HEADLINE> Outerspace Sailing Ship Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Just as early explorers reached new continents in
sailing ships, so will humans sail out into the solar system -- but
by harnessing the power of sunlight instead of wind.
</P>
<P>
   That's the vision of a group of engineers at the International
Aerospace Exhibition. On Tuesday, they unveiled a prototype solar
sail designed to capture the energy of the sun and transport humans
and cargo through space without engines or fuel.
</P>
<P>
   It can do it at speeds of 223,220 mph, nearly 10 times as fast
as the U.S. space shuttle and quick enough to get you from Los
Angeles to New York in a little over a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our mission, to project mankind beyond the loneliness
of our own solar system,'' said Nersi Razavi, whose Paris-based
company Star of Tolerance is the first to contract the solar sail
for commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a solar sail is not a new one. But the sail unveiled
Tuesday is the first prototype capable of being steered from the
ground and carrying a payload.
</P>
<P>
   The solar sail could be conducting its first tests in outer
space by the end of next year and will be launched atop a converted
Russian missile.
</P>
<P>
   The sail captures the photons that constantly shoot from the sun
in a phenomenon known as the solar wind. The impact of these light
particles crashing against the silver film drives the craft
forward.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the sail can carry only microsatellites, too
small to transmit more than radio signals. To transport a human,
the sail would have to be several square miles in size.

<HEADLINE> Vatican To Play Russia, Europe Role  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican on Tuesday said it is prepared
to play an active role in promoting closer ties between Russia and
Western Europe and expressed satisfaction with the visit by
Russia's new president.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, a Vatican spokesman dismissed
suggestions that Monday's meeting with Russian President Vladimir
Putin represented a setback to Pope John Paul II and his dream of
visiting Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a trip would crown the pontiff's efforts toward
reconciliation between Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Vatican officials insisted that a visit was not on
the agenda of Monday's talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''To try to read yesterday's audience between Putin and the holy
father in terms of a possible trip is reductive and improper,''
said the pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides said negotiations were under way between the
Vatican and the Orthodox church to clear obstacles blocking such a
trip.
</P>
<P>
   For the Vatican, an invitation issued by then-President Mikhail
Gorbachev in 1989 still stands. ''Once a door has been opened it
remains open until it is closed,'' Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, in comments in Rome and during a stopover in Milan,
Italy's financial capital, suggested he was optimistic a trip could
be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am convinced that everything will go for the best,'' Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's Orthodox Patriarch Alexey II has been the chief
stumbling block. Long-standing theological divisions have been
worsened by Catholic missionary activity since the fall of
communism in traditionally Orthodox Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican news media gave prominent attention to Putin's visit,
particularly his comment that that the Vatican ''has an important
mission to play'' in integrating Russia into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul took note of that comment, Navarro-Valls said. ''The
pope is pleased that Russia recognizes the importance of the role
the Vatican can play in bringing East and West Europe closer
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In Milan, Putin met with Italy's leading industrialists and
financiers with the stated goal of expanding Italian investment in
his country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to explain the state of the Russian economy and
changes in political and economic fields,'' Putin said. ''I'm also
here to hear their worries about fiscal problems and how to improve
investment conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   One project, announced after a meeting with officials of Fiat,
is a joint venture with the Russian Gaz company for the production
of 75,000 cars in a new factory at Nizhny Novgorod.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also met with heads of Italy's ENI energy company, with
which Russia conducts trade worth $2 billion annually.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Heading to Japan  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Undeterred by the prospect of two long flights
on top of fresh jet lag, President Clinton is heading abroad again
to pay his personal respects to Japan's late prime minister, Keizo
Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to leave Wednesday morning for Tokyo to
join other world leaders at a memorial service for Obuchi, who
suffered a stroke in April and died May 14. This foreign journey --
Clinton's 49th as president -- comes just a day after Clinton
returned from a six-day trip to Europe and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It also was sandwiched between Tuesday's White House meeting
with King Abdullah of Jordan and Friday's visit by Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo. While in Tokyo, Clinton will meet with
Obuchi's successor, Yoshiro Mori, and South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be gone for about 36 hours, with all but 10 spent
flying to and from Tokyo, White House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Clinton and Kim, other heads of state and governments
attending the service include the presidents of the Philippines,
Indonesia, Palau and Micronesia and the prime ministers of
Malaysia, Australia, Thailand and Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Elian Coverage Greatest Since OJ  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The network evening news shows have devoted
more stories to Elian Gonzalez than to any other nonelection story
since the O.J. Simpson case, according to a study by the Center for
Media and Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   During comparable time periods, coverage of the 6-year-old
shipwreck survivor exceeded that of the Columbine tragedy, the
Oklahoma City bombing, and the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr. and
Princess Diana combined, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian's story has been especially alluring, combining a
photogenic boy, family ties and serious international political
issues,'' CMPA President Dr. Robert Lichter. ''The story was a
current events cocktail, with equal parts People magazine and Wall
Street Journal-type story lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ''big three'' networks, ABC was responsible for more
than 38 percent of the boy's coverage, CBS more than 34 percent and
NBC with more than 26 percent of the total stories, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Election 2000, the study found that the Gonzalez case
has dominated the network newscasts this year, surpassing the next
six stories combined: rising gas prices, the New York Senate race,
the war in Chechnya, the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, Pope
John Paul II's trip to the Middle East and the Justice Department's
continued battle with Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the networks aired 431 stories on Simpson, who was
acquitted of the murder of his ex-wife and a friend, while so far
this year, the networks have aired 363 stories about Gonzalez's
plight, the research found.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, there were 336 stories on the Oklahoma City
bombing in 1995, 319 on the Columbine shooting last year, 211 on
the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, 200 on the death of
Princess Diana in 1997 and 161 on the death of Kennedy last year,
the study showed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hot Hollywood celebrity couple Jim Carrey and
Renee Zellweger didn't experience love at first, or second, or even
third sight.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until after they finished filming the upcoming ''Me,
Myself &AMP; Irene'' that Zellweger finally succumbed to the smitten
Carrey's charms.
</P>
<P>
   While making the movie, ''he became very important to me as a
friend,'' the 31-year-old Zellweger said in the July issue of
Vanity Fair. ''I mean, we had had some fun together.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey, 38, had met Zellweger over dinner at a mutual friend's
house about two years ago. He fell for her during filming, but
Zellweger's affections grew a bit slower.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was there for work,'' Zellweger said. All I know is that
once he was gone I missed him. Badly. So maybe I was falling in
love.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- The former Key West ''shack'' of Tennessee
Williams has been sold to an Ohio couple for $1.15 million -- a
hefty sum that surprised the brother of the late playwright.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why, that was just a shack that floated over from Cuba,'' said
Dakin Williams, speaking from his home in Collinsville, Ill.
Williams, 80, said he bought the house for his brother in the 1940s
for $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   The three-bedroom, one-and-a-half story house with a guest
cottage has undergone extensive renovations since Williams lived
there. His one-time studio in the historic 2,100-square-foot home
is now a family room.
</P>

   LONDON (AP) -- Queen Elizabeth II met Tuesday with survivors of
the Holocaust at the opening of a permanent exhibition documenting
Nazi persecution during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The queen, accompanied by husband Prince Philip, looked somber

   ''Just to survive one day in the camp and retain a sense of

<HEADLINE> Country Singers' Case Postponed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Court action against two country
singing stars has been postponed until July 18, lawyers said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney were arrested Saturday night after
performing at the George Strait Country Music Festival near
Buffalo. Erie County Sheriff's deputies said Chesney rode away on a
deputy's horse and McGraw tussled with police who tried to round up
the horse.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw, 33, husband of country star Faith Hill, was charged with
a felony count of second-degree assault, obstructing governmental
administration, menacing and resisting arrest. He was released
after posting $2,500 bail. Chesney, 32, was charged with disorderly
conduct and released on $100 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Eoannou, the lawyer for McGraw, said the court postponement
will give both sides time to investigate the incident. Eoannou said
he is confident the charges will be dropped ''with no hard feelings
on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   Erie County District Attorney Frank J. Clark could not be
reached for comment late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw was named top male vocalist at the Academy of Country
Music Awards in May. Chesney's hits include ''How Forever Feels.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio questions Clinton's ability to work in Senate chambers  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - Republican Rick Lazio on Tuesday
questioned whether his campaign rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
could work effectively in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a very questionable record when it comes to
working in a bipartisan fashion,'' the little-known Long Island
congressman said following a speech to the New York State
Conference of Mayors and Other Municipal Officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers have every right to ask ... can you demonstrate to
us that you can work in a bipartisan fashion?'' Lazio told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning the first lady's ability to work effectively in the
Senate echoed a theme Clinton had used against former Republican
Senate candidate, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The first lady
had repeatedly raised questions about Giuliani's temperament and
ability to work with others. Lazio on Tuesday seemed to be turning
the tables on her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the president have had sometimes icy relations with
Republicans in Washington who led the unsuccessful fight to throw
Bill Clinton out of office.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's campaign disputed Lazio's charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Rick Lazio followed the party line and cut student
loans, Head Start and Medicare, Hillary Clinton worked in a
bipartisan way to pass laws that provided health care to more than
400,000 New York children and made it easier for New York families
to adopt,'' Clinton spokeswoman Karen Finney said.
</P>
<P>
   In another campaign development, sources within the Lazio
campaign and the Pataki administration said Eileen Long, the chief
of staff to Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue and a daughter of state
Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long, would be taking a leave
of absence from her government post to work in a ''senior
position'' on the Lazio campaign. Ms. Long is extremely close to
Zenia Mucha, Gov. George Pataki's chief political adviser.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering a speech to the mayors about public housing
issues - his most policy wonkish to date - Lazio told reporters he
didn't think much of federal housing policies espoused by the
Clinton administration or federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to say anything much disparaging about Andrew
Cuomo, suffice it to say that I think all the leadership in housing
issues has come from the Republican side, particularly in the House
of Representatives,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the role the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development had played, Lazio said ''sometimes there was
opposition, sometimes there was disinterest, but we have not had
much in terms of legislative initiatives coming out of the White
House or HUD,'' said Lazio, who chairs the House's Housing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   David Egner, a spokesman for Cuomo said ''the difference between
the Republicans and Democrats couldn't be more clear.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They (Republicans) wanted to eliminate HUD entirely, stop
housing production, sell the federal housing administration and
kick the poor out of public housing,'' Egner said. ''We (Democrats)
reformed HUD.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to more than 200 members of the mayors'
conference, Lazio outlined policies for revitalizing downtown areas
and providing affordable housing for New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something uniquely American about owning your own
place,'' Lazio told the mayors.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that successful public housing requires a mix of
income levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to concentrate poverty,'' the Republican
congressman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also faced questions Tuesday about his owning a vacation
home in an area of Long Island where he is pressing for a
beach-restoration project.
</P>
<P>
   Area real estate agents told the New York Daily News the project
could raise property values for homeowners like Lazio. One critic
of the project questioned the Long Island congressman's championing
of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is the federal government paying for virtually private
beaches for Rick Lazio and his beach buddies?'' said Jeff Stein of
Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group
opposed to the project.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the beach house ''has not been a very good
investment'' and that he saw no conflict in pushing the project. He
compared it to fighting for help for local schools in his
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   ''My record is being an advocate for my community and my
neighborhood,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to have the Army Corps of Engineers dredge sand from
the ocean and then pump it onto the beaches of Fire Island just off
the south shore of Long Island is stalled over a funding dispute
between the federal government and New York state and a separate
federal demand for a building moratorium in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the plan say that building up the barrier island
beaches off Long Island's south shore will make the main island
safer from flooding and other possible storm-related damage.
</P>
<P>
   Federal financial disclosure forms filed by Lazio last year
value the vacation home in Fair Harbor on Fire Island at between
$100,000 and $250,000 and say Lazio had rental income from the
property last year of between $5,000 and $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's main home is in Brightwaters, a community on Long Island
not far from Fair Harbor.

<HEADLINE> House To Vote on Shark Fins Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fishermen kill some 60,000 Pacific sharks
every year, tossing their carcasses or dying bodies back into the
sea, to satisfy a voracious human appetite for shark's fin soup.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday moved to stop that practice, voting 390-1
to ban shark finning in all U.S. federal waters extending 200 miles
from American shorelines. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, was the lone no
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an avid sportsman,'' said Rep. Randy ''Duke'' Cunningham,
R-Calif., the chief sponsor, ''I find this practice horrific and
wasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which still needs Senate consideration, is aimed at
Hawaiian longline fishing boats engaged in the lucrative practice
of harvesting fins for sale in Asian nations where shark's fin soup
is a delicacy. The fins of blue shark that are a by-catch of tuna
fishing are sliced off and the dead or dying fish, which are of
little other commercial value, are then dumped overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Shark finning has been banned in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
since 1993, when the Commerce secretary, responding to evidence of
serious shark overfishing in those waters, set rules for highly
migratory fish such as swordfish and shark.
</P>
<P>
   But it's only been in the past decade, with a dramatic rise in
Asian demand for shark fins, that attention has turned to the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The Ocean Wildlife Campaign, a coalition of conservation groups,
says the number of sharks killed by Hawaiian longline fisheries
climbed from 2,289 in 1991 to 60,857 in 1998, with 98 percent of
the sharks killed for their fins. Dried shark fins are reportedly
worth up to $40 a pound in Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an incredible waste and it is jeopardizing our
international conservation role,'' said Sonja Fordham of the Center
for Marine Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's bill would not ban the sale of fins, but would
prohibit the landing or possession of fins in U.S. waters without
the carcasses. That would effectively deter most fishermen who lack
the storage capacity to transport the shark carcasses to shore.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service has
argued that shark finning is wasteful and should be stopped, but
this idea has met resistance from the federal Western Pacific
Regional Fishery Management Council, based in Honolulu, which says
there is no evidence the blue shark population is being depleted.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Spalding, a council spokeswoman, said it recently adopted
a plan to protect sharks that includes an annual quota of 50,000
for the Hawaiian longline fleet and severe limits on the catching
of other shark varieties.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaii state legislature recently approved a bill that would
ban the landing of shark fins in Hawaii unless they are attached to
the shark. The legislation awaits the governor's signature.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned about sharks and I think we've taken a lot of
precautionary measures,'' she said. She said most of the benefits
of finning go not to fishing companies but to fishermen, who derive
some 10 percent of their incomes from the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Dunn of the Ocean Wildlife Campaign said no one really
knows the health status of shark populations in the Pacific. ''But
we have seen crashes of shark populations all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharks, he said, are vulnerable to overfishing because they grow
slowly and have few offspring.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- A high school student accused of disabling a
major U.S. Web site in February will appear in court in August to
have a date set for his trial.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old youth, who cannot be named under Canadian law,
is charged with two counts of mischief related to interfering with
data. Known by the Internet name of Mafiaboy, he has been released
on bail with conditions that limit his access to computers.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief court appearance Tuesday, his lawyers asked for an
extension to study the piles of information gathered by
investigators. An Aug. 3 hearing was scheduled to set a trial date.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Mafiaboy in April in connection with a Feb. 8
cyber attack on the CNN Web site, one of a series of attacks that
targeted major sites including Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks flooded sites with so much traffic that legitimate
customers were unable to get through.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the two mischief charges, Mafiaboy would face
maximum penalties of two years in a juvenile correctional center
and a $650 fine.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved and sent to the White House
Tuesday legislation awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to the late
Peanuts comic strip creator Charles Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medal is the highest civilian honor given by Congress.
The House in February voted to award the medal to Cardinal John

Paul II is before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which the House passed by voice after unanimous
approval by the Senate, commends Schulz for giving ''the nation a
unique sense of optimism, purpose, and pride. Whether through the
Great Pumpkin Patch, the Kite Eating Tree, Lucy's Psychiatric Help
Stand, or Snoopy's adventures with the Red Baron, 'Peanuts'
embodied human vulnerabilities, emotions, and potential.''

<HEADLINE> Bolshoi Opens Doors to Brazil Poor  </HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOINVILLE, Brazil (AP) -- Tchaikovsky tinkles from the piano and
the room-length mirror fills with schoolboy faces, their eyes as
tense as the thin bodies that dip and rise, striving to please an
instructor who can barely speak their language.
</P>
<P>
   They all knew the Bolshoi Ballet school was tough. Still, for
students like 9-year-old Rafael da Silva, just getting this far was
even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael is among the 132 needy children who receive a full
scholarship to the school, the Bolshoi's first outside Russia. Too
poor to attend even a regular dance academy, Rafael sees the
opportunity as a minor miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe my sister up in heaven is helping me,'' he said. ''She
always wanted me to be a dancer. Now I am fulfilling that dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the school to this southern Brazilian city was itself
something of a miracle. Beating out bids from Japan and the United
States, Joinville (pronounced zho-een-VEE-lee) opened the school
this past March -- after just 57 days of preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the city is a stranger to classical ballet. An
industrial hub of 400,000 people, Joinville is renowned for its
large German colony, a boisterous Oktoberfest and its annual
international dance festival in July, the largest in South America.
</P>
<P>
   But Joinville's trump card was Jo Braska Negrao, a veteran
international artist who once taught modern dance at the Bolshoi in
Moscow. There she met her husband, Joao Ribeiro Prestes, the son of
Brazil's legendary communist leader Luiz Carlos Prestes, and his
influence made negotiations easier.
</P>
<P>
   From Moscow they brought three teachers, as well as the
Bolshoi's strict methodology and eight-year curriculum, which
Negrao says hadn't been allowed to leave Russia before this. For
use of the name and method, the school here pays $120,000 each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their only condition was that 30 percent of the students had
to be needy children,'' said Negrao, the school's supervisor. ''Our
total is more than 70 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The next problem was how to get the word out to kids and parents
who had never seen ballet. For three months, the staff visited
every public school in the city, taking life-sized pictures of
dancers and arguments to disarm the dads who thought ballet wasn't
suitable for their sons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We touched the ill-resolved 'machismo' of Latin men,'' Negrao
said. ''We told them dancers were simply athletes on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 students applied -- surprisingly, half of them
boys. Of the 6,500 students preselected, 141 finally enrolled.
Later, a second group of 45 older students was added for a two-year
finishing course, and the top four are to join the Russian Bolshoi
next January.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition is about $170 a month -- compared to $1,600 at the
Bolshoi in Moscow. Scholarship funds came from the city government,
a supermarket chain and the federal savings bank, and more has been
promised by private and government backers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one gets a free ride. The school aims to turn out
world-class dancers for the Bolshoi and other top companies, and
the requirements are strict.
</P>
<P>
   For Negrao, Brazilians have an edge.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can always tell a Brazilian dancer right away,'' she said.
''They have a natural musicality, a gift for corporal expression.
They are true performers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the daily 3{ hours of classes, dancing is just part of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ''After ballet there's music, piano, responsibility, hygiene,
posture,'' counted off 11-year-old Aline Decker. ''So much to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important is discipline, said Maristela Teixeira,
artistic and technical coordinator. Students must keep their school
grades up or leave the Bolshoi.
</P>
<P>
   ''We breed discipline first, so the kids know where they want to
go and how to reach their goals,'' she said. ''The tradition of
Brazilian education makes this very difficult, specially for boys,
because they always have someone to spoil them.''
</P>
<P>
   The school gets high marks from its toughest critics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The level here is excellent,'' said instructor Andrei Smirnov,
speaking through a translator. ''The school has a high degree of
professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Students also learn a rare sort of democracy. Social differences
seem to melt away as they file through the turnstile, pass the show
costumes on display and head for their lockers to don practice
leotards and slippers. Inside, talent is what counts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here, everyone is equal,'' said assistant director Deborah
Leal. ''The difference is at the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where kids like Rafael can shine, no matter how hard the
road that led here.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael knew he was born to dance. Samba, disco -- he mastered
them early, rehearsing endlessly in his tiny bedroom at the
family's simple brick shack. His ability even drew the attention of
a TV talent scout, but his father was adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was selfish with Rafael,'' admitted Odorico da Silva, an
unemployed construction worker. ''He loved to dance, but I told him
they would make him into a sissy on television. The Bolshoi is
different. I saw a TV show about them, and I know they are
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoolmates were even rougher. Sissy was the mildest of
epithets, but Rafael doesn't let it bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some kids are really jerks,'' he says matter-of-factly. ''They
say dancing is just standing on your tiptoes and call you names,
but they can't do the steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Back straight, head high, hands on hips, Rafael displays a poise
beyond his years. It's almost as if he were on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I just let them talk,'' he says. ''I have a path to
follow.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Issues Discussed At UN  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Trafficking in women and the devastating
impact of AIDS on women and girls have become the hottest new
challenges for 180 nations trying to accelerate an international
agenda to achieve women's equality.
</P>
<P>
   Women's rights activists spoke about the two problems at a U.N.
meeting this week aimed at reviewing progress since the 1995
Beijing women's conference and producing a strong final document
that pushes things forward.
</P>
<P>
   The women at the conference said a key problem in negotiating
the final document is linking these two global scourges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue we are dealing with right now is whether or not
these governments are going to recognize that both the epidemic and
trafficking are driven by men's demands for sex,'' said Adrienne
Germain, president of the International Women's Health Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're going to deal with that issue we have to deal with
both ends of the equation, namely we have to recommit ourselves as
we did in Beijing to recognizing women's sexual rights and men's
responsible sexual behavior,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new challenges posed by trafficking and AIDS got some
high-level visibility at Monday's opening sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan called trafficking ''a worldwide
plague'' and said he will ask world leaders at the Millennium
Summit in September to launch an international campaign to reverse
the spread of AIDS, which is killing tens of thousands of young
mothers, especially in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Clinton declared that ''the face of AIDS
today is increasingly female,'' creating a generation of AIDS
orphans. And she said it was time to speak out ''on behalf of the
one million trafficking victims who, every year, are being bought
and sold into modern slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said during a forum
Tuesday that the United States would be pushing at the Group of
Eight economic summit in Okinawa, Japan, in July for greater
international assistance to combat AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Both AIDS and trafficking were mentioned at Beijing, but not
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1995, we knew that the HIV epidemic was progressing, but we
tended to see it largely as an issue of homosexuality and gay
people,'' Germain said, ''and while women had recognized the
problem of trafficking for a long time, it didn't really figure on
the Beijing screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Loar, director of President Clinton's Interagency
Council on Women, said the explosion in trafficking is largely the
result of open borders and the economic situations that countries
in transition have faced.
</P>
<P>
   ''The root cause of it is economic desperation of women and
girls and their families that makes them very susceptible to the
lure of traffickers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Piot, executive director of the Joint U.N. Program on
HIV/AIDS, said gender inequality -- including women's economic
dependence on men -- is a fundamental driving force of the AIDS
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Slowing down the spread of HIV means important changes are
needed in relationships between men and women,'' Piot said. ''Men
have a crucial role to play in bringing about this kind of radical
change.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the HIV epidemic, Germain said, the conference
needs to agree on specific actions to protect and promote women's
sexual rights, which were recognized in the Beijing platform.
</P>
<P>
   She said men are not acting responsibly in regards to sex, and
that in Africa older men who have sexually transmitted diseases --
including AIDS -- go to young virgins for sex because they believe
it will cure them.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, women infected with the HIV virus now outnumber men,
she said, ''and that's not because women are promiscuous, and it's
not because they're ignorant of the disease or what have you, it's
because men have sex with any number of women -- and they bring it
back to their wives.''

Quebec Man Guilty Of First-Degree Murder
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST-JEAN-SUR-RICHELIEU, Quebec (AP) -- A man who admitted to
shooting his wife at a women's shelter was convicted Tuesday of
first-degree murder by a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Samson, 45, also was convicted of two arson-related
charges for setting their house on fire and pouring gasoline in the
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Chantale Dufour, 21, was working at the shelter on June 10,
1999, when Samson stormed in and forced her to reveal the
whereabouts of his wife. Dufour cried when the verdict was
announced and hugged supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The defense and Crown didn't dispute that Samson took a shotgun
to the shelter and shot Ginette Roger, 42, six or seven times while
she slept.
</P>
<P>
   The issue for the jury was whether he intended to kill his wife.

Senate Committee: Dying Patients Don't Get Proper Care
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Death in Canada is a disgrace, says a Senate
committee.
</P>
<P>
   No more than 10 percent of incurable patients get good care in
their final days and months, the legal and constitutional affairs
committee says in a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are often left to die without adequate pain relief and
without emotional or spiritual comfort, says the report.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors scrimp on pain medication because they fear
criminal charges if the patient's life is shortened.
</P>
<P>
   Such palliative care programs as do exist tend to focus on
cancer patients. There are fewer services for other diseases like
Alzheimer's, respiratory failure and multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians have good reason to be concerned about these issues,
chairwoman Sharon Carstairs said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single one of us dies. The sad news is that all of you
are going to die and hope you die with quality end-of-life care.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies Draft Heisman Trophy Hopeful  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- After he's done chasing the Heisman Trophy, the
Colorado Rockies are hoping Michael Vick might want to chase down
some fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   Vick, the Virginia Tech quarterback who finished third in last
year's Heisman Trophy voting, was Colorado's 30th round selection
Tuesday in the second day of baseball's amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   Vick has not played organized baseball since about the eighth
grade, but Rockies scouting director Bill Schmidt said his speed
and athletic ability was too tempting to pass up in baseball's
unpredictable talent search.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you can run like him, our feeling was he could cover some
ground for us in the outfield,'' Schmidt said. ''I didn't think it
was a major investment at that point (30th pick). If it didn't work
out, we could take a chance. Michael Jordan tried (baseball). Maybe
he might want to make a run at it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman last year, Vick threw for 1,840 yards and 12
touchdowns and ran for 585 yards and eight TDs in the regular
season. He led No. 2 Virginia Tech to an improbable second-half
comeback in the national title game against top-ranked Florida
State before the Hokies fell to the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies have until the first day of the fall semester to
sign Vick to a contract, and Schmidt said Colorado scouts hope to
contact the sophomore-to-be in the next couple of days. The team
had not talked to him before the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''I imagine (Tuesday) was a surprise to him,'' Schmidt said.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Draft Son Of Rich Gale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates drafted the son of
former major league pitcher Rich Gale on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Gale, a right-handed pitcher from Oyster River High
School in New Hampshire was chosen in the 30th round.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a young pitcher who has definitely benefited from the
tutelage of his father,'' Pirates scouting director Mickey White
said. ''He was supposed to initially sign with the University of
Virginia but we're hoping to persuade him during the summer and
make him a Pirate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Gale pitched in the major leagues from 1978-84 with Kansas
City, San Francisco, Cincinnati and Boston. He had a career record
of 55-56 and a 4.53 ERA. He lost the sixth and deciding game of the
1980 World Series to Philadelphia while with the Royals.

<HEADLINE> Bill To Trim Clinton's Peace Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel approved a spending bill for
next year that would slice President Clinton's plans for U.S.
contributions to United Nations peacekeeping efforts and hinder the
federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   By a voice vote Tuesday evening, a subcommittee of the House
Appropriations Committee approved a $34.9 billion measure financing
the departments of State, Commerce and Justice. Overall, it was
$2.7 billion below Clinton's request and $100 million below this
year's level.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Chairman Harold Rogers, R-Ky., called the bill ''a
barebones recommendation'' that will force the administration to
choose priorities. Democrats predicted that money would be added
before the bill is signed into law. The panel's top Democrat, Rep.
Jose Serrano of New York, saying it heeded budget limits set ''when
we could only see a future of deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure's $4.4 billion for the Commerce Department is nearly
$300 million below this year's level. It contains $498 million for
peacekeeping contributions, the same as this year but $241 million
less than Clinton wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers contended the peacekeeping cut was warranted, saying the
United Nations is not equipped to intervene in what he said has
become a full-fledged war in Sierra Leone. But Rep. David Obey,
D-Wis., called the reduction ''a gross dereliction of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also forbid the Justice Department from taking
money from other agencies' budgets for the costs of lawsuits unless
they were defending the government.
</P>
<P>
   That, in effect, would make it harder for the department to
pursue its litigation against cigarette companies. The government
is trying to recover billions of dollars it has spent under
Medicare and other programs to treat people with illnesses related
to smoking, and the Justice Department wants other agencies to
share the legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the same spending bill would also block
the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Violence Intensifies in Solomons  </HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Fighting between rival rebel
factions on the Solomon Islands intensified Wednesday, with one
group using a stolen gunboat to fire cannon rounds at coastal
villages and hitting a school, New Zealand officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of casualties from the shelling, which
marked a major escalation of the weaponry being used in the dispute
between rival islanders. The 1{-year-old confrontation on the
Pacific island nation exploded into a governmental crisis on
Monday, with one rebel group seizing the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff said Wednesday that ''an
agreement of sorts'' had been reached and that the situation
appeared headed for a deal under which rebels are dropping demands
that Solomon Islands Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu resign.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would bring the Solomon Islands closer to
constitutional rule, said Goff, though it won't necessarily mean an
end to fighting between the rebels from two islands in the
archipelago. Goff said he had spoken with Ulufa'alu.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu had offered to resign a week ago anyway and instead
now will likely face a vote of no confidence when the Solomon
Islands Parliament convenes on June 16. In the meantime, armed
rebels are expected to stop escorting the prime minister everywhere
and he will ''resume his normal duties with normal security as of
today,'' Goff said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal had yet to be signed by a representative of the
Malaitan rebels who seized Ulufa'alu, said attorney Andrew Nori, a
Malaitan spokesman, but it appeared solid enough that Commonwealth
member nations, meeting in London, put off any discussions about
suspending the Solomon Islands from its activities.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 months, the rebel groups -- the Isatabu and Malaitans --
have skirmished on Guadalcanal, the country's main island and the
scene of a pivotal battle between U.S. and Japanese forces in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Isatabu want to rid Guadalcanal of thousands of settlers
from nearby Malaita. The Malaitans complain they are being unfairly
pushed off their land, and some accuse the democratically elected
Ulafa'alu -- who is from Malaita -- of betraying them.
</P>
<P>
   The current emergency began Monday when armed Malaitan rebels
seized Ulafa'alu and demanded that he resign. On Tuesday, the
country -- 2,300 miles northwest of Wellington -- appeared to be
plunging into war.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu came to a meeting of government caucus officials and
told them he would leave ''if that is the price of peace in the
Solomon Islands,'' the nation's state minister, Alfred Sasako, told
Australian television.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were wounded Tuesday during a three-hour gunbattle
between the two groups -- the Malaita Eagle Force and the Isatabu
Freedom Movement -- on the fringe of the airport in the capital,
Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   After securing the area around the airport, the Malaita Eagle
Force rebels early Wednesday deployed a stolen police patrol and
with the cannon were ''indiscriminately shooting'' at nearby
coastal villages, according to a New Zealand official in the
Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-milimeter shells hit the Nazareth Apostolic Center -- a
Catholic missionary school -- but it appeared students were on
holiday and there were no immediate reports of injuries, said the
official, who spoke on condition his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   A Solomon Islands government official reached by phone in
Honiara said rival bands of rebels were fighting both east and west
of town -- with a group of migrants from Malaita much better armed
after joining forces with paramilitary teams on Monday and seizing
machine guns and ammunition from the Solomon Islands' armory.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaita Eagle Force, which was formed a few months ago, now
has the support of about half of the Solomon Islands paramilitary,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the crisis had been scant on Monday and early
Tuesday because phone lines were cut, but communications were
restored by Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday called
on the rebels through his spokesman, Fred Eckhard, to release the
prime minister and to resume peace talks ''aimed at returning the
country to normalcy and re-establishing democratic governance as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Goff, New Zealand's foreign minister, warned that ''the
international community will not accept a democratically elected
prime minister being forced out of office at gunpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The coup attempt was the second in the South Pacific in weeks.
Armed rebels in Fiji are still holding the elected prime minister
and more than 30 other people seized in a raid on Parliament on May
19.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Waive DE Gabe Wilkins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Defensive end Gabe Wilkins, who had
just one sack in two seasons after coming to San Francisco as a $20
million free agent, was waived by the 49ers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move generated $3.25 million in savings for the salary-cap
strapped 49ers this season but the team will take a $4 million hit
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins spent his first four years in Green Bay, where he played
opposite Reggie White and established himself as a solid run
defender and pass rusher. Wilkins developed tendinitis in his left
knee during the 1997 season, missed one half of a playoff game and
left the Super Bowl, which the Packers lost to the Denver Broncos,
after one series.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to bolster their defensive line, the 49ers signed
Wilkins as a free agent but it never panned out. The knee injury
was worse than originally thought and required additional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He spent half of his first season in San Francisco on the
physically unable to perform list before being activated, appearing
in eight games and starting four.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Wilkins started 15 of 16 games but made little
impact. His only sack in the last two seasons came during a Dec. 18
game against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In another move, the 49ers signed linebacker Jason Lamar.

<HEADLINE> Historic showdown in Democratic primary between big spender, veteran fighter </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Former investment banker Jon Corzine led
former Gov. Jim Florio in very early returns in the Democratic
Senate primary Tuesday after the political newcomer spent a
record-shattering $33 million on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With 8 percent of precincts reporting, Corzine led with 27,826
votes, or 67 percent. Florio drew 13,760 votes, or 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has never held elected office but quickly gained
endorsements from key Democratic Party organizations and the key
party leaders, including the man both he and Florio hope to
replace, retiring three-term Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Florio is seeking a return to politics after voters dumped him
in 1993 at the end of just one term as governor following his $2.8
billion tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   At Corzine's reception at an East Brunswick hotel, two giant
screens alternated between television news coverage and Corzine's
ubiquitous commercials. About 300 supporters cheered when seeing
early returns with a Corzine lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked his tuition thing and what he did with Social
Security,'' said supporter Frank Lysick, 42, of Linden, who added
he was not disturbed by Corzine's campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like it. The guy's rich. I want to be rich someday,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The primary campaign has been decidedly nasty as Florio has
spent most of his time chiding the former chairman of the Goldman
Sachs &AMP; Co. investment firm for a cash takeover of the political
process. Corzine in a $2-million-per-week blitz of TV commercials
has hammered Florio for the tax increases he pushed through as
governor 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even the chief issue of the campaign, Social Security, has been
discussed with a hard edge.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has proposed investing a small portion of the Social
Security trust fund into the stock market to build up long-term
security. Florio has denounced it as a reckless risk designed to
benefit Wall Street cronies who would be in line to earn
commissions. Corzine's campaign has denounced Florio as a liar on
the issue because a newspaper tape recording showed he thought it
was a good idea in May 1999 before Corzine entered the race.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine came into the contest Tuesday with substantial
advantages over Florio not only in cash firepower - the former
governor was to have spent only about $2 million - but in
organizational support and high-profile endorsements. A Quinnipiac
College poll released May 25 had placed Corzine 26 points ahead
among likely Democratic primary voters, with a margin of error of
5.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine had the official backing of the state Democratic Party
and the Democratic organizations in most of the major counties in
New Jersey covering some two-thirds of the registered Democrats in
the state. Lautenberg had endorsed Corzine and filmed a campaign
commercial with him.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's other U.S. senator, Robert Torricelli, has remained
officially mum on the race but in fact played the major role in
recruiting Corzine. During an embarrassing flap in April when
Corzine apologized for ethnic jokes he reportedly had made about
Italian Americans, Torricelli traveled from Washington to stand by
him at a Newark news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Florio, though a resident of Metuchen, had built his
campaign upon his traditional support in the counties around
Camden, his home turf as congressman for 16 years and his base for
his 1989 victory in the race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Florio narrowly lost re-election in 1993 to Republican Gov.
Christie Whitman, and Republicans remain in firm control of the
state Senate and Assembly since the fallout over Florio's tax
increases of $2.8 billion caused voters to oust the Democratic
majorities in both houses. The tax increase was a decision Florio
in this campaign still defended assiduously.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Colo Gov. Named LA Schools Chief  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN SANTOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer on Tuesday was
named superintendent of the Los Angeles school system, which has
been struggling with low test scores, fractious leadership and the
threat of state oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Romer, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
will take over the nation's second-largest school district, with
711,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new face of America is going to be developed, in my
judgment, in the L.A. community. You have the potential of being
the premier metropolitan area of the United States,'' Romer said at
a news conference. ''Now, there's one flaw to that. If you do not
make this school system work, you're never going to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer, 71, succeeds Ramon Cortines, who was brought in as
interim superintendent in January to begin reforms after the ouster
of Ruben Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias was accused of mismanagement, and he especially came
under fire when it was learned that the nation's most expensive
high school, the Belmont Learning Complex, was being built on a
site suffused with toxic gases left over from its days as an oil
field. After $170 million in construction costs, the project was
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Romer beat out two experienced school administrators: former
Chicago Board of Education President George Munoz and an official
of another school district who asked the Los Angeles board to keep
her name private.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential candidates said they withdrew their applications
for superintendent out of fears that the district will be taken
over by the state because of all its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Romer also inherits a district that is being reorganized into 11
semiautonomous mini-districts, each with its own superintendent.
And the contract with teachers expires June 30; they want a 21
percent pay increase, limits on class size and a grievance process
if textbooks are lacking or classrooms aren't clean.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most exciting jobs in America and it's also
one of the toughest jobs,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers Los Angeles, which
represents 43,000 district teachers, reacted favorably to Romer's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was right on today, he made a lot of common sense,''
Higuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education President Genethia Hayes announced the
appointment at a hastily called news conference. The board then
returned to closed session and did not immediately comment on its
choice of Romer.
</P>
<P>
   Romer spent nearly 40 years in Colorado government, beginning in
1958, when he was elected to the state House. He served 12 years as
governor, from 1987 to 1999, and was barred by law from seeking a
fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   Romer was appointed general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee in 1997 and left that post last year to become head of
the committee organizing the party's convention in Los Angeles in
August. He will resign that post to take the school position.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment comes three weeks after the nation's largest
school district, the one in New York City, picked a new
superintendent without education experience -- former banking
executive Harold Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar, a former Romer aide, said
Romer ''prioritized education as one of his top issues'' and pushed
for the creation of statewide tests that measure students'
performance and progress.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar also said Romer broke an impasse between Denver teachers
and the school board in the early 1990s by ordering the teachers
not to strike and helping to put together a contract both sides
agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican who succeeded Romer, Gov. Bill Owens, said
Romer ''has a long record of commitment to public education which
will serve the district well.''

<HEADLINE> Corzine Lead Grows in N.J.  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Former investment banker Jon Corzine held a
wide lead over former Gov. Jim Florio in New Jersey's Democratic
Senate primary Tuesday, after the political newcomer spent a
record-shattering $33 million on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 percent of precincts reporting, Corzine led with 29,157
votes, or 66 percent. Florio drew 14,908 votes, or 34 percent. Much
of the early vote came from the Democratic stronghold in the Newark
area where Corzine organized well. Florio was doing well in a
smattering of returns from the Camden area, considered to be his
base.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has never held elected office but quickly gained
endorsements from top state political leaders, including the man
both he and Florio hope to replace, retiring three-term Democratic
Sen. Frank Lautenberg. The race was the highlight of primary voting
in six states Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, seeking a return to politics after voters dumped him in
1993 at the end of just one term because he raised taxes by $2.8
billion, accused Corzine of trying to buy the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's primary spending -- which could work out to as much as
$100 per vote -- shattered the previous U.S. record for an entire
Senate race -- $30 million spent by Republican Michael Huffington in
his losing 1994 bid for office in California.
</P>
<P>
   The former Goldman Sachs chairman unleashed a
$2-million-per-week blitz of TV commercials and poured hundreds of
thousands of dollars into state and county Democratic
organizations. Florio denounced the tactic as a ''hostile corporate
takeover'' of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters shrugged off the criticism of Corzine's spending.
Norm Reiff, 69, of Northfield, said he picked Corzine, ''in spite
of all the money he put into it.''

   ''We've got a new face,'' Reiff said. ''Let's give him a

</P>
<P>
   Rain throughout the day threatened to keep turnout low.
</P>
<P>
   The attention paid to Corzine's spending and his campaign
platforms, such as federal funding of college for students with B
averages or better and investing Social Security funds in the stock
market, dwarfed interest in the GOP primary for Lautenberg's seat.
</P>
<P>
   After GOP Gov. Christie Whitman said she would not run, four
lesser-known candidates stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. William Gormley led in early returns with 53 percent
of the total in a four-way race with Rep. Bob Franks, Essex County
Executive Jim Treffinger and Ramapo College professor Murray
Sabrin. The GOP has not won a Senate seat in New Jersey since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday also marked the end of the presidential primary season,
with contests in five of the six states, though they held little
import since George W. Bush and Al Gore locked up their nominations
back in March. The sixth state, Iowa, held its caucuses in January.
</P>
<P>
   In the other states:
</P>
<P>
   --Alabama Circuit Judge Roy Moore, who fought the American Civil
Liberties Union in 1995 to post the Ten Commandments in his
courtroom, was leading in the race for the GOP nomination for chief
justice of the state Supreme Court. With 11 percent of precincts
reporting, Moore had 9,588 votes votes, or 67 percent, in a
four-way race.
</P>
<P>
   Moore bucked Republican leaders by running for the seat, which
is being vacated by a justice forced to retire because he is past
70.
</P>
<P>
   --In Montana, Democratic farmer Brian Schweitzer made the high
price of prescription medicine the theme of his Senate campaign,
taking buses of seniors to Canada to highlight the price
differences. He was expected to win the nomination and face
two-term GOP Sen. Conrad Burns in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Montana, three Democrats and two Republicans sought
their party nominations to replace Republican Gov. Mark Racicot,
forced by term limits to retire.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter primary fight in New Jersey, 10-term Rep. Marge
Roukema was trailing 62 percent to 38 percent to conservative state
Assemblyman Scott Garrett. The returns did not include any votes
from her home base of Bergen County.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, who lost a close fight with Roukema two years ago, got
$100,000 worth of support in ads from a conservative group.
</P>
<P>
   And two former GOP congressmen fought for the nomination to
challenge first-term Democratic Rep. Rush Holt. Mike Pappas lost to
Holt two years ago in part because of a ditty he sang about
impeachment on the House floor (''Twinkle, Twinkle, Kenneth
Starr''). He vied with former Rep. Dick Zimmer, a lawyer who
teaches at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   -- In New Mexico, three Republicans sought the nomination to
challenge three-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Iowa, two Republicans sought the nomination to challenge
two-term Democratic Rep. Leonard Boswell.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the race for South Dakota's lone House seat, three
Democrats sought the nomination to challenge two-term Republican
Rep. John Thune.

<HEADLINE> Orioles-Mets Game Postponed By Rain  </HEADLINE>
By HOWIE RUMBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cal Ripken and the Baltimore Orioles are getting
an extra night in New York, not that they're happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   The game between the Orioles and the Mets was rained out Tuesday
night after a miserable day of chilly winds and non-stop showers.
It will be made up Thursday at 7:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, which is on the final leg of a three-city, 10-game
road trip, waited out the Mets' decision all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you have rainouts and rescheduling,'' Ripken
frowned. ''But that's baseball and that's your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mussina was among several players wondering why it took so
long for the Mets to postpone the game. It was called at 7:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all part of the job,'' Mussina sighed as he walked out of
Shea Stadium into the blustery night.
</P>
<P>
   The rainout created a difficult predicament for Baltimore
traveling secretary Phil Itzoe. The hotel where the Orioles stay
was oversold by about 100 rooms for Wednesday night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got a few phone calls to make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine said his team held out hope that
the game would go on.
</P>
<P>
   ''They thought we would be able to play and then the window
closed,'' Valentine said. ''Everybody would've liked to have that
off day before the Yankees series, just like the Yankees have
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescheduling interleague games can be tricky because, in most
cases, teams only play each other in one series. The Orioles had no
say on when to play the makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no vote, we didn't get anything,'' said Jason Johnson,
whose start was pushed back a day to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rick Reed will start for the Mets against Scott Erickson on
Wednesday night. The forecast is for a clear evening.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who left his last outing May 27 after just three innings
because of a strained left side muscle, was ready to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got here at 3 and they told me we were being delayed. As you
get closer to the scheduled starting time it gets a little crazy,''
he said. ''But no one is out there to get injured. I'll wake up
tomorrow, come out to the park and be prepared to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets start the Subway Series at Yankee Stadium on Friday
night. Mike Piazza, Mike Hampton, and Turk Wendell were among
several Mets scheduled to take part in charity and promotional
events around the city Thursday, including one being thrown by
comedian Jerry Seinfeld and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The bad weather didn't dampen the spirits of Mets rookie Jason
Tyner. After going 2-for-3 in his major league debut Monday night,
the new leadoff man was the only player on the field signing
autographs in the rain shortly before the game was called.
</P>
<P>
   ''These last couple of days have been a blur. It's really been
exciting, and I'm just trying to take it all in,'' said Tyner who
planned to go out for an Italian dinner with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Tyner didn't do any celebrating Monday night, especially since
the Mets lost 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went back and went straight to sleep,'' he said. ''Well,
actually, I stayed up to watch the highlights. I had never seen
myself get a hit in the majors.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: The rainout cost a few PGA golfers a chance to show off
swings of a different kind. With the Buick Classic beginning
Thursday at nearby Westchester Country Club, Davis Love III, Mike
Hulbert and Barry Cheesman -- a former minor league catcher in three
organizations -- were to take batting practice with the Mets. Sergio
Garcia, the 20-year-old Spanish star, was to throw out the first
ball. ... The Orioles' win Monday night was their first at Shea
Stadium since 1975, when they beat the Yankees, who were playing at
the park while Yankee Stadium was being remodeled.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Hitchcock Has Elbow Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Padres left-hander Sterling Hitchcock underwent
reconstructive surgery on his left elbow Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lewis Yocum of the Anaheim Angels performed the ''Tommy
John'' surgery, in which a tendon was taken out of his wrist to
repair or replace the torn ulnar collateral ligament.
</P>
<P>
   ''A significant bone chip was also removed from behind
Hitchcock's left elbow, and mild arthritis was found,'' the team
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, MVP of the 1998 NL Championship Series, will need up
to a year and half for recovery, the team said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When an injury hits your starting rotation, it's tougher to
overcome,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ''You try to look at
the bright side with Hitchcock. It gives us a chance to look at the
young kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock (1-6, 4.93 ERA) was San Diego's opening day pitcher.
He left a start against Montreal on May 26 complaining of pain in
the elbow. He's the third Padres starter to miss a significant part
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego lost right-hander Carlton Loewer to a left ankle
fracture during an offseason hunting incident, and right-hander
Woody Williams to an aneurysm under his right armpit on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Loewer is currently on a rehab assignment and could rejoin the
club within a week.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy GOP Opponent Clears Hurdle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A Republican whose campaign against Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy has been plagued by trouble officially won a spot on the
November ballot Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state's office approved 10,139 nominating
signatures for Jack E. Robinson, slightly more than the 10,000 he
needed. Robinson, a black businessman who made a fortune in
telecommunications, is making his first run for office.
</P>
<P>
   Libertarian candidate Carla Howell said Tuesday night she would
review Robinson's signatures to make sure they are legitimate. A
spokesman for Kennedy, a Democrat who has held the seat since 1962,
said Kennedy has no plans to challenge Robinson's signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Both Howell and Kennedy have well over the 10,000 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's campaign has been through controversy from the start.
The state's top Republicans withdrew their support after
embarrassing details of his past were revealed, including his
arrest on drunken driving charges -- he was eventually cleared -- and
the fact that an ex-girlfriend had taken out a restraining order
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody had a lot of laughs at my expense the last 90 days
so now let's get over that and get onto the issues,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NANUET, N.Y. (AP) - Mambo king Tito Puente, whose music crossed
cultural and generational boundaries, was laid to rest Tuesday
following a private funeral Mass at St. Anthony's Catholic Church
in Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the best,'' the Rev. Lewis Gigante, told Newsday.
Gigante recalled knowing Puente from several decades ago in East
Harlem and the Bronx. He said that an era had died with Puente.
''His music was the best bridge to bring people together. He was
the Bach and the Beethoven of Latin music.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente, 77, died last Wednesday at NYU Medical Center. He had
recently been treated for an irregular heartbeat, according to his
agent, Eddie Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday and Monday, thousands of fans and fellow musicians
lined up outside a Manhattan funeral chapel to bid a fond farewell
to their beloved El Rey. He was recalled as a man who was a source
of pride, especially to people of Puerto Rican descent.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing their love and admiration, mourners held Puerto
Rican flags, wore T-shirts emblazoned with his image and listened
to his music while trading memories of the flamboyant percussionist
and bandleader outside Riverside Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have lost a brother, and like the rest of the world, I am
deeply saddened,'' fellow timbale player Jimmy Sabater said Sunday.
''This is a great loss.... He was the king immortalized,'' said
George Padilla.

<HEADLINE> Bob Hope To Go Home by Thursday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Bob Hope is likely to be out of the
hospital and headed home by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 97-year-old entertainer ''responded with a resounding,
'Yes!''' when asked if he would like to go home, Dr. Gary
Annunziata said Tuesday. He said Hope likely would be released
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hope was taken to Eisenhower Regional Medical Center in critical
condition with gastrointestinal bleeding last Thursday. The
entertainer's doctor marveled at Hope's quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is more awake, alert and talkative than I've seen him in a
long time,'' Annunziata said Tuesday. Hope was up and out of bed,
visiting with his wife Dolores.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns to his mountainside estate, Hope will continue
with a program of physical therapy to improve his strength and
motor coordination, the doctor said.

<HEADLINE> Corzine Leads Florio in N.J.  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Former investment banker Jon Corzine held a
wide lead over former Gov. Jim Florio in New Jersey's Democratic
Senate primary Tuesday, after the political newcomer spent a
record-shattering $33 million on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With 29 percent of precincts reporting, Corzine led with 84,698
votes, or 62 percent. Florio drew 51,886 votes, or 38 percent.
Corzine was outpolling Florio by more than 3-1 in the vote-rich
Newark area, but only a few votes had been counted in Florio's home
base of Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has never held elected office but quickly gained
endorsements from top state political leaders, including the man
both he and Florio hope to replace, retiring three-term Democratic
Sen. Frank Lautenberg. The race was the highlight of primary voting
in six states Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, seeking a return to politics after voters dumped him in
1993 at the end of just one term because he raised taxes by $2.8
billion, accused Corzine of trying to buy the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's primary spending -- which could work out to as much as
$100 per vote -- shattered the previous U.S. record for an entire
Senate race -- $30 million spent by Republican Michael Huffington in
his losing 1994 bid for office in California.
</P>
<P>
   The former Goldman Sachs chairman unleashed a
$2-million-per-week blitz of TV commercials and poured hundreds of
thousands of dollars into state and county Democratic
organizations. Florio denounced the tactic as a ''hostile corporate
takeover'' of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters shrugged off the criticism of Corzine's spending.
Norm Reiff, 69, of Northfield, said he picked Corzine, ''in spite
of all the money he put into it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a new face,'' Reiff said. ''Let's give him a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain throughout the day threatened to keep turnout low.
</P>
<P>
   The attention paid to Corzine's spending and his campaign
platforms, such as federal funding of college for students with B
averages or better and investing Social Security funds in the stock
market, dwarfed interest in the GOP primary for Lautenberg's seat.
</P>
<P>
   After GOP Gov. Christie Whitman said she would not run, four
lesser-known candidates stepped in.

<HEADLINE> Ex-majority leader loses staff, prime office  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - What is the cost of attempting to topple the
speaker of the New York state Assembly?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the failed coup by the ex-No. 2 in the chamber,
Michael Bragman, about $1.2 million a year in terms of staffers,
offices expenses and other expenses related to the post.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he was told Tuesday by an emissary from Silver that
all but two or three of his one-time staff of about 36 people would
be transferred away starting Thursday and he would be moved to a
much smaller office in the state Legislative Office Building as of
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of resources is clearly designed by Silver to ''punish
me'' for the failed coup attempt by ''beating on people, staff
people,'' Bragman said. But Bragman, a Democrat whose district
office is in North Syracuse, argued that it is unfair to take
members of his staff who have ''vast expertise'' in transportation,
workers' compensation and other issues and move them into undefined
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell them where they'll be working, I can't tell them
what they will be doing,'' Bragman said. ''This is not based on how
intelligent you are or how hard you want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman lost the majority leader's title, his $34,500-a-year
stipend, his state Capitol office and a dozen of the majority
leader's staffers when his coup attempt was unfolding. He said the
additional cuts will mean the reduction of his staff from two dozen
to two or three, depending on how he wishes to allocate his
remaining budget.
</P>
<P>
   In dollars, Bragman said he was told he would be given $125,000
a year to run his offices, or prorated for the rest of 2000,
$70,000.
</P>
<P>
   That is very different from the budget Bragman formerly enjoyed.
In the 1998-99 state fiscal year, Bragman spent $1.36 million on
his office, far more than the average of about $304,000 of all
Assembly Democrats for that year.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman's previous spending is somewhat misleading, however.
Unlike other legislative leaders, he did not split up his costs
between the operations of his office as an individual legislator
and as majority leader. Other leaders list the expenses of their
appointed offices - such as the Finance Committee in the Senate or
the Ways and Means Committee in the Assembly - separately, lowering
the cost of running their offices as individual legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said his district office gets about 300 calls a week
from constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver spokeswoman Patricia Lynch confirmed Bragman's loss of
about $1.2 million worth of staff and perks.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were perks what were attached to the majority leader's
position and since he is no longer majority leader, those
additional resources need to be held for the new and the next
majority leader,'' she said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to Bragman to choose which employees he wants to
retain on his staff, according to Lynch. The others will start to
work for the Assembly's ''central staff'' doing projects for the
Democratic majority, she said.
</P>
<P>
   No one will be fired, Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The speaker has guaranteed that the staff people will not lose
their jobs because of the attempted power play of their boss,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The office Bragman is being forced out of is on the prestigious
ninth floor of the Legislative Office Building where long-tenured,
powerful lawmakers have offices. His new office will be a
far-smaller space on the third floor of the same building where
low-tenured and minority party legislators have mostly been
assigned space.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said the loss of resources shows the absolute power
Silver has and the need for the reforms in the Assembly which he
and other dissident Democrats are advocating for.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman suggested that legal action is one of the options he is
''reviewing,'' though courts in New York have been highly reluctant
to inject themselves into the activities of a coequal branch of
government, the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Silver said it is unlikely a new majority leader
will be selected until after the November elections for all seats
in the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to sit down and see the results of the election and
go with a majority leader at that point,'' the speaker told WROW-AM
radio in Albany. ''There are several deputies and assistants who
have been doing a very good job on the floor. At this point I think
we will wait for the start of the new legislative session.''

   Assuming his district returns him to Albany, Silver will also

for the 2001-02 legislative session.

   The majority leader acts as a traffic cop in the Assembly,
bringing bills to the floor the ruling Democrats favor and calling

been filling in most of the time since Silver stripped Bragman of
his majority leader's title on May 17.

<HEADLINE> Serbs, NATO Clash After Grenades  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRACANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs angry over a grenade attack
swarmed around a British general Tuesday, prompting his bodyguards
open fire to scare the crowd. The clash left one person wounded and
increased tensions in the already restive Serb community.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came during a melee that was touched off by the
grenade explosion as furious Serbs attacked passing ethnic
Albanians and peacekeepers, leaving at least 11 more people
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage in this Serb enclave comes after a surge of attacks
Kosovo's Serb community claims are intended to drive them and other
minorities from the province. Eight people have died in the past
week, and many Serbs say peacekeepers have failed to ensure their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles in this monastery town just south of the capital,
Pristina, escalated quickly Tuesday. At midmorning, an attacker
drove alongside the market in the center of town and hurled a
grenade, witnesses and NATO-led peacekeepers said.
</P>
<P>
   Furious that NATO troops did not prevent the attack, a crowd
gathered and began to stone Swedish peacekeepers who form a huge
share of the contingent stationed in the town.
</P>
<P>
   The mob pulled people out of cars, beat them and set the
vehicles on fire. Drivers and others, reportedly ethnic Albanians,
retreated to the town's 14th century Serbian Orthodox monastery for
refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the British sector, Brig. Richard Shirreff
rushed to the scene to calm the crowd of several hundred. The mob
closed around him and took the weapon of one of his bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Others in his security detail fired shots into the air and one
into the crowd, injuring one person, NATO officials said. NATO-led
peacekeepers originally reported three people were injured, but
later revised the figure downward.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were attacked,'' Shirreff said. ''We had to fire shots to
protect ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the medical center in Gracanica, Zorica Nedeljkovic,
told Beta that a total of 12 Serbs were injured -- eight in the
grenade attack and four in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Local Serbs stood outside the monastery throughout the day,
watching cars, trucks and vans smolder. They called out to
reporters to express their outrage over the grenade attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was thrown right in front of KFOR,'' said Dragan
Stojanovic, 48, using the acronym for the NATO peacekeepers' Kosovo
Force. ''How come they weren't able to stop that car? Aren't they
ashamed?''
</P>
<P>
   The local Serb National Council condemned the grenade attack,
claiming it was only the latest act from a ''wave of organized
Albanian terrorist groups seeking to expel Serbs from Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have repeatedly told KFOR that the market in Gracanica is a
dangerous site ... but NATO found no solutions for the problem,''
Father Sava Janjic told Yugoslavia's private Beta news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The melee comes at a sensitive political moment for the
province's Serbs, just days before the anniversary of the arrival
of NATO-led peacekeepers, who took over Kosovo after a 78-day air
war to end Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's repression of
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   As the date of the anniversary has drawn closer, moderate Serbs
have grown more impatient with their increasing isolation in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb delegation plans to travel Wednesday to U.N. headquarters
in New York to demand self-rule for Serbs in Kosovo and better
security, according to the independent Yugoslav news agency FoNet.

<HEADLINE> Fund-Raising Probe Sparks Debate  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a memo kept secret for 2{ years, FBI
Director Louis Freeh warned that the Justice Department was
ignoring ''reliable evidence'' that conflicted with Al Gore's
accounts of his fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh urged appointment of an independent counsel to investigate
Democratic fund raising in the November 1997 memo to Attorney
General Janet Reno, written by staff at his request.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the face of compelling evidence that the vice president was
a very active, sophisticated fund-raiser who knew exactly what he
was doing, his own exculpatory statements must not be given undue
weight,'' the Freeh memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said the FBI's legal analysis was
flawed. The dispute, and numerous others among campaign finance
investigators, were laid bare in 61 FBI and Justice documents
released Tuesday by a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore campaigning for president and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton running for the Senate, Republicans in both Houses
of Congress on Tuesday investigated why no independent counsel for
fund-raising was sought.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's memo preceded a better-known, and more scrutinized, memo
by the chief prosecutor in the case, Charles LaBella, who accused
his Justice superiors of contorting their investigation to avoid
triggering an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In a later memo, Freeh recounted a meeting with Reno on Dec. 4,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ... argued once again that the Attorney General has and had
had for some time an irrevocable political conflict of interest
which makes it inapproprirate and -- in my judgment -- impossible for
her ... to make legal ... decisions'' regarding a probe of
President Clinton and Gore, Freeh wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Both Freeh and LaBella have testified in Congress to disagreeing
vigorously with Reno's decision not to request appointment of
independent investigators. The new documents are the first with
details of their suspicions about Gore's truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and LaBella demanded an independent counsel to scour a
wide range of accusations, from White House coffees for donors to
millions of dollars in foreign contributions to the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you blame the American people or many in Congress for
being cynical?'' asked House Government Reform Committee chairman
Dan Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the senior Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee, called the LaBella memo ''perhaps the worst
piece of legal analysis to ever come out of the Justice
Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh argued that the Justice Department's preoccupation with
bit players should be replaced by a top-down investigation starting
with President Clinton and a ''core group'' of aides under the
theory that ''most of the alleged campaign abuses flowed directly
or indirectly from the all-out efforts by the White House and DNC
(Democratic National Committee) to raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 94-page memo, LaBella also said the Republican Party
''had its fair share of abuses,'' including funneling $2 million in
foreign money into the Republican National Committee in a single
hidden transaction that may have been illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RNC accomplished what it took the DNC over 100 White House
coffees to accomplish,'' LaBella wrote.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella said an independent counsel also should consider what
Mrs. Clinton knew about foreign money brought in by fund-raisers
Johnny Chung and Charlie Trie.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has repeatedly said she based her decisions on the law and
the facts and didn't feel pressured to protect Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The documents in their entirety show that the attorney general
made the right decisions,'' said Reno spokesman Myron Marlin. ''She
had compelling reasons not to appoint an independent counsel and
she received solid advice from many officials in the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's memo focused in part on fund-raising phone calls Gore
made from his government office. The vice president denied that he
intended to raise ''hard money,'' which is regulated by federal
laws prohibiting solicitations on federal property.
</P>
<P>
   The director's memo suggested the Justice Department was
''relying almost exclusively on the vice president's own statements
to draw inferences favorable to him even where those statement are
contradicted by other reliable evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion that Gore's phone calls were to solicit ''soft
money,'' outside the scope of the law, was based on ''hundreds of
interviews with those who participated in the calls, and the
examination of scores of documents,'' responded Lee Radek, the
chief of the department's public integrity section who dealt with
independent counsel issues.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella complained that his Justice Department superiors were
''intellectually dishonest'' and practiced ''gamesmanship'' to
avoid an independent counsel investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Radek called those allegations ''preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The authors' attribution of bad faith to those of us who have
disagreed with them on various issues is nothing short of
shocking,'' Radek wrote.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella said the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign ''was so
corrupted by bloated fund raising and questionable 'contributions'
that the system became a caricature of itself.''

DOJ Official Criticizes Microsoft Response
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A Justice Department spokeswoman today criticized Microsoft's
response to the DOJ's breakup plan in the anti-trust case. Gina Talamona says
the response, which came a day early than expected today, ''rehashes Microsoft's
old arguments, ignores the extensive violations found by the court, denies the
need for serious relief and grossly distorts our proposed remedy.'' In the
filing, Microsoft asked U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to include
previously suggested language that would give a broken-up Microsoft more freedom
to enter into agreements with software developers and computer makers.

   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Propelled from obscurity by his record-shattering $33
million campaign, retired investment banker Jon Corzine captured New Jersey's
Democratic Senate nomination today and ruined the comeback hopes of former Gov.
Jim Florio. With 38 percent of precincts reporting, Corzine led with 103,175
votes, or 60 percent. Florio drew 67,763 votes, or 40 percent. Corzine has never
held elected office but quickly gained endorsements from top state political
leaders, including the man both he and Florio hope to replace, retiring
three-term Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg. The race was the highlight of
primary voting in six states today.

Serb Aide Says CIA Behind Slaying
</SUBHEAD>

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A top aide to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on Tuesday claimed that the CIA was behind the slaying of an adviser
to Montenegro's pro-Western president. U.S. officials called the charge absurd.
Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic is at odds with Milosevic's government
over economic and political issues. Montenegro and Serbia make up Yugoslavia.
Some officials in Montenegro have accused Yugoslav authorities of complicity in
the killing of National Security Adviser Goran Zugic a week ago. Zugic was one
of Djukanovic closest associates.

he asked Joseph Sweeting what happened in the hours after the Jan. 31 fight.
Lewis said the fight, which happened outside an Atlanta club after a Super Bowl

<HEADLINE> Tigers 2, Pirates 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Deivi Cruz homered and Juan Gonzalez had an
RBI single as the Detroit Tigers beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 2-1 on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair and four relievers held the Pirates to one run on
11 hits. They stranded 12 Pirates baserunners.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Anderson (1-4) lost despite allowing only three hits and
one run in seven innings. Anderson walked the game's first two
batters before giving up an RBI single to Gonzalez, who returned
after sitting out Monday's game with a bruised foot.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz led off the eighth with a homer, his second, off Josias
Manzanillo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates finally broke through in the eighth. John Vander Wal
doubled off Brocail and, two outs later, Mike Benjamin hit a
triple.
</P>
<P>
   Blair allowed seven hits and no runs in 4 1-3 before leaving
with runners on first and second. C.J. Nitkowski (3-7) got the last
two outs in the fifth. He struck out Brian Giles and got Vander Wal
to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones pitched a hitless ninth for his 17th save in 18
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh left the bases loaded in the first when Vander Wal
struck out and Kevin Young flied out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tigers catcher Brad Ausmus batted leadoff for the fifth
time this season. He's already hit in six spots in the order. He's
been used most often at second, starting 28 games there. ...
Gonzalez has hit in 15 of his last 18 games and has 13 RBIs in that
stretch. ... Anderson has been scored upon in the first inning in
seven consecutive starts. ... The first-inning announcement of new
Pirates base coaches Trent Jewett and Tommy Sandt was greeted by
applause. Jewett worked at third and Sandt at first after Jack Lind
and Joe Jones were fired from those jobs Tuesday. ... Pirates 2B
Warren Morris was unavailable because of a bruised ankle he
sustained in Monday's game. Abraham Nunez, just up from Triple-A
Nashville, replaced him.

<HEADLINE> Power Outage Stalls U.S. Cup Game  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- A power outage during a heavy rainstorm
delayed a U.S. Cup game between the United States and Ireland for
22 minutes before play resumed on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 1-1 when the stadium lights went out at Foxboro
Stadium, sending the field into darkness. The game clock continued
to run, and some billboards remained illuminated with auxiliary
power.
</P>
<P>
   Power was restored about 10 minutes later, but the lights needed
time to warm up and the game resumed at 9:53 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Wind whipped at up to 35 mph and driving rainstorm drenched the
crowd, but the field remained clean and the footing appeared sure
before the outage, which organizers could not immediately explain.
</P>
<P>
   A blown transformer near the stadium delayed the NFL's 1997 AFC
Championship game between the New England Patriots and Jacksonville
Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Although the game was only an exhibition, U.S. coach Bruce Arena
is using the U.S. Cup to pick the squad that will compete in World
Cup qualifying starting next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland took a 1-0 lead when Domonic Foley converted a bicycle
kick pass from Stephen McPhail in the 31st minute. Foley also
scored in Ireland's first game, a 2-2 tie with Mexico on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans tied it in the 68th minute when Ante Razov got
past the defense -- perhaps so far that he should have been called
offsides -- and bounced a pass from Earnie Stewart into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones entered the game as a substitute in the 65th minute,
tying him with Marcelo Balboa for the U.S. record of 128
international appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, which beat South Africa 4-0 on Saturday, will
play Mexico at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., on Sunday.
Ireland tied Mexico 2-2 on Sunday and plays South Africa at Giants
Stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heading into the wind, Ireland was able to capitalize in
the first half. McPhail got the ball in a crowd about 30 yards out
and wheeled it to Foley, who snuck behind U.S. defender C.J. Brown
10 yards from the goal and booted it past goalkeeper Brad Friedel.

<HEADLINE> Study finds 20-somethings want fun, sex -- not marriage  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Are romance and marriage dead? Not exactly,
but they're clearly out of favor among ''20-somethings,'' according
to a study that found young adults are focusing on fun, casual sex
and low-commitment relationships, rather than courtship and
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marriage Project at Rutgers University in New
Brunswick surveyed never-married men and women age 21 through 29 in
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and northern New Jersey for
its new study, dubbed ''Sex Without Strings, Relationships Without
Rings.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Tuesday, was based on results of separate
''focus group'' interviews of men and women, about 10 to 12 of each
sex in the five areas, along with lengthy questionnaires filled out
by the participants. The small number of people studied aren't
statistically representative of that population, but this pilot
study will be followed with a large national one next year,
according to David Popenoe, co-director of the three-year-old
project.
</P>
<P>
   ''We put this out as a special report because the material
seemed so compelling,'' said Popenoe, a sociology professor at
Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   None of the interview subjects were college graduates or
currently in a four-year degree program, because most other studies
on such issues have surveyed college seniors or graduates, he said.
Rutgers focused on the non-college crowd because, Popenoe said,
it's roughly 75 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to look at what's happening in the country, this
is the group you want to look at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study revealed nearly identical goals among 20-something men
and women: achieving financial independence and buying a home
before marriage - and delaying marriage indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tend to look at marriage not as a wealth-building thing,
but as an economic risk,'' because of the high costs associated
with divorce, Popenoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in their late 20s, though, there was a difference.
The men still wanted the single life; the women were getting more
serious about finding a husband, but more disenchanted about their
chances of landing a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ''The women were very pessimistic and they had grown very
distrustful of men,'' Popenoe said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason he suggested was that the female participants ''were
quite presentable,'' but the men surveyed were ''considerably more
immature and lacking in goal orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the participants were more likely to see the purpose
of marriage as personal satisfaction, not raising children
together. Many of the men did not want any children, and both sexes
saw it as OK to have a child outside of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of the women were seriously thinking about single
motherhood as an option, although not an ideal one.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some cases, they're picking men out as sperm donors,''
Popenoe said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found several other significant shifts from past
attitudes, based on trends found in national social surveys, with
the participants likely to:
</P>
<P>
   -favor living together before or instead of marriage;
</P>
<P>
   -identify fear of divorce as the key reason to postpone or avoid
marriage;
</P>
<P>
   -idealize marriage, saying they wanted a ''soul mate,'' despite
saying they see marriage as difficult work;
</P>
<P>
   -support marriage preparation and relationship education as a
good way to prevent unhappy marriages and divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the study participants expect their future marriages
to last a lifetime and to fulfill their deepest emotional and
spiritual needs, they are involved in a mating culture that may
make it more difficult to achieve this lofty goal,'' said Barbara
Dafoe Whitehead, the project's other co-director.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Sex Without Strings'' report is part of a larger study,
the project's second annual report on the health of marriage in
America, called ''The State of Our Unions: 2000.''

<HEADLINE> La. Man Executed After 5 Reprieves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGOLA, La. (AP) -- A killer whose life was spared five times by
reprieves was executed Tuesday night for the 1991 murder of a
fast-food restaurant employee.
</P>
<P>
   Feltus Taylor, 39, shot Donna Ponsano to death during a robbery
at Cajun's Fabulous Fried Chicken in Baton Rouge. The manager,
Keith Clark, was shot four times in the head and left partially
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always regretted what I've done,'' Taylor said just before
his lethal injection. ''It was my own doing. After this is over
with, I hope you can find the peace to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who had been hired and fired twice as a fry cook at the
restaurant, had gone to the restaurant to get his job back.
</P>
<P>
   Clark already had replaced Taylor, but he gave him 35 cents to
buy a newspaper so the two could sort through classified ads. Clark
said Taylor snapped when Ponsano passed by, grabbed her arms and
demanded that Clark open the safe. Clark gave Taylor $1,300, but
Taylor still opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's most recent reprieve came in September. He was eating
his final meal of seafood gumbo and fried soft-shell crabs when his
execution was delayed by the Supreme Court. The high court lifted
the reprieve in April when it refused to hear the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's execution was the 26th in Louisiana since the Supreme
Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Republican Senate to take up hate crime bill  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The New York state Senate appears ready to
abandon its long-held opposition to a law to stiffen penalties
committed on the basis of a victim's race, gender, age, religion
and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Senate planned to vote on a measure Wednesday
proposed by Gov. George Pataki to push the penalties for so-called
hate crimes up one notch in severity.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a person facing a Class A misdemeanor charge, which
carries up to one year in jail, would be sentenced as if the crime
was a Class E felony if a defendant's intent to commit a hate crime
is proven. That person would face up to four years in prison under
the heightened penalties provision.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of a law say New York and South Carolina are
currently the only states on the East Coast without a bias crime
law.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said Tuesday that ''times have
changed and the message probably ought to be out there'' that bias
crimes will not be tolerated in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly passed a somewhat more expansive bill this year in
which proof of the intent of a defendant to commit a hate crime
does not have to be present.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he was happy Senate Republicans had relented and
decided to consider bias crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that is a major step forward,'' Pataki said Tuesday.
''It is something I have been working on and striving for since the
first day I got elected governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, gay groups hailed the Senate's apparent willingness to
pass the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a historic victory over hate and anti-gay prejudice,''
said Matt Foreman, executive director of the Empire State Pride
Agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat-dominated state Assembly has approved hate crimes
bills for 11 straight years and is prepared to reconcile its latest
bill with the one the Senate will adopt, said Patricia Lynch, a
spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a Manhattan Democrat and the
Assembly's only openly gay member, said she was ''absolutely
certain'' one bill acceptable to the Assembly, Senate and governor
can be worked out by the end of the legislative session later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman credited impassioned speeches by Sen. Thomas Duane about
bias-related assaults Duane has suffered for shifting ''the terms
of the debate from the abstract to the personal.'' Duane is the
only openly gay member of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Though he will allow the Senate to vote on a bias crime bill,
Bruno hardly sounded enthusiastic about the measure Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been ''totally distorted'' for political purposes,
he grumbled, and become an issue of ''symbolism'' that is detached
from reality. Crime has been going down in New York and penalties
going up for the victims of all crime, regardless of the criminals'
motivation, Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe that a bias or hate bill by itself is going to
do anything to reduce crime,'' he said. ''But I believe that the
message that we're focusing on people who have malice in their
hearts or hate or a bias towards an individual or group ... maybe
the time has come for us to send out there.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Paterson, a Manhattan Democrat who first
introduced a hate crimes bill in 1987, said ambivalence is the
wrong signal for Bruno to send about the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If public servants aren't going to stand behind this they are
sending a subliminal message to prosecutors that they don't have to
pay attention to it,'' Paterson said. ''To me, it is a lot better
if they would embrace the legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's doubts about the bill show ''what a long way we have to
go'' in convincing New Yorkers about the wisdom of anti-bias crime
legislation, Paterson.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many of the 36 Republicans in the Senate
would vote for the measure. Thirty-one votes are needed for
passage, and most, if not all, of the 25 Democrats in the chamber
are expected to vote for the hate crimes bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno himself said he wasn't sure he would vote for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post first reported Tuesday that Senate Republicans
would allow a vote on the bias crime bill.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Closer to Release  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's feared rebels have
moved 21 U.N. peacekeepers closer to the Liberian border,
apparently in preparation to release them, a U.N. spokesman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian peacekeepers had been surrounded by rebels for about
three weeks in the town of Quiva, about 170 miles east of the
capital, Freetown. They were moved Monday in two vehicles to
Pendembu, about 10 miles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials believed the move was the ''last phase'' before
the peacekeepers would be transferred to the Liberian capital,
Monrovia, and then returned to the United Nations in Freetown, U.N.
spokesman David Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels appeared to be acting on the instructions of Liberian
President Charles Taylor, who helped negotiate the release of 500
U.N. hostages via the same route, Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other peacekeepers who were previously thought to be in
Quiva had turned up among 234 U.N. soldiers and 10 unarmed
observers surrounded in the rebel stronghold of Kailahun, about 200
miles east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Zambian peacekeeper who had been missing and
presumed dead made contact with pro-government forces in the north
on Monday and was now recovering at a Freetown hospital, Wimhurst
said. He had no further details.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front rebels killed tens of thousands
of civilians during the West African country's eight-year civil war
and maimed many more.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels signed a July peace accord with the government, but
reignited the conflict in early May, seizing the 500 U.N. hostages
and advancing toward the capital.
</P>
<P>
   About 320 peacekeepers were expected to arrive Tuesday from
Bangladesh, bringing the U.N. force in Sierra Leone to 11,850.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping mission is expected to be boosted to 13,000
troops by the end of June, and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
has called for an additional 3,500 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   As British soldiers prepare to pull out of Sierra Leone in
mid-June, the United Nations has promised a more robust response
from its peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to take very firm action to defend themselves
if hostile intent is show toward them, and to defend unarmed
civilians whenever their lives are endangered,'' U.N. military
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Coker said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Sen. Judd Gregg agreed Tuesday to release
$50 million in U.S. funds for the peacekeeping operation after
receiving assurances from the administration that it no longer
envisions a role for rebel leader Foday Sankoh in efforts to reach
a new peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg, who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee overseeing
State Department expenditures, had been single-handedly holding up
the money. Sankoh was captured by pro-government forces last month
and is being held at an undisclosed location.

<HEADLINE> U.S. 1, Ireland 1  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Ante Razov scored in the 68th minute as
the United States survived a nor'easter, a 22-minute power outage
and a deficit to tie Ireland 1-1 Tuesday night in the U.S. Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Wind whipped at up to 35 mph and a driving rainstorm drenched
the crowd, but the field remained clean and the footing appeared
sure before the outage in the 71st minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Foxboro Stadium lights went out, sending the field into
darkness. The game clock continued to run, and some billboards
remained illuminated with auxiliary power.
</P>
<P>
   Power was restored about 10 minutes later, but the lights needed
time to warm up and the game resumed at 9:53 p.m. EDT. Organizers
blamed the interruption on a brownout affecting Massachusetts
Electric customers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   A blown transformer near the stadium delayed the NFL's 1997 AFC
Championship game between the New England Patriots and Jacksonville
Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Bruce Arena is using the U.S. Cup to pick the squad
that will compete in World Cup qualifying starting next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland (0-0-2 in the tournament) took a 1-0 lead when Domonic
Foley converted a bicycle-kick pass from Stephen McPhail in the
31st minute. Foley also scored in Ireland's first game, a 2-2 tie
with Mexico on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Razov then got behind the defense -- perhaps so far that he
should have been called offsides -- and bounced a pass from Earnie
Stewart into the net to tie it for the United States (1-0-1 in the
cup, 4-2-3 this year).
</P>
<P>
   The home team has never lost in seven games between Ireland and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones entered the game as a substitute in the 65th minute,
tying him with Marcelo Balboa for the U.S. record of 128
international appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, which beat South Africa 4-0 on Saturday, will
play Mexico at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., on Sunday.
Ireland plays South Africa at Giants Stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heading into the wind, Ireland was able to capitalize in
the first half. McPhail got the ball in a crowd about 30 yards out
and wheeled it to Foley, who snuck behind U.S. defender C.J. Brown
10 yards from the goal and booted it past goalkeeper Brad Friedel.

<HEADLINE> Indians 4, Brewers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- David Justice hit his 250th home run and Chuck
Finley pitched a seven-hitter as the Cleveland Indians beat the
Milwaukee Brewers 4-2 Tuesday night for their fourth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, who homered twice Monday, hit a 420-foot drive off John
Snyder (0-2) following Roberto Alomar's two-out double and Jim
Thome's walk. Justice has 15 homers this season, including 12
homers in his last 26 games. He had 33 RBIs in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland helped Finley (5-4) with double plays in each of the
first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was seldom was in trouble, even though the Brewers'
leadoff hitter reached in each of the first four innings. Sean
Berry hit a one-out double in the fifth but didn't advance.
</P>
<P>
   Finley struck out five -- all looking -- and walked three in his
third complete game this season, the 60th of his career. He allowed
a pair of runs in the ninth on Charlie Hayes' RBI double and
Marquis Grissom's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder settled down after Justice's homer and allowed only two
more hits: singles by Travis Fryman in the fourth and by Alomar in
the eighth. He left after 7 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson hit an RBI double off David Weathers in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: RHP Jim Gold, 20, the Brewers' 1998 first-round draft pick,
tore an elbow ligament, and Brewers physicians are recommending
reconstructive surgery. Gold, 3-1 with a 2.91 ERA for Class-A
Beloit, Wis., in the Midwest League, is going to California for a
second opinion. ... Milwaukee sold bleacher tickets for $1 and
upper grandstand seats for $4 in ''Turn Back The Clock'' night
Tuesday. The Brewers wore 1989 uniforms, which will be auctioned
for charity Wednesday at County Stadium. The game drew 24,595. ...
With 211 home runs each, injured Manny Ramirez and Thome are tied
for sixth on the Indians' career list.

Two injured after strong earthquake jolts western Japan
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A fairly strong earthquake jolted western Japan
Wednesday, injuring two people and stopping local train service
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the injuries were minor, both from falling debris
inside homes.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.8 magnitude earthquake was centered about 6 miles under
the seabed in the Sea of Japan at a point about 50 miles, northwest
of Komatsu, Ishikawa prefecture (state), the Meteorological Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   Komatsu, a city with 110,000 people, is 145 miles northwest of
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens of aftershocks recorded in the four hours
after the initial tremor, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of an apartment building in Kaga, a city near Komatsu,
reported that water supply was cut by the quake, apparently after a
pipe broke, police said. Local train service in Ishikawa prefecture
(state) was temporarily halted as officials checked tracks for
damage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage if centered
in a heavily populated area.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Ramon Martinez beat Florida for the eighth time in
nine career decisions and Nomar Garciaparra had three RBIs to lead
the Boston Red Sox over the Marlins 4-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (5-3) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings.
He has a 2.45 career ERA against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Hipolito Pichardo allowed David Berg's RBI double in the sixth.
Rheal Cormier escaped trouble in the seventh when Mark Kotsay hit
into a double play. Derek Lowe, Boston's sixth pitcher, got three
outs for his 12th save in 14 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez (4-5) gave up four runs and eight hits in five
innings. While the Marlins dropped to 33-21 in interleague play, it
is still the best record in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who went 2-for-5. has 13 hits in his last 25
at-bats with three homers and six RBIs, raising his average to .374
and his home-run total to five.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd's 11th homer put Florida ahead in the first and
Preston Wilson made it 2-0 with an RBI triple in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's two-run homer tied it in the fourth, and the Red
Sox went ahead in the fifth on RBI singles by Garciaparra and
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox center fielder Carl Everett caught Floyd's sinking liner
in the fifth and doubled up Mark Kotsay at second, ending the
threat.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Florida manager John Boles indicated that Alex Gonzalez,
who hit .277 and played in last year's All-Star game, will no
longer be the team's starting shortstop. Gonzalez is hitting .163,
the lowest average among regulars in the major leagues, and has a
.202 on-base percentage, also the worst. Berg replaced him in the
lineup. ... Boston's Jeff Frye has hit safely in 15 of his last 16
games. ... Floyd has reached base in a 34 straight games, a career
best. ... Ramon Martinez' fifth-inning single was the second hit in
as many nights by a member of the Red Sox pitching staff, which
came into Monday's game with just one hit in its previous 54
at-bats.

<HEADLINE> Activists Demand Sex Equality  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Women's rights activists demanded Tuesday
that countries which have promised to promote equality between the
sexes repeal laws that discriminate against women, including those
that allow rapists to escape punishment by marrying their victims.
</P>
<P>
   Equality Now, a nonprofit organization, has launched a campaign
to abolish the dozens of laws in penal codes and constitutions
''which are fundamentally inconsistent with the basic human right
to equality,'' said Monique Widyono, the New York-based
organization's co-director.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, she and a half-dozen women activists from
around the world detailed some of the laws that were supposed to
have been revoked according to a platform of action adopted at the
landmark women's conference in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation includes restrictions on women's rights to own
property in Nepal, their right to pass on citizenship to their
husbands in Kenya and the ban on women voting in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Equality Now and a host of grass-roots organizations are calling
on governments attending a conference reviewing the progress since
Beijing to set a date of 2005 to finally repeal the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elimination of discriminatory laws does not require the
allocation of financial resources -- it merely requires political
will,'' Widyono said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Chiarotti, regional coordinator for the Latin American and
Caribbean Committee for the Defense of Women's Rights, said several
Latin American governments, including Peru and Costa Rica, had
recently repealed legislation that would allow rapists to avoid
serving jail time if they offered to or married their victims.
</P>
<P>
   But still others have the legislation on the books, even if it
isn't necessarily enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very difficult to provide for penalization of sexual
violence of marital rape if the law consents to the foundation of a
family upon a crime like rape, abduction or sexual abuse,''
Chiarotti said.
</P>
<P>
   She said countries including Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela have such laws, which
are rooted in religious norms written 3,000 years ago dictating
that a father of a rape victim could ask for money from the
perpetrator and oblige him to marry his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was considered damaged object and the person who spoiled
it had to keep it,'' Chiarotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of discriminatory legislation are laws that condone
''honor killings,'' allowing men to escape punishment for killing a
female relative who has shamed the family.

<HEADLINE> OAS Needs Money to Avoid Crisis  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- A day after approving a new mission to
enhance democracy in Peru, the Organization of American States
heard Tuesday it was running out of money and members must pay what
they owe to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ministers attending the 30th general assembly of the
34-nation group echoed a call by Secretary General Cesar Gaviria of
Colombia for the OAS to reassess priorities and unlock spending
that has remained at $75 million a year under a 1995 mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't review your 1995 decision, the OAS is going to be
extinguished very soon,'' Gaviria said. ''It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The OAS budget comes from annual assessments, known as quotas,
collected from each member. Six countries -- the United States,
Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela -- together are
assessed more than 90 percent of the total, with the United States
asked to pay almost five times as much as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, the U.S. quota was $44 million, while Canada had
the second largest quota at $9 million. Of the so-called big six,
Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela have paid their full quotas
for this year, while the United States owes $36 million and Brazil
its entire quota of $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials authorized to comment on the issue were attending
meetings Tuesday and not immediately available, according to the
office of the U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS has received $26.6 million of the $73.7 million in year
2000 quotas so far.
</P>
<P>
   Gaviria said the OAS was struggling to maintain its programs and
activities, noting that nine of its offices in the hemisphere had
been closed in the past five years. He and others said the OAS was
under pressure to take a stronger role in hemispheric issues, such
as election observer missions and the special mission being sent to
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mandates cannot continue being given to the OAS without at the
same time increasing in real terms the resources we have at our
disposal,'' said Javier Murillo, the Bolivian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution passed Monday night created a new mandate -- sending
Gaviria and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy to
Peru to assess ways to rebuild democracy following irregularities
in the recent election of President Alberto Fujimori to a third
straight term.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 8, Expos 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Bernie Williams homered and drove in four runs,
and emergency starter Jason Grimsley pitched five strong innings to
lead the New York Yankees to an 8-1 win over Montreal on Tuesday
night, ending the Expos' season-high six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit a solo homer in the second and hit a three-run
double during a six-run eighth to the delight of numerous Yankees
fans 24,453 in attendance, the Expos' second-largest home crowd of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley (2-1) allowed three hits and one run in his third start
of the season, throwing 77 pitches after David Cone moved up a day
to fill in for the injured Ramiro Mendoza on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton, who relieved Grimsley, struck out the first four
batters he faced and retired eight in a row before issuing a
two-out walk to Mike Mordecai in the eighth. Todd Erdos got the
last four outs.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton also singled in the eighth, improving his average to
.500 in 14 career at-bats. Scott Brosius went 4-for-5 for the
Yankees, who have won three of five interleague games this year.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal lost for the second time in its last 12 home games. The
Expos had won seven straight at Olympic Stadium and their 22-10
home record is the best in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams homered off Javier Vazquez (6-2) to give New York
an early lead, Mordecai tied it at 1 with his third homer leading
off the third. The only other hits for Montreal were by Vazquez who
went 2-for-2, including a leadoff double in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, batting leadoff for the second straight game in
place of the injured Chuck Knoblauch, hit a sacrifice fly to give
the Yankees a 2-1 lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez, who threw 120 pitches, and just 64 strikes, in six
innings, allowed two runs on seven hits. He struck out seven and
walked four.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees put the game away with six runs in the eighth,
including Tino Martinez's sixth homer off reliever Guillermo Mota.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The crowd was Montreal's third over 20,000 this season,
including 51,249 for the home opener April 3 and 20,111 for an 8-3
win over Houston May 21. ... Knoblauch missed his second straight

<HEADLINE> Cubs 4, Diamondbacks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Kevin Tapani took a shutout into the ninth inning
to lead the Chicago Cubs to a 4-1 victory over the Arizona
Diamondbacks, who lost their fourth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Augie Ojeda hit an RBI triple to spark a three-run fifth
off Armando Reynoso (4-5). The Diamondbacks have lost four straight
for the first time since June 20-23, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani (4-6) pitched a five-hitter, allowing a solo homer to
Craig Counsell with one out in the ninth inning. It was Tapani's
second complete game this season. He also went the distance April
18 in a 4-3 loss to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani retired the first nine batters he faced before Tony
Womack singled to lead off the fourth. Damian Miller reached on an
infield single in the sixth and as did Craig Counsell leading off
the seventh. Turner Ward also doubled with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani struck out seven -- including Luis Gonzalez three times --
and did not walk a batter. He now has worked at least seven innings
in each of his last eight starts and 10 of his last 11 outings.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso lost for the second time in his last seven starts,
giving up three runs and six hits over 4 2-3 innings. He struck out
a season-high seven.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Buford walked to lead off the Cubs fifth and Ojeda tripled
into the right-field corner to make it 1-0. One out later, Eric
Young was hit in the left shoulder by a pitch and Joe Girardi
singled to score Ojeda and make it 2-0. Mark Grace then singled to
drive in Young.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the Cubs' seventh, Young walked, stole second,
advanced on a wild pitch by Russ Springer and scored on Girardi's
double to make it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tapani's career low-hit complete game was a one-hitter
Sept. 16, 1997, against Cincinnati. ... Ojeda, called up May 31
from Triple-A Iowa, started his third straight game at short. The
Cubs' other shortstops, Ricky Gutierrez (separated shoulder) and
Jose Nieves (strained hamstring), are on the disabled list. ...
Arizona broadcaster Rod Allen's son Rod Allen Jr. was drafted by
Cincinnati in the 34th round of the amateur draft.

<HEADLINE> Manson Follower Denied Parole  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRONTERA, Calif. (AP) -- Former Charles Manson follower Leslie
Van Houten was denied parole for a 13th time Tuesday after
relatives of her victims pleaded that she be kept in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Van Houten, 50, told a parole board hearing she wished to be
released, perhaps to work as a book editor at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know the world out there, but it felt like a good
thing for a woman in her 50s to do,'' Van Houten told the board.
''If that day ever comes, I want to become anonymous and live as
quietly as I can.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe what I did is inexcusable,'' she said. ''You can
never make it right and I sincerely apologize for all the pain the
family went through.''
</P>
<P>
   California Board of Prison Terms Chairman Manuel E. Ortega said
the viciousness of the crimes was the main reason Van Houten was
denied parole.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Smaldino, a nephew of victims Rosemary and Leno LaBianca,
told the hearing, ''She can never repay in this life what she did
to us and our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Houten was 19 when she joined Charles Manson's hippie-like
cult. In August 1969, Manson sent his followers out on two nights
of murders, first to the home of actress Sharon Tate, who was slain
along with four others, and then to the home of the LaBiancas, who
owned a grocery business.
</P>
<P>
   Van Houten was not present at the Tate slayings, but went along
the following night to the LaBianca home.
</P>
<P>
   She and two other women followers, Susan Atkins and Patricia
Krenwinkel, were convicted of the murders and sentenced to death.
Their sentences were commuted to life in prison when California's
death penalty was briefly overturned in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Muslim Leader To Retire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Alija Izetbegovic, who led
Bosnia's Muslim-led government during the Bosnian war, announced
Tuesday he will resign from Bosnia's collective presidency in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Izetbegovic cited his age and health for his decision to
withdraw from the three-member presidency at the end of his term as
the chairman Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''In August, I will be 75 and the job of a member of the
presidency requires a physical condition that I no longer have,''
Izetbegovic said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency includes one representative from each ethnic
group -- Muslims, Serbs and Croats -- that fought the 1992-1995 war.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian law provides no provision for choosing a new presidency
member if one of the three dies in office. Izetbegovic said he
hoped parliament would approve a succession law before he steps
down.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said that because there is no law on succession,
Izetbegovic's decision may force the two other presidency members --
Bosnian Serb Zivko Radisic and Bosnian Croat Ante Jelavic -- to
resign also pending new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Izetbegovic said he would stay on as president of his Party for
Democratic Action, or SDA. Izetbegovic said his biggest success in
the last 10 years was the fact that he prevented Bosnia becoming a
part of Greater Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the failure to establish a ''a unified, democratic and
prosperous Bosnia'' was his greatest failure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bosnia is still not unified,'' he said. ''There are no human
rights throughout the country. Bosnia is being eaten by social
problems. There are no jobs, people live a difficult life ... This
process of creating unified Bosnia and the elimination of
separatistic elements, creating of jobs ... it's not moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Izetbegovic, a devout Muslim who spent nine years as a political
prisoner in Communist Yugoslavia, became an international figure
during the long years when his capital Sarajevo was under siege by
Bosnian Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the signatories of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement
which ended the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Izetbegovic won a reputation as a moderate by steering
multi-ethnic Bosnia-Herzegovina on a neutral course during the
early years of the breakup of former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Miami Gang Leader Gets Life in Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The leader of a drug gang authorities say worked to
kill off its competition while building a cocaine smuggling empire
was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth ''Boobie'' Williams was head of the Boobie Boys gang,
which authorities say committed 35 murders to establish drug
operations that smuggled $85 million of cocaine across Florida and
to 12 other states during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and six other gang members, including his right-hand
man, Efrain Cosado, received life terms. Three others received
30-year sentences.
</P>
<P>
   They were convicted in cocaine distribution conspiracy case
after a jury trial last month.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1998, gang members killed to establish their
turf and to retaliate against rivals as they built their own drug
empire, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Although no murder charges were part of the federal indictment,
jury members were shown gruesome pictures of drug crime victims,
supplemented by testimony from former gang members turned
government witnesses.

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Popocatepetl volcano erupted with a spew

five small towns nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The government's National Center for Disaster Prevention said
that the mountain shot out a column of ash that rose about 3{ miles

   On May 23, the volcano shot ash more than 3 miles into the air.

<HEADLINE> Gogel Gets Another Shot At Pebble  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The last batch of PGA Tour players trying to qualify
for the
U.S. Open will have to wait one more day as heavy rain kept 93 of
118 players from finishing their 36 holes Tuesday in New Jersey,
one of eight sites used for sectional qualifying.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Others got their ticket to Pebble Beach Golf Links for the Open,
which gets under way June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Gogel, who squandered a seven-stroke lead to Tiger Woods on
the back nine at Pebble in February, was among 12 players who
survived a playoff at Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Tiziani, the brother-in-law of Steve Stricker, was the
medalist at Boone Valley Golf Club in St. Louis to take one of two
spots available.
</P>
<P>
   University of Houston senior Andrew Sanders had a 62 in the
afternoon at Shadow Hawk Golf Club in Houston to return to Pebble
Beach. He reached the quarterfinals of the U.S. Amateur at Pebble
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger story was who didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Panthers tight end Brian Kinchen will have to stick
with football. He had rounds of 80 and 81 at Shadow Hawk and missed
out by 25 strokes. That was still better than 1998 U.S. Amateur
champion Hank Kuehne, who withdrew after opening with an 81.
Kuehne's brother Trip, who lost to Woods in the 1996 U.S. Amateur
finals, also failed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Former PGA and U.S. Open champion Larry Nelson, now on the
Senior PGA Tour, failed to qualify in his home state of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest sectional qualifier Tuesday was at Canoe Brook
Country Club in Summit, N.J., where players such as two-time
Masters champion Ben Crenshaw, former Masters and U.S. Open
champion Fuzzy Zoeller and former Masters champion Craig Stadler --
along with his son, Kevin -- were trying to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   They will return to the course Wednesday morning to finish their
rounds.
Knollwood Club, Lake Forest, Ill.:
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Blackman of North Mankato, Minn., grabbed one of three
spots available by finishing as medalist at 141. Danny Green, the
'99 Mid-Amateur champion, is an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifier was continued from Monday because of rain.
Woodmont Country Club, Rockville, Md.:
</P>
<P>
   At the course where Shigeki Maruyama shot a 58, 13 players
returned Tuesday in a playoff for 12 spots. Among tour players who
got in were Gogel, John Cook, Scott Verplank and Andy Bean, who had
to qualify at the local level. The odd man out was Don Pooley.
Butler Country Club, Butler, Pa.:
</P>
<P>
   J.L. Lewis, who won the John Deere Classic last year, and Rick
Stimmel of Cranberry, Pa., tied at 138 to claim both spots.
Shadow Hawk Golf Club, Houston:
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he never came close to a bogey in his round of 62
to qualify. The other spot went to former University of Oklahoma
player Jeff Lee. Among the alternates is Peter Jacobsen, who hasn't
played in a U.S. Open since 1996.
Settindown Creek, Roswell, Ga.:
</P>
<P>
   Javier Sanchez is returning to the U.S. Open after a three-year
absence. Sanchez, who took up the game while working as a cook in a
local golf club, was medalist at 141.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Nelson, others who failed to qualify were tour
players Franklin Langham and Skip Kendall, and Georgia Tech
teammates Bryce Molder and Matt Kuchar.
Boone Valley Golf Club, St. Louis:
</P>
<P>
   Tiziani had an afternoon round of 67 to finish at 135. The other
spot went to amateur Craig Lile.
Pumpkin Ridge (Ghost Creek), North Plains, Ore.:
</P>
<P>
   Taggert Riddings of Tulsa, Okla., won medalist honors by three
strokes at 137 to take one of two spots. One of the alternates is
Tommy Stankowski, brother of tour player Paul Stankowski, who
failed to qualify Monday at Woodmont.

<HEADLINE> Donor's Ex-Aide Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A former aide to a Democratic donor pleaded
guilty Tuesday to obstructing a Justice Department investigation
into campaign contributions made by her boss, David Chang.
</P>
<P>
   The plea by Audrey Yu came on the day she and Chang were to
stand trial. Chang pleaded guilty Friday to illegally donating
$53,700 to the successful 1996 Senate campaign of then-Rep. Robert
Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   Like Chang, Yu has agreed to cooperate with the Campaign
Financing Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Yu, 32, faces six to 12 months in prison but could get probation
for pleading guilty to a single charge of conspiring with Chang to
obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her plea, Yu admitted that she lied to a federal
grand jury last year when she said she did not see shredded
documents at the offices of one of Chang's companies.
</P>
<P>
   Chang operates several trading companies in Torricelli's former
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli spokesman Richard McGrath said he had no comment on
Yu because her activities did not involve the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yu is among 25 people charged by the task force. Six, not
including Yu, have admitted wrongdoing regarding Torricelli
fund-raising efforts. None of the six has implicated the New Jersey
Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Hicks Named Loyola, Md. Hoops Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Scott Hicks, the men's basketball coach of the
State University of New York at Albany, was introduced Tuesday as
the head coach at Loyola College.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel strongly that we can achieve a very high level in the
years to come on the basketball court,'' Hicks said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, 34, has compiled a 131-95 record in eight seasons as a
collegiate head coach.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the past three seasons as Albany's head coach, leading
the Great Danes to an 11-17 record last season, Albany's first as a
Division I independent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scott is a great young basketball mind, and he has been
successful at every juncture of his career,'' Loyola athletic
director Joe Boylan said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks was a graduate assistant coach at Syracuse before he
became the head coach at LeMoyne College, which he led to the New
England Collegiate Conference championship in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, a native of Oneida, N.Y., is a 1988 graduate of LeMoyne,
where he was captain of the 1988 team, which went 24-6.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Loyola announced that Dino Gaudio resigned after three
years as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Gaudio won a Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament game
in each of his first two seasons at Loyola. He left after a 7-21
record last season to become an assistant at Xavier.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda Agree to Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- After two days of fierce fighting,
Rwandan and Ugandan troops on Tuesday agreed to a U.N.-brokered
cease-fire in a northern Congolese city that both sides consider
strategic.
</P>
<P>
   Only sporadic gunfire could be heard in the Congo River port of
Kisangani after the cease-fire took effect, the third such attempt
by a U.N. mission here to stop the fighting between the two
erstwhile allies in a 22-month war against Congolese President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said Uganda would not complete
a planned withdrawal from the town without a U.N.-supervised
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan and Ugandan armies have clashed repeatedly in Kisangani,
a city both view as strategic for resupplying their troops
elsewhere in Congo. Both armies were in the process of withdrawing
on Monday when Ugandan artillery pounded Rwandan positions in the
city. Ugandan officials suspected the Rwandan Patriotic Army of
firing a rocket at one of their vehicles and provoking the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan army denied the charge, and said the incident was
staged as an excuse to bring Ugandan troops back into the city and
regain positions lost in fighting in August and last month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, preliminary talks began Tuesday in the nearby west
African nation of Benin, but without the participation of the
Congolese government.
</P>
<P>
   Delegations from the two major rebel factions, the Ugandan
foreign minister and some civil society representatives attended
the opening session of the meeting convened by international
mediator Ketumile Masire, the former president of Botswana. The
talks are aimed at deciding a venue, planning an agenda and working
out logistical problems for a national dialogue on Congo's
political future envisaged in last year's cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, however, was not represented. The Congolese government
would not ''sit down at the same table as the instigators of
massacres,'' Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia said Monday in
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   After ferocious artillery bombardment that left at least four
civilians dead, Rwandan troops controlled most of downtown
Kisangani and halted the Ugandan advance across the Tshopo River
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. military observers said the Ugandan troops had crossed the
bridge on Monday in an attempt to move toward Kisangani, but had
faced Rwandan units that put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials evacuated their headquarters to a Roman Catholic
church compound after two mortar rounds landed near their house on
Monday, they said. Kisangani, Congo's third largest city in the
middle of a thick tropical forest, was plunged into darkness after
one of the shells reportedly damaged the only power station.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping they will respect this cease-fire. It's a third
cease-fire since yesterday,'' said Maj. Sissoko Ramadan, one of the
U.N. military observers stationed here as part of a peace plan
signed in August between Kabila and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which was also signed by Rwanda and Uganda
as well as Kabila's allies from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, the
foreign troops are to withdraw from Congo under the supervision of
5,537-strong U.N. force. So far, more than 100 unarmed U.N.
military observers have deployed in Congo and the remainder are
expected in July.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated gunshots pierced the otherwise quiet night in
Kisangani, where most residents took cover in their homes. Ramadan
said it might take a while before the cease-fire order reached all
units.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the two East African neighbors have
deteriorated since they went into Congo to back up a rebellion
against Kabila in August 1998. They have differed over the conduct
of war and which of the three rebel groups to support.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 5, Phillies 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mike DiFelice hit a go-ahead, two-run double
in the 10th inning Tuesday night, leading the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
over the Philadelphia Phillies 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley (1-1) walked Jose Guillen leading off the 10th
and, one out later, walked Steve Cox. DiFelice then doubled to the
gap in left-center, helping Tampa Bay win three straight for the
first time since last September at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Rick White pitched a perfect 10th for second save of the season,
his second in as many nights.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia played its third straight extra-inning game and
fourth in five games, going 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Hernandez (2-2), who had converted four straight save
chances after blowing four in six opportunities, allowed a
game-tying RBI single in the ninth to Kevin Sefcik after Doug
Glanville reached on a throwing error by second baseman Miguel
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville was nearly thrown out at second on the play, but
shortstop Felix Martinez dropped the throw as the umpire was
signaling an out. Sefcik then bounced a single up the middle off.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa's Bryan Rekar allowed two runs and six hits in 6 2-3
innings. Rekar, who was 7-for-52 in his career, broke a 2-2 tie
with an RBI double in the sixth but was thrown out trying to
stretch it into a triple. It was Rekar's second career extra-base
hit, the first since he doubled for Colorado in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, who have been in the NL East cellar for nearly the
entire season, swept AL East-leading Boston before losing twice to
Tampa, the worst team in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay took a 2-0 lead in the first on an RBI single by Jose
Guillen and a sacrifice fly by Vinny Castilla.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Politte allowed three runs, five walks and eight hits in
seven innings. Politte pitched out of trouble early and stranded
seven runners in the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Politte, acquired from St. Louis in November 1998, made his
first start as a Phillie and his first in 25 months. He was called
up from Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre last Friday to replace the
ineffective Paul Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies cut it to 2-1 on an RBI single in the third by
Mickey Morandini. Sefcik tripled to left-center with two outs and
scored on Morandini's liner to right.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Jordan tied the game at 2 in the fourth with a two-out,
solo homer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Phillies third base coach John Vukovich was ejected in the
top of the sixth. ... The Phillies are 0-8 on Tuesdays. ... Rookie
1B Pat Burrell struck out in his first two at-bats. He had fanned
seven times in nine at-bats before flying out in the sixth. ...
Fred McGriff walked in the fifth after thinking he had struck out
on a 1-2 pitch that was called a ball. McGriff grimaced and took a
step toward the dugout before realizing the pitch wasn't a strike.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori to OAS: Don't Question Win  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori said Tuesday that
the decision of the Organization of American States not to impose
sanctions against his government after his controversial
re-election was ''a triumph for Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending his government in his first interview since the OAS
announced its decision, Fujimori told The Associated Press that it
was an ''imperfect democracy'' that he was working to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like a man confident that events were going his way,
Fujimori said he did not foresee serious problems with the United
States, which has sharply criticized the fairness of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect our relationship with the United States to continue
without problems and even to be strengthened. We will do our
best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS on Monday agreed to work on strengthening democracy in
Peru but stopped short of questioning the country's tainted
presidential election or imposing sanctions. Instead it resolved to
send a high-level mission to Peru to work on strengthening
democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Fujimori said he would welcome the OAS mission
and would work with it but would not accept its questioning his
re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The objective of the OAS is to promote and consolidate
representative democracy, respecting the principle of
nonintervention,'' Fujimori told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS general assembly voted Monday to send a mission composed
of its secretary general, Cesar Gaviria, and Canadian Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers debated what course of action to take
after a May 28 presidential runoff election that was boycotted by
Fujimori's opponent, who claimed it would be fraudulent
</P>
<P>
   In Buenos Aires, Argentine President Fernando de la Rua
expressed support for the OAS mission, but suggested any economic
sanctions on Peru would serve no useful purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions ''aren't going to hurt the electoral process, just the
people,'' he said. But de la Rua echoed many Latin American leaders
in expressing concern about the tainted re-election of Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ''What worries me most is what has gone on in this electoral
process,'' he said in the interview at the Government House in
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said the outcome of the OAS meeting was neither a
defeat nor a victory for his government.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the OAS election observer mission that left Peru
two days before the May 28 ballot concluded that the election
process was characterized by merely by ''irregularities, not
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy said Gaviria and he would go to Peru before Fujimori's
July 28 inauguration, when opposition groups plan to hold a giant
protest rally in Lima. Specific issues they will study include
reforming the electoral process and bolstering freedom of the
press.
</P>
<P>
   Debate before the OAS vote pitted Peru and some Latin American
allies that oppose foreign intervention in election issues against
the United States and others seeking a harsh response to
irregularities in the Peruvian voting.

<HEADLINE> Twins 3, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jose Lima took a two-hitter into the eighth
inning, then lost his eighth consecutive decision as the Minnesota
Twins rallied with a three-run eighth inning to beat the Houston
Astros 3-1 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (1-8), on the longest losing streak of his career, hasn't
won since beating Pittsburgh on April 5 in his first start of the
season. He didn't allow a home run for only the third time in 12
starts, but that wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   With Houston leading 1-0, Jacque Jones and Midre Cummings
singled leading off the eighth, Denny Hocking sacrificed and Yorkis
Perez relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Cristian Guzman's grounder scored Jones with the tying run, Matt
Lawton doubled for a 2-1 lead and David Ortiz followed with an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Santana (1-2) got his first major league win, allowing
three hits in five innings, including Ken Caminiti's RBI double in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Guardado, Minnesota's fourth pitcher, got three outs for
his third save in as many chances, completing a six-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the second time in 30 games at Enron Field that both
teams failed to hit any home runs. The other was an April 9 game
against Philadelphia. There have been 105 homers at Enron this
year, 13 short of last season's total in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota starter Eric Milton was bruised on his left lower leg
when hit by Craig Biggio's liner leading off the first. Milton left
after the second inning and the Twins said he was day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, 21-10 last season, retired his first 10 batters and didn't
allow a hit until Lawton's fourth-inning single. Ortiz singled
leading off the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Lima was charged with two runs and four hits in 7 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou returned to the Astros' lineup in left field after
missing eight games with a tight left quadriceps. He went 1-for-4
with a second-inning double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lawton leads the Twins with 21 multihit games. ... The four
runs matched the fewest at Enron (Colorado's 3-1 win on May 8). ...
Perez allowed both inherited runners to score after allowing one of
his first 11 this year. ... Lima had his longest outing of the
season and allowed his fewest hits.

<HEADLINE> Two Cuban Doctors Missing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Police in Zimbabwe denied on Tuesday
that they had arrested two Cuban doctors who attempted to defect by
handing themselves over to Canadian diplomats in Harare.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency said the doctors -- identified as Noris
Pena, 25, and Leonel Cordova, 31 -- failed to show up for an
interview on their status Friday and were believed held by police
in the Zimbabwe capital.
</P>
<P>
   But police said they don't have them. ''We never took them,''
said police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena.
</P>
<P>
   Bvudzijena said he did not know the whereabouts of the pair and
they had not been reported missing to police.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald reported Tuesday that the doctors had been
abducted from a Harare house by Cuban diplomats aided by Zimbabwean
security agents.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Ambassador Rodolfo Sarachino was unavailable Tuesday, his
office said. His staff refused to accept calls relating to the
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Sarachino confirmed last week that the two were among a group of
152 Cuban doctors and medical workers sent to assist Zimbabwe's
ailing health service.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors told the independent Daily News they chose the
assignment in Zimbabwe with the intention of seeking asylum at the
Canadian diplomatic mission here.
</P>
<P>
   When they showed up at the mission two weeks ago, Canadian
diplomats referred them to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees to
evaluate their status as asylum seekers, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors had been in Zimbabwe a little over a month.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence from British colonial rule in 1980, Zimbabwe
has maintained close cultural and ideological ties with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Braves 7, Blue Jays 6  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Rafael Furcal drove in the winning run with a
one-out double in the ninth inning as the Atlanta Braves rallied
from a three-run deficit to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 7-6 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The game dragged on for 3 hours, 44 minutes on an unseasonably
cool night. There were 18 walks -- 10 by the Blue Jays, including
two with the bases-loaded, and eight by the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan led off the ninth with a single off John Frascatore
(1-2) and moved to second on Javy Lopez's dribbler in front of the
plate. Bobby Bonilla was walked intentionally before Furcal lined a
drive to the gap in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger (2-1) picked up the win with a scoreless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Woodward homered for the second night in a row, following
up a three-run homer Monday night that sent the Blue Jays on their
way to a 9-3 victory in the series opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays led 6-3 after Jose Cruz Jr.'s RBI single in the
sixth. But the Braves, who had lost three of their previous four,
battled back with runs in each of the next three innings. Walt
Weiss, who took Chipper Jones' spot in the batting order, tied it
up with a sacrifice fly in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   One day after sending closer John Rocker to the minors, the
Braves received a scare in the sixth inning when Jones, last year's
National League MVP, crumpled to the ground after stepping
awkwardly on second base.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was trying to stop at the bag on a grounder up the
middle, remained on the ground for several minutes with an
anguished look on his face. He finally managed to limp off the
field with what appeared to be a sprained ankle. X-rays were
negative.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves went ahead in the first on Jones' 13th homer of the
season, a 428-foot drive into the right-field seats. Jones drove in
another run with a bases-loaded walk against Paul Quantrill in the
sixth before he was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward hit a two-run homer in the third to give the Blue Jays
a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones had two RBIs for the Braves. Toronto's Shannon
Stewart went 3-for-5, including a run-scoring single in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter Tom Glavine had a miserable game, throwing 136
pitches in just six innings. He walked six in a game for the first
time since Aug. 4, 1996, at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays starter Frank Castillo had a career-high seven walks,
including one to Andruw Jones with the bases loaded in the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Greene made his first appearance as the Blue Jays catcher
this season after Albert Castillo was thrown out of the game in the
fifth for arguing a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's other catcher, Darrin Fletcher, was supposed to be
available only for pinch-hitting duty after straining his right
shoulder making a throw Sunday. But even he was needed before the
night was over, entering in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Toronto had won four straight over the Braves. ... Chipper
Jones' homer marked the first time in four games that Toronto
didn't open the scoring. ... Glavine had two sacrifice bunts,
giving him 130 for his career. He eclipsed the Atlanta Braves
record of 129 set by Phil Niekro. ... Jason Marquis, the
21-year-old pitcher who replaced Rocker on the Braves' roster, made
his first major league appearance and threw a scoreless inning. ...
Atlanta 2B Quilvio Veras left after the fifth inning with lower
back pain. X-rays were negative.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Wins Mont. GOP Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By BOB ANEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Brian Schweitzer, a farmer and political
newcomer who made the high cost of prescription medicine the theme
of his campaign, easily won the Democratic nomination Tuesday to
challenge GOP Sen. Conrad Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer held off John Driscoll, a well-known political figure
who challenged Democratic Sen. Max Baucus in 1990. Driscoll
conducted his low-key pitch mostly through his Web site, and did
little fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 percent of precincts reporting, Schweitzer had 13,069
votes, 67 percent, and Driscoll had 6,513 votes, 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer, who promised to embarrass Congress into doing
something about the cost of medicine, orchestrated four bus trips
of senior citizens to Canada and Mexico to get their prescriptions
filled at up to half of what they would pay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He also went on the attack against Burns, rapping his farm
policies and saying he cannot be trusted because he reneged on a
vow to spend only two terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who was unopposed Tuesday, withheld rebuttals and watched
donations flow in. At last count he had $3.5 million, almost five
times the $710,000 raised by Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Montana voters also narrowed the field of candidates vying to
succeed Gov. Marc Racicot, a popular Republican who is barred from
seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, state Auditor Mark O'Keefe led two other
top state officials, Secretary of State Mike Cooney and Attorney
General Joe Mazurek.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the choice was between Lt. Gov. Judy
Martz and Rob Natelson, a University of Montana law professor known
for conservative activism.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Bench Gonzalez  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Alex Gonzalez, hitting just .163 a year after
making the NL All-Star team, was benched by the Florida Marlins on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a struggle,'' Marlins manager John Boles said. ''It
just can't continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Boles inserted Dave Berg at shortstop for Tuesday's 4-3 loss to
the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who hit .277 with 14 home runs and 59 RBIs last year
as a rookie, was just 33-for-202 this year with one homer and 11
RBI. He struck out 38 times.
</P>
<P>
   His average and on-base percentage (.202) are the lowest in the
major leagues among regular starters.
</P>
<P>
   Boles has benched Gonzalez before for not hustling. Although
Gonzalez has been taking extra batting practice, the results
haven't improved.
</P>
<P>
   ''He works super hard,'' Boles said. ''It's past the point of
wishing and hoping he gets base hits here and there. We believe in
this guy, we believe in his future. We want him to build it back up
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, known for his stellar defense, has also made a
team-leading 12 errors in 54 games. Last year, he had 27 errors all
season
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll see what my hitting coach says and try it day by day,''
Gonzalez said of a new batting stance the coaching staff has him
working on.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who is hitting .247, had an RBI double Tuesday, but
committed one error and misplayed another grounder that was ruled a
hit. Gonzalez got into the game as a pinch-runner in the ninth
inning.
