WHISTLE BLOWS ON KNICKS' STREAK AS HAWKS WIN DEFENSIVE BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An irate Jeff Van Gundy nearly spun to his knees in
disbelief. He had just watched the New York Knicks scramble to make
up for their unsightly effort Wednesday night, and now he was
hearing a whistle that sounded like fingernails across a
chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   He cringed and screamed, ``No, no, no, we've worked too hard for
this. No.''
</P>
<P>
   Referee George Toliver just ignored him and walked away. He was
sticking to his call that came after an unlikely 3-pointer by Larry
Johnson cut the Atlanta Hawks' lead to 1 point with 9.5 seconds
remaining. Just before the inbounds pass by the Hawks, Toliver saw
Allan Houston grab the wrist of Steve Smith and called him for a
dead-ball foul.
</P>
<P>
   And that foul cost the Knicks dearly. The Hawks went on to to
win a game that played out like a demolition derby, 76-73, and
broke the Knicks' three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The loss punctured the feel-good mood of the Knicks, whose hold
on the eighth and final playoff spot trembled just a bit. With four
games left in their season, the Knicks (24-22) hold a half-game
lead over Charlotte and will play a very hot Philadelphia team
Thursday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks lost a little breathing space Friday night, and Van
Gundy lost his temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was a foul or wasn't, I've never seen that call in
10 years in a close game,'' Van Gundy said, referring to the
dead-ball foul, which, in the last 2 minutes of a game, results in
a free throw and the opposition's possession of the ball. ``George
Toliver is a good guy, but that's not an NBA call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad call. First of all, it wasn't a foul. The whole
game was like a locked-up game. If the question is, do you make it
be decided by letting the ball be inbounded and then you call it,
yes. But that's not an NBA call right there.''
</P>
<P>
   The call resulted in a free throw by Steve Smith. When the Hawks
retained possession, Smith was purposely fouled and sent to the
line with 7.8 seconds left. He hit both free throws and finished
off a three-point swing to give the Hawks a 72-68 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough. A wild 3-pointer by Latrell Sprewell fell with
5.5 seconds left to once again cut the Hawks' lead to one point,
but it was too little too late. The Knicks, who sent the Hawks to
the line 43 times in the game, including 21 times in the fourth
quarter, had nothing left to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I did enough to have that foul called,'' Houston
said. ``But you hate to place the blame for a loss on a call. It
was pivotal. But we shouldn't have been in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   They were in a tough spot. Although Sprewell was thriving in an
offense that he took over, and scored 29 points, the ball stopped
moving as well as it had been in the Knicks' previous two games
without Patrick Ewing. The Knicks, who had 20 turnovers, got sucked
into running and gunning with no plan.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was out of sorts, hitting just 4 of 11. And Johnson made
just 2 of 10 shots by trying to maneuver around Dikembe Mutombo,
who scored 18 points and altered dozens of shots. Still, the
Knicks, who held the Hawks to 31 percent from the floor, had a
chance to recover from their messy night. But the whistle, in part,
stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   ``George got the guy holding onto his wrist under the basket,''
the head referee, Bernie Fryer, explained afterward. ``And in that
situation, in the last 2 minutes of the fourth, it's an away from
the play foul.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Only in the end did the Knicks put together a run after trailing
by as many as nine points early in the fourth quarter. After the
two teams combined for just 19 third-quarter points _ an NBA low
for the third quarter points since the 24-second clock was
introduced in 1954 _ the Knicks trailed by five points entering the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks got the better end of the nightmarish quarter, leading
by 52-47 entering the fourth quarter. Harassed by the Hawks,
Sprewell scored only two points. Obviously, he was not the only one
off his mark. Houston missed all five of his shots as the Knicks
shot 25 percent in the third quarter and committed five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   True, these were two defensive teams. But there was no
accounting for the thoughtless turnovers both teams were making.
And it didn't just begin in the third quarter. The third was only a
manifestation of what began at tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   To a point, Sprewell rescued the Knicks in the first half. But
he could not completely make up for the advantage the Hawks had
with Mutombo. Without Ewing to counter the hulking presence of
Mutombo, the Knicks had a difficult time patrolling him without
getting into foul trouble. Mutombo, who scored 12 points in the
first half, put Chris Dudley into foul trouble after just 10
minutes on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   As damaging as Mutombo was, Sprewell was even more devastating.
Taking advantage of an assortment of Hawks _ from Tyrone Corbin and
Alan Henderson to Anthony Johnson and Steve Smith _ Sprewell spun
and drove by them all on his way to 13 trips to the free-throw
line. He hit 11 of 13 from the line and was 3 for 4 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sprewell failed to get his teammates involved, they
seemed almost happy he decided to take over. Johnson was
struggling, going 0 for 5 in the first half, and Houston was of no
use in the first quarter, turning the ball over four times. Houston
spent most of the second quarter on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five days ago we were given up for dead,'' Van Gundy said
before the game. ``We're a little closer, but we're no sure thing.
We felt good the last time we went on a three-game winning streak
and then went on a four-game losing streak. If you have even a
little less focus, you drop back down.''

NASCAR RELATIVELY COMPETITIVE CIRCUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ NASCAR has long prided itself on being family
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctioning body features as many children and women as
drivers in its numerous commercials. So it shouldn't come as a
surprise that three father-son combinations and six sets of
brothers will compete this weekend in the NASCAR tripleheader at
the California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Two families will be represented by three brothers. The
father-son combinations represent the latest generation into stock
car racing. In the case of the Petty clan, it's four generations.
Kyle Petty, son of NASCAR's all-time winningest driver, is slated
to drive in the Winston Cup NAPA California 500 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Petty will be working the ABC broadcast for the
Busch Grand National Auto Club 300, which will feature 18-year-old
Adam Petty. Young Adam is not only following in the footsteps of
his father, but grandfather Richard and great-grandfather Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cool,'' said Kyle of the family connection.
``There are plenty of Richard Petty fans in Southern California and
I think they'll be rooting for Adam.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dale and Dale Earnhardt Jr., not only are two generations
represented, but also champions from both series. The elder
Earnhardt, fresh from last Sunday's DieHard 500 victory at
Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway, has won seven Winston Cup
championships, tying Richard Petty for the record.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr., defending champion of the California Busch race,
joined his father in the trophy room by claiming the Busch
championship last season. Dale Jr., who has raced brother Kerry in
Busch races this season, follows in the footsteps of father Dale
and his late grandfather, Ralph, one of NASCAR's pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jarrett family will also be well represented. Patriarch Ned
is best known for his television coverage. Son Dale will race in
both the Winston Cup and Busch events. Grandson Jason is scheduled
to compete in Saturday's feature race.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallace and Bodine families also will be out in force. Rusty
and Kenny Wallace are Winston Cup regulars. Rusty, who posted his
49th career win at Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway three weeks ago,
drives the No. 2 Miller Lite Ford entry; Kenny is in the No. 55
Square D Chevrolet. Mike Wallace, a regular in the Craftsman Truck
Series, will race in the Winston West event. He won the series
opener this year at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three Bodine brothers, who were involved in a family
dispute that attracted national attention, are Winston Cup
tourists. Brett is the driver-owner of the No. 11 Paychek Ford;
older brother Geoffrey is in the No. 60 Power Team Chevrolet. Todd
Bodine, youngest in the family, is a regular in the Busch series.
Although he'll be driving the No. 66 Phillips 76 Chevrolet for
Saturday's race, he won the inaugural California Busch race in July
1997 while driving the No. 36 Stanley Works car.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining four sets of brothers are all part of the Winston
Cup brigade. They are Darrell and Michael Waltrip; Terry and Bobby
Labonte; Jeff and Ward Burton; and crew chiefs Robin and Ryan
Pemberton.
</P>
<P>
   The Labonte and Burton brothers are pretty close in age, the
same can't be said for the Waltrips. At 52, Darrell (No. 39 Big
Kmart Ford) is 17 years older than Michael (No. 7 Philips Ford).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closer now than we've ever been. We weren't close at all
when he started,'' said Darrell, who won his first driving title
(1981) before Michael started in Winston Cup (1985). ``I was in my
prime at the time and trying to take care of my own career.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip has won 84 races in his career and three driving
championships. Michael is searching for his first victory in 403
career starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Labontes are seven years apart and a lot closer on the
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work together a little bit more than some guys,'' said
Terry, at 42, the oldest of Bob Labonte's sons. ``We actually get
along, not like some other brothers in this sport.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a swipe at the feuding Bodines, who have since
patched up their differences exposed during the first Brickyard 400
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Burtons staged a spirited duel in Las Vegas earlier this
year, but it was Jeff, 31, who outlasted Ward, 37, to claim the
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing has brought us closer,'' said Ward, who will drive the
No. 22 Pontiac for Bill Davis Racing. But he can recall a time when
they were too close, on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at South Boston. I had just moved up to late model
stock. I guess that was 1987, and Jeff had been there for a couple
of years,'' Ward said earlier this year. ``A guy named Bobby Moon
out of Lynchburg (Tenn.) was leading the race. I had been gaining
on him and was about to take the lead with 15 to go when a caution
came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff had caught up, he was running third. Once they threw the
green flag, we had run about one lap. Jeff had about six inches up
underneath me, and I came down and we both wrecked. To make a long
story short, once I got out of the car, I got him by the throat and
was picking him up in the air when I saw my dad coming. That's when
I got back to my pits.''

MAN'S LEGS ARE SEVERED AFTER BEING PUSHED IN FRONT OF SUBWAY TRAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, A group ..., to UPDATE with suspect being
charged with attempted murder.)

 By ANDREW JACOBS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In front of scores of horrified commuters, a man had
his legs severed Wednesday when he was pushed in front of an
oncoming subway train in a crowded midtown Manhattan station at the
height of the evening rush hour, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the victim appeared to have been randomly shoved
in front of an uptown No. 6 train in the 51st Street station, one
of the busiest in the subway system, at 5:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A group of passengers seized and held down the man accused in
the attack, Julio Perez, 43, who the police said is homeless and
might be mentally ill. Perez, who was being questioned Wednesday
night at a nearby precinct station house, was charged with
attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses on the platform said Perez had been acting
strangely moments before the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Edgar Rivera, 46, of the Bronx, was taken to
Bellevue Hospital Center, where doctors were trying to reattach his
legs Wednesday night. Rivera also suffered severe head wounds after
he was struck by the train, which witnesses said screeched to a
halt as he was sprawled on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Perez and Rivera did not know each other.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this year that a subway rider has been
pushed from a platform by a stranger. In January, Kendra Webdale, a
32-year-old receptionist, was killed after she was shoved in front
of a train at the 23rd Street station in the Chelsea section of
Manhattan. The police arrested Andrew Goldstein, who had been
undergoing treatment for schizophrenia. He is awaiting trial on
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's incident occurred as thousands of commuters
were pouring into the subway station; service on the uptown No. 6
line was suspended for two hours as police investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses said that the suspect's odd behavior was
especially disturbing because of the crowds of commuters on the
platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see people like that all the time in the subway, but
usually you can just move away,'' said Barbara Fisher, 48, an
insurance executive who was standing nearby. ``In this case, there
was nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said that when one man asked Perez to move away from
him, he became agitated. ``He punched the wall,'' said one witness,
a 40-year-old engineer from the Bronx who identified himself only
as Josh. ``Then he swung around and five seconds later he just
pushed this guy. I saw him lose his balance. He yelled `Oh my God,'
and then he fell.''
</P>
<P>
   With only seconds before the train's arrival, witnesses said
that Rivera crawled to the platform's edge and kneeled down with
his face to the wall and his legs draped over the tracks. Two cars
passed over Rivera, who was pulled from between the second and
third cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers said that Rivera's right leg was severed at
mid-thigh and the left below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who saw the first two cars of the train pass over
Rivera thought he could not possibly have survived, said Fire Capt.
Fred Ill, who was one of the first rescuers on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were reporting to us that he was dead,'' Ill said.
``But when I looked down between the two cars and shined the
flashlight down at him, his eyes opened up and he looked at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ill said it took three men to pull Rivera from between the cars
and up onto the platform. His legs, Ill said, ``were both just
laying there. It was tangled and mangled. It was a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ill said Rivera remained conscious but was unable to
speak during the rescue. ``I spoke to him but all he could do was
moan,'' Ill said. ``His eyes were aware, but I think he was really
going into shock.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Subway pushings are relatively rare, but the random nature of
the attacks represent the worst fears of commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the attack on Ms. Webdale, the most recent victim was a
50-year-old woman who was pushed to the tracks and injured in 1997
by a man who was apparently angry because he thought she had made
him miss his train.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a 20-year-old aspiring model from Brooklyn died after
being pushed in front of a train by a youth who was trying to mug
her. The year before, a 63-year-old woman was killed at Herald
Square when she was pushed in front of a train by a man who had
recently escaped from a state psychiatric center.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, as they were turned away from the entrance to
the station, commuters said they were shocked by another random
pushing so soon after the one that killed Ms. Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes you think twice about going into the subway,''
said Gaby Baxter, 35, a paralegal from Westchester County. ``As it
is, I am always afraid on the platform and I stand as close to the
wall as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Others complained that the Lexington Avenue line on which the
No. 6 train runs had become increasingly crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so chaotic that it makes nice people very nasty,'' said
Kevin Morrison, 30, a legal assistant who lives in the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn. ``It's gotten to the point that I'd rather
walk out of my way than take the Lex.''

METS BEAT PADRES, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The feeling of hitting a game-winning home run, Mike
Piazza said on Wednesday night after hitting one, is indescribable.
His came off Trevor Hoffman in the bottom of the ninth inning and
it gave the New York Mets an improbable 4-3 victory over the San
Diego Padres at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling,'' Piazza said after drilling a
first-pitch fastball into the bullpen in right field for a two-run
homer that turned a 3-2 deficit into a victory. ``You go deaf from
the crowd. And to see your teammates like that, it's a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for someone who had been struggling with his timing.
No wonder Piazza thrust both arms in the air as he ran up the
first-base line. And all he could see when he approached home plate
were white shirts. Rey Ordonez nearly tackled Piazza, who said he
emerged from the scrum with his shirt torn off.
</P>
<P>
   And the crowd of 22,581 left the stadium chanting team slogans
with glee.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Not only had the Mets won despite stranding 12 runners,
but they had also left at least two on in every inning from the
fourth inning on. And after Armando Benitez was finally charged
with his first runs of the season after nine scoreless appearances,
on came San Diego's ace closer, Hoffman, who saved 53 games in 54
chances last year. The Mets were staring at their fourth straight
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It had been nearly three years since the Padres had lost a game
they led after 8 innings. San Diego was 181-0 in such situations
since July 24, 1996, 85-0 last season, 7-0 this year. But Hoffman
is not so automatic anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things prior to this don't amount to a hill of beans
right now,'' said Hoffman, who allowed a single to John Olerud
through short one pitch before Piazza hit the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself fortunate,'' said Piazza, who is now 4 for
10 against Hoffman with 3 homers and 9 runs batted in. ``The worst
thing about it is that we have to come right back tomorrow. I wish
we had a few days to enjoy it. But hopefully it will get us
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The late heroics saved Al Leiter, who took a 2-1 lead into the
seventh that could very easily have been more.
</P>
<P>
   From the fourth through sixth innings, the Mets, who lead the
league in men left on base, left seven runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded in the fourth, Ordonez grounded into an
inning-ending double play that not even a head-first dive into
first base could prevent.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out in the fifth,
Olerud _ who had previously homered and singled _ sliced a fly to
left for the second out, and Piazza popped to first, swinging at
the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and one out in the sixth, Leiter took five
straight pitches and was called out on strikes, before Rickey
Henderson, like Piazza, popped to first on the first pitch that
they saw.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Mets were 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position
through six innings, the only productive hit being Edgardo
Alfonzo's shattered-bat double down the left field line that broke
a 1-1 tie in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Padres put runners on first and second with nobody
out in the seventh, Leiter probably wished his team had managed
something more from those wasted opportunities. And when Ruben
Rivera moved the runners to second and third with a ground out,
Leiter's chance to lose the lead increased.
</P>
<P>
   But the veteran left-hander bore down and struck out San Diego's
No. 8 hitter, Damian Jackson on a high fastball. Then, with Eric
Owens pinch-hitting for Sterling Hitchcock, Leiter induced Owens
into hitting a grounder to second, and now it was the Padre hitters
who were unable to cash in opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   It wound up costing them the game.

RESPONSE TO NEW L.A. SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN MIXED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A new policy that could strip some low-performing
Los Angeles schools of their administrative independence provoked
cautious support and anxious questions Wednesday among educators.
</P>
<P>
   Many wondered how the plan would work but few questioned its
underlying principle -- that schools should be responsible for
student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with being held accountable for student
performance. That's my job,'' said Earl Edward Barner, principal of
Los Angeles High School.
</P>
<P>
   Barner's is one of 30 schools citywide currently on academic
probation. Under a policy approved by the city's Board of Education
on Tuesday, those schools could lose their authority to make many
administrative decisions -- including personnel and spending
decisions -- if their students' Stanford 9 test scores don't
improve.
</P>
<P>
   Should even that step fail to boost scores, those schools could
face ``reconstitution,'' the takeover of the school by the
district.
</P>
<P>
   Olive Vista Middle School in Sylmar and Pacoima Elementary
School are the only San Fernando Valley schools listed by the
district as being on academic probation. The principal at Olive
Vista Middle School, Charles Baldwin, declined to talk about the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Gonzales, principal of Pacoima Elementary, said
Wednesday his school had recently been taken off probation, but
district officials said the school remains on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders expressed qualified support for the plan Wednesday
but wondered about the details. The policy approved Tuesday
contained only broad directives, they said.
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing with the plan's basic premise, Eli Brent, head of
the district's administrators union, said the district should first
give principals greater leeway to make changes at their schools
before administrative powers are taken away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to hold the principal responsible, which I
agree with, you have to give them the authority to do something
about it,'' Brent said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the district's teachers union, who had
threatened to file an unfair labor practice grievance over the

it had further discussed the plan with the district. Day Higuchi of

assessment teams that would go into failing schools and figure out
how to fix them.

A SNEAK PREVIEW OF `STAR WARS' TOYS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucasfilm is fending off reporters by the dozen. The Internet is
buzz ing with rumors. Fans are plotting to be first in line.
</P>
<P>
   And we aren't talking about the movie. Frighteningly, this is
just about the toys.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:01 a.m. Monday, the new Star Wars playthings will descend
upon the country with a nearly deaf ening marketing roar.
</P>
<P>
   The toys have been under security that rivals that of precious
jewels. The stolen pictures on the Internet aren't supposed to be
there, the toys for sale on eBay aren't supposed to exist yet, and
you're not supposed to know most of what we're going to tell you in
this article, either.
</P>
<P>
   As they work up to the national release of Star Wars: Episode I
_ The Phantom Menace on May 19, the folks at Lucasfilm want to keep
the mystique. And they want May 3 to be like Christmas for Star
Wars fans, rather than a day of disap pointment for spoilers who
opened their gifts early.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have been scared silent by rumors that if the goods
are dis played, advertised outside the store or even breathed on
before Monday, Lucasfilm and/or Hasbro, the chief manufacturer,
will withhold all fu ture shipments.
</P>
<P>
   But at 12:01 a.m. Monday, all mysteries will be revealed when
the store wars begin. Retailers across the country, including Toys
`R' Us stores in the Valley, are planning to take advantage of the
first minute of the first date the embargo is lifted. They can
unveil then, and only then, what the industry expects to be the
largest, and most successful, line of merchandise in the history of
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sneak peek, mostly due to two folks: local collector
Oliver Hirsch, who found a naughty Chan dler Kmart that sold toys
early, and Dallas Web junkie Philip Wise, who found his own Star
Wars toy manu facturing sources in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The big news: The toys can talk . . . to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro's new 3}-inch action fig ures feature COMMTECH technol
ogy. Each includes a microchip that, when paired with a COMMTECH
reader (sold separately for about $30), allows the figures to speak
up to four lines of dialogue from the movie with each other.
</P>
<P>
   The action figures, created by Hasbro, will cost about $7 each,
and there will be about 25 of them. They include characters unique
to Episode I: young Anakin Skywalker, new droids and the evil Darth
Maul. There will also be Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Master; Queen
Amidala, the leader of the good side; and Jar Jar Binks, a new
space creature ex pected to obtain a cult following a la Boba Fett.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be new and younger versions of old friends:
Obi-Wan Kenobi, a brassless C-3PO and even a Jabba the Hutt that
oozes slime.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm spokeswoman Jeanne Cole said the staff at Skywalker
Ranch, especially George Lucas himself, is having a heyday with the
talking figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recently had them all out at lunch, seeing what they
said,'' Cole said. ``He (George Lucas) thought they were great. He
has all the toys.''
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of vehicles is also on the way, including pod racers,
which play a big part in the movie; Trade Federation Droid
Fighters, the vehi cles of the evil side; and Queen Amidala's Royal
Starship, which will be about 4 feet long and cost $100.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a new conventional lightsaber, there will be a
double-bladed lightsaber (used by Darth Maul in the movie) that
will go for about $35.
</P>
<P>
   Lego will offer microprocessor-based droid-development kits that
allow kids to create functional, mov ing versions of R2-D2 and
other droids. There will also be a whole Lego line of Episode I
scenes and vehicles toy kits.
</P>
<P>
   Thinkaway Toys has created Star Wars piggy banks that feature
ani matronic technology. The banks will be topped by three figures
_ Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul _ who will come to
life at the drop of a coin, arguing and engaging in lightsaber
duels.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be card games, board games and video games,
in-line skates, bedding and fruit snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the original Star Wars toys released in 1977, these new
toys won't be hard to come by, though some stores will limit
customers looking to buy more than two of each toy. This is bad
news for col lectors, who won't be able to make fortunes off rare
toys, but good news for fans who want their share of the loot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a goal to keep our toys in stock,'' said Hasbro
spokeswoman Holly Ingram. ``We've tried to make our production
forecast meet what we think demand is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Wise, a 40-something Star Wars fan in Dallas, has had
pictures, prices and dimensions of the new toys up on the Fandom
Menace Web site (www.fandommenace.com) for weeks. Wise, like most
people who've landed unauthorized ad vance samples, got the toys
from a contact in Hong Kong, where they are produced. He logs more
than 22,000 hits per day from fans want ing to take a peek.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm's reaction to this Inter net phenomenon and to other
sites dedicated to spreading Episode I ru mors is not anger at
spoiling the surprise, as one might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to decide long ago that we would sit and watch it
with with wonder and amusement,'' Cole said. ``The people who crave
that information are our fans, and none of this excitement would be
there without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Webmaster Wise concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the stuff early has gotten a lot more excitement
going,'' he said. ``As much as Lucasfilm prob ably wishes (the
pictures) never showed up, I think it's created a lot of buzz for
them.'' &QL;

ARIZONA LAWMAKERS VOTE TO MOVE BACK PRIMARY DATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawmakers voted Wednesday to delay Arizona's 2000 presidential
primary by three weeks, a move opponents say is a blatant attempt
to help Sen. John McCain's campaign that would also reduce the
state's political clout nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal surfaced suddenly Wednesday in a hastily called
conference committee on an obscure bill relating to ballot stubs. A
McCain campaign aide, Wes Gullett, watched from the back row of
seats in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said Gullett had pushed the date changes for much of
the session. The bill still faces final votes in the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain could not be reached for comment, while campaign aides
ducked questions about the senator's position on the change.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is currently slated for Feb. 22, placing Arizona in
a strategic position just after early contests in Iowa and New
Hampshire but before critical tests for large numbers of delegates
March 7 in New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   The new date would be March 14, a day when six Southern states
are scheduled to hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Arizona would drop off the political map if the
date is pushed back into the heart of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once California goes, that's really the state in the West.
Obviously, Arizona wouldn't get as much attention from
candidates,'' said Bruce Merrill, an Arizona State University
pollster and professor of journalism. ``You're not going to get
near the interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the change, including Sen. Marc Spitzer, R-north
central Phoenix, said the date would allow more people to
participate in the primary because March 14 is one of four dates
for elections in Arizona, meaning more people would be aware of the
election.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a McCain representative defended the move to a
``Republic'' reporter in much the same language, saying the senator
favored moving the primary to a date that would be ``least
problematic for Arizona voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull also favors the switch.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were quick to accuse McCain of engineering the date
change, suggesting that a loss in Arizona would cripple his
campaign and that the senator doesn't want to expend resources
defending his own state.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls show that in Arizona McCain trails Texas
Gov. George W. Bush by as many as 8 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``(McCain) set his sights on California. He's willing to throw
Arizona overboard. It's absolutely wrong,'' said Sidney Hoff Hay, a
political consultant who is working for presidential contender Alan
Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said that he believes the winner of the California
primary will win the party's nomination. He has made repeated
visits there and plans a vigorous campaign in the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could our own senator sell out his state for his own
political ambitions? You ought to question whether that kind of
person should be leading this country,'' Hoff Hay said.
</P>
<P>
   Another opponent of the switch, Sen. Scott Bundgaard, said
moving the date would cause most candidates to ignore the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there's no competition from other candidates for John
McCain and his moderate ideas,'' said Bundgaard, R-Glendale.
Bundgaard is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very obvious this change is being made simply to
satisfy John McCain, and they are taking every step to ensure the
possibility that he's victorious in this state. By eliminating
competition, by moving the primary date, it enhances his chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, McCain was one of the people behind the early
primary date. McCain and former Gov. Fife Symington hoped that
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm would win the state, launching his bid for
the GOP nomination. But Gramm was gone by the primary after poor
finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, and billionaire publisher Steve
Forbes ran away with the race.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the date will be controversial with GOP party activists,
who voted in January to keep the date in February. Mike Minnaugh,
the state GOP chairman, said he stood by that vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's position was pretty clear in January,'' Minnaugh
said. ``If it goes into March, we'll still have a lot of
excitement, but not as many candidates here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodie Londen, a former state GOP chairwoman who helped in the
drive for the early date, called the move ``the dumbest thing we
could do.'' She said she understood why McCain wanted the primary
moved to after California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll win Arizona,'' said Londen, who is
supporting Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic state chairman Mark Fleisher said the primary
change had nothing to do with McCain's campaign. Democrats have
pushed the March date since 1996 because party rules forbid a
Democratic primary before the first Tuesday in March.
</P>
<P>
   They sat out the 1996 primary. Vice President Al Gore faces
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that has anything to do with it,'' Fleisher said
of the McCain campaign. ``We're the ones who pushed real hard not
to do it in February. It benefits us to have it on the 14th.''
</P>
<P>
   But rival GOP campaigns expressed concern that McCain was
rigging the process in his home state. Bert Coleman, Forbes'
Arizona campaign coordinator, called the change ``extremely
peculiar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, Steve Forbes will participate in the
Arizona primary regardless of when it is,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Dan Quayle had a similar response, saying the
for mer vice president ``just needs to know the date, and he'll be
here to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's fate is uncertain. Senate President Brenda Burns said
late Wednesday that she opposed the bill but would not block it if
a majority of Republicans favored it. Democrats will likely support
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support moving the primary. The position we have is
so good _ we're before California,'' Burns said, adding that she
supports McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that John McCain will lose Arizona.'' &QL;

JUSTICE DOESN'T RISE FROM ASHES
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fire gets our attention. All heat and light. But then the flames
subside and the smoke dissipates. The em bers cool. Ashes crumble
to dust and scatter in the wind. And we forget.
</P>
<P>
   The name Jermaine ``J.R.'' Miguel Jr. means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Just about a year ago, the little boy was in all the papers. He
was the first story on all the local TV broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Outside his grandparents' mobile home in Chandler, he came
across a couple of teenage boys making pools of lighter fluid on
the ground, then lighting them.
</P>
<P>
   The older boys would later say J.R. tripped on a barbecue grill
on which they were preparing to cook hot dogs, and his clothing
caught fire. But the story fell apart. The coals in the grill
weren't hot.
</P>
<P>
   What actually happened, investigators later said, is that one of
the boys taunt ingly dangled the 7-year-old over a pit of fire, and
dropped him.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. was burned over 60 percent of his body and spent most of
the next six months in the burn unit of Maricopa Medical Center.
Between then and now, J.R.'s mother, Lori Sumatzkuku, has lost
count of the number of operations her boy has been through.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't know how many times she's traveled between here and
Shriners Hospital in California, where J.R. has his surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   She tries hard not to remember the dark moments in the hospital
when the faces of nurses and doctors told her the tiny, bandaged
boy in the bed may not make it.
</P>
<P>
   DISRUPTED FAMILY LIFE
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this happened, we were a reg ular family with three
kids and jobs and a life that was like everybody's, you know?'' she
says. ``We don't know what that life is like anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   They've returned recently from Califor nia, where doctors had to
cut and stretch J.R.'s grafted skin, a procedure he'll go through
again and again, well into his 20s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to plastic surgeries. In addi tion to the looks. The
uncomfortable stares. The turned heads of those who can't bear to
look.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a wonderful boy,'' Lori says. ``But his life is going to
be hard. It is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the life of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Lori has had to give up her job as a secretary with the state of
Arizona. And, while the Shriners take care of the actual
operations, the expenses of caring for a burn victim are
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   The medication that kept J.R. alive, for instance, has caused
him to lose most of his hearing. According to Anna Nebel of the
non-profit Foundation for Burns and Trauma, each of the hearing
aids J.R. now needs costs more than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which can be reached at (602) 230-2041, is
accepting donations for J.R. and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of all they're already going through,'' Nebel says,
``this family must suffer through a justice system that doesn't
seem to take a crime like this se riously enough.''
</P>
<P>
   A YEAR IN A LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the boy who dropped J.R. into the fire
pleaded guilty to at tempted aggravated assault. Late last month,
he was sentenced to a year in jail, community service and
probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son got a life sentence of pain and suffering when the kid
who did this to him gets a year?'' Lori says. ``That's not right.
After that year, he will be fine, his life will be normal, and J.R.
will go for operation after operation. And have to deal with all
the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   She worries about her other children, who don't receive the
attention she used to give them, and which they deserve, be cause
of all she must do for J.R.
</P>
<P>
   She worries about her burned son's ability to overcome all he's
been through and lead a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   She worries that the same thing could happen to another family.
</P>
<P>
   She worries, because she understands that whatever heat and
light another newspaper article may bring to the trag edy of her
son, it won't last.
</P>
<P>
   The glow subsides. The warmth cools. The paper crumbles to dust
and scatters in the wind. And we ask, J.R. who? &QL;

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Bob Baffert entered Excellent Meeting in
Saturday's Kentucky Derby and Friday's all-female Kentucky Oaks.
But after pulling a lucky draw Wednesday for post position, he is
expected to let the big bay filly run for the roses.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Had he drawn unfavorably in the 20-horse field, the white-haired
trainer might have settled for the Oaks. But after securing the No.
6 position, Excellent Meeting probably will get her chance to be
the first filly since Winning Colors in 1988 to win America's most
famous horse race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been training her for the Derby,'' Baffert said. ``A lot
had to do with the draw. Right now I'd say she will run in the
Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Excellent Meeting has the same owner (John Mabee) and
trainer as General Challenge, the two will form a betting entry.
They became the morning-line favorite at 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's third horse, Prime Timber, is the second choice, by
himself, at 7-2. He probably would be the morning-line chalk if
Excellent Meeting, winner of five Grade I stakes, were not entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's training the best she's ever trained,'' Baffert
said. ``She loves this track; she's handling the turns really
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux, who could have ridden a talented colt, Aljabr,
in the Derby, accepted a ride on Excellent Meeting, whether in the
Derby or the Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pegram, owner of last year's Derby winner, Real Quiet, and
the champion juvenile filly, Silverbulletday, did not want the
latter running in what he called ``a 20-horse Roller Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   So Silverbulletday, who is also trained by Baffert, will race in
the 1-mile Oaks. ``At a mile and a quarter, Excellent Meeting is
the best horse in the country,'' Pegram said.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's draw, the connections of each horse chose their
own post positions after the order of selection was determined by
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero got first pick, and trainer Richard Mandella chose
No. 7 for a horse who likes to run a length or two off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Zito, choosing 11th for Adonis, surprised some observers by
taking the rail, with positions 2-11 already filled. The rail is
considered potentially troublesome, since a horse might get jammed
against it.
</P>
<P>
   But Zito explained: ``General Challenge hadn't selected yet; I
don't want to be near Baffert.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to stay away from two colts who are sometimes unruly
in the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert chose post 14 for Prime Timber, even though he could
have been closer in at 12 or 13. For General Challenge, Baffert
took post 15, which is the first slot in the auxiliary starting
gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Timber gets fidgety in the gate, so I took 14 so nobody
would be on his outside,'' Baffert said. ``General Challenge takes
a step or two to get in gear, and I wanted some open space for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert also preferred outside to inside, so his horses ``would
not have to be in the gate too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Nafzger, who drew 17th with Vicar, chose the 18th hole,
which allowed Wayne Lukas with the 18th pick to claim No. 17 for
Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be late loading, so I went with 18,'' Nafzger said.
``I don't think it matters much whether you're 17, 18 or 19. I
think we have enough speed to get right into the heat of it
early.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who put one of his horses, Cat Thief, in the 11th post,
said: ``Carl was generous enough to take one outside of us. We came
out better than I thought with the second horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of post position is always debated, but it
becomes more important the larger the field.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Eddie Plesa, who has the second post for Saturday,
scratched Three Ring out of the Florida Derby when he drew outside
position. ``If we had drawn the 2 post in the Florida Derby,'' he
said, ``we would have run in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring has morning-line odds of 20-1 but is considered the
second-best filly in the Derby. Excellent Meeting is the filly who
is feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's earned her way into the Derby,'' Baffert said. ``She's
good enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the other horsemen was disputing that contention.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
When the Rockets watched the less-than-entertaining film of last
week's game against Dallas, the problem was obvious.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The film was running, the Mavericks were running the Rockets
were not.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of the expected cakewalk over one of the NBA's
doormats, the Rockets walked around and got cake thrown in their
faces in a 109-95 loss at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called defensive intensity,'' Rockets guard Brent Price
said. ``It's just a matter of getting back (on defense), hustling
to make them make harder shots. They were getting easy shots _
layups, dunks and fast breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the games are won. If you establish yourself
defensively, and everyone runs back and matches up to take away
those easy baskets, they have to score in the half-court offense,
and it's a lot tougher for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not tough that night for the Mavs, who outscored the
Rockets 24-5 on fast-break points.
</P>
<P>
   There was a complete turnaround for the Rockets in their last
outing against the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday as they ran out to
an 18-0 halftime advantage on fast-break points and finished with a
26-4 edge in a 22-point win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem (against Dallas) was definitely team defense.
That's all it was,'' Rockets guard Cuttino Mobley said. ``We have
to come out and set the tone on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mobley ignited the Rockets with 12 points and a pair
of steals in the first quarter, when they built a 14-point lead on
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to do the same thing I did against LA,'' Mobley said.
``I need to continue it each game. We woke up. Now, we've just got
to go and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets believe the Mavericks caught them napping last week
and made them pay for it. But not only did the Rockets lack the
intensity needed to win, Dallas played one of its best games of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play like they did every night, you will have the best
record in the league,'' Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs, while far from being a playoff contender, have been
much better of late. With a win over Vancouver on Tuesday, Dallas
guaranteed itself its first winning season at home since 1989-90 _
the last time the Mavericks made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is 17-29 this season, with seven of those victories
coming in April. The Mavericks have wins this month over San
Antonio, Phoenix, Minnesota and the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguished the win over the Rockets was that it was the
lone victory of the bunch to come on the road. Dallas is one of the
league's weakest road teams, with a 3-19 mark away from Reunion
Arena. Only Denver (2-22) and Vancouver (1-22) are worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are the only team with a winning record that Dallas
has managed to beat on the road this season (the other two wins
were against the Warriors and Clippers), and the victory at Compaq
Center snapped an 11-game road losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it won't happen again; that better not happen
again,'' Rockets forward Charles Barkley said. ``Dallas just kicked
our butts last week. We really can't do anything about that. We
just have to come out ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets failed to do that the last time the Mavericks were
in town. Dallas scored 61 points in the first half _ the most the
Rockets have given up in the first two quarters all season _ and
shot a blistering 53 percent from the field for the game. This from
a team making 43.2 percent of its shots this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played well,'' Barkley said. ``They could have beaten
anybody that night.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some superlative performances from the Mavericks.
Rookie Dirk Nowitzki, who is shooting 40 percent and averaging 7.7
points, lit up the Rockets for 22 points on 10-of-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon and Scottie Pippen said the Rockets entered the game
with little respect for the Mavs' ability to pull off such a win
and were put in their place as a result.
</P>
<P>
   In this lockout-shortened season, teams can afford few such
lapses, and waiting for wake-up calls could prove costly.
Fortunately for the Rockets, the loss to the Mavs, which started a
three-game skid that included setbacks to the Clippers and Suns,
has not been extremely costly.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, who have five games left, remain in control of the
fourth playoff seed in the Western Conference, meaning they would
have the home-court advantage in a first-round postseason series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's not always a bad thing to have the rug pulled
from under your feet a little bit,'' Price said. ``Then you can
say, `Look, we need to focus on our internal problems and what
we're doing on the court as a team and not look ahead.' I don't
think you're going to see us _ at least I hope not _ taking any
team for granted after we got beat by Dallas and the Clippers.
Hopefully, that was an eye-opener for us, and we're not going to
let anything come back and bite us again like that.''
</P>
<P>
   If they paid attention to the film, the Rockets know that if
they see it coming, they had better start running.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A month has passed since the allied air forces of NATO members
began bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the intention of the Clinton administration and its
NATO allies to force the Serbian government to quickly end the
massacre of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the bombing so far has only
resulted in the exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have already suggested that the bombing will
continue well into the summer unless the Serbian government gives
in.
</P>
<P>
   Some people such as Henry A. Kissinger, who had criticized the
Rambouillet agreement as unsustainable, now unwillingly suggest
that NATO countries will have to introduce ground forces to settle
the Kosovo issue and maintain NATO credibility.
</P>
<P>
   He also warns that the disappearance of Serbia from the Balkan
equilibrium may risk a wider Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, there is a high likelihood that the war will drag
on much longer than anticipated until a sustainable political
solution is worked out and imposed.
</P>
<P>
   This prospect calls for an examination of the economic
implications of the Balkan crisis if a sustainable political and
military solution requires substantial economic resources from the
United States and its NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, wars and business cycles have been very closely
interrelated.
</P>
<P>
   The downward phases of business cycles have caused economic
dislocation of peoples and ruptures within society. In particular,
in the downward phase of a long business cycle, or the period known
as depression years, economic dislocation has been severe enough to
cause ruptures and ultimately wars between nations and states.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century depression years (1873-1895) coincided with the
rapid colonization of Asia and Africa by European powers to gain
``markets'' for their surplus products and secure a supply of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the United States as latecomers followed the European
powers to claim their shares of the pie in Asia around the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate consequence of the rivalry among the great powers
was World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th-century Great Depression of the 1930s led to exclusive
economic blocs by the British and the French, as well as Germany's
pursuit of the Lebensraum (political and economic expansion) and
Japan's Great Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate consequence was the unprecedented devastation of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. economy, far from the war front, could emerge
from the Great Depression because of wartime demand, its citizens
were obliged to shed their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Wars have turned economic depressions and deflation into booms
and inflation, or have solved economic depressions in a brutal way.
</P>
<P>
   The victor and the bystander (or the neutral) have gained
economically. And the defeated countries have often suffered
economic devastation and hyperinflation: Germany after the two
world wars and Japan after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, wars fought during the upward phase of
business cycles had quite different economic implications.
</P>
<P>
   A typical example is the Vietnam War. For the first half of the
1960s preceding the escalation of the war, the U.S. economy was
booming, with an unemployment rate of just around 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mobilization of more economic resources for the
escalating war in the second half of the 1960s, the Johnson
administration, which had campaigned for the ``Great Society,''
sought a policy of guns and butter at the same time. The shortage
of economic resources was filled by increasing imports in exchange
for paper dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of such a policy were the sharp deterioration
of the U.S. external balance of payments and the abandonment of the
gold standard by the Nixon administration in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying more paper dollars to finance the Vietnam War was the
root cause of the escalation of worldwide inflation in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike during the Persian Gulf War period (1990-1991) when the
U.S. economy was in recession, the U.S. economy for almost a decade
has been near full employment with record high stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   This record boom, however, has also resulted in a sharp
deterioration of U.S. external balance of payments, or a record
level of external deficits. In short, the boom has been financed by
huge borrowing from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the economic crisis in the rest of the world for the
past two years, especially in Asia, Latin America and Russia, has
helped prolong U.S. growth with subdued inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The depreciation of currencies in economically depressed regions
has worked to provide the U.S. economy with imports at much cheaper
prices than before.
</P>
<P>
   The unstable European political situation has already resulted
in a sharp weakness of the euro against the dollar. It will work
further to widen the external imbalance of the U.S. economy and the
exodus of capital from Europe to the United States to push up the
New York stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of much cheaper imports, however, will be detrimental
to the earnings of U.S. corporations in the home market. The rising
stock prices and subdued corporate earnings will be an incompatible
proposition before long.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Yugoslavia, if escalated into a muddy ground battle,
will be a very costly proposition for the U.S. economy already
working at full capacity, not to mention the cost to reconstruct
the afflicted region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, policymakers and investors worldwide need to keep a
close watch on the development in the Balkans. An escalation of the
war in the region could be the last straw for the U.S. economy,
which appears to have been overstretched for some time. &QL;

DODGERS BEAT BREWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Chan Ho Park is revered in his native Korea, where
his popularity equals, if not exceeds, that of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   He can do nothing about that pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Park is also pitching for a contract. He won't be eligible for
free agency until after the 2001 season, but the Los Angeles
Dodgers wish to lock him into a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   He's alleviated that pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Park said he won't sign a contract during the
season. Two days ago his agent told the Dodgers he wouldn't even
discuss a contract until the season ends. And after leading the
Dodgers to a 3-2 win Wednesday against the Milwaukee Brewers, Park
admitted a burden was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Park (2-2) bounced back from his last start, in which he was
shelled for 11 runs, to pitch 62/3 innings of two-run ball. He also
delivered a two-run double in the sixth inning off loser Steve
Woodard (2-2) to provide the tying and winning runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The contract) was bothering me because I was trying to show
them I was good, but it was wrong,'' Park said. ``I still thought
about it a little bit, but I don't get pressure from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Park will earn $2.3 million this season and is eligible for
salary arbitration in November and after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers offered Park a four-year, $20 million deal during
the offseason, but it was refused. Park and agent Steve Kim are
seeking a four- or five-year deal worth approximately $30 to $36
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to wait until after the season to talk,'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``We still want to do something
long-term with Chan Ho. We want him to have a big year.''
</P>
<P>
   Park said he wants to remain with the Dodgers, and with
negotiations in the past _ and future _ he looked more like his old
self, challenging hitters inside and aggressively using his
fastball. He allowed an RBI single to Jeromy Burnitz in the first
and consecutive doubles to Marquis Grissom and Geoff Jenkins in the
second, and shut the Brewers down the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield, ejected in the ninth for
arguing a strike call, had an RBI single in the third before Park
defied the Dodgers' modus operandi and delivered a hit with a
runner in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   After catcher Todd Hundley was intentionally walked for the
second consecutive time, Park hit Woodard's 1-0 fastball off the
wall in center field to score Raul Mondesi and Hundley and give the
Dodgers a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for (Park)'s bat,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``I know he was fighting himself a little early. He gave us
just what we needed. We needed him to get him his confidence again.
I needed for him to give me about seven innings. He was more free.
Everything was sharper, in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (11-10) won back-to-back games for the first time
since April 9 and 10, and the formula was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous day, Milwaukee took an early 2-1 lead and the
Dodgers scored twice in the sixth to go ahead 3-2. And for the
second consecutive day the Dodgers used a left-hander out of the
bullpen to record the last out of the seventh inning _ Onan Masaoka
this time _ had Alan Mills pitch the eighth and used Jeff Shaw in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spring training, when you looked at it, that was the
blueprint,'' Shaw said after recording his sixth save. ``Use the
left-handers to get to Mills to get to me.''

<P>
   When I attended an international conference at a Sydney hotel, I
noticed a big blackboard in the lobby that listed the flights
between Tokyo's Kansai International Airport and Sydney. The list
was in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese receptionist who was sitting in front of the
blackboard told me that the sign was for three Japanese couples
from the Kansai area who were holding wedding ceremonies in Sydney.
It was also there to help Japanese guests in the wedding parties.
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist said the brides and grooms were accompanied by
their parents, relatives and close friends in the package tour from
Japan. The flight to Australia takes nearly 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the couples are having weddings in Australia. Isn't that a
bit extravagant?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that some foreigners who see such people question
whether Japan is really undergoing a recession,'' she said. ``But
it costs less to have weddings here than in Japan because you have
far fewer guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it's much less troublesome to have overseas
weddings,'' she said. Dropping the sound of her voice, she offered
the following explanation:
</P>
<P>
   In Japanese weddings, newlyweds usually are obliged to invite
their superiors at work even when they are uncertain about whether
it would cause their bosses problems. When they invite their
colleagues, they rack their brains over who to invite.
</P>
<P>
   But if they hold weddings abroad, they don't have to worry about
such matters. All they have to do is ask to be pardoned since
they're getting married in a faraway place.
</P>
<P>
   Getting away from worldly trouble. That makes sense, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   The woman lowered her voice again and said: ``Before, lifetime
employment was nothing special. But now, you never know when you'll
lose your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, indeed. I found her logic convincing.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation intrigued me and led me to call the tourism
bureau of the Australian government to find out more.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official in charge, Australia is now the second
largest market for overseas weddings next to Hawaii. Since it is a
promising area, the tourism office is putting a great deal of
effort into luring foreign couples, the official said. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The official also suggested that the recent surge in overseas
weddings may have to do with the Japanese trend of holding simple
wedding ceremonies. Overseas weddings seem to be an economical
alternative to elaborate domestic weddings, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the official said that Australia has seen a sharp
drop in the number of churchgoers in recent years and many churches
now stand virtually idle. That is why they welcome large numbers of
Japanese couples for church weddings, the official said.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While explaining the situation, the official repeatedly
mentioned the name Watabe, which prompted me to call Takao Watabe,
president of Watabe Wedding Corp., a Kyoto-based wedding service.
</P>
<P>
   The company triggered the trend for overseas weddings when it
started organizing them on a commercial basis 26 years ago.
Currently, it boasts a 60-percent share of the world market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overseas weddings are not a phenomenon unique to Japan,''
Watabe said. ``It is a global trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 20,000 German couples tie the knot in Las Vegas
every year,'' he claims. ``The Swiss go to Jamaica and the British
go to Disney World in Florida to get married. The trend is
spreading. The reason is the same anywhere in the world: Couples
don't want to be fettered by obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Britain, more than 10 percent of all newlyweds are holding
overseas ceremonies,'' Watabe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, the national average is 6 percent. In Tokyo, Osaka
and other urban areas, the percentage tops 10. I expect the
percentage to eventually hit 30 in Japan as well as in the United
States and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Watabe's latest venture is overseas wedding tours targeted at
Chinese couples that he started organizing last spring. According
to Watabe, Bangkok is a favorite destination among Chinese brides
and grooms from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``China lifted the embargo on overseas travel for the general
public,'' he said. ``Since the population is so large, I wish to
attract as many couples as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, there will be fewer weddings starting in 2002 to
2003 because of a decline in the younger population. That's why
global business development is needed,'' he said. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, very few foreigners come to Japan to hold weddings.
</P>
<P>
   ``With such high prices, Japanese weddings are unaffordable,''
Watabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the price of Japanese weddings went down nearly 40
percent from the peak of the asset-inflated economy, it is still
double the average of U.S. weddings, according to Watabe. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Globalization gives people a much wider selection to choose from
in any given area. The process of making a choice also allows
people to make decisions about economic obstacles in the form of
market barriers and also social restrictions such as local custom. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Overseas weddings promoted price destruction of domestic
weddings and changed stereotyped wedding receptions. They are also
about to change the wedding culture itself.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered the following words of the receptionist at the
hotel lobby: ``The relatives accompanying the newlyweds say that
the trip gives people who hardly exchanged words before a chance to
get to know each other better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some couples seem happy that they were able to play golf
together day after day after a long time. They seem to be enjoying
themselves.'' &QL;

DODGERS STILL SEARCHING FOR PRODUCTIVE NO. 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Mark Grudzielanek failed to lay down a bunt and in
frustration pulverized a batting helmet Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did it symbolize Grudzielanek's frustration through the
first month of the season, but also the Los Angeles Dodgers'
inability to find a No. 2 hitter _ a crucial element in manager
Davey Johnson's grand lineup plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing you have a four-year veteran in the two-hole who
isn't more selective,'' Johnson said. ``We're talking about Grud,
but there's a lot of people you could talk about, being more
selective. Grud hit a lot of second in Montreal, to my
recollection, but obviously he's doesn't even get (good) balls to
bunt at.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, Devon White, Jose Vizcaino and Todd Hundley have
all been given opportunities in the second spot, where patience is
paramount to success. The No. 2 spot has produced a .202 average.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek is hitting .308 and has a .400 on-base mark while
hitting second, but he's been swinging at pitches early in the
count and not allowing leadoff hitter Eric Young, who leads the
majors in stolen bases, a chance to steal.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's been asked to bunt on a few occasions, Grudzielanek
has yet to be successful on a sacrifice attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this club I think that's where I fit best because I can
hit, and I can hit the other way,'' said Grudzielanek, who batted
seventh Wednesday against Milwaukee. ``One thing I've been lacking
in the two-hole is I failed to get the bunt down. If I can't bunt,
I just have to find another way to get the man over.''
</P>
<P>
   While Grudzielanek has faltered, neither White (3 for 30),
Vizcaino (6 for 21) or Hundley (0 for 9) have provided answers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield ejected: Left fielder Gary Sheffield was ejected in
the top of the ninth by a chuckling Eric Gregg after being
displeased about a called third strike. Sheffield said it wasn't an
isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he's back there he punches me out (on strikes),''
said Sheffield, who was 2 for 5 with an RBI. ``Some umpires you
know what he's going to call a strike and what he's going to call a
ball... I said, `That ball was down and you know it.' He said,
`Don't say anything.' I felt, `What, we can't talk to the umpires
now?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Gregg has had an inconsistent, and wide, strike
zone. Sheffield was on the field when Florida's Livan Hernandez
struck out 16 Atlanta Braves during the 1997 playoffs. Greg Maddux
struck out 10 in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   The farm report: While Johnson molds the bullpen at the
major-league level, the Dodgers' brass keeps an eye on Single-A San
Bernardino and right-handed relievers Antonio Osuna and Mike
Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Both pitched Tuesday against Lake Elsinore and both had success.
Osuna (elbow bone spur) gave up one hit and struck out five in two
scoreless innings. Maddux, who signed a minor-league contract with
the Dodgers last week, pitched the ninth inning and recorded a save
by retiring the side in order.
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: Third baseman Adrian Beltre had the game off to
rest his bruised knee. Jose Vizcaino started at third.... Johnson
said catcher Todd Hundley would have today off and Paul LoDuca
would start.... Brewers second baseman Fernando Vina was suspended
by the National League for two games for an incident in an April 23
game against Pittsburgh. Vina argued a strike call and while
pointing at an umpire made contact. But Vina appealed the decision
and was in Wednesday's lineup.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AFTER one inning Wednesday night, it seemed clear the Astros had
erred.
</P>
<P>
   What, we asked ourselves, was Chris Holt doing in the starting
rotation? And why in the world was Scott Elarton languishing in the
bullpen?
</P>
<P>
   To the untrained eye, Holt had thrown like a dolt, allowing the
Diamondbacks to bat around while taking a 3-0 lead. The five hits
and one walk added to the eight hits and two walks he surrendered
in his previous start, an aborted one of 4 innings in Cincinnati,
did not a pretty picture paint.
</P>
<P>
   You do the math please. Those kind of numbers terrify me.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there sat Elarton, a picture of calm and confidence
on the bench. The Ordained One who was deemed untouchable even for
Roger Clemens was in possession of a zero-point-zero-zero ERA and a
2-0 record through six appearances. He was busily attempting to
make a mockery of the spring training decision to relegate him to
middle-relief Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   He was still miffed, to be sure, but he was no longer
verbalizing his disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Which is good because the debate became a great deal more
clouded as the long evening wore on (and on and on). Holt's
deceptively disappointing first inning was followed by five
perfectly commendable innings _ two hits allowed, no runs _ and the
Astros rewarded him for his diligence and resilience by claiming a
5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-3 lead that Elarton promptly blew in the time it took him to
pitch to four batters. Single, single, sacrifice, double: Arizona
5, Houston 5. Just like that, a reality check for the (soon-to-be)
Great Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, for his part, remains winless at 0-3 after losing all of
last year to shoulder surgery. But his ability to personally stave
off catastrophe against the Arizonans ensured he won't get yanked
from the rotation any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   He has proved deserving of our patience for as long as he keeps
his wits about him because, medically, his arm is fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pain, none at all,'' he insisted. ``They don't have me on
any kind of pitch count. I could have stayed in the game. But he
(manager Larry Dierker)'s the boss. I don't question his
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dierker: ``I liked Chris' stuff, even in the first inning.
He could very easily have escaped it without giving up a run. If
he's happy with the way he pitched, then I'm happy, too. We've just
got to take him from throwing the ball well to getting a few wins
under his belt. The only thing that would concern me is his
becoming frustrated with his record.''
</P>
<P>
   It could happen. Holt admits he retired to the clubhouse after
the first inning and let a bit of steam off. He raised enough Cain,
in fact, to draw the attention of Craig Biggio and Mike Hampton all
the way back in the dugout. Both came to pay him a consoling visit,
if for no other reason than to ensure he didn't destroy their
lockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Biggio) reminded me it's a nine-inning game,'' Holt said,
``and Hampy told me, `Hey, dude, it's OK. This team can score some
runs for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was right on about the runs. He was wrong, however,
about the worrying part, although Holt was taken off the hook at
the end. For a guy with an 8-16 major-league record, there are
worse things than a no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, to be fair, didn't do himself any damage, either. It's
not like anybody really expected him to post a 0.00 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Billy Wagner, although he had trained us to assume a
disaster of Wednesday's force-five magnitude shouldn't be possible.
Yes, ultimately, Billy the Kid took the loss with a capital,
bold-faced ``L,'' glumly watching his also previously pristine ERA
go from nada to a lotta _ 6.43 _ in a ninth inning that was every
bit as dreadful as it looked.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Holt's first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy got behind the hitters,'' Dierker said, ``and had to
bring the ball over the middle of the plate. You know what can
happen when you do that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, once again, the Diamondbacks batted around. Wagner never
could get an out, much less get out of the inning. The five
visiting Snakes he faced stung him with either a hit or a walk, and
by the time the carnage was complete all scored. The Astros were in
a 10-5 hole that looked more like a bottomless pit.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crowd of 19,605 had fled before the Astros added a
meaningless sixth run in the bottom of the ninth. Those who stayed
did so mostly to boo and hiss.
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros were blown out in a game in which they socked
three home runs over one span of five at-bats. There was not a bit
of relief to be found on the pitching staff this sad night. I won't
upset you any further by providing the particulars of Jay Powell's
mop-up mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good bullpen,'' Holt argued. ``There's nothing wrong
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably magnanimous attitude under the circumstances.

YANKEES BOW TO RANGERS, 8-6 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Don Zimmer has maintained all along that he
never wanted to manage the New York Yankees, that he is doing so
only because Joe Torre, a close friend, asked him to take over. He
must have been wondering on Wednesday night if it is worth the
aggravation, after an 8-6 loss to Texas and an unhappy exchange
with a coach that prompted a post-game team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat snapped the Yankees' six-game winning streak, but
even so, the Yankees are 13-6 under Zimmer; with Torre recovering
from prostate cancer surgery and close to returning to the dugout
as manager, Zimmer is on the verge of completing his goal of
delivering the Yankees back into the hands of Torre with a record
reflective of their talent.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer's aggravation might have provided a foundation for what
occurred on Wednesday evening. At some point during the loss,
Zimmer and Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' first-base coach, engaged in
an angry exchange.
</P>
<P>
   it is not known exactly what spurred the incident, but Zimmer
has been adamant about taking charge of the club, through Torre's
authority; any comment questioning a move or strategy would not
have been received well.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees relievers Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson blew a 4-3
lead in the bottom of the seventh inning, allowing five runs in the
bottom half of the inning, and a late rally fell short. Zimmer
typically addresses members of the news media almost as soon as he
returns to the manager's office, but on Wednesday night, reporters
waited some 15 minutes. Inside, Zimmer held a team meeting,
speaking to the team as a whole, but others said he also seemed to
be addressing the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting ended and reporters were allowed into the room,
clusters of players spoke in whispers; Paul O'Neill, Derek Jeter
and Chuck Knoblauch talked quietly, as did the catcher Joe Girardi
and Chad Curtis. Zimmer spoke to reporters without ever letting on
about the team meeting, or the exchange with his coach, but after
reporters departed, players intermittently ducked into Zimmer's
office and closed the door _ O'Neill, and then Jeter, who both like
Zimmer very much as a person and most likely offered him support.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, Zimmer sat in the office alone, his legs propped
up on the desk, silently looking off in the distance, and he would
not discuss what took place in the meeting, which left some players
somewhat astounded and confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our business,'' he said. ``As I say, if we wanted you
in, we would've invited you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmer's tenure as interim manager has been fraught with
pain and frustration. His right knee, which required surgery in
March and forced him to undergo constant treatment, has hobbled
him; with his pain growing acute in recent days, Zimmer spoke of
possibly undergoing knee replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer scrapped with George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal
owner, at the end of spring training about what role pitcher Hideki
Irabu should assume, and on Wednesday, Zimmer suggested to
reporters that he would have no input into who would be taken off
the roster once third baseman Scott Brosius is activated off the
15-day disabled list on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer may be nearing the end of his career, in his 51st year in
baseball. He acknowledges that he is in constant pain, and that if
his pain doesn't dissipate, Zimmer has said he may walk away from
the game for treatment. Torre could be back as manager as soon as
this weekend, but perhaps not until next week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Yankees led by 4-1, after scoring three
runs in the top of the fifth inning. But in the bottom of the
fifth, a strained left quadriceps began to bother Orlando
Hernandez, the Yankees' starter, and he had to come out after the
sixth inning, with a 4-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton was summoned to start the seventh inning, and Lee
Stevens fought off an inside fastball and blooped a single to left.
Royce Clayton followed with a hit, Stevens taking third; Stanton
grimaced, disgusted. The right-handed-hitting Roberto Kelly
pinch-hit for Tom Goodwin, but with the switch-hitting Mark
McLemore and the left-handed-hitting Rusty Greer due to bat, Zimmer
decided to stick with Stanton, his only left-handed reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly laced a run-scoring double, tying the scire and sending
the possible go-ahead run to third. The Yankees' infield moved in,
and the Texas runners had to hold when McLemore grounded out. But
Stanton fell behind Greer three balls and no strikes, and Zimmer
ordered an intentional walk, filling the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson then replaced Stanton to face Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to the fact that I'd rather take a chance with
Nelson pitching and the big guy hitting,'' Zimmer said, referring
to Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers' right fielder slammed a two-run single and Todd
Zeile doubled home two more runs, giving the Rangers a four-run
cushion, and the Yankees more reason to believe their bullpen will
need help before the start of the playoffs.

COWBOYS' SANDERS LIKELY OUT 4-6 MONTHS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Deion Sanders underwent surgery Wednesday on his injured left
big toe and is expected to begin an aggressive, four- to six-month
period of rehabilitation in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he wasn't prepared to
speculate on when Sanders will return, but said the All-Pro
cornerback might miss all of training camp and perhaps the start of
the season. Jones also said the injury will preclude Sanders from
playing wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to prepare our team like Deion is not going to be
there,'' Jones said. ``It's what we did when Deion was playing
baseball when we signed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are going to do is not speculate in any way where he
is medically as we start the season. Consequently, to be sound, we
have to prepare ourselves not to have Deion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Hamilton performed the surgery in New York City,
described Sanders' injury as a ``rare and unusual variation of turf
toe,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, suffered in the first quarter of the Cowboys' 35-28
victory against the Arizona Cardinals on Nov. 15, interrupted
perhaps Sanders' finest NFL season. After a brief appearance the
next week against Seattle, Sanders missed the remaining five
regular-season games before returning to play in the playoff loss
to Arizona on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, expected in Dallas this afternoon, played extensively
in the Pro Bowl on defense and as a punt returner. Sanders and
Jones came under scrutiny because Sanders took part in the game,
but Jones said Sanders did not worsen the injury by playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing we have seen, or from any indication from his doctors
or from the surgery showed additional injury,'' Jones said. ``He
was in rigorous exercise before the surgery, as an alternative to
the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Hamilton) said the thing giving Deion the problem was the
initial injury. Nothing he saw Deion do in the postseason or in
rehab impacted the need to have the surgery today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders injury _ known medically as a hyperdorsal flexion of the
first metatarsal joint _ is to the volar plate in his left big toe.
The volar plate is under the sesamoid bone; there was a tear of the
tissue inside the medial sesamoid bone.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also did not speculate about Sanders' future with the
Cowboys. Sanders' contract expires after the 1999 season. In the
past, Jones has adamantly expressed his vision of seeing Sanders in
a Cowboys uniform for the remainder of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be inappropriate and we don't have the information to
speculate how this might affect our plans now or later on in the
season contractually,'' Jones said. NEWTON LIKELY GONE
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys offensive lineman Nate Newton has likely played his
final game with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drafted two offensive linemen as well as free-agent
lineman. We are looking fundamentally where we are at on the
offensive line,'' Jones said. ``Right now, we have decided, and we
explained to Nate, we will be going into quarterback school and
training camp without Nate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are scheduled to begin quarterback school tomorrow.
Jones did not rule out a possible return by Newton in some
capacity, but said he is giving Newton, 37, every opportunity to
pursue free-agent offers during the off-season. nn

CLAYTON DONATES $100,000 FOR SCHOLARSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For much of his life, Royce Clayton has been
well aware of the sacrifices made for him and others like him to
play baseball; from the humble beginnings of the Negro leagues to
Jackie Robinson's historic journey across the color line.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, it was Clayton making a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers shortstop announced that he will make a
$100,000 donation for an endowed college scholarship through the
Jackie Robinson Foundation. Clayton is the first active baseball
player to endow a college scholarship with the organization named
after Robinson, who became the major leagues' first black baseball
player in 1947 when he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you know about Jackie's life, the more you are
inspired by his strength, determination and courage in the face of
racism,'' Clayton said before the Rangers-Yankees game last night.
``African-American ballplayers have the opportunity to play in
major-league baseball because of him, and I believe the best way we
can continue to honor his life is to give opportunities to
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those on hand to announce the endowment were Robinson's
widow, Rachel Robinson, who founded the nonprofit foundation in
1973; Clayton's parents; and the first recipient of the endowment,
Antoine Brown, a 19-year-old Chicago native who plans to major in
computer science at Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Clayton's first venture into public service. He has
established a foundation in his hometown of Los Angeles to benefit
sickle cell disease patients.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton's involvement with the Jackie Robinson Foundation began
in 1998 after he had a two-hour meeting with Rachel Robinson in New
York City. Clayton talked about his fondness for Jackie Robinson's
contributions to the game, and about how Clayton might make a
difference in his era.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is totally dedicated to the idea'' of the endowment, Rachel
Robinson said of Clayton. ``The idea of giving back in this way was
nothing new for him. He was just looking for a vehicle in which to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Toni Clayton, Royce Clayton's mother: ``I'm glad he
understands about giving back, and sharing what he has with others.
It makes you feel proud that the lessons you taught in life have
stuck.'' nn

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The hits just kept on coming to the tune of one of the Astros'
worst-pitched games of the season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks provided the beat with their relentless
bats, which blended harmonically Wednesday night with the
persistent booing of a small but vocal gathering of 19,605 at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' bullpen gave up its first blown save of the season,
turning a two-run lead into a five-run deficit in a span of three
innings. When the music finally stopped, the Astros found
themselves on the wrong end of a 10-6 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks third baseman Matt Williams atoned for a
career-worst three-error game by breaking a 5-5 tie with a
bases-loaded single off Billy Wagner in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect anyone to stand up and applaud when I pitch
like that,'' said Wagner, who allowed five runs on three hits and
two walks while failing to record an out.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Wagner allowed more than three runs in an
outing in his career and only the second time he failed to record
an out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was bad,'' he said. ``It was just one of those nights
when things didn't work out. You can't expect to do it every time,
but the way I get paid, I should be able to do it every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who also walked in a run with the bases loaded, had a
streak of seven scoreless innings before Williams' clutch hit. But
Wagner wasn't the only Astros reliever to say goodbye to a streak.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton watched his streak of 11 shutout innings fall by
the wayside, blowing a 5-3 lead for starter Chris Holt in the
process. The Diamondbacks scored seven runs on six hits off the
Astros' two hottest relievers. The three hits Wagner (0-1) allowed
in the ninth matched the total number against him for the season
prior to Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holtie needed to get that win, and I wanted to hold the lead
for him,'' Elarton said. ``I just didn't do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's 10 runs and 14 hits were the most the Astros have
allowed in a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``I
thought we were pretty much in the driver's seat with a 5-3 lead
and Scott and Billy being fresh. They're human; they're going to
have games when they don't pitch so well.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Holt was headed for one of those games after the
first inning, when the chances of his lasting six innings seemed
about as good as the Titanic's making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks sank their teeth into Holt, scoring runs on
Luis Gonzalez's bloop double and a pair of singles by Travis Lee
and Tony Batista. Holt was ripped for five hits in the inning, but
the damage could have been much worse. He induced a groundout from
Diamondbacks pitcher Andy Benes to escape the inning with the bases
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to do a better job in the first inning,'' Holt said.
``I have to treat it like it's the middle innings.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much set the tone for Holt's next two innings, when
he danced effortlessly around one-out doubles in the second and
third. He didn't allow a hit over his next three innings, and the
only other batter who reached base against him did so on an error.
Unfortunately for Holt, his rebound was wasted in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little frustrating, because I knew I had good stuff,''
Holt said. ``I felt fortunate to go six innings, and we were still
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' fourth set of back-to-back home runs this season
tied the score in the third inning. Holt drew a leadoff walk and
strolled home on Derek Bell's line-drive homer to left-center. Jeff
Bagwell followed with his team-leading sixth home run. Bill Spiers
put the Astros on top with a solo homer in the fourth, and Paul
Bako's sixth-inning sacrifice fly gave the Astros a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers' home run marked the fourth time the Astros have hit
three homers in a game this season. The Astros have not gone
consecutive games without a home run since April 7-8. They have
homered in 13 of their last 17 games, with multiple home runs in
eight games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Wednesday's home-run derby couldn't have been
possible without the Diamondbacks, who have allowed 31
round-trippers _ the second-highest total in the National League.
Benes, who served up all three of Wednesday's homers, has
surrendered an NL-high nine home runs. He allowed only two other
hits against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who extended his hitting streak to 14 games, tied the
score in the seventh with a two-run, one-out double off Elarton,
and the score remained locked until Williams' hit off Wagner in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw me a slider, and I snuck it through,'' Williams said.
``I was just trying to make contact. He was running it up there
pretty good.''

VAUGHN NOT ONE TO HIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Only minutes after Tuesday's 10-1 loss to the
Blue Jays, many of the Anaheim Angels players were dressed and out
the door. By the time reporters were let into the clubhouse, it was
quiet and nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   However, one Angel stayed around late.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn stayed and talked. And talked. With coaches and
teammates. At one point, he went into manager Terry Collins' office
and held court with Collins, general manager Bill Bavasi, assistant
GM Ken Forsch and communications director Tim Mead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in, sat down and we talked about the game,'' Collins
said. ``He's a baseball player. It's easy to sit around and talk
about the game when you win. It's different when you lose. Most
guys get out of here as fast as they can after a game like that.
Not Mo. That's why he's so great.''
</P>
<P>
   No screaming: Collins said Tuesday's game was the worst a team
he has managed in the big leagues has ever played. That includes
three seasons with the Houston Astros and two with the Angels
before this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins didn't yell and scream at his team after the game,
which saw the Angels make numerous mental errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sit down and have me lecture after a game like that is
pointless,'' he said. ``Because we don't have those often.... I got
that one over with, put that baby away. About two hours ago. It
stuck in my craw for a while. But I wrote (Wednesday's) lineup,
talked to my friendly coaching staff and got ready for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's game, Vaughn met with third baseman Troy
Glaus, who botched a rundown play in Tuesday's game. Collins,
though, said he found no reason to ask Glaus what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's 22 years old,'' Collins said. ``He made a mistake.
He'll be fine. Those things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, recovering from surgery
on his broken left forearm, is doing exercises to increase mobility
and flexibility in his arm, which include light weights and therapy
in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins doesn't keep up with DiSarcina's progress. It takes
too much out of him, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gary and the doctor and the trainer come in my office and
say he's ready to play, the next day he'll be in the lineup,'' he
said. ``Who knows when that will be? It might not be until
!ital!next!off! June. I'm done building up my hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina is expected back around the All-Star break.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn sauntered up to Anaheim Angels
manager Terry Collins during batting practice late Wednesday
afternoon and told him the time has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be good to go for the Chicago series,'' Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who has been the DH since returning from the disabled
list April 22, has determined his sprained left ankle is healthy
enough to allow him to return to first base by Friday when the
Angels begin a four-game series against the White Sox. Collins
urged Vaughn to wait and see how it feels then, preferring Vaughn
not rush to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vaughn showed again Wednesday that his batting stroke
is healthy, hitting his second and third home runs of the year _
the second in the eighth inning giving the Angels a 12-10 victory
over the Toronto Blue Jays after they had blown a 10-0 lead before
18,304 fans at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   His first homer sparked a five-run third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has hit safely in five of the six games. But it wasn't
Vaughn that caused concern for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   A more pressing concern was how the club would respond to
Tuesday's 10-1 loss, a game in which the Angels played so poorly
Collins called it the worst game any of his big league teams has
ever played.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, though, Collins said he was confident his
players would put Tuesday behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk into the clubhouse after a game like (Tuesday)
night's and you see Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon, Darin Erstad, Chuck
Finley, Tim Belcher, Troy Percival, you know that (Tuesday) was
just one bad night. It'll pass. We know we've got a good team. You
put that sucker out of your mind and move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins was reassured early, as his club built a 10-0 lead
through four innings. But Belcher, who squandered a 7-2 lead to the
Blue Jays last week in Toronto, could not make it out of the fifth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Belcher gave up six runs and seven hits, including
home runs by Shannon Stewart and Shawn Green, and had to be rescued
by reliever Al Levine, who recorded the final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense beat up on Blue Jays starter David Wells,
knocking the ex-Yankee out of the game after just 21/3 innings.
Wells gave up seven runs (six earned) and seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got two in the second inning, one scoring on Garret
Anderson's RBI triple, and another coming home on Charlie O'Brien's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Vaughn's two-run homer was the seventh of
his career off Wells, more than any other active player. Albert
Belle, Chili Davis and Ken Griffey Jr. have six apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels added three more runs in the inning on four hits,
including an RBI single by Tim Unroe and a two-run single by Andy
Sheets.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Troy Glaus hit a towering, three-run homer
off reliever Tom Davey for a 10-0 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   All that time between innings, apparently, took a toll on
Belcher. Needing to finish the fifth to qualify for a victory, he
gave up four consecutive hits to begin the inning, including a
three-run homer by Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher struck out Jose Cruz but then yielded a homer to Green
to make it 10-5. Carlos Delgado walked and Tony Fernandez singled
before Willie Greene struck out for the second out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But after Darrin Fletcher singled to drive in Delgado and make
it 10-6, Collins marched to the mound with the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Green hit his second homer of the game in the sixth inning off
Scott Schoeneweis to cut the Angels lead to 10-8.

LAKERS' ONCE-PROMISING SEASON HAS BECOME DISASTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ All those months of inactivity during the
NBA work stoppage sure made a couple of the Los Angeles Lakers
restless. That was to be expected, we guess. After all, you know
what happens when kids are cooped up for 191 days. It doesn't
matter if they're 66 years old or 7-feet tall, they're bound to get
fidgety.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with owner Jerry Buss and center Shaquille O'Neal.
They waited so long for the 1998-99 season to start. Then, when it
finally did they acted as though they were supposed to have hoisted
the NBA championship trophy yesterday, already.
</P>
<P>
   There was so much lost time to make up and so few games. Just
thinking about it made them crazy. In their impetuousness they
club-jacked the Lakers, the better to get to the NBA Finals in five
months flat.
</P>
<P>
   They have steered the club so recklessly that executive vice
president Jerry West eventually turned around his squad car. Good
cop, bad cop, what did it really matter? He clearly grew weary of
the chase after a few miles.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Lakers continue to hurtle along fecklessly while we
watch, at once mesmerized and mortified. They're running out of
road, sure as Buss and O'Neal, the team's standout center, did
patience months ago.
</P>
<P>
   As hopeless as it looks, the fact is there's just enough time
for someone to wrest control of the club before it spins out of
control and plunges into a ditch while Houston and San Antonio and
Portland and Utah zoom on by.
</P>
<P>
   That someone is Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   In Kobe we trust. We must. What other choice do we have?
</P>
<P>
   We feel for Bryant, who has had to grow up so abruptly it's a
wonder he hasn't been on the injured list with whiplash. And yet at
the tender age of 20, with no college seasoning to speak of, he
already is infinitely wiser in one respect than O'Neal, his senior
by nearly seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The supremely skilled guard is smart enough to see he isn't
perfect. He'll own up to his mistakes, which is the first step
toward not repeating them. When he talks, he puts the accent on
Superman squarely on the third syllable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the heat,'' he said after practice Wednesday. ``It
doesn't bother me. It's part of the learning process.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week at Portland, Bryant launched a 3-point shot in the
final minute of a four-point game with two men in his face and
plenty of time on the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he readily acknowledged that he should have driven to
the basket and tried to draw a foul.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neal? He readily acknowledged that certain teammates
shouldn't be shooting a three-pointer in the final minute with two
guys in their face and plenty of time on the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Lakers' avowed leader. He is SUPERman, hear him roar.
He's as likely to deflect blame onto his teammates as deflect
opponents' shots. He'll be the first to tell you he's good for 26
points and 11 rebounds a night. But the next time he blames his
shoddy defense or lackluster shotblocking (he had zero in that
aforementioned Portland loss) or poor free-throw shooting for a
loss it'll be the first time.
</P>
<P>
   If only O'Neal could check his ego and his insecurities just a
little, he might be able to learn a lot from Bryant. He'd certainly
be able to better co-exist with him.
</P>
<P>
   Their first two years as teammates, O'Neal never publicly picked
Bryant apart the way he has this year. Maybe the fact that Bryant
signed a contract extension before the season and O'Neal holds the
option to walk away as a free agent at the end of this miserable
year is behind O'Neal's imperiousness and his impatience.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, in Buss he found a person willing to indulge his
whims. Thus the past three months have seen O'Neal barking
directions (who can forget his recent boast, ``I'm glad I'm the
general manager of this team. I've got this team just the way I
want it.'') and Buss at the wheel and a city of sports fans
watching, transfixed.
</P>
<P>
   We've already seen one coach get tossed as though he were an
empty aluminum can (we remain confident someone will come along and
recycle Del Harris).
</P>
<P>
   We've seen one itinerant hitchhiker climb aboard, ostensibly to
help the club safely navigate the shortened season. For a while it
looked like Dennis Rodman would steer the Lakers straight, as weird
as that sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then Buss, again doing O'Neal's bidding, dumped two hostages,
center Elden Campbell and the defensive-minded Eddie Jones, and
brought aboard shooters Glen Rice and J.R. Reid. Shortly thereafter
Rodman was discarded like yesterday's sandwich wrapper and the
Lakers haven't been able to stop much of anything _ their
opponents, their sniveling, their course _ since.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have met the enemy all right. It isn't Pacific
Division-leading Portland, whom they'll face tonight at the Forum.
It's them.

INFIELD CAMPERS CLAIM SPOTS

   FONTANA, Calif. _ While team transporters waited on the outside,
infield campers claimed their spots Wednesday evening at the
California Speedway in preparation for Sunday's NASCAR Winston Cup
Series event.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 vehicles, ranging from expensive motor homes to
vans, were ushered into the infield at 5 p.m. Last year, the huge
response prompted speedway officials to open the backstretch gates
a night before the first event.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge was Tom Villa of West Covina, subbing for
brother Richard. It was Richard, a Dale Earnhardt fan, who left
work at 6 a.m. on Tuesday and made the trek to Fontana, arriving
more than 24 hours before anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's first-come, first-serve, so we wanted to get the choice
spot,'' said Tom. ``We're season ticket holders, so we want a spot
near the tunnel, close to the track and our seats. Also close to
the showers.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Tom will be joined by brother Eddie and two other
friends in the infield. Their Volkswagen van was crammed with food,
drink, a bike, generators, tents, chairs, a wagon, blankets and a
Monopoly game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll spend the whole weekend here, it's great,'' said Tom,
wearing a Bobby Labonte hat. ``Especially Saturday night in the
infield, it's just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The lure of infield life also prompted Vince Hanley of Encino to
leave the San Fernando Valley at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday to get in
line. He and wife Cathy have also camped out for NASCAR races at
Phoenix, Sears Point in Sonoma, Calif., and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have general admission, so we really don't know where we'll
be,'' said Hanley, a NASCAR fan for 15 of his 37 years. ``It's hard
to get the popular spots.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Hanley family will be present and each rooting for a
different driver. Daughter Ashley, 12, is a fan of ``The
Intimidator,'' Dale Earnhardt; 7-year-old Trevor likes Jeff Gordon;
Mom cheers for rookie Tony Stewart and dad sticks with Bill
Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seats,'' said Hanley before moving into the infield.
``It's hard to see from the infield during a race, but it's pretty
good afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   According to speedway officials, more than 20,000 are expected
to live in the infield area this weekend. All reserved and general
admission spots have been sold, leaving only weekend infield
passes, which cost $40.
</P>
<P>
   WINSTON WEST QUALIFYING: All positions for Saturday's California
200, the 100-lap Winston West race, will be determined during this
afternoon's qualifying. The drivers will practice from 11 a.m. to 2
p.m. before making timed runs at 3:30. The fastest 31 cars will
qualify for the 36-car field, which also includes five
provisionals.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Schrader, who has won two of the three Winston West races at
the speedway, holds the qualifying mark of 40.084 seconds (179.623
mph). After three of 14 races, former champion Mike Chase leads the
points race. He's seven ahead of Brandon Ash. Austin Cameron, Sean
Woodside and rookie Sammy Potashnick round out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader and fellow Winston Cup regular Ricky Craven are entered
in the event along with Craftsman Truck Series drivers Ron
Hornaday, Mike Wallace and Jerry Glanville. Wallace won the West
season-opener last January in Phoenix. AUTOGRAPH SESSION: Several
Winston Cup drivers, including ex-champions Rusty Wallace and Terry
Labonte, will be among those signing autographs today from 5 to 7
p.m. as part of the first RaceFest. There is no admission charge to
the session, which will also include Ernie Irvan, Michael Waltrip,
Johnny Benson, Brett Bodine, Elliott Sadler, Jason Jarrett, Mike
Dillon, Larry Pearson and Butch Gilliland, the 1997 Winston West
titlist from Chino Hills.
</P>
<P>
   SOLID FUTURE: According to Randy LaJoie, the future of stock car
racing looks pretty good. LaJoie is referring to the youthful
competitors in the Busch Grand National series. The names range
from NASCAR royalty _ Dale Earnhardt Jr., Adam Petty, Jason Jarrett
_ to those getting experience before making the transition to
Winston Cup, drivers such as Mike Dillon, Matt Kenseth, Kevin and
Wayne Grubb and Dave Blaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two thumbs up,'' said LaJoie, who has opted to race in the
Busch series so he can spend more time with his family. ``They're
very smart. And they are very talented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I've seen about these guys compared to some of
the ones in the past is they will ask questions,'' LaJoie said.
``The last couple of years, we've had guys coming through here who
thought they were smarter than the rest of us.''

 TEEN PREGNANCY RATES DROP _ EDUCATION, ECONOMY CREDITED  &HT;     By RAMON G. MCLEOD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teenage pregnancy rates in California and the rest of the
country dropped in 1996, and it appears that sex education,
economics and more realistic attitudes by teenagers played a large
role in the downward trend.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by the New York-based Alan Guttmacher Institute
shows that pregnancies in females 19 and younger declined 4 percent
from 1995 to 1996. Teen pregnancy rates have dropped 17 percent
since peaking in 1990. Pregnancy rates include births, abortions
and miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   And new information released by the U.S. government on
birthrates for 1997 shows that these have been falling since 1991
with the greatest improvements nationally among African American
females 19 or younger. Pregnancy rates are not available for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty happy to see this,'' Beth Frederick, a
spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute, said of the new figures.
``The pregnancy declines are across the board, and that means kids
are getting the message that having a baby too young is something
they want to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   California, which has the second highest teen birthrate in the
nation, has seen these figures drop much faster than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, birthrates for white teens fell 13 percent from 1991
to 1996, but fell 24 percent in California. The African American
birthrate fell 21 percent nationally, but 23 percent in California.
The Latino birthrate went down 5 percent nationally, but 15 percent
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Comparative Asian American data has not been published, but
other data show that Asian American teen birthrates have followed a
similar downward path.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes toward sex and sex education by both children and
their parents may be playing a significant role in the declining
teen birth and pregnancy rates, Frederick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that these kids are the first generation
to have been exposed to sex education messages for a very long time
now,'' Frederick said. ``They have been hearing about AIDS,
condoms, abstinence and how it is bad to have a baby when you are
not ready, since grade school.''
</P>
<P>
   Parental attitudes about frankly talking to kids and attitudes
about school-based sex education are also likely playing a role,
said Gary Yates, executive director of the Wellness Foundation of
California, a Los Angeles health care organization that is
launching a major teen-pregnancy prevention campaign in May.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Field Institute in San Francisco that was
commissioned by the foundation and released this week found that 88
percent of California adults believe that sex education should be
taught in the schools. Most believe this should happen before the
eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll, said Latino and
African American parents are the strongest supporters of quality
sex education and are the groups most likely to consider it a
serious problem for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birthrates are higher for these two groups than for other
groups, and this is definitely an issue of real importance to the
parents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Field Poll shows that more than 90 percent of parents and
nonparents alike are highly supportive of education about AIDS, the
basics of human reproduction, and the use of condoms. Better than
83 percent of parents and 73 percent of nonparents also believe
that schools should discourage kids from having sex before
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Yates said the survey shows that ``parents believe that young
people should have sex education in schools and they want it to
begin at a fairly young age,'' he said. ``They may not show up at
school board meetings to announce their support of these programs,
but this poll shows how strong the sentiment is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex education alone cannot account for the drop in teen birth
and pregnancy rates, however, said Yates and others familiar with
the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy being sound, hope for the future increases,
and when that happens pregnancies tend to decline,'' Yates said.

PAYTON BLOWS TOP AFTER BLOWOUT LOSS TO TRAIL BLAZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND _ Minutes after the Sonics suffered their worst loss
this season, Gary Payton unleashed an emotionally charged tirade as
soon as his agent entered the team's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better do something about this,'' Payton hollered at Aaron
Goodwin Wednesday night after the Sonics were destroyed, 119-84, by
the Portland Trail Blazers at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about this (expletive) no more. I'm tired of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin immediately tried to calm Payton, who yelled in front of
teammates and a room filled with print and television reporters.
After Goodwin's prodding, Payton eventually lowered his voice. The
pair continued their discussion near the showers, out of sight and
earshot of those in the room.
</P>
<P>
   However, as Payton walked away he could be heard saying ``I
don't care about Wally ... '' _ a reference to team president Wally
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time this season Payton has publicly griped
about the Sonics' losing ways. It was also a tangible indication of
Payton's displeasure with Walker and possibly first-year Sonics
coach Paul Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics again fell out of the Western Conference playoff
standings. They are in ninth place, one game out of the playoff
picture. Minnesota beat Phoenix Wedesday to pull even with the idle
Sacramento Kings for the seventh spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have four regular-season games left with Westphal
standing firm by his claim that three wins will get the team into
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who for the second time in three games was held to
single digits (7), may not be so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just frustration,'' Goodwin said after Payton left the
locker room without speaking with the media. ``He wants to win. He
wants to be in the playoffs. That's why I pulled him aside. I told
him we don't need theatrics. I told him to relax. It's acceptable
and it's understandable. It's been a long season.''
</P>
<P>
   Said center Olden Polynice: ``Everybody would love to see us
unravel. But I'm not going to let that happen. We're going to stay
together for the next four games and get into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   At 22-24, the Sonics are toying with not making the playoffs for
the first time in Payton's career. The Sonics have been in the
postseason in each of Payton's eight seasons since he was drafted
No. 2 overall in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Sonics began summer vacation early was
1989-90.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing speculation, heightened by a recent report in
ESPN The Magazine, that Payton will ask to be traded in the
offseason. Goodwin squelched that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real truth is he doesn't want to leave here,'' Goodwin
said. ``The real truth is he doesn't want to lose. Wally's going to
do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Walker nor Westphal witnessed Payton's outburst. Walker
attended Wednesday's blowout, but there was little he could do
about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, owner of the best record in the NBA, pummeled the
Sonics with a third quarter that, in the words of Polynice, rivaled
a ``Mike Tyson uppercut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They just straight cold-cocked us and we never recovered,''
Polynice said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers, doing whatever they pleased, outscored the
Sonics 44-19 in the third. Point guard Damon Stoudamire, another
Goodwin superstar, punished the Sonics the most. He scored 17 of
his season-high 31 points in the decisive period.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, which successfully stalled John Stockton in a win
against Utah Tuesday night, could not handle Stoudamire's
quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was Hersey Hawkins, John Crotty or even Payton
defending, Stoudamire crossed them over, scooped layups or drilled
3-pointers in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Portland multiplied an eight-point halftime lead into a 97-64
bulge at the end of the period. The Sonics' biggest deficit was 38
points in the fourth. They never found a way to match Portland's
energy, toughness or size.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is not going to make or break our season,'' said
Dale Ellis who, along with Detlef Schrempf, led the Sonics with 13
points. ``They play well here in Portland. And we haven't had a lot
of success here lately. Plus, they were just a little more physical
than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' backcourt will affirm that. Both Crotty and Hawkins
were injured in the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins jammed his right ring finger in the first quarter, and
had to leave the game in the third because of the injury. Crotty
suffered a mild concussion late the third. He took an elbow to the
head from Portland's Stacey Augmon while driving to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Both incidents were painful reminders of how much the Trail
Blazers wore the Sonics down.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can look at the score and draw any conclusions they
want,'' Westphal said. ``But we're going to be ready for Denver
(Friday at KeyArena). We're not giving up. We're just going to
flush this one.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Wednesday night revealed bigger problems.

   LONDON _ While Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic publicly
keeps his distance from any Western-backed peace proposals for
Kosovo, his wife's political party has joined _ if only hesitantly
_ those forces seeking a compromise solution with the West.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Wednesday in the International Herald
Tribune, Goran Matic, a leader of Mirjana Markovic's Yugoslav
United Left, said he believed the conflict over the province would
be solved within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Matic, seen as close to Milosevic's inner circle, told the
newspaper that a mutually satisfactory formula would soon be found
with the assistance of diplomatic initiatives from Moscow, Serbia's
traditional Orthodox ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this will be the week in which the basic outlines of
an agreement on Kosovo can be firmed up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will give NATO their victory,'' he said, adding ambiguously
that ``they (NATO) have to decide what that really means.'' He
said: ``We won't give up Kosovo or allow armed troops into Kosovo.
Everything else we will give NATO for their victory.''
</P>
<P>
   While the substance of Matic's remarks will hardly raise
eyebrows _ NATO after all can hardly claim ``victory'' without
sending at least some armed troops into Kosovo _ the tone suggests
important elements in the Serbian regime do not want the sacking of
the moderate Deputy Prime Minister, Vuk Draskovic, to be seen as
closing off all avenues to a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Markovic's party, known by its acronym JUL, does not garner
many votes in Serbian polls. Nor does it need to, such is the power
that the former professor of Marxism is said to wield over her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of its feeble poll ratings, membership of JUL is seen
as a ticket to the highest office in Serbian politics and industry,
most of which is in the patronage of the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Markovic, moreover, is known to telephone her husband up to
a dozen times a day and sources close to the regime insist he acts
on her political advice.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Markovic has acted the role of prophet before. During the
1991-5 wars in Croatia and Bosnia, it was Mrs. Markovic's attack on
the Bosnian Serb leadership in her magazine column that was seen as
a sign that they had forfeited Milosevic's support.
</P>
<P>
   Her words were recalled when Milosevic refused to come to the
aid of the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs when they were threatened
with military annihilation in the summer of 1995. &QL;

   SURDULICA, SERBIA _ They had been torn apart. Blood was caked
around what was left of Vojislav Milic's cellar, and there was the
smell of meat. In the morgue, they had been unable to fit together
the pieces of his son and daughter-in-law and his two
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bomb _ one of two which struck the homes of Surdulica _
had scored a direct hit on the house, killing at least nine other
children in the basement, the youngest only five years old.
</P>
<P>
   Milic was still there, slumped over a wall in despair, head
buried in his hands, tears draining between his fingers _ a
survivor who wanted to die.
</P>
<P>
   A tweed cap was sadly askew on his head. A blonde girl put her
arm around him. ``We can't bear to see you like this,'' she wept
into his ear. ``We can't look at you like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Every house on Zmaj Jove Jovanovica Street had been ripped apart
by the 2,000-lb. laser-guided bomb, their roofs flung hundreds of
feet around the town, their walls cracked or blasted to the ground,
their people _ those who survived _ taken to hospital in their
dozens.
</P>
<P>
   The few who remained untouched stood in the mud beside the
wreckage here Wednesday. Most were crying. At least one appeared to
have gone mad.
</P>
<P>
   Another NATO ``mistake.'' How often have we been writing that
word these last five weeks?
</P>
<P>
   The civilian dead of Aleksinac (26), the passengers burned alive
on the bombed train at Grdelica a few miles from here (27), the
civilians killed in the NATO bombing of central Pristina (10), the
convoy of Albanian refugees attacked by the Americans (74). And now
another slaughter of the innocents.
</P>
<P>
   What did NATO think it was bombing? ``There are no military
facilities in the vicinity,'' Nabojsa Vujovic, the foreign ministry
spokesman, announced amid the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   But a middle-aged lady whose best friend had been killed in the
Milic house said there had been a barracks 500 meters away on the
outskirts of the town. Others said it had been empty. I saw a mass
of tangled white prefabricated sheeting on a hillside that might
once have been a military store.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military said four missiles had hit Surdulica at
noon on Tuesday. Did two of them hit the ``barracks?'' We certainly
knew where the other two exploded.

<P>
   And their detonations _ two laser-guided bombs hit civilian
homes, not one as NATO later claimed _ broke a community apart.
</P>
<P>
   The house on Zmaj Jove Jovanovica Street had the strongest
cellar, the safest basement, with railway lines to support its roof
_ the ideal shelter for the children who lived in the neighboring
two-story detached homes with their gardens of tulips and lilac
trees.
</P>
<P>
   So that is where the children ran when the air-raid siren
sounded over Surdulica. And that is where they died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bits of them were all over the road,'' a young,
American-educated man said to me. ``We found the head of a child in
a garden and many limbs in the mud. But you don't want to report
that. CNN filmed the bodies _ but they didn't show them on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the young man was right. History is quickly sanitized
here. But in the hospital a few hours after the NATO bombing,
doctors were still trying to fit arms and legs and heads to at
least 20 torsos.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were the remains of Mrs. Milic, her 37-year-old son
Aleksandar, his wife Vesna, and their children, 11-year-old
Vladimir and 15-year old Miljna.
</P>
<P>
   The dead also included two 18-year-old boys, a 21-year-old girl
and the relatives of a man who walked up to us near the bomb crater
with tears in his eyes and said: ``I have lost what I hold most
dear to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a house just down the road, the same NATO bomb had blasted
his aunt Stanica Rasic to death and his cousin Dragan Manolov as
well.
</P>
<P>
   An old woman was dragged alive from the mud, just as Vojislav
Milic was pulled from the tomb of his family. ``When he was taken
out of the basement, `Voja' said he would hang himself,'' the
middle-aged woman remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing he said when they pulled him out was `Shoot
me,' `Kill me.' He had lost everything, you see _ his whole family,
his home... .''
</P>
<P>
   Surdulica was not the place Wednesday to discuss NATO's latest
explanations of a single erroneous bomb, or its expressions of
regret or the British Ministry of Defense's statement _ made four
hours after the Surdulica attack _ that NATO had had ``a good day''
over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take some pictures of my house,'' a man shrieked at us from
the timbers of his smashed roof. ``(Screw) Clinton and his family
for this. I spent 30 years building my home. You're a bunch of
fascists.'' &QL;

wreckage, believed these houses had been deliberately bombed.

<P>
   ``NATO hit the barracks on April 6th,'' she said. ``So now they
came to attack us in our homes.''

   SURDULICA, SERBIA _ They had been torn apart. Blood was caked
around what was left of Vojislav Milic's cellar, and there was the
smell of meat. In the morgue, they had been unable to fit together
the pieces of his son and daughter-in-law and his two
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bomb _ one of two which struck the homes of Surdulica _
had scored a direct hit on the house, killing at least nine other
children in the basement, the youngest only five years old.
</P>
<P>
   Milic was still there, slumped over a wall in despair, head
buried in his hands, tears draining between his fingers _ a
survivor who wanted to die.
</P>
<P>
   A tweed cap was sadly askew on his head. A blonde girl put her
arm around him. ``We can't bear to see you like this,'' she wept
into his ear. ``We can't look at you like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Every house on Zmaj Jove Jovanovica Street had been ripped apart
by the 2,000-lb. laser-guided bomb, their roofs flung hundreds of
feet around the town, their walls cracked or blasted to the ground,
their people _ those who survived _ taken to hospital in their
dozens.
</P>
<P>
   The few who remained untouched stood in the mud beside the
wreckage here Wednesday. Most were crying. At least one appeared to
have gone mad.
</P>
<P>
   Another NATO ``mistake.'' How often have we been writing that
word these last five weeks?
</P>
<P>
   The civilian dead of Aleksinac (26), the passengers burned alive
on the bombed train at Grdelica a few miles from here (27), the
civilians killed in the NATO bombing of central Pristina (10), the
convoy of Albanian refugees attacked by the Americans (74). And now
another slaughter of the innocents.
</P>
<P>
   What did NATO think it was bombing? ``There are no military
facilities in the vicinity,'' Nabojsa Vujovic, the foreign ministry
spokesman, announced amid the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   But a middle-aged lady whose best friend had been killed in the
Milic house said there had been a barracks 500 meters away on the
outskirts of the town. Others said it had been empty. I saw a mass
of tangled white prefabricated sheeting on a hillside that might
once have been a military store.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military said four missiles had hit Surdulica at
noon on Tuesday. Did two of them hit the ``barracks?'' We certainly
knew where the other two exploded.
</P>
<P>
   And their detonations _ two laser-guided bombs hit civilian
homes, not one as NATO later claimed _ broke a community apart.
</P>
<P>
   The house on Zmaj Jove Jovanovica Street had the strongest
cellar, the safest basement, with railway lines to support its roof
_ the ideal shelter for the children who lived in the neighboring
two-story detached homes with their gardens of tulips and lilac
trees.
</P>
<P>
   So that is where the children ran when the air-raid siren

   BELGRADE _ From high above Belgrade, the voices are often
disjointed but unmistakably American, very occasionally humorous
but usually talking like computers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is what they are reading as they turn across the
skies of Yugoslavia. ``Contact three-two-two and twenty-four.''
``About four miles to...'' ``I'm going to do a left-hand turn.''
``One victor...'' ``Negative.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Midwest voices, New York accents, Californian boys,
high-altitude static cutting off their voices in the
air-conditioned interiors of F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Yugoslavs can hear the U.S. pilots above them. For when
the air-raid sirens sound at dusk, Belgrade's ham radio operators
go to their roofs rather than their shelters and tune in to NATO's
state-of-the-art air alliance.
</P>
<P>
   There are very few moments of emotion in those voices from the
other world, just the hint of a joke and some laughter coming down
from the ether.
</P>
<P>
   Or the sudden, unprofessional surprise of a young pilot who
didn't realize how real his bombs were until they exploded. ``Two
impacts _ wow, look at that!'' a young voice says. Then there are
seconds of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the right side.'' ``Pods quiet.'' ``I might continue
climbing up to base plus 10.'' ``Comin' right, reference
two-one-zero.'' ``Twenty-three thousand.''
</P>
<P>
   What are ``pods?'' How high is ``base?'' Is 23,000 the altitude
of the F-16 (altitudes being the great unmentionable, secret
subject of all NATO briefings)?
</P>
<P>
   But be sure that if the radio hams of Belgrade can pick this
stuff up, so can the Yugoslav military. And they will be listening
with more professional ears than the cold men on the chilly roofs
of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Already, government propagandists are making use of these radio
intercepts, cutting them into false passages of ``pilot''
transmissions in which actors pretending to be American or British
aircrew say they are ejecting from their jets or bombing refugee
convoys.
</P>
<P>
   Radio-TV Serbia ran a taped ``conversation'' between an AWACS
aircraft and an F-16 pilot last Saturday that purported to be a
record of the April 14 NATO attack on a Kosovo Albanian refugee
convoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see tractors. I hope Reds have not camouflaged tanks into
tractors,'' the ``pilot'' supposedly says.
</P>
<P>
   The fake ``AWACS'' responds: ``Mother to Charlie Bravo. What
kind of a strange convoy? What civilians? Hell. It's all Serbian
doing. Destroy the target!''
</P>
<P>
   Although the fraudulent tape betrays an odd parallel to the
reality of the refugee convoy attack _ NATO did indeed claim it had
originally mistaken tractors for military vehicles _ the words of
the ``AWACS'' are more like those of a space cartoon than the USAF.
``Destroy the target!'' is Battleship Galactica, not NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the radio ham intercepts which are undeniably real, a
tape of which was handed to The Independent on Sunday in Belgrade.
And it is just possible _ even for a non-technical ear _ to
understand how the NATO air strikes are controlled.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in a night raid near the capital, for example, a
clear but very distant voice (much softer than the pilots') states:
``Aircraft Zero-Two, SA-6, charted acquisition, Romeo Fox, five
zero four three, location map...two three seven two three.
Coordinates four four north zero one nine.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice appears to be an AWACS _ a real high-altitude Boeing
stuffed with electronics and air controllers _ which is directing a
NATO (Zero-Two) jet on to its target coordinates, warning of
possible antiaircraft missiles (SA-6 is a Soviet-made ground-to-air
missile system).
</P>
<P>
   Pilots' voices then break in on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pushing up now. I'm about through seven o'clock for bomb
`ap'.'' ``...with the goggles yet?'' ``Say again.'' ``Have you seen
the flare with the goggles yet?'' ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a pilot appears to make a joke about the moon.
``Can you see a floating strobe light up there?'' And there is
laughter from another voice. Then a poor-quality voice says,
``...how high the strobe light is...the stars,'' receiving the
response: ``Yeah, we're seeing it, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars and laughter in the skies over wartime Yugoslavia.
Listening to all this on the ground, as the rain gutters down from
the caked roofs of old Belgrade, it's possible to believe that we
live in different worlds. &QL;

Listening to all this on the ground, as the rain gutters down from
the caked roofs of old Belgrade, it's possible to believe that we
live in different worlds. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ Who will pay for it all?
</P>
<P>
   When the Yugoslav war is over, who is going to foot the bill for
the massive industrial destruction _ including 36 factories and 19
oil refineries, gas facilities and power plants _ which the Serbs
list among the infrastructure targeted by NATO jets and missiles?
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the government says it is already compiling a list
of destroyed factories, electrical and communications facilities
which it expects the NATO alliance to repair once the conflict is
over.
</P>
<P>
   They include 32 road and rail bridges and 19 television stations
and transmitters as well as widespread damage in civilian areas of
major Yugoslav towns.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army, television stations and the official Tanjug
news agency puts out regular daily accounts of NATO attacks on the
country _ usually leaving out any reference to military targets but
always including damage to civilian property.
</P>
<P>
   NATO briefings highlight military targets, largely ignore
civilian damage and regard major industrial targets as
``dual-purpose'' facilities which are of use to the military as
well as civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Thus NATO claims that weapons were made at the heavily-bombed
Zastava car plant and the Sloboda home-appliance factory at Cacak.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia says the attacks were a deliberate attempt to destroy the
civilian infrastructure of the country and create mass
unemployment. In some cases, factories, refineries and bridges have
been attacked as many as seven times.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO missile attack last week on the 24-story building
comprising commercial offices as well as three television stations
and two political party headquarters in Belgrade has taken the jobs
of 6,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In Kragujevac, the factory raids are said to have lost 26,000
jobs among the local work force.
</P>
<P>
   Six days after the Novi Sad city hall was hit, a bomb destroyed
the Uzice central post office. Hundreds of civilian homes have also
been badly damaged in NATO raids. &QL;

SUMMARY N0 2538 - April 29,1999 We are offering the following
articles for sale. Please contact us for availability in your
country. Karl Horwitz
                                                                 1.
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: DRIVEN BY HER OWN BIOGRAPHY By A.O. Scott from
Slate - 1.900 words Madeleine Albright is a ``celebrity''. Of her
predecessors, only Henry Kissinger exercised a comparable hold over
the public imagination. Albright's celebrity is less a matter of
what she has done than of who she is.
--------------------------------------------------------2.PLAN TO
DE-BALKANIZE WHEN THE WAR ENDS By Flora Lewis There are no new
answers and the questions have scarcely changed. But it is
impossible to change the subject. War in Kosovo remains the
throbbing overwhelming issue that can't be stopped and can't keep
going on.
----------------------------------------------------------------3.
WAR WITHOUT DEATH By Corey S. Powell from Discover - 1.200 words
The image of the perfect nonlethal weapon - a Star Trek-style
phaser set on stun - is so powerful that no one has given up on the
idea. The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency is
collaborating with the National Institute of Justice to develop a
more sophisticated laser weapon.
----------------------------------------------------------------4.
WHO SAYS WE CAN'T STOP EVERY GENOCIDE? By Lucy Russell from Slate -
1.200 words Critics say moral consistency requires us to do nothing
in Kosovo because we can't intervene every time a thug like
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic decides to start slaughtering
his own citizens. But is it true?
----------------------------------------------------------------5.
CLONING MAY CAUSE LONG-LASTING HEALTH PROBLEMS By Michael McCarthy
from The Lancet News Service French researchers report that a
cloned calf may have died because of a genetic malfunction caused
by the cloning. This is the first time anyone has reported that
cloning could cause long-lasting health problems in clones.
----------------------------------------------------------------6.
LIZ TILBERIS: A GALLANT STRUGGLE ENDS By Sharon Edelson from
Women's Wear Daily - 2.500 words She was the epitome of glamour,
escorting Princess Diana to the Costume Institute gala at the
Metropolitan Musueum of Art in 1996. But beneath the velvet and
satin, Liz Tilberis was fighting the battle of her life. On April
21, at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, the 51-year-old
editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar, lost her six-year struggle with
ovarian cancer. In this tribute, friends, designers and co-workers
remember this very extraordinary woman.
----------------------------------------------------------------7.
SHEDDING LIGHT ON JET LAG By Everett Potter - 1.000 words Forget
melatonin and faddish diets. When it comes to jet lag, that
traveler's hangover of digestive ailments, sleep deprivation and
moodiness, it is best to turn on the lights. External and internal
desynchronization are the major culprits.
----------------------------------------------------------------8.
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER EVGUENI PRIMAKOV by
MAREK HALTER - text in French (not available in France and Italy.
----------------------------------------------------------------9.
ENVIRONMENTAL MYTHS from Discover - 600 words The editors of
Discover set the record straight on a spectrum of erroneous
environmental assumptions, from the primary source of U.S. energy
(70 % is derived from coal and other fossil fuels) to the primary
culprit responsible for oil pollution (autos and boats - not
tankers). Learn the direct cause of damaging environmental effects
as well as what, if anything, is being done to safeguard our
national forest and bottled water.
----------------------------------------------------------------10.
ISABELLE HUPPERT'S RISQUE BUSINESS By Daniel Perez - from Fairchild
Isabelle Huppert is stumped. She just can't figure out why she's
occasionally referred to in the press as ``the little French
mouse''. But if she had seen herself sitting in the front row of
January's Yves Saint Laurent couture show, just one seat down from
Catherine Deneuve, she might have some idea...Please fax to Paris : 33.1.47.42.80.44 or: 33.1.47.42.18.81

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Legal system fails to do justice to blacks
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a book us white folks need to read but black folks can
skip. Black folks already know why there's such a grotesque
disproportion of their young men in prison. And, no, it's not
because African Americans are natural-born crooks; that's
talk-radio tripe. It's in good part because the relentless
inequities of the criminal justice system are geared, however
unintentionally, to produce that disproportion.
</P>
<P>
   The book is ``No Equal Justice.'' It is by David Cole. He brings
a disturbing _ and what ought to be an urgent _ message.
</P>
<P>
   For every black man who is graduated from college, 100 are
arrested. The consequences for our national life are corrosive. The
current, unprecedented disproportions are devastating black family
formation and economic opportunity and creating an alienation that
is more, not less, likely to produce crime.
</P>
<P>
   The tilt against the poor, especially the black poor, starts at
the bottom of the criminal justice ladder, with kids, and compiles
with every rung up. A 1991 study found juvenile drug use about
50-50 black and white, but black juveniles were detained for drug
cases at twice the rate of white kids and were charged in adult
criminal courts at four times the white rate.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutorial decisions disfavor the black and poor. Georgia's
prosecutors, Cole reports, have invoked their state's
two-times-and-out life sentences against 1 percent of the whites
facing a second drug conviction, 16 percent of eligible blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors are drawn from pools that underrepresent the poor and
minorities and prosecutors misuse preemptory challenges to keep
minorities off trial juries.
</P>
<P>
   Drug, especially crack and powder cocaine laws, prosecutions and
sentences, are notoriously tilted. Some 65 percent of crack users
are white but in 1992, 92.6 percent of crack convictions were of
blacks, and black federal crack offenders serve an average 5 years
longer than white cocaine offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Public Health Services finds that 76 percent of all
drug users are white, 14 percent black, 8 percent Hispanic. But
African Americans account for 35 percent of drug arrests, 55
percent of convictions and 74 percent of prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Black defendants are 50 percent more likely than whites to be
imprisoned for larceny; twice as likely to be imprisoned for
weapons offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court gave indigent defendants a theoretical right
to counsel but undermines the practical right. The court has
accepted as ``competent'' indigents' attorneys who slept at the
trial, used heroin during a trial, were drunk in the court and were
suffering from Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Most states underfund public defenders and judges appoint
defense lawyers with little or no criminal trial experience. Few
states provide post-conviction counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative effect of all this is that while blacks are 12
percent of the population, prisons are 50 percent black. And citing
that as justification, beat cops, highway patrols and custom agents
then target black folks for frisks and searches _ powering a
self-fulfilling cycle.
</P>
<P>
   A nation intending justice would be offended by these
distortions. An artful one would right them.

marine-based quest of biologist William Fenical may be critical to
the future of medicine. Since the 1980s, Fenical has been plunging

   Exciting new evidence suggests that the first humans in the New
World were not, as previously believed, mammoth hunters from
Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait at the end of the Ice Age.
Who, when, where and how the first North Americans came to the
continent is an evolving mystery with some new, compelling and
evolving answers. The surprising remains of Spirit Cave in a museum
laboratory outside Carson City, Nev., offer startling clues about
the origins of mankind.

   In New Guinea's rain forest, environmentalists and business
executives are learning that what's good for this pristine world is
also good for the bottom line. The author, a professor of
physiology and an avid bird-watcher, makes his 17th visit to New
Guinea and discovers an elusive bird _ a cassowary _ living near
the oil fields. What makes it possible for this big, shy,
ostrichlike bird _ rarely found anywhere near the disturbances
people create _ to survive alongside the country's largest
operating oil and natural gas field?

   The author, an orthopedic surgeon in Berkeley, Calif., seeks to
cure a severe condition of developmental dysplasia found in a
3-year-old patient named Gabrielle. Can the child be saved from

   Exciting new evidence suggests that the first humans in the New
World were not, as previously believed, mammoth hunters from
Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait at the end of the Ice Age.
Who, when, where and how the first North Americans came to the
continent is an evolving mystery with some new, compelling and
evolving answers. The surprising remains of Spirit Cave in a museum
laboratory outside Carson City, Nev., offer startling clues about
the origins of mankind.

   In New Guinea's rain forest, environmentalists and business
executives are learning that what's good for this pristine world is
also good for the bottom line. The author, a professor of
physiology and an avid bird-watcher, makes his 17th visit to New
Guinea and discovers an elusive bird _ a cassowary _ living near
the oil fields. What makes it possible for this big, shy,
ostrichlike bird _ rarely found anywhere near the disturbances
people create _ to survive alongside the country's largest

 By THE EDITORS OF DISCOVER MAGAZINE  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Most energy in the United States comes from solar,
nuclear and hydroelectric generation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Seventy percent of our electricity is produced by
burning coal and other fossil fuels _ sources linked to global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Plastic six-pack rings do not break down in the
environment and can trap marine animals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  The rings are designed to disintegrate in sunlight, but
the process can take 10 years. Therefore, the rings should be
snipped, recycled or avoided altogether. Surveys have shown that
the rings can strangle birds and fish, but the worst culprit is
abandoned plastic fishing line responsible for 37 percent of marine
entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Destruction of tropical rain forests will cause Earth's
atmosphere to run out of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Oxygen makes up almost 21 percent of atmospheric gases.
Burning all the tropical forests in the world would decrease the
proportion of oxygen by four-hundredths of one percent. Destruction
of tropical rain forests, however, would significantly increase the
concentration of carbon dioxide _ the most important greenhouse gas
_ in the atmosphere by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Household and industrial chemicals are routinely tested
and approved for safe use by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Federal officials do not test pesticides or household
products for safety. They rely on producers to do so.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  The solar-energy market has plateaued.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Worldwide sales of solar cells increased 11 percent a
year from 1990 to 1996, then jumped by 43 percent in 1997 and by
another 28 percent in 1998. Sales of coal and oil have grown by
slightly more than one percent a year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants _ which will
remain radioactive for millions of years _ are safely stored in a
deep underground facility in the West.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  No such long-term storage facility exists. All fuel rods
are stored temporarily at the nation's 103 active nuclear plants.
Another 12 plants have been shut down, but the spent rods are still
stored at the plants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Most oil pollution comes from tankers that run aground
or ships that wash out their holds at sea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  More than twice as much oil gets into the environment
each year because of sloppy activities involving automobiles and
boats. At least 200 million gallons of oil are dumped each year in
the U.S. by people who change their own automobile engine oil.
Overfilling auto gas tanks also contributes to the mess, as do
spills when refilling outboard-motor tanks. However, tens of
thousands of leaky auto engines whizzing over already polluted
urban environments can't compare with the damage done to a pristine
environment by a single oil tanker such as the Exxon Valdez, which
spilled 10 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound in
Alaska in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Aerosol spray cans are the leading source of
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  CFCs were banned from aerosol cans in 1978. They are
still found, however, in many air conditioners and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Government agencies test bottled water for safety and
purity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT &LR; : Bottled water is not tested by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Our national forests are protected from logging, mining
and drilling for oil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Fifty-two percent of national forests are logged, mined
and crisscrossed by more than 373,000 miles of roads, enough to
circle Earth 14 times. Just 18 percent of national forest land is
permanently protected wilderness, and much of that is thin soil
over rock where trees rarely grow.

<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Most energy in the United States comes from solar,
nuclear and hydroelectric generation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Seventy percent of our electricity is produced by
burning coal and other fossil fuels _ sources linked to global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Plastic six-pack rings do not break down in the
environment and can trap marine animals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  The rings are designed to disintegrate in sunlight, but
the process can take 10 years. Therefore, the rings should be
snipped, recycled or avoided altogether. Surveys have shown that
the rings can strangle birds and fish, but the worst culprit is
abandoned plastic fishing line responsible for 37 percent of marine
entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Destruction of tropical rain forests will cause Earth's
atmosphere to run out of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Oxygen makes up almost 21 percent of atmospheric gases.
Burning all the tropical forests in the world would decrease the
proportion of oxygen by four-hundredths of one percent. Destruction
of tropical rain forests, however, would significantly increase the
concentration of carbon dioxide _ the most important greenhouse gas
_ in the atmosphere by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Household and industrial chemicals are routinely tested
and approved for safe use by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Federal officials do not test pesticides or household
products for safety. They rely on producers to do so.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  The solar-energy market has plateaued.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Worldwide sales of solar cells increased 11 percent a
year from 1990 to 1996, then jumped by 43 percent in 1997 and by
another 28 percent in 1998. Sales of coal and oil have grown by
slightly more than one percent a year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants _ which will
remain radioactive for millions of years _ are safely stored in a
deep underground facility in the West.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  No such long-term storage facility exists. All fuel rods
are stored temporarily at the nation's 103 active nuclear plants.
Another 12 plants have been shut down, but the spent rods are still
stored at the plants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Most oil pollution comes from tankers that run aground
or ships that wash out their holds at sea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  More than twice as much oil gets into the environment
each year because of sloppy activities involving automobiles and
boats. At least 200 million gallons of oil are dumped each year in
the U.S. by people who change their own automobile engine oil.
Overfilling auto gas tanks also contributes to the mess, as do
spills when refilling outboard-motor tanks. However, tens of
thousands of leaky auto engines whizzing over already polluted
urban environments can't compare with the damage done to a pristine
environment by a single oil tanker such as the Exxon Valdez, which
spilled 10 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound in
Alaska in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Aerosol spray cans are the leading source of
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  CFCs were banned from aerosol cans in 1978. They are
still found, however, in many air conditioners and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Government agencies test bottled water for safety and
purity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT &LR; : Bottled water is not tested by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Our national forests are protected from logging, mining
and drilling for oil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Fifty-two percent of national forests are logged, mined
and crisscrossed by more than 373,000 miles of roads, enough to
circle Earth 14 times. Just 18 percent of national forest land is
permanently protected wilderness, and much of that is thin soil
over rock where trees rarely grow.

   Little more than a year ago, on the night of Feb. 9, the
170-foot research ship Wecoma headed west from the Oregon coast
into darkening rough seas. Within hours, the ship was making its
way into a gale. By the next day 45-knot winds were jacking waves
up to heights of 30 feet. Oceanographer Ed Baker remembers Feb. 14
as the worst night of all. Waves crashed over the deck and the wind
would suddenly change direction without warning. The Wecoma pitched
and bucked violently.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the storm, Baker, a researcher at the Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, and his colleagues were
determined to launch a half-ton deepwater probe into the Pacific to
collect evidence of a newly discovered side effect of giant
underwater twisters of hot water, called megaplumes.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the 14th was memorable not only because the seas
were so rough but also because the researchers had to deploy an
acoustic beacon the size of a telephone pole. Baker remembers, ``It
went off without a hitch, but that was probably the scariest part
of the trip.'' Several days later, everyone was relieved when the
beacon began broadcasting data.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage took 10 days but when the Wecoma docked in Oregon,
Baker was happy because the data he and his colleagues had
collected painted a picture of a far more violent spectacle on the
seafloor than the scientists had experienced in the storm on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The first rumblings of that unseen spectacle had begun weeks
earlier, on Jan. 25. A network of sensitive hydrophones in the
North Pacific, deployed by the U.S. Navy to listen for Soviet
submarines, picked up a swarm of earthquakes at the summit of an
undersea volcano called Axial. The quakes shook loose the rock that
had stopped up the volcano's plumbing. Through the newly cleared
rocky pipes came an inferno of molten rock and boiling water driven
upward by the intense pressures and temperatures of the inner Earth
miles below.
</P>
<P>
   A typical volcano on land, such as Mount St. Helens, fills the
sky with a plume of ash when it erupts. But Axial belched forth an
equally massive eruption of superhot water. That was followed by
streams of lava, some as deep as six feet, flowing down the sides
of the volcano. Along Axial's flanks, fields of geysers suddenly
pierced the ocean bottom, shooting up superheated jets of water
darkened with heavy concentrations of minerals from Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimated, roughly, that there were 10 gigawatts of energy
coming out of the volcano's caldera,'' Baker says. ``By comparison,
Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River puts out about one gigawatt,
and that can provide energy for three million homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip on the Wecoma was launched to find out what happens
when all that energy breaks loose. The instruments dropped by Baker
and his fellow oceanographers measured water temperature, current
flow and the chemicals released during the eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was particularly interested in learning more about
megaplumes which can soar more than several thousand feet off the
ocean floor and spin like slow but gargantuan tornadoes. They can
be 12 miles across and travel hundreds of miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bomblike event,'' says Baker, who was among a group of
oceanographers who discovered the phenomenon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The plumes have attracted interest for three reasons. First,
they're new. Second, megaplumes stir up huge amounts of ocean,
carrying minerals and gases and heat almost to the sea's surface.
As they rise from the ocean's depths, megaplumes may bring energy
and food to animals in shallow water. Third, megaplumes move great
distances horizontally, too. In their travels, they may have helped
some of the oddest and oldest beasts in the world colonize the
planet. Megaplumes, which remain intact, spinning and drifting for
months and traveling hundreds of miles, could be mobile ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The Juan de Fuca Ridge which runs right below Axial has garnered
a lot of scientific interest because it runs roughly parallel to
the northwest coast of the United States only 300 miles offshore.
Axial lies on top of a segment midway along the ridge. In 1986 a
research vessel carrying Ed Baker and his colleagues lay above a
southern segment called Cleft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to map the ridge to see where vent fields were
likely to be,'' Baker says. ``We were doing something called a
towyo, where you tow instruments behind the ship and send them up
and down at the same time. This lets you sample the water at
different depths. All of a sudden, we started getting a bunch of
plumelike signals up here'' _ the oceanographer raises his hands,
indicating a point high above the seafloor _ ``in an area where
there shouldn't have been any plumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a while to realize these were plumes ... but
instead of plumes rising 200 meters above the seafloor, we had
plumes 1,000 meters above it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker began to visit other eruption sites at various segments of
the Juan de Fuca Ridge and saw megaplumes at all of them. ``The
plumes are pretty distinctive,'' he says. ``They've got a definite
top and bottom. Their temperature and salt content are different
from the surrounding water. They're warmer, and they're more fresh.
In part that explains why they rise so high _ hot fluids are more
buoyant than cooler ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat is a reason megaplumes maintain their shape. Baker
describes the plumes as similar to underwater hurricanes. Their
shape and movement result from a devilishly complex interaction
between the rising plume and the sideways rotation of the planet.
Viewed from the side, Baker says, a megaplume might initially look
like a huge twirling mushroom but eventually it takes on the form
of a giant Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   Baker has been trying to figure out how megaplumes form and
where they go. To find out the answers to these questions, Baker's
colleague Bob Embley is laying the groundwork for an observatory at
Axial that will be put in place early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a network of sensors and cameras on the seafloor,
transmitting data to buoys near the surface, which in turn bounce
the signals off satellites to Baker's office in Seattle. This New
Millennium Observatory (NeMO, for short) will also employ an
autonomous submarine at a permanent mooring on the site so that a
scientist, after hearing the rumbles of an upcoming eruption, can
tell it to ``please do survey number 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Baker says, with the memory of 10 horrible days at sea
still fresh in his mind, ''I could dial up the results on the Web
from the comfort of my home.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: IS THE SEAFLOOR LIKE A HOT PLATE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How does a megaplume get started? What prompts such a massive
explosion of hot water in such a short time? No one knows for
certain, but two competing views have gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Baker believes in the sponge theory, envisoning a magma dike
shooting up from below, squeezing a massive amount of fluid out the
top of the loose seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   While Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory chemist David
Butterfield envisions megaplumes formed by the geologic hot-plate
theory. ``It's not hard to imagine a magma dike breaching the
seafloor and laying out 1200-degree lava over half a square mile.
That would expose a lot of seawater to heat, but only once. The
water would be warmed as it passed over the molten rock _ like a
pot of water on a hot plate _ and start to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker doesn't buy it. ``These guys envision the megaplumes
forming in a week or so. I think they happen in a much shorter
time, days or hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent voyages to Axial were supposed to test both theories.
however, the researchers found few clues, and the debate still
rages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like being a chemist in a lab where you can say,
'Okay, I want to do this kind of experiment to prove my theory.'
We're sort of at the mercy of Mother Nature here,'' Baker says.

the U.S. by people who change their own automobile engine oil.
Overfilling auto gas tanks also contributes to the mess, as do
spills when refilling outboard-motor tanks. However, tens of
thousands of leaky auto engines whizzing over already polluted

   Little more than a year ago, on the night of Feb. 9, the
170-foot research ship Wecoma headed west from the Oregon coast
into darkening rough seas. Within hours, the ship was making its
way into a gale. By the next day 45-knot winds were jacking waves
up to heights of 30 feet. Oceanographer Ed Baker remembers Feb. 14
as the worst night of all. Waves crashed over the deck and the wind
would suddenly change direction without warning. The Wecoma pitched
and bucked violently.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the storm, Baker, a researcher at the Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, and his colleagues were
determined to launch a half-ton deepwater probe into the Pacific to
collect evidence of a newly discovered side effect of giant
underwater twisters of hot water, called megaplumes.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the 14th was memorable not only because the seas
were so rough but also because the researchers had to deploy an
acoustic beacon the size of a telephone pole. Baker remembers, ``It
went off without a hitch, but that was probably the scariest part
of the trip.'' Several days later, everyone was relieved when the
beacon began broadcasting data.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage took 10 days but when the Wecoma docked in Oregon,
Baker was happy because the data he and his colleagues had
collected painted a picture of a far more violent spectacle on the
seafloor than the scientists had experienced in the storm on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The first rumblings of that unseen spectacle had begun weeks
earlier, on Jan. 25. A network of sensitive hydrophones in the
North Pacific, deployed by the U.S. Navy to listen for Soviet
submarines, picked up a swarm of earthquakes at the summit of an
undersea volcano called Axial. The quakes shook loose the rock that
had stopped up the volcano's plumbing. Through the newly cleared
rocky pipes came an inferno of molten rock and boiling water driven
upward by the intense pressures and temperatures of the inner Earth
miles below.
</P>
<P>
   A typical volcano on land, such as Mount St. Helens, fills the
sky with a plume of ash when it erupts. But Axial belched forth an
equally massive eruption of superhot water. That was followed by
streams of lava, some as deep as six feet, flowing down the sides
of the volcano. Along Axial's flanks, fields of geysers suddenly
pierced the ocean bottom, shooting up superheated jets of water
darkened with heavy concentrations of minerals from Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimated, roughly, that there were 10 gigawatts of energy
coming out of the volcano's caldera,'' Baker says. ``By comparison,
Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River puts out about one gigawatt,
and that can provide energy for three million homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip on the Wecoma was launched to find out what happens
when all that energy breaks loose. The instruments dropped by Baker
and his fellow oceanographers measured water temperature, current
flow and the chemicals released during the eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was particularly interested in learning more about
megaplumes which can soar more than several thousand feet off the
ocean floor and spin like slow but gargantuan tornadoes. They can
be 12 miles across and travel hundreds of miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bomblike event,'' says Baker, who was among a group of
oceanographers who discovered the phenomenon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The plumes have attracted interest for three reasons. First,
they're new. Second, megaplumes stir up huge amounts of ocean,
carrying minerals and gases and heat almost to the sea's surface.
As they rise from the ocean's depths, megaplumes may bring energy
and food to animals in shallow water. Third, megaplumes move great
distances horizontally, too. In their travels, they may have helped
some of the oddest and oldest beasts in the world colonize the
planet. Megaplumes, which remain intact, spinning and drifting for
months and traveling hundreds of miles, could be mobile ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The Juan de Fuca Ridge which runs right below Axial has garnered
a lot of scientific interest because it runs roughly parallel to
the northwest coast of the United States only 300 miles offshore.
Axial lies on top of a segment midway along the ridge. In 1986 a
research vessel carrying Ed Baker and his colleagues lay above a
southern segment called Cleft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to map the ridge to see where vent fields were
likely to be,'' Baker says. ``We were doing something called a
towyo, where you tow instruments behind the ship and send them up
and down at the same time. This lets you sample the water at
different depths. All of a sudden, we started getting a bunch of
plumelike signals up here'' _ the oceanographer raises his hands,
indicating a point high above the seafloor _ ``in an area where
there shouldn't have been any plumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a while to realize these were plumes ... but
instead of plumes rising 200 meters above the seafloor, we had
plumes 1,000 meters above it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker began to visit other eruption sites at various segments of
the Juan de Fuca Ridge and saw megaplumes at all of them. ``The
plumes are pretty distinctive,'' he says. ``They've got a definite
top and bottom. Their temperature and salt content are different
from the surrounding water. They're warmer, and they're more fresh.
In part that explains why they rise so high _ hot fluids are more
buoyant than cooler ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat is a reason megaplumes maintain their shape. Baker
describes the plumes as similar to underwater hurricanes. Their
shape and movement result from a devilishly complex interaction
between the rising plume and the sideways rotation of the planet.
Viewed from the side, Baker says, a megaplume might initially look
like a huge twirling mushroom but eventually it takes on the form
of a giant Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   Baker has been trying to figure out how megaplumes form and
where they go. To find out the answers to these questions, Baker's
colleague Bob Embley is laying the groundwork for an observatory at
Axial that will be put in place early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a network of sensors and cameras on the seafloor,
transmitting data to buoys near the surface, which in turn bounce
the signals off satellites to Baker's office in Seattle. This New
Millennium Observatory (NeMO, for short) will also employ an
autonomous submarine at a permanent mooring on the site so that a
scientist, after hearing the rumbles of an upcoming eruption, can
tell it to ``please do survey number 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Baker says, with the memory of 10 horrible days at sea
still fresh in his mind, ''I could dial up the results on the Web
from the comfort of my home.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: IS THE SEAFLOOR LIKE A HOT PLATE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How does a megaplume get started? What prompts such a massive
explosion of hot water in such a short time? No one knows for
certain, but two competing views have gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Baker believes in the sponge theory, envisoning a magma dike
shooting up from below, squeezing a massive amount of fluid out the
top of the loose seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   While Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory chemist David
Butterfield envisions megaplumes formed by the geologic hot-plate
theory. ``It's not hard to imagine a magma dike breaching the
seafloor and laying out 1200-degree lava over half a square mile.
That would expose a lot of seawater to heat, but only once. The
water would be warmed as it passed over the molten rock _ like a
pot of water on a hot plate _ and start to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker doesn't buy it. ``These guys envision the megaplumes
forming in a week or so. I think they happen in a much shorter
time, days or hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent voyages to Axial were supposed to test both theories.
however, the researchers found few clues, and the debate still
rages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like being a chemist in a lab where you can say,
'Okay, I want to do this kind of experiment to prove my theory.'
We're sort of at the mercy of Mother Nature here,'' Baker says.

<P>
   How does a megaplume get started? What prompts such a massive
explosion of hot water in such a short time? No one knows for
certain, but two competing views have gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Baker believes in the sponge theory, envisoning a magma dike
shooting up from below, squeezing a massive amount of fluid out the
top of the loose seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   While Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory chemist David
Butterfield envisions megaplumes formed by the geologic hot-plate
theory. ``It's not hard to imagine a magma dike breaching the
seafloor and laying out 1200-degree lava over half a square mile.
That would expose a lot of seawater to heat, but only once. The
water would be warmed as it passed over the molten rock _ like a
pot of water on a hot plate _ and start to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker doesn't buy it. ``These guys envision the megaplumes
forming in a week or so. I think they happen in a much shorter
time, days or hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent voyages to Axial were supposed to test both theories.
however, the researchers found few clues, and the debate still
rages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like being a chemist in a lab where you can say,
'Okay, I want to do this kind of experiment to prove my theory.'
We're sort of at the mercy of Mother Nature here,'' Baker says.

   NATO's EUROPEAN MEMBERS
</P>
<P>
   While the governments of all NATO countries support the attack
on Yugoslavia, public support -- and perhaps ultimately political
support -- varies dramatically. following is a breakdown of where
each of the 18 European members of the alliance stands, separated
into four groups: solid supporters, supportive supporters and
reluctant supporters and publicly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   SOLID SUPPORTERS
</P>
<P>
   UNITED KINGDOM
</P>
<P>
   Public Support: 68 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Prime Minister Tony Blair has been a leading hawk and
has strong public support. Second only to the United States in
providing troops and firepower. British
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has been at the forefront of the
public relations assault on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosovic,
often invoking memories of Adolf Hitler. The aggressive British
stance is seen in Europe as a guidepost for the direction U.S.
President Bill Clinton is likely to move. A whopping 54 percent of
Britons favor launching a ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE
</P>
<P>
   Public support: 54 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Not since the '60s have France's leaders worked so
closely and harmoniously with the United States despite deep
misgivings over the growth of U.S. power and influence.
Surprisingly, 55 percent of the French public favors a ground
attack and polls show a strong desire to remove Milosevic from
power.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY
</P>
<P>
   Public support: 57 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Contributing 14 fighter-bomber jets and 3,000 German
troops are in Macedonia. While support for Germany's first armed
campaign in Europe since World War II is high, it is not
unequivocal. A full 63 percent oppose the use of ground troops,
deeply complicating the political challenge for Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder should there be a move toward a land invasion.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLAND
</P>
<P>
   Public support: 78 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: One of most enthusiastic fans of NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   DENMARK
</P>
<P>
   Public Support: 74 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Contributing eight jet fighters and ready to do more.
Support for a ground attack also seems high.
</P>
<P>
   BELGIUM
</P>
<P>
   Public support: 70 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: No substantial political opposition; contributing four
fighter jets and 1,000 personnel.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA
</P>
<P>
   Public support: 64 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Has contributed 12 jet fighters and 650 military
personnel. Stance closely follows that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   NORWAY
</P>
<P>
   Public Support: 64 percent
</P>
<P>
   Pro-NATO government has support from all political parties, and
support is growing for ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   POLAND
</P>
<P>
   Public Support: 54 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Polish government is the most enthusiastic of
NATO's new members from the former Soviet bloc. It has sent 120
soldiers to Macedonia and has expressed
</P>
<P>
   willingness to send more.
</P>
<P>
   LUXEMBOURG
</P>
<P>
   Public support: 60 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Despite popular support, the government of this tiny
country is unenthusiastic about the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ICELAND
</P>
<P>
   Public support: 60 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Doesn't have a military but all for the air strikes
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORTIVE SUPPORTERS
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN
</P>
<P>
   Public support: 55 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The home country of NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana also has a
</P>
<P>
   large percentage of its people -- nearly 40 percent -- in
opposition. The government
</P>
<P>
   has contributed eight warplanes. Spain has no obvious strategic
interests in the
</P>
<P>
   Balkans but is supportive of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   PORTUGAL
</P>
<P>
   Public support: N/A
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The Balkans are a long way away and the Portuguese are
grateful. Offered to make fighter planes available.
</P>
<P>
   RELUCTANT SUPPORTERS
</P>
<P>
   HUNGARY
</P>
<P>
   Public support: 48 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: A ``new'' NATO member as of March 12. Because it
borders Yugoslavia, Hungary is a potential staging area for a
ground attack. This could be difficult politically because 41
percent of the population opposes the air strikes. Many fear the
Serbs, who will be neighbors long after the war is over, have long
memories.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY
</P>
<P>
   Public support: 47 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Also 47 percent of the public opposes NATO's campaign.
Italy is clearly the most reluctant of NATO's major members, even
though it is home to 11 airbases
</P>
<P>
   used in the attack. There are growing fears that Italy, which is
a ferry ride across
</P>
<P>
   the Adriatic Sea from Albania, will have to take on large
numbers of refugees. Italy has sent military doctors and nurses,
tents, volunteers and aid but has been wary of joining several of
its NATO partners in offering temporary homes to the refugees. The
country reluctantly voted for European Union oil embargo against
Yugoslavia. Even so, 60 percent of Italians favor more diplomacy,
while 64 percent oppose a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLICLY OPPOSED SUPPORTERS
</P>
<P>
   CZECH REPUBLIC
</P>
<P>
   Public Support: 35 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Just six weeks after being admitted to the alliance,
the Czech Republic finds itself supporting an attack on a country
with which it has had strong links. President Havel supports the
air strikes even though 57 percent of Hungarians oppose them. The
Czech Republic has allowed the use of its air bases and territory
for NATO air tankers and the transport of war equipment for the
bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   GREECE
</P>
<P>
   Public Support: less than 5 percent
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Athens and Belgrade are old friends. Since the war
began, Greeks have burned U.S. flags. Newspapers have described
NATO as ``criminal'' and TV coverage has
</P>
<P>
   focused on destroyed buildings and cowering residents in
Belgrade and Pristina. Thus
</P>
<P>
   far, the government has been able to position its support for
air strikes as an obligation to NATO. The country also supported
European Union oil embargo against Yugoslavia. Greeks fear NATO
bombing will trigger an influx of thousands of Albanians across
their borders, a civil war in neighboring Macedonia and even
demands for autonomy or separatism from their own Muslim minority
in Thrace, on the border with Turkey.

<P>
   PANAMA:
</P>
<P>
   Capital: Panama City.
</P>
<P>
   Area: 29,208 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Population: 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Location: The Central American republic is located between Costa
Rica and Colombia. It is an S-shaped isthmus that joins the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
</P>
<P>
   President: Ernesto Perez Balladares.
</P>
<P>
   Language: Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Religion: Overwhelmingly Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Economy: Service-oriented, with most of its income derived from
the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   History: Christopher Columbus landed here in 1502. Panama was
joined to Colombia in 1821. The U.S. flag has flown in Panama since
1903, when President Theodore Roosevelt engineered Panama's
separation from Colombia so that the ``big ditch'' could be built.
The United States began building the 50-mile-long Panama Canal in
1904 and completed it in 1914. Under the Panama Canal treaties,
signed by Gen. Omar Torrijos and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter
in 1977, Panama is to take complete control of the canal and all
surrounding property by high noon on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Politics: Presidential elections are scheduled May 2. They pit
the son of a ruling-party strongman against the widow of the man
his father overthrew. Martin Torrijos, son of Gen. Omar Torrijos,
who signed the Panama Canal treaties along with former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, will go up against Mireya Moscoso, widow of
former President Arnulfo Arias. Omar Torrijos headed a coup in 1968
that deposed Arias 11 days after he took office.
</P>
<P>
   TWO MAIN CANDIDATES IN THE MAY 2 RACE:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Martin Torrijos, 35.
</P>
<P>
   Graduated from Texas A&AMP;M University with degrees in political
science and economics. He served as vice minister of the interior
under President Ernesto Perez Balladares. He is the son of the late
dictator, Gen. Omar Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mireya Moscoso, 54.
</P>
<P>
   Widow of former President Arnulfo Arias, who was overthrown by
Gen. Omar Torrijos in 1968. She has no government experience, but
made a strong showing in 1994 when she ran against the current
president, Ernesto Perez Balladares. She's known as a left-leaning
populist who has opposed many of the government's market reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Even from the grave, Panama's cigar-chomping former
dictator, Gen. Omar Torrijos, surely must be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Torrijos had called the U.S. presence in Panama a ``colonialist
tumor'' before negotiating the Panama Canal treaties with his
friend, former President Jimmy Carter, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Now his son, Martin Torrijos, 35, has a good shot at winning
Panama's presidential election on Sunday(5/2) and leading the
country as it takes official custody of the 50-mile-long waterway
at high noon on Dec. 31 under the terms of those treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it would be a remarkable twist of fate for the young
Torrijos to preside over the fulfillment of his father's dream.
</P>
<P>
   But his political ascension is far from being a sure thing as
several polls this week predict a neck-and-neck contest with the
leader of Panama's largest opposition party, Mireya Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, both candidates have played up their
famous relations more than their stands on domestic issues such as
jobs and education.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Torrijos headed a military coup that deposed former
President Arnulfo Arias 11 days after he took office in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful general remained in power until he died in a 1981
airplane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Moscoso is the widow of Arias, a famous three-time
president and the country's most popular civilian politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin is obviously getting a lift from Omar's continued
popularity,'' said Robert Pastor, a Latin America expert at
Atlanta's Emory University who helped negotiate the Panama Canal
treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Running third in Sunday's race is Alberto Vallarino, chief
executive of one of Panama's leading banks. A political newcomer,
he lacks the big party support of the two leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Although Omar Torrijos has been criticized for ushering in 21
years of military rule, he still has a massive following of ardent
supporters who praise him for providing housing and employment for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   To this day the former strongman is viewed as a national hero by
many of his countrymen for negotiating the return of the Panama
Canal, which for decades had been a Yankee thorn in the side of
Panama's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Torrijos was a mere 14 years old when the canal treaties
were negotiated, and was 18 when his father died.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Torrijos graduated from Texas A&AMP;M University with degrees
in economics and political science, and his first job was slinging
hamburgers at a McDonald's restaurant in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He has vowed to oversee a kinder, gentler government that's in
touch with the needs of all segments of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found him to be very intelligent and very charismatic,
just like his father was,'' said Ambler Moss, former U.S.
ambassador to Panama. ``I think he'd be a good leader and represent
continuity in the U.S.-Panama relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso, 54, is a left-leaning populist who has opposed many of
the government's economic reforms -- including privatizations of
state-owned businesses -- worrying some business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But she is a tireless campaigner who made a surprisingly strong
showing in the 1994 election, when she was narrowly defeated by
President Ernesto Perez Balladares.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has seen with her own eyes the poverty that neo-liberal
economic policies have brought to Panama,'' said Guillermo Endara,
a former president who supports Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
   Panama struggles with widespread poverty and a high unemployment
rate of 12.8 percent, despite $100 million in profits annually from
canal tolls and another $300 million derived from the U.S. military
presence in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Besides blasting his economic policies, Moscoso and other
critics have often accused Balladares, as well as his party, the
Democratic Revolutionary Party, of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   That party, founded by Omar Torrijos, today supports Martin
Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the criticism has hurt Martin Torrijos, who has
served the last four years as a deputy minister in the Balladares
administration, which is also viewed by many in Panama as being
riddled with nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, voters expressed their dissatisfaction with
Balladares by overwhelmingly defeating a referendum to change the
constitution allowing Balladares to run for a second consecutive
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since neither of the two leading candidates has a lot
of government experience under their belts, it's the names of their
well-known relations they often invoke when stumping for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Torrijos' campaign headquarters is blanketed with posters
of his father, and even his campaign's theme song is an
enthusiastic tribute to the former dictator entitled ``Omar
Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso, who dresses casually and is praised for her ``common
touch,'' leads a party that's named for her late husband -- the
Arnulfista Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastor insists that Martin Torrijos has a certain charisma
all his own.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that he defeated two opponents with the same
famous last name in last year's presidential primary: his
half-brother, Omar Torrijos Jr., and his cousin, Hugo Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   But even with all the charisma in the world, Martin Torrijos
faces a major challenge if elected: He must ensure the canal runs
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, critics in the United States have expressed
misgivings that a small country of only 2.8 million people with no
military can successfully manage one of the world's most important
transportation lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think there will be mismanagement of the canal,''
said John Sweeney, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government will be tempted to milk the canal for
resources because the economy will take a big hit when the U.S.
military leaves,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the U.S. troops will cost Panama's economy some $300
million a year, or up to 15 percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian government officials say they will more than make up
for that, though, with an expected boom in tourism and new
business.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates promise to run the canal professionally and
to maintain good relations with the United States following the
canal's transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very symbolic if Martin Torrijos wins and oversees
the canal's return, but it will also be a challenge for whoever
wins,'' said Jennifer McCoy, director of the Atlanta-based Carter
Center's Latin America and Caribbean Program. ``All eyes are going
to be on Panama as it takes over the canal.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Chasing dictators, and stumbling
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 2,1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We began the '90s in hot pursuit of one dictator, Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, but did not succeed in ridding the world of him. Already,
we had Panama's Manuel Noriega in a Miami jail, nabbed by U.S.
troops who actually invaded Panama by the thousands to get their
hands on him.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many more despots to pursue. Libya's Moammar
Khadafy is one, Syria's Haffez Assad another and Yugoslavia's
Slobodan Milosevic another; Milosevic being the present focus of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has made it the business of its government and
budget to bring down dictators but, except, for the greasy grab of
Noriega, hasn't succeeded. Despite embargoes and occasional warlike
actions against them, the dictators remain intact, likely more
cherished by their subjects than before as a result of the
nationalism that usually embraces a nation when its leader is
targeted.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, we have Fidel Castro _ the longest running
dictatorship in the world. While the remainder of the planet flocks
to the shores of Cuba to either sun themselves or invest in a
future Cuba, the U.S. stands firm, its teeth clenched _ but that's
all. Nothing changes, the man is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   As American pilots fly sorties over Iraq in 1999, they (and we)
must be wondering why a more complete job wasn't done on Saddam
Hussein at the beginning of this decade, why we quit fighting just
when we were within reach of Saddam's throat. George Bush, Colin
Powell, Dick Cheney and Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf need to explain
that, although I would surmise _ the truth be known _ that they
would not all be in agreement with having let Saddam off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dictators I've referred to aren't simply dictators;
they are butchers _ killers of innocents, destroyers of families,
genocidal practitioners. You can include in that Chile's Augusto
Pinochet, who's got himself pinned down in London by legal actions
emanating from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, one rarely hears the name of Idi Amin any
longer. He was the brutal dictator of Uganda from 1971 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of military service under British colonial rule, Amin
took power with force and kept it that way. His rule is described
as a ``reign of terror'' in which 300,000 Ugandans were reportedly
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of things have been said about Amin that have yet to be
proved, including the appalling claim that he ate the flesh of some
of his victims.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Milosevic and Hussein, however, Amin is not living under
the threat of bombs. This man, acknowledged as one of the world's
cruelest, lives a sedentary life in Saudi Arabia, now deeply
wrapped in an Islamic existence, and reportedly sustained by the
Saudi government.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper reports during the 20 years of Amin's exile have him
shopping for himself in supermarkets, living in a large marble
villa with his wife and about nine of the 43 children he fathered.
It's a pretty good life for a man who was responsible for the
murders of hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S. and its allies, as gentle people of the world
call for the apprehension and trial of vile human rights abusers,
it seems somewhat eerie that Amin has been allowed to slip into the
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   For many, his crimes took place so long ago that they are
forgotten. His marked attempt to erase the Asiatic population of
Uganda seems lost to the ages. He did precisely what Milosevic is
doing in Kosovo; he shoved 70,000 ethnic Asians from inside Uganda.
Today that's called ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no one seems to be pressing Saudi Arabia to turn this man
over to a court. It seems to me that while we're chasing down the
world's dictators _ well, some of them _ we ought to be making
noise about the Saudis hosting and subsidizing Idi Amin; and with
our oil money, no doubt.

 &HT;    What if they held an election and nobody came?
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Low voter turnouts spook politicians like
thunder and lightning spook cattle. In either a low voter turnout
or a stampede, no one has any control, and anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   After a candidate forum last week, Council Member Jackie Goodman
said she took her campaign to the airwaves to make sure her
supporters knew that there was an election Saturday and that she
was running.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a lesson from political history, Goodman observed,
``There's a reason that Attorney General John Hill wasn't Gov. John
Hill.'' In 1978, Hill was the Democratic nominee for governor and
by virtue of the dominant party's nomination was considered a
shoo-in. Despite purveyors of conventional wisdom saying and
believing that, Bill Clements, the Republican, won.
</P>
<P>
   So, Goodman isn't taking the election for granted. Nor should
she.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom is that Goodman and her incumbent colleagues
Daryl Slusher and Beverly Griffith should have little trouble
winning re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Low turnouts have a way of turning conventional wisdom on its
pointy little head. The political cemetery is full of graves of
those conventional wisdom held were immortal.
</P>
<P>
   These days, people who follow Austin politics aren't guessing
who is going to win what and by how much. What people who follow
Austin politics are guessing is how low the turnout will be.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents are especially vulnerable to low-voter turnouts
because their friends aren't as motivated to go vote as their foes.
</P>
<P>
   With little attention paid to the races, neither friend nor foe
is likely to be aware that there is an election.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a low turnout, the candidate with a lot of cousins is
considered viable.
</P>
<P>
   If you think the situation is bad here, consider the single-race
ballots in Round Rock and San Marcos. Candidates in our neighboring
cities and with whom we share an environment, also are concerned
about the apathy greeting their races.
</P>
<P>
   Some say people don't care because times are good. Others say
people don't care because they're happy. Still others say people
don't care because nothing changes whoever wins.
</P>
<P>
   None of those suppositions is any basis for a form of
government, to borrow a line from Monty Python.
</P>
<P>
   Don't give in to apathy. Go vote.

 &HT;    House Calendars Committee: Where bills go to die
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The House Calendars Committee is the
Legislature's equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle. Many bills sail
into it, and particularly in the hectic closing weeks of the
140-day legislative session, some are never heard of again.
</P>
<P>
   After bills are passed out of other committees, Calendars
schedules them for floor debate by the Texas House of
Representatives _ or doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Members fight to get on Calendars because of its power over
bills and bargaining leverage for their own legislative package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely love it,'' said Rep. Debra Danburg (D-Houston),
who is a member this time. ``It gives you a chance to look at all
the bills in advance. It's the only committee through which all
bills must pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has no such committee. It requires a two-thirds vote
to put a bill on the floor; once there, a majority can pass it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate also allows its presiding officer _ the
lieutenant governor, currently Republican Rick Perry _ to decide
which senators to recognize to try for the two-thirds vote to bring
up their bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's one-man calendars committee ``would be a fiasco in
a body with 150 members,'' said Calendars member Brian McCall
(R-Plano). But one-third of the Senate _ any 11 senators _ can
block any bill.
</P>
<P>
   Calendars has 11 members. The chairman is Rep. Barry Telford
(D-Texarkana), a relative teddy bear compared to big, intimidating
past chairmen like Democrats Stan Schlueter of Killeen or Mark
Stiles of Beaumont, who chaired it the past three terms.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles was ``a resounding success. Somebody once described Mark
as a force of nature. He could be terribly brusque,'' Telford said.
``I have to find my own way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry is a real member's member,'' said McCall. ``He wants to
help freshmen get their bills set.''
</P>
<P>
   Telford admitted Calendars, on which he'd never served, was ``a
mystery'' to him before.
</P>
<P>
   Calendars meetings are open, which they haven't always been. But
there is little discussion while nonmembers are present.
</P>
<P>
   The committee usually convenes upon House adjournment, though
late in the session it may meet while the House is meeting. Most
members stand.
</P>
<P>
   One will read a list of bill numbers and move they be reported
to the floor. Members vote, then they adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   But the real meetings have taken place one on one, bill by bill.
Legislators and lobbyists talk to individual Calendars members, and
Calendars members to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk amongst themselves,'' said Cliff Johnson, a lobbyist
who was on Calendars in the 1980s, ``but they don't talk outside
the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes six of the 11 members of the committee to set a bill.
But an unwritten tradition allows each committee member to ``tag''
a bill and hold it up for a week. Enough tags can kill a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about it like there's something mystical about it,
but there's really nothing mystical,'' said Schlueter, now a
lobbyist. ``Somebody has to be the traffic cop, and the chairman
has to try to get all the bills to the floor he can without bogging
things down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the chairman has a lot of power _ and discretion.
And there's always complaints. It's a tough job in that you can't
please everyone. That is the job of the Calendars Committee
chairman _ to take all the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Do House speakers use the committee as their killing ground?
Schlueter, appointed by former House Speaker Gib Lewis, said ``I
got one call from Gib all session _ one.'' And that was to set a
bill, not kill it. Telford said House Speaker Pete Laney leaves him
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Far more common, Schlueter said, are committee chairmen trying
to kill a bill they had let out of their committee. ``So you catch
the blame for killing a bill that the chairman didn't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes legislators _ including senators _ will ask Calendars
members to kill a bill of their own that they carried to please a
constituent or lobby group, but consider unneeded or bad
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done it to my own bills,'' Danburg laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Even busy chairmen of other committees, like Public Education
Committee chairman Paul Sadler (D-Henderson), like belonging to
Calendars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be on it,'' Sadler observed dryly, ``than off it.''

 &HT;    In quest for beauty, liposuction is operation of choice
 &HT;    By Sonja Isger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A taught tummy. Less-lumpy legs. A
chiseled chin.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans head to the doctor's office to retool what they
see in the mirror, liposuction is their procedure of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, nearly 150,000 people had unwanted fat sucked from
their bodies. That's about 40,000 more than had the same procedure
in 1996 and three times the number who sought liposuction in 1992,
according to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in technology accounts for part of the boom. Doctors
can now use ultrasonic equipment or inject fluid into the targeted
pockets and pull out more fat as a result.
</P>
<P>
   That leap means people can see more dramatic results, but it
also may expose them to more risk of serious medical complications.
Doctors and professional associations say liposuction is still
safe, but patients should be educated first.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach plastic surgeon Dr. Fred Barr, and San Francisco
author on plastic surgery Dr. Alan Gaynor answered questions about
the procedure:
</P>
<P>
   Are liposuction and lipoplasty the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   Both: Yes. They refer to the removal, reduction of fat in
specific body areas.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have to have all areas done at once?
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: No, but it saves a lot of time and money if you do. It
takes about $600 to set up an operating room. If you want to do
your stomach one day and the hips another, that's $600 each time.
It's certainly safer to do it once than than several times. But
beware of ``selling up.'' Some doctors, for example, will tell you,
if you do your stomach your hips will be out of balance, so you
should do them too. That should send up flags.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a reasonable alternative to dieting or other medical
procedures to take off weight?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: No. It is not. It will never be replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: Unrelated. If someone is obese, liposuction is not an
answer. But liposuction is not forbidden on overweight people.
</P>
<P>
   What if I'm not overweight at all, but have saddle bags or a
stomach pooch that won't go away? How much fat has to be there to
qualify for the procedure?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: There really isn't a minimum. It becomes an issue of what
the patient is concerned about. We are ``hangup physicians.'' We
are here to help people with their hangups.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: Any that's disproportional. You can take out 2 ounces or
2 pounds on a large portion. You're going after part of their
figure they could never fix on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Can this procedure turn me into a bikini model?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: I think the issue of unrealistic expectations should be
addressed here. If somebody is already a model and spent a
significant amount of time working on their bodies to be what they
need for their career, and then they come in, fine. If you have
somebody who is not modeling, has a sedentary job ... to say you're
going to be spectacular is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: To get someone to look phenomenal with liposuction, they
have to had a good body. Each person can be taken a certain
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Can you be too old for liposuction _ too old for your skin to
snap back?
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: In the stomach, yes. But there are 80-year-olds that you
can improve their saddle bags. And then again, you can't do all
25-year-olds either.
</P>
<P>
   How many incisions do you make? How big are they? And do they
scar afterwards?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: Usually the incisions are about 1/2 an inch or less. At
least one, sometimes two, sometimes three. Everybody has a scar.
Obviously, as plastic surgeons, we try to hide them. But they may
raise up, discolor, become numb.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: The ones that show a bit more are on the hips because
there's no natural place to hide them. So then I tell my patients
to bring a bikini so we can put it on the bikini lines.
</P>
<P>
   What type of anesthesia is used (am I awake for the operation?
Do I feel anything?)
</P>
<P>
   Barr: Everybody has their own method. I use spinal or general.
My patient would be asleep. People do them awake under conscious
sedation.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: For stomach-only or hips-only, you can use local, but
others might use IV medication. For the whole body, you can use
general, epidural where they're awake _ like Clinton had when he
hurt his knee _ or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   Can you take the fat out and put it somewhere else, such as my
lips, during the same operation?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: You can with traditional liposuction. Not with ultrasonic
(where the fat is emulsified before removal). The only thing of
controversy is putting fat in the breast areas.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: I'm the king of that. I took it out of Geraldo's buns
and put it in his face.
</P>
<P>
   How soon will I see the results?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: You'll see results in the first two weeks or so. But there
can be swelling, hardness and lumpiness in that time. They resolve
in three to six months. To improve results, we recommend our
patients massage the area four times a day with moisturizing cream
and spend time in whirlpools.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: I'd say 40 percent of change in six weeks, more up to
six months. After six months, what you see is what you get.
</P>
<P>
   Will this get rid of cellulite?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: No. And that's a problem because cellulite is a
disturbance of the surface attachment of muscle, skin and fat.
Sometimes liposuction can worsen those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: Any doctor or any ad that tells you this can treat
cellulite is a medical fraud. Same thing for stretch marks. But
we're working on it.
</P>
<P>
   How many days off do I need to take from work?
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: A liposuction on the stomach, you could go to work in
the next two or three days. A full body, five to six days.
</P>
<P>
   What will I feel like that day? That week?
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: It hurts like crazy. It feels like you've won the
Marines situp contest. But we can give you medication, then you're
just uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Will the fat return?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: The liposuction will remove fat cells permanently, but the
existing cells will swell with weight gain. You may gain it first
in other areas, but you will eventually gain in those areas. Don't
gain, maintain.
</P>
<P>
   What are the risks?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: Bleeding, infection, scaring, irregularities of contour,
swelling of the extremities, asymmetries. With the ultrasonic
liposuction you've got to add in there burn wounds.
</P>
<P>
   How many mortgage payments will I have to skip to pay for this?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: It really depends on how you're doing the procedure _
office vs. in-patient. It's really variable. Fees are not in
general major expenses _ from $500 to several thousand dollars.

</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: In the stomach, yes. But there are 80-year-olds that you
can improve their saddle bags. And then again, you can't do all
25-year-olds either.
</P>
<P>
   How many incisions do you make? How big are they? And do they
scar afterwards?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: Usually the incisions are about 1/2 an inch or less. At
least one, sometimes two, sometimes three. Everybody has a scar.
Obviously, as plastic surgeons, we try to hide them. But they may
raise up, discolor, become numb.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: The ones that show a bit more are on the hips because
there's no natural place to hide them. So then I tell my patients
to bring a bikini so we can put it on the bikini lines.
</P>
<P>
   What type of anesthesia is used (am I awake for the operation?
Do I feel anything?)
</P>
<P>
   Barr: Everybody has their own method. I use spinal or general.
My patient would be asleep. People do them awake under conscious
sedation.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: For stomach-only or hips-only, you can use local, but
others might use IV medication. For the whole body, you can use
general, epidural where they're awake _ like Clinton had when he
hurt his knee _ or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   Can you take the fat out and put it somewhere else, such as my
lips, during the same operation?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: You can with traditional liposuction. Not with ultrasonic
(where the fat is emulsified before removal). The only thing of
controversy is putting fat in the breast areas.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: I'm the king of that. I took it out of Geraldo's buns
and put it in his face.
</P>
<P>
   How soon will I see the results?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: You'll see results in the first two weeks or so. But there
can be swelling, hardness and lumpiness in that time. They resolve
in three to six months. To improve results, we recommend our
patients massage the area four times a day with moisturizing cream
and spend time in whirlpools.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: I'd say 40 percent of change in six weeks, more up to
six months. After six months, what you see is what you get.
</P>
<P>
   Will this get rid of cellulite?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: No. And that's a problem because cellulite is a
disturbance of the surface attachment of muscle, skin and fat.
Sometimes liposuction can worsen those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: Any doctor or any ad that tells you this can treat
cellulite is a medical fraud. Same thing for stretch marks. But
we're working on it.
</P>
<P>
   How many days off do I need to take from work?
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: A liposuction on the stomach, you could go to work in
the next two or three days. A full body, five to six days.
</P>
<P>
   What will I feel like that day? That week?
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor: It hurts like crazy. It feels like you've won the
Marines situp contest. But we can give you medication, then you're
just uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Will the fat return?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: The liposuction will remove fat cells permanently, but the
existing cells will swell with weight gain. You may gain it first
in other areas, but you will eventually gain in those areas. Don't
gain, maintain.
</P>
<P>
   What are the risks?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: Bleeding, infection, scaring, irregularities of contour,
swelling of the extremities, asymmetries. With the ultrasonic
liposuction you've got to add in there burn wounds.
</P>
<P>
   How many mortgage payments will I have to skip to pay for this?
</P>
<P>
   Barr: It really depends on how you're doing the procedure _
office vs. in-patient. It's really variable. Fees are not in
general major expenses _ from $500 to several thousand dollars.

Clinton was attracted to her bubbly personality. To the way, he

 &HT;    Examine adult males' exploitative role in teen pregnancy
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole have stated that
rape would be one of few factors considered in granting an abortion
if they could amend the U.S. Constitution. Life-or-death medical
necessity would be another.
</P>
<P>
   How to write a constitutional amendment or statute to reflect
that: Medical necessity _ on one doctor's word? On decree of a
medical congress?
</P>
<P>
   Rape is even more problematic. The next time Bush or Dole
broaches the subject, someone ask, ``Does that include statutory
rape?''
</P>
<P>
   If the latter is the case, the candidates would allow a lot of
legal abortions and, presumably, be prosecuting more rape trials
than one can imagine. For by definition in most states, a vast
number of teen pregnancies, maybe the majority, are the result of
statutory rape.
</P>
<P>
   A nasty little matter too commonly downplayed: Most teen moms
are impregnated by adult males. Roughly half of the babies born to
mothers age 15 to 17 have fathers older than 20. Though the girls'
participation is consensual and irresponsible, they are the true
embodiment of girls getting swept off her feet.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Planned Parenthood seminar called ``Unequal Partners''
addressed this, focusing particularly on ways to get teen girls to
foresee the potential problems of being squired by older males.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want government to make tricky personal judgment
calls, this is one of the most compelling puzzles: Sometimes
there's a fine line between romance and rape.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 study by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy
found that more than 80 percent of teen girls engaging in
intercourse for the first time did so with older males, that 45
percent involved an age gap of two to four years, that 17 percent
had a gap of up to five years, and that 11.8 percent involved a
male five or more years older.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the phrase ``children having children'' is only
half right in so many cases. The fathers have left their childhood
behind. They've also left a teen's childhood in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The starkest reality is what happens when when the girl gets
pregnant. That special someone, so responsible and mature _ he's
gone.
</P>
<P>
   The girls are far from not blameless. But Lynn Phillips, whose
study for Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey is used
in ``Unequal Partners,'' points out the ominous impressions that
draw some girls into these straits.
</P>
<P>
   Older males are seen by teen girls not only as more wealthy and
mobile _ that car, that apartment _ but also as ``more likely than
teens to be monogamous.'' The girl presumes Mr. Dream-Boat's wild
oats have already been sown.
</P>
<P>
   However, reported Phillips, the adult men she studied in these
situations ``were no more likely to take responsibility for
pregnancy and child rearing than were adolescent partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips also found young girls taking less care to use birth
control with older males who looked more like the marrying type
than teens, or at least more like the type to stand by them if they
got pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   This dynamic must be front and center in the discussion of teen
sexuality, the fact that a young girl being romanced by a mature
candidate for the altar may only become a notch on his bedpost.
</P>
<P>
   Should these adults be prosecuted for rape? California has taken
a more aggressive stance in so doing. But the extent of the problem
is such that one exploitative seed-sower unto himself is but a
grain of sand on a long, long beach.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is laying out the facts and getting girls to think
about ways to spare themselves life-altering pregnancies or the
abortion dilemma. Meanwhile, candidates: Rape or romance? Are you
ready for government to make the call?

 &HT;    Georgia's Cash 3 a bad bet for payouts to treasury
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time in its history, the Georgia Lottery
Corp. last year fell short of its target for funding education, the
main selling point used to win voter approval in 1992 for a state
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   State officials blame a statistical fluke in big payouts for
Cash 3, the lottery's most popular game. But it is the second
consecutive year lottery officials have faced the payout problem
caused by the fixed-odds, casino-style game.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials drained an $8 million Cash 3 reserve they
control to plug the gap the first year, so they couldn't turn to
that reserve again.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires the lottery to return, in ``as nearly as
practical'' a manner, 35 percent of its net proceeds to the
treasury, where it can be appropriated by the General Assembly for
HOPE scholarships, pre-kindergarten programs, and school
construction and technology.
</P>
<P>
   But payments dipped to 33 percent for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1998, according to State Auditor Claude Vickers. The $555
million transferred to the state was more than enough to cover HOPE
and pre-K costs, but was $33 million below the statutory target.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers said the lottery came up short because of unusually high
payouts to winners of Cash 3, particularly those who bet triple
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law of averages caught up with us on those triple
numbers,'' he said. ``But since the inception of the lottery, we're
really close to a 35 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reasonable person, in looking at the way they've conducted
their business ... would conclude they're probably doing it
right,'' the auditor said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes said he was pleased with the way the lottery was
being run.
</P>
<P>
   But Harold Parker, state president of Common Cause _ a
nonprofit, nonpartisan citizens lobbying group based in Washington,
D.C. _ said the law shouldn't allow the lottery leeway with the
language ``as nearly as practical'' concerning a 35 percent payout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a loophole you could drive a bus through,'' Parker
said. ``The lottery should make up the difference out of their
advertising budget in order to honor their commitment to
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Hooks (D-Americus), chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, wasn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're on safe ground,'' said Hooks, who helps decide
how lottery money is spent. ``We fully funded HOPE and pre-k, and
our lottery reserves (within the state treasury) are full.''
</P>
<P>
   However, temporary shortfalls could affect discretionary capital
spending for projects such as computers or school construction,
Hooks noted. ``We need to keep an eye on it,'' he said. Lottery
President Rebecca Paul said there was little she could have done to
attain the 35 percent target last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have cut our ad budget and fired everybody and still
not make up the big Cash 3 payouts,'' Paul said. The lottery spent
$17.4 million on advertising in fiscal 1998, about half of that
year's shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Cash 3 generated ticket sales of $627 million that same year.
</P>
<P>
   The game is designed to pay out 50 percent of ticket sales.
Players pay either a dollar or 50 cents to pick a number between
000 and 999. If their number is randomly selected, they win $500 or
$250, depending on the size of their bet.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination of numbers can be bet, and any has an equal
chance of winning. But players tend to prefer triple numbers, such
as ``888'' or ``444,'' and the lottery sometimes has to pay
thousands of winners when one is drawn.
</P>
<P>
   From December 1997 to February 1998, triples were drawn four
times. The lottery's total liability on those four drawings
exceeded $50 million. As a result, the lottery paid out 53.50 cents
in prizes for each $1 in Cash 3 sales in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The year before was even worse; the average payout was 53.99
cents per dollar.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the 35 percent contribution target, Paul said, the
lottery emptied an $8 million Cash 3 reserve account and
transferred $7.7 million from an unclaimed prizes fund.
</P>
<P>
   It also intentionally reduced payouts on scratch-off games, but
that strategy backfired by driving players away.
</P>
<P>
   So last year, Paul significantly raised scratch-off payout
ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Raising scratch-off payouts made it harder to meet the 35
percent payback target, but it spurred sales. Paul said Georgia is
on track to have its fifth straight increase in annual sales this
year, a rare accomplishment for a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the lottery would meet the 35 percent payback
target this fiscal year, she said: ``We'll be 34 percent and
change. Our goal is to raise dollars, not achieve percentages.''
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1998, Georgia was 15th among 38 state lotteries in the
percentage of proceeds returned to the government, according to La
Fleur's Lottery World, a Maryland-based trade publication.
Georgians rank third nationally in spending a percentage of their
income on the state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   That ranking could suffer if Alabama and South Carolina approve
their own lotteries as expected. But Paul said there is little
danger the Georgia Lottery won't be able to sustain the needs of
its highest-priority programs _ HOPE and pre-k.

 &HT;    'Pushing Tin' takes flight of fancy
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Critics have generally liked ``Pushing Tin,''
the romantic comedy about two fiercely competitive air traffic
controllers, starring John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton. The movie
opened last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say most movie critics don't know diddly about
guiding planes from the heavens to terra firma. Viewers who do _
namely real air traffic controllers _ have a different spin on the
film, and they are not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most controllers didn't like it,'' says Austin air traffic
controller Ed Mears, who works at the Terminal Radar Approach
Control (TRACON) center at the new Austin-Bergstrom International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a medical guy watching 'ER' or 'MASH,''' he says. To
these guys, the film's inaccuracies about the job stick out in
high, irritating relief. ``They forget it's a movie,'' says Mears
of his naysaying colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   (For the record, Mears didn't hate the film. ``It had
entertaining moments, but I don't think we're going to see it at
the Oscars.'')
</P>
<P>
   Mears, who is the local president of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, is a 16-year veteran of ``pushing tin'' _
a term he knows but rarely hears.
</P>
<P>
   We asked Mears where the sometimes tech-heavy ``Pushing Tin''
hit the mark _ and where it lost altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How accurately does the film depict your job?
</P>
<P>
   A: From a technical standpoint, parts of it were real accurate,
parts of it were not. A colleague said that at least now people
don't think we're the guys with the flashlights directing the
aircraft. Those guys work for the airlines. We call them ``ramp
rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the film's TRACON look authentic?
</P>
<P>
   A: They built their own TRACON because the FAA wouldn't let them
in the building. It looks very accurate. The lights are up too
(bright), which you have to have for a movie. In ours you're kind
of feeling your way around the dark. The display on the radar
scopes is not color like they are in the movie, it's just green.
Their phraseology is pretty accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For kicks, Thornton and Cusack's characters lay on a runway
as a 747 lands. They get whipped around like dolls in a twister. Is
this likely?
</P>
<P>
   A: It would throw a plane around, so I guess it would throw a
person around. That part is accurate. With a 747, planes have to be
five miles behind them. The wake turbulence from the lift of the
wings looks like horizontal tornadoes. It'll throw a jet and loop a
little plane.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the workplace as festive and frat housey as it is in the
movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: That was inaccurate. It seemed like the guys who were working
could get up at will and walk across the room and get into a
conversation. You can't do that. We can get slow enough here where
we could turn around and talk to a guy for a second. But not in New
York. Another inaccuracy is the constant crowd hanging out in
TRACON. If they're not plugged in working they're not going to hang
out in TRACON; they're going to be in the break room. It seemed
like a moving pack of groupies going from scope to scope. That
would be terribly distracting. You don't want someone behind you
distracting you, because you've got to hang on to that mental 3-D
picture you have.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else was false?
</P>
<P>
   A: How they put aircraft in jeopardy for their personal
squabbles. When they got into a fist fight on the floor when they
had a lot of traffic, that was bizarre. Thornton's training was
interesting. He showed up and they sat down with him for what
looked like 15 minutes. It would take at least six months, I don't
care how good he is. And they wouldn't have cleared the building
during a bomb threat, either. They didn't when we had one!
</P>
<P>
   Q: What struck you as really accurate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The lack of empathy for weak controllers. Part of the whole
controller thing, unfortunately, is we tend to feed on our own. If
controllers smell blood, there are sharks in the water. You show
weakness, you're dead.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So the job is as competitive as it looks?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's very ego-driven and the guys are very self-confident
because you have to be very sure what you're saying. If it comes
across in your voice that you're not, the pilots won't listen to
you. That's what you do. You tell them to turn left, turn right, go
up, go down, stop, go fast, and you have to be sure of what you're
doing. Most controllers think they're the best one. I'm smarter
than that (laughs). I'm not the best one.

 &HT;    Silver-gilded soccer revival
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The latecomers kept piling onto the concrete seating
at DeKalb Memorial Stadium, many of them children in full uniforms.
Concession and beer and wine lines curled around the ends of the
concourses. The staff and management of the Atlanta Silverbacks,
who drew a local A-League record crowd of 8,416 for their season
opener April 17, clearly were surprised _ and happily so _ by the
deluge of spectators.
</P>
<P>
   It's a problem they're glad to have, as they revive a franchise
that was on the verge of collapse less than a year ago. When
co-owners John Latham and Bobby Glustrom took over the former
Ruckus last June, barely a hundred people were turning out for
games, the latest debacle in a series of flops for professional
soccer in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After several months of trying to repair the damage caused by
their predecessors, Latham and Glustrom will get a true test of
their commitment over the next few days in what figures to be one
of the biggest soccer weekends in Atlanta in years. The Silverbacks
play the Jacksonville Cyclones Saturday night, then will serve as
hosts Sunday afternoon for a ``friendly'' match at DeKalb Memorial
between the U.S. women's national team and Japan. More than 9,000
tickets have been sold for that nationally televised match, part of
the American team's exhibition tour to promote the Women's World
Cup that begins in June.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Georgia State Soccer Association, in conjunction
with a number of business, political and soccer leaders from the
metro area, will announce plans for a soccer-only complex that
includes a 25,000-seat stadium and adjoining fields in the northern
Atlanta suburbs. For a city that has had a checkered history of
supporting soccer as a spectator sport, could these events be a
major turning point?
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any idea we'd get the attendance we did, but
we're going to be anticipating good crowds from now on,'' said
Glustrom, the president of an international bank in midtown
Atlanta. ``The grass-roots involvement in soccer in Georgia is
finally starting to translate into a desire for high-quality
professional soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Chiefs coach and North American Soccer League
commissioner Phil Woosnam has felt that way for nearly three
decades. He is a key figure in the secretive plan to create what is
being dubbed the ``Atlanta Soccer Village,'' which might be located
in north Fulton County or near Doraville.
</P>
<P>
   Woosnam's long-stated desire is to attract an MLS franchise to
the city. The league considered Atlanta in its start-up plans in
1996, but backed out because of the Olympics and the lack of a
suitable stadium, local investors and strong community support.
Nearly three years after the Atlanta games, those other factors
might be coming into shape. ``There's a lot of momentum now,'' said
Rick Skirvin, executive director of the GSSA, which began hashing
out Soccer Village options last fall. ``This has more real
potential than anything we've ever seen in this state. There's such
significant momentum that this is going to be a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Silverbacks are making do with a 15,000-seat high
school football stadium and emphasizing outreach, particularly to
families with soccer-playing children and the metro area's
burgeoning Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   Latham and Glustrom require that players stay on the field after
games to sign autographs. A season ticket costs $55 for adults,
roughly the price of two field-level seats for a single Braves
game.
</P>
<P>
   Latham is a partner in the Atlanta law firm Alston and Bird and
a legal representative for Umbro, the A-League's main sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Glustrom, who has three soccer-playing sons, said, ``This is
what we want the Silverbacks to be about: an affordable,
people-friendly alternative to Turner Field and $40 tickets and the
big crowds that often make it tough for families to enjoy a night
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes have been great,'' said Silverbacks defender Brian
Crane, who came to the Ruckus in 1996 and quit last season before
deciding to come back. ``From the top down, they're trying to do
everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   On another front, MLS is planning to expand by two more cities _
most likely Philadelphia and Houston _ either by next season or
2001. The next wave of expansion after that could come as early as
2003, and Atlanta is one of at least six cities being looked at,
along with San Diego, a second New York City team, Rochester, N.Y.,
Portland, Ore., and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Atlanta as a sound market, one that has the
demographics we're looking for,'' said Christopher Pepe, an
assistant to MLS commissioner Doug Logan for expansion matters.
``Whether it can support soccer like Philadelphia or Houston, for
example, we can't say right now. But we're continuing to look into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woosnam and Atlanta public relations executive Amanda Brown
Olmstead have been the central players in persuading disparate
elements of the area's business, political and soccer communities
to get behind the Soccer Village plan. However, they have refused
to divulge essential details, including location, capacity,
financing, zoning and possible tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Woosnam _ whom Pepe called ``the heart and soul and driving
force of the effort to get MLS in Atlanta'' _ declined any comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Silverbacks' more immediate goals are to work with the
DeKalb Board of Education to ensure a long-term beer and wine
license, tear out the track surrounding the DeKalb Memorial field
for wider soccer configurations and overhaul a patchy, rocky
playing surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to DeKalb Memorial,'' said Latham, who served
on the GSSA's advisory board for the Soccer Village. ``Whether
something else becomes an alternative to what we already have, we
can't say for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, that's not a choice that confronts us. We need to
prove that we can crawl before we walk.''

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Forget melatonin and faddish diets. When it comes to jet lag,
that traveler's hangover of digestive ailments, sleep deprivation
and moodiness, it's best to turn on the lights.
 &HT;    That's the contention of Dr. Martin Moore-Ede, a Harvard Medical
School professor for 25 years, who says that ``external and
internal desynchronization'' are the major culprits. Moore-Ede is
now president of Circadian Technologies in Cambridge, Mass., a
company that deals with issues of sleep and productivity for major
U.S. corporations, and the co-author of ``The Complete Idiot's
Guide to Getting a Good Night's Sleep'' (Macmillan, 1998; $16.95)
with Suzanne LeVert.
 &HT;    ``You're asking your body to cope with a sudden shift from day
to night,'' Moore-Ede points out. ``You're cramped in a plane with
low humidity, and you're dehydrated regardless of what you consume.
And when you get there, you're required to sleep at times that are
counter to your biology.''
 &HT;    Moore-Ede believes that once travelers determine whether they
are a ``morning lark'' or a ``night owl,'' they can counter the
effects of jet lag with massive doses of light at the proper time.
They must factor in which direction they're flying, how many time
zones they've skipped and how much sleep they've lost.
 &HT;    As for other methods of dealing with jet lag, Moore-Ede says,
``There's no data whatsoever'' to support jet lag diets and there
are clear dangers to using faddish drugs like melatonin. Instead,
he believes in using light and making some sensible travel
decisions.
 &HT;    ``First, your choice of flights and times is quite
significant,'' he says. ``Certain flights are better suited to
certain types of people.''
 &HT;    Moore-Ede says that morning people who can adapt well to going
to bed early and then rapidly adjust to a new time zone should take
advantage of daytime flights from the United States to Europe.
 &HT;    ``But if you're a morning person and there isn't a daytime
flight,'' Moore-Ede says, ``take an early evening flight that gets
you into Europe anywhere from 4:30 a.m. to 7 a.m. and then go to
bed immediately when you arrive.''
 &HT;    For night owls heading to Europe, ``you may do well by taking
the latest evening flight that you can find and then try to sleep
on the plane,'' he adds. ``You don't want a flight that gets you in
at 6 a.m. local time. You want to get in as close to noon as you
can.''
 &HT;    For today's business travelers who are making a relativey short
trip to Asia or Europe, Moore-Ede says that ``there's considerable
logic to not adjusting your biological clock at all but simply
adapting as best as you can, and staying on your home time zone.''
 &HT;    As for getting that precious sleep upon arrival, look for hotels
that cater to business travelers. Some Hiltons, for example, have
special rooms with blackout drapes and extra soundproofing and have
specially trained their housekeeping staff not to disturb guests.
 &HT;    But the two key components for dealing with jet lag are light
and dark, says Moore-Ede, who was a member of the Harvard team that
discovered in the human brain the cluster of nerve cells known as
the suprachiasmatic nuclei, or SCN.
 &HT;    ``The SCN regulates the 25-hour time clock that we are believed
to have and it enables early morning light to reset our clocks to a
24-hour day, every day,'' Moore-Ede says.
 &HT;    To reduce jet lag, Moore-Ede suggests using heavy doses of light
to both reset and advance time clocks based on individual sleep
personalities and the distance traveled.
 &HT;    His theory is that any light that a traveler receives before 5
a.m. home time shifts his or her time clock westbound. Light
received after 5 a.m. home time will shift it eastbound. The amount
of light needed to make a real adjustment is measured in lux, a
metric unit used to quantify the intensity of visible light.
Moore-Ede says that one needs about 2,500 lux to move one's body
clock one hour or more in a single dose.
 &HT;    Moore-Ede notes that a room lit with 100-watt lightbulbs will
produce only about 200 to 500 lux. With his corporate clients, he
uses a light visor called Bio-Brite to deliver the required number
of lux to them when they're sitting in a hotel room or on a plane.
 &HT;    His clients also use his software program, Midnight Sun, to
figure out how much light they'll need. This program can tell them
before they get on a flight to Japan this afternoon the exact time
of dawn in Tokyo tomorrow. It will inform them of how long a dose
of light they'll need in flight and how much they'll need upon
arrival.
 &HT;    But for those who don't have $300 to spend on a Bio-Brite light
visor, let alone the money for the software program, Moore-Ede says
to simply go outside. He maintains that a cloudy day yields about
10,000 lux while a sunny blue sky provides a whopping 50,000 lux.
 &HT;    The disappointing news is that even with concentrated doses of
light, jet lag won't be completely eliminated. But it should make
the transition from the United States to Paris or Tokyo or Tel Aviv
that much easier.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The enthusiastic guide in the ornate Victorian house draws the
members of the tour group along just as a real estate salesman
might, urging them to think of themselves as residents, make
decorating decisions and choose their bedrooms.
 &HT;    Joe Wolfenden, a guide in the Old Governor's Mansion in
California's capital city of Sacramento, tells stories relating to
each room. When he points to gowns worn by women in former Gov.
Earl Warren's household, he muses that his mother-in-law, Florence
Muschetto, may have been the seamstress who made one of the
dresses.
 &HT;    As you leave the mansion, whistles shriek across the treetops _
some from steam trains, some from sternwheelers.
 &HT;    Sacramento is a city that offers mature travelers insights into
history, railroading, riverboats, traditional jazz, politics and
gold fever. And it constantly adds new items to its repertoire. For
inquisitive travelers, Sacramento can be an in-depth and leisurely
learning experience in an easy-to-take climate.
 &HT;    The spirit of modern Sacramento depends on the many ghosts of
Sacramento's past _ like John Sutter, whose fort was the
provisioning headquarters for the 49ers in search of their fortunes
150 years ago. Touches of the golden heritage are everywhere:
melted gold coins creating the crown on the State Capitol, the
burnished golden onion domes of the Russian Orthodox Church, broad
golden bands circling china plates in the governor's mansion.
 &HT;    Sacramento was the site of the genesis of the gold rush that
tilted our nation west; the jumping-off place for the
transcontinental railroad that tied this nation together
economically; and the launching pad for the political dreams of
several notable people.
 &HT;    Sitting in the midst of rich agricultural acreage and a
meandering river delta, Sacramento is often overlooked in favor of
bigger, brassier California cities with their film and high-tech
industries. But it is easy to be surprised while sampling
Sacramento and to come away with tidbits of the past that make
today easier to understand. For instance:
 &HT;    _ The music room in the Old Governor's Mansion (1526 H St.),
where guests sang show tunes while an aide to Gov. Ronald Reagan,
Michael Deaver, played the piano.
 &HT;    _ The State Capitol's assembly chambers (10th &AMP; L streets),
which simultaneously boast chairs for representatives of the
English crown and display computers on each of its 130-year-old
desks. Or the brightly colored modernistic portrait of Gov. Jerry
Brown in the halls of the Capitol hanging beside more somber,
formal portraits of his predecessors, including his father, Gov.
Pat Brown.
 &HT;    _ The living history scenes showcased regularly at Sutter's Fort
(27th &AMP; L streets). They tell stories about life when the fort
stood alone on the Sacramento plain in 1847 through the gold rush
frenzy of 1849 until 1857, when the rush was over and the frontier
gone.
 &HT;    _ The Sierra scene in the California State Railroad Museum (2nd
and I streets), which tips its hat in tribute to the lives and
deaths of thousands of Chinese workers who helped build the
transcontinental railroad, a great civil engineering feat. You can
even catch a ride on the Sacramento Southern Railroad steam train
on weekends from April through September.
 &HT;    _ The Huntington, Hopkins &AMP; Co. Hardware Store sign in Old
Sacramento (113 I St.), which tells you clearly that a quartet of
merchants who sold hardware, groceries and dry goods could become
the Big Four railroaders, who had great influence in the worlds of
politics and finance.
 &HT;    It had been some time since we lingered in Sacramento. So when
we had a chance to stay awhile and wander the vast and comfortable
neighborhoods studded with architecture of every era and bike the
tidy trails along the American River, we relished renewing our old
friendship. We enjoyed not only the attractions in the city itself,
but neighboring areas where we could prospect for gold, hunt for
antiques, go river rafting or walk around historic neighborhoods.
And this year, added attractions include celebrations of the
Sesquicentennial of the Gold Rush.
 &HT;    My, how Sacramento has grown! Not so much in size as in style.
 &HT;    Monolithic government buildings of every hue and style cozy up
to gingerbread Victorians, some commanding high banks that once
helped thwart river floods, others with elevated porches and
staircases leading past unusual first-floor delta basements.
 &HT;    Quiet, clean, light-rail trains slide beside horse-drawn
carriages and lines of cars and trucks. Nouveau restaurants have
moved into warehouse districts and car showrooms. Their tables
spill outside, where patrons lounge on even the warmest (100-plus
degrees) or coldest days (around 35 degrees).
 &HT;    Sidewalks deviate from their straight lines to meander around
the bases of big leafy trees, towering palms and dusty evergreens.
 &HT;    New museums have popped up, such as the McClellan Aviation
Museum (3204 Palm St., McClellan Air Force Base, 916/643-3192, free
admission), which now displays approximately 31 vintage aircraft.
 &HT;    Another is the innovative Golden State Museum (1020 O St.,
916/653-4255, $5 admission for seniors), showcasing the people and
politics of California through interactive exhibits. For example,
you can climb inside a bus to hear the voices of those who
immigrated to ``Golden Mountain,'' as the Chinese referred to
California.
 &HT;    More established museums offer mini-theatricals with docents
dressed in costumes of the era or stage elaborate multi-day
festivals. One upcoming festival offered by the California State
Railroad Museum is Railfair '99 (June 18-27, 1999), which will
feature locomotives and railroad cars as well as live entertainment
and living history demonstrations to highlight the ways railroads
have made a difference in our lives.
 &HT;    Railfair prices for those 62 and older are $1 off whatever
admission you buy, from a one-day to a 10-day pass. Those buying
tickets in advance _ before June 17 _ get an additional $4 off.
Call 916/445-6645 for information.
 &HT;    And this year, dozens of special events are planned to celebrate
the Gold Rush anniversary, including ``Gold Fever!'' (Aug. 1-Oct.
31), an interactive, multimedia exhibition that is one of the
anniversary centerpieces. It will be held in Sacramento's Memorial
Auditorium at 15th &AMP; J streets (916/264-7072). Admission for those
65 and older is $6.
 &HT;    Sacramento's Old Town will convert itself into a theme park with
sawdust-filled streets for The Second Great Gold Rush from Sept. 3
to 6, featuring reenactments of everything from a horse-drawn
funeral to the arrival of the Pony Express. Call 916/264-8141 for
ticket info.
 &HT;    Earlier in the year, on Memorial Day weekend (May 28-31), the
city will resound with the music of the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee
(916/372-5277). Jazz concerts in dozens of venues from one end of
the city to the other will showcase bands from around the world and
across the United States, while aficionados dress up in costume and
dance and swing whenever the beat moves them. Daily tickets range
from $16 for half-day admission to $80 for the weekend; admission
on Monday is half-price for seniors.
 &HT;    Trains and planes and boats and all that jazz _ these are the
grown-up toys that hold fascination for many mature travelers and
are so much a part of the Sacramento of today.
 &HT;    For your copy of the Sacramento Vacation Planner with details
about these and other attractions, call 916/264-5553 or visit the

but neighboring areas where we could prospect for gold, hunt for
antiques, go river rafting or walk around historic neighborhoods.
And this year, added attractions include celebrations of the
Sesquicentennial of the Gold Rush.
 &HT;    My, how Sacramento has grown! Not so much in size as in style.
 &HT;    Monolithic government buildings of every hue and style cozy up
to gingerbread Victorians, some commanding high banks that once
helped thwart river floods, others with elevated porches and
staircases leading past unusual first-floor delta basements.
 &HT;    Quiet, clean, light-rail trains slide beside horse-drawn
carriages and lines of cars and trucks. Nouveau restaurants have
moved into warehouse districts and car showrooms. Their tables
spill outside, where patrons lounge on even the warmest (100-plus
degrees) or coldest days (around 35 degrees).
 &HT;    Sidewalks deviate from their straight lines to meander around
the bases of big leafy trees, towering palms and dusty evergreens.
 &HT;    New museums have popped up, such as the McClellan Aviation
Museum (3204 Palm St., McClellan Air Force Base, 916/643-3192, free
admission), which now displays approximately 31 vintage aircraft.
 &HT;    Another is the innovative Golden State Museum (1020 O St.,
916/653-4255, $5 admission for seniors), showcasing the people and
politics of California through interactive exhibits. For example,
you can climb inside a bus to hear the voices of those who
immigrated to ``Golden Mountain,'' as the Chinese referred to
California.
 &HT;    More established museums offer mini-theatricals with docents
dressed in costumes of the era or stage elaborate multi-day
festivals. One upcoming festival offered by the California State
Railroad Museum is Railfair '99 (June 18-27, 1999), which will
feature locomotives and railroad cars as well as live entertainment
and living history demonstrations to highlight the ways railroads
have made a difference in our lives.
 &HT;    Railfair prices for those 62 and older are $1 off whatever
admission you buy, from a one-day to a 10-day pass. Those buying
tickets in advance _ before June 17 _ get an additional $4 off.
Call 916/445-6645 for information.
 &HT;    And this year, dozens of special events are planned to celebrate
the Gold Rush anniversary, including ``Gold Fever!'' (Aug. 1-Oct.
31), an interactive, multimedia exhibition that is one of the
anniversary centerpieces. It will be held in Sacramento's Memorial
Auditorium at 15th &AMP; J streets (916/264-7072). Admission for those
65 and older is $6.
 &HT;    Sacramento's Old Town will convert itself into a theme park with
sawdust-filled streets for The Second Great Gold Rush from Sept. 3
to 6, featuring reenactments of everything from a horse-drawn
funeral to the arrival of the Pony Express. Call 916/264-8141 for
ticket info.
 &HT;    Earlier in the year, on Memorial Day weekend (May 28-31), the
city will resound with the music of the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee
(916/372-5277). Jazz concerts in dozens of venues from one end of
the city to the other will showcase bands from around the world and
across the United States, while aficionados dress up in costume and
dance and swing whenever the beat moves them. Daily tickets range
from $16 for half-day admission to $80 for the weekend; admission
on Monday is half-price for seniors.
 &HT;    Trains and planes and boats and all that jazz _ these are the
grown-up toys that hold fascination for many mature travelers and
are so much a part of the Sacramento of today.
 &HT;    For your copy of the Sacramento Vacation Planner with details
about these and other attractions, call 916/264-5553 or visit the

   STOCKTON-SCHOOL (Stockton, Calif.) _ When Stockton dedicated its
Children's Museum to the victims of a 1989 schoolyard massacre,
speaker after speaker repeated the same hope: ``This will be the
last school shooting.'' But 10 years and many campus tragedies
later, Stockton has instead become a study in survivors and a
community that cannot put the deaths of five children in the past.
The reminders are everywhere, especially in the headlines and
newscasts following shootings like the one last week in Littleton,
Colo. By ERIC DRUDIS.
</P>
<P>
   WEB-MISSING (San Francisco) _ A 5-year-old Santa Rosa, Calif.,
girl was reunited with her mother after a resident of a small
Mexican town used his computer to sign onto a Web site of missing
children and recognized the faces of the child and her alleged
abductor, the girl's father. By KATHERINE SELIGMAN.
</P>
<P>
   GROUNDED-THUNDERBIRDS (San Antonio) _ The Air Force has
suspended all performances by the Thunderbirds, the service's
precision flight team, for only the second time since a fatal 1982
crash. The decision was made after the Air Force reviewed an
incident in which two F-16 jets made contact while taking off at an
air show Sunday at Patrick AFB, Fla. By SIG CHRISTENSON.
</P>
<P>
   WINE-LAWSUIT (Houston) _ Three people from Houston have filed a
federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Texas law
that prohibits the direct shipment of wine to a Texas residence
from out of state. The law also prohibits the transportation of
more than three gallons of wine across the state line. By ED ASHER.
</P>
<P>
   DENTISTS-TEXAS (Houston) _ When health officials decided that a
panel of experts should review fraud allegations involving the
Texas Medicaid dental program, they told an aggressive consultant
that his services were no longer needed. But when a top health
official sent out letters soliciting members of the new panel, one
of them went to the consultant. Dentist Donald Crow says the
mailing suggests a lack of serious commitment to fraud enforcement.
By MARK SMITH.

<P>
   LATINOS-WAR (San Francisco) _ Anti-war author Jorge Mariscal is
frustrated that the Latino community isn't asking harder questions
about war in Yugoslavia, especially since two of the three American
POW's taken in the Kosovo conflict are Latinos. By EDVINS BEITIKS.

<P>
   CAREERS-PASSION (San Francisco) _ If you ever have a chance to
see ``Rent'' _ or if you ever had a chance to see Wayne Gretzky _
you might appreciate why passion is more than a career counseling
buzzword. The career counseling mantra is that you should find work
that you're passionate about, but keeping that passion is a lot
easier to philosophize about than to accomplish. By DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   GASOLINE-PRICES (Sacramento, Calif.) _ A week-long breakdown at
a Southern California Arco refinery, kept secret from the public
until now, was a major factor in the recent huge increase in gas
prices in California, state officials say. By ROBERT SALLADAY.

<P>
   MUSIC-MELLENCAMP (Undated) _ John Mellencamp, 47, has learned to
enjoy his success, even as his kind of music _ rock 'n' roll _
seems to be taking a back seat to other sounds among younger
listeners. By RICK MITCHELL.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-REVIEW-SONG (Undated) _ Jan Karon has produced another
adventure with Father Tim Kavanagh, but this time he has left the
small town of Mitford, N.C. If some of the new characters in ``A
New Song'' don't have the same resonance as our old Mitford
friends, it's probably just because we don't have the same history
with them. That's a sure sign of more to come. By JOHN GRIFFIN.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 (San Francisco) _ From garage trios to headlining divas,
modern-day musicians have jumped onto the cyberspace bandwagon en
masse, using the popular digital compression format ``MP3'' to
record and market their music to a global audience via the
Internet. By GLENN RUBENSTEIN.
</P>
<P>
   STAR-WARS (Pleasant Hill, Calif.) _ Dan Killoran came up with an
idea crazy enough to get most people locked away on one of the
moons of Jupiter. Killoran, 29, a musician when he's not delivering
packages for UPS, decided that he was going to write a song
celebrating ``Star Wars,'' and try to get it done in time for the
mega-grand premiere of the latest epoch from George Lucas on May
19. By CRAIG MARINE.
</P>
<P>
   TV-NICK (Undated) _ Next time you find little Johnny watching
too much TV and you're about to snatch the remote away and begin
your patented Parental Lecture About the Great Outdoors, think
again. That kid could be in training to run a TV network. By TIM
GOODMAN.

   WASHINGTON (``w'' category)
</P>
<P>
   PATAKI-BALKANS (Washington) _ New York Gov. George Pataki has
blasted President Clinton's foreign policy and his handling of the
war in Kosovo, saying the administration's ``track record of
indecisiveness'' helped create the Balkan conflict. By MARK HELM.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL (``t'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-TEXAS (Jefferson, Texas) _ To wander the pine forests of
East Texas is to see what pioneers from long ago saw. The past is
very much alive here. But this region is also very much about the
here and now. East Texas has a little something for just about
everyone _ except big city stress. By RENEE KIENTZ (Photos
available on NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-MARHSALL (Marshall, Texas) _ Some travelers might see
Marshall as a blip on Interstate 20, a chance to gas up before
heading on to the bed-and-breakfasts of Jefferson or the casinos of
Shreveport/Bossier City, La. But something's afoot. This East Texas
city has the feel of a town on the cusp of becoming a destination
in its own right. By RENEE KIENTZ. (Photo available on NYT
database.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-EL-CAMINO (Nacogdoches, Texas) _ To some folks traveling
through the Piney Woods, Texas Highway 21 is just a pretty
east-west stretch of road. It'll get you where you're going, all
right. Or it can take you back in time. Back to the early days of
El Camino Real, the Royal Road. By RENEE KIENTZ. (Photo available
on NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-CADDOAN-MOUNDS (Caddoan Mounds State Park, Texas) _
Standing in a clearing at Caddoan Mounds State Park, you wonder
what this place looked like 1,200 years ago when a group of Caddo
Indians decided it was the right spot for a village. By RENEE
KIENTZ. (Photo available on NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-LAKES (Undated) _ Many of us appreciate the beauty of
East Texas best with a fishing pole in hand, though often fish have
nothing to do with it. It's more about a state of grace, the
enormously complex simplicity of sun flashing off the water's
surface, the chance to just sit and relax and enjoy the open air.
By RENEE KIENTZ. (Photo available on NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ If anyone was watching the debate
over Serbia on C-SPAN, it probably came as a surprise that the
power to declare war is reserved for Congress. Don't presidents
have the right to bomb any country that displeases them? On
Wednesday, the House of Representatives stood up for itself. By ROB
MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ In the Littleton, Colo.,
shootings, the two teenage shooters _ who allegedly planned to kill
hundreds of people _ were not members of a racial or ethnic
minority, were not poor and did not come from broken homes.
Remember that the next time a politician or condemnatory clergyman
heaps the blame for society's woes atop welfare mothers, divorce,
violence-prone minorities and the decay of traditional family
values. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE, MELLENCAMP REMAINS PASSIONATE ABOUT ROCK 'N'
ROLL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've probably seen the T-shirts. The message is aimed at
uptight grown-ups yelling at their kids to turn down that darn rock
'n' roll: ``If it's too loud, you're too old.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mellencamp, middle-aged rock star, isn't buying it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what young people buy, it is not rock 'n'
roll,'' he said. ``Hip-hop is very popular with young people, and
country music is very popular with young people, but I don't see
rock 'n' roll being that popular with young people. I don't see a
lot of young rock bands going out on tour and selling records the
way that I experienced it in my youth. It just doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he notes that there are still some good modern-rock
bands such as the Offspring, Mellencamp predicts that the rock 'n'
roll era is coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``All music has its cycle, and it goes away,'' he said. ``I
remember the fear in our parents' faces when the Rolling Stones
showed up and we had our hair just barely on top of our ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where it started, and I think this is where it ends.
It'll never go away, but I don't think you're going to find another
movement like the punk movement rejuvenating the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mellencamp is ready to hang up his rock 'n' roll shoes
just yet. He's bringing his band to the Houston area May 5, the
third stop on the ``Rural Electrification'' tour supporting his
latest album, titled simply ``John Mellencamp.'' The album came out
six months ago and is no longer on the Billboard Top 200 sales
chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there some rule that I don't know about, that your album
comes out and you have to go on tour five days later?'' Mellencamp
asked in mock indignation. ``I just sort of approached it in an
unconventional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp's whole career has proceeded in a somewhat
unconventional manner. His first album, ``Chestnut Street
Incident,'' was released in 1976 under the name Johnny Cougar.
Mellencamp first learned of his new stage name when he saw the
album cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever called me Johnny my whole life,'' he said. ``That
record sold 18,000 copies _ hated by everyone. Read the first
review they ever did of me in Cream magazine; the last line went
something like, `This record is not very good, but what a wonderful
find it will be in the cut-out bins in 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp went on to enjoy massive commercial success with
``American Fool'' _ the best-selling album of 1982 _ and finally
won over the critics with his mid-'80s masterpieces ``Scarecrow''
and ``The Lonesome Jubilee.'' But he's never been able to shake
completely that manufactured pop-idol moniker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first cut is always the deepest,'' he said. ``People still
call me Johnny Cougar.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, Mellencamp considers himself fortunate
to have had such a long and rewarding career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking to the luckiest guy in the world,'' he said,
punctuating his speech with his favorite unprintable adjective. ``I
started out at 22 years old. I had no idea what I was doing _ none,
no vision at all about what I was supposed to do. All I wanted to
do initially was make a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then here it is in 1999, 20-some years later. I'm still
making records. I do exactly what I want to do. I hear my songs on
the radio all the time. It's amazing to me that people will be
dancing and making love to my songs in the next millennium. Now
isn't that astonishing for a guy who started out as Johnny
Cougar?''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp admits he went through a period when he was less
appreciative of his good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a young guy, I really never was in the moment,'' he
said. ``In the '80s, I was always like five years ahead of myself.
I didn't really have the opportunity or the brains to enjoy what I
was going through at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to a point in my life in the late '80s and early '90s
where I had to make a decision _ if I was going to be one of those
bitter, jaded guys in the music business or if I was going to turn
my life around and try to be a little bit more upbeat about
things.''
</P>
<P>
   His newfound peace of mind is reflected in some of the songs on
``John Mellencamp.'' In the bouncy ``I'm Not Running Anymore,'' he
comically describes his two young sons as ``the hoodlums of my
third wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Over sweeping violins in ``Your Life Is Now,'' he declares his
intention to learn to live in the present:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Your finest days are lost to you
</P>
<P>
   This is your time down here to do what you will do
</P>
<P>
   We could shake this world if you would only show us how
</P>
<P>
   Your life is now ...``
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp, 47, lives with his third wife, model Elaine Irwin,
and pint-sized hoodlums Hud and Speck in Belmont, Ind., the town
where he grew up. (Two teen-age daughters by a previous marriage
are frequent visitors from South Carolina.)
</P>
<P>
   George Green, Mellencamp's childhood friend and frequent
co-writer (``Hurts So Good,'' ``Rain On the Scarecrow,'' ``Human
Wheels''), lives just a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp's small-town upbringing led to his involvement with
Farm Aid, which he formed in 1985 with Willie Nelson and Neil
Young. Each year, Farm Aid holds an annual all-day fund-raising
concert in support of the American family farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did one last year in Chicago, and we're doing one this
year in either Kansas City or Los Angeles,'' he said. ``Farm Aid
was really the one `aid' that came out of the '80s that was a true
representation of what it's supposed to do. The rest were invented
by corporations, promoted by corporations and sold to America and
the world by corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it like this: Are people still starving in Africa?
Where's Live Aid?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Mellencamp suffered a mild heart attack. He's since
started taking better care of himself. He works out regularly,
maintains a healthy diet and takes medicine to keep his coronary
disease under control. The one bad habit he hasn't been able to
kick is smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cigarettes got their mitts into me early. Hopefully, someday
I'll be strong enough to quit smoking 'em,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 albums on the Mercury/Polygram label, Mellencamp jumped
to Columbia prior to the release of his latest album. He felt his
previous label had stopped promoting his albums. (Last year,
Mercury released a greatest-hits collection, ``The Best That I
Could Do, 1978-1988.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When Polygram went public, their whole outlook on how to sell
records changed,'' Mellencamp said. ``I'm very fortunate to grow up
when I did, because that's back when record companies were
privately owned by individuals who cared about developing artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important to a public company? The stock holder. Hanson
had three albums out in their first year. You can see that people
were just harvesting this act to make numbers. That's what the
focus has become in the late '90s _ numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite record ever made was `Highway 61 Revisited' (by
Bob Dylan). I don't know how many records it sold then, and I don't
know how many records it has sold now. Because I'm interested in
what's on the record, not how many copies it sold.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Mellencamp's albums aren't selling the kind of numbers
they did in the '80s, he maintains his faith in the power of music
to change lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my best, I can write a song that's powerful enough to touch
somebody's emotions. For a moment, that person thinks about himself
and that song. When you are able to do that, you have made a friend
for life. I've been fortunate that I've been able to write two or
three that people felt that way about.''
</P>
<P>
   And remember: If it's too loud, you're too young.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: A playground in the woods
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Susie Clifton
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   My mother died in 1942 when I was a year old. In 1944, Daddy and
my Cherokee stepmother and I _ red-haired and freckle-faced _ moved
from Texas to our 10-acre farm in Clay County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   My four half-brothers were born during the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Our nearest neighbor lived a couple of miles away, so we
entertained ourselves. We had radio, but no TV until the late
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   A railroad track ran along our piney woods farm. We'd wave to
the train engineers, and they'd wave back.
</P>
<P>
   Mom said that whenever a train was late during the night, we
children would wake up because we had not heard the train whistle
in our sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Daddy walked with our dogs and us a couple of miles
down the tracks to the trestle over Black Creek. The tracks
followed beside the main road to town, about ten miles.
</P>
<P>
   One year, a hurricane washed out the bridge on the road to town.
People had to either park their car on one side and cross the creek
in a neighbor's boat or hike through the woods to the railroad and
walk across the trestle. Everybody was happy when the bridge was
rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Once Daddy took two of my brothers and me to Jacksonville, Fla,
to see a movie. We drove to town and boarded the train, which then
chugged by our farm on the way to Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Mom and the babies waved to us as we passed, and everyone on
that train knew it was our farm.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy built our house. The log part was two bedrooms and two
closets.
</P>
<P>
   A concrete slab formed the porch beside the bedrooms. On the
porch stood a wringer washing machine and two rinse tubs, which I
was well acquainted with on wash day.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy put a small trailer on another side of the porch, took the
wheels off and made it into a kitchen. Mom planted flowers around
the outside of it.
</P>
<P>
   On the third side of the porch he attached a huge wooden crate
that an airplane engine had come in. He worked at the Jacksonville
Naval Air Station, so he had access to discarded crates.
</P>
<P>
   Inside this crate he put down a concrete floor with plumbing, a
toilet and a smooth concrete bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   The water heater was outside, behind the crate bathroom. The
water pipes ran from a shower to the metal hot water tank which was
tilted on its side, one end higher than the other, and set on
concrete blocks at each end.
</P>
<P>
   When we needed hot water, we built a trash fire under the tank.
In a few minutes Mom said, ``OK! Everybody get your bath. But don't
use up all of the hot water!''
</P>
<P>
   We had a garden every spring and summer, and Daddy planted a
pear tree right in the middle of it. We had all the vegetables we
could eat and always more tomatoes than we needed.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy loved gladioluses and included them in the garden. Every
year when he plowed, he'd spread gladiolus bulbs all over the
place, so there were multi-colored flowers among the beans,
potatoes, corn and everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the woods. They were the playground for my brothers and
me, acres and acres of woods.
</P>
<P>
   Once I saw an old movie, ``Rose Marie.'' I wanted to be an
Indian like Rose Marie, and like my brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Once I secretly wrote, ``I want to be an Indian'' on a piece of

QUESTIONS ARISE OVER HOW DENTAL FRAUD OVERSIGHT PANEL PICKED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK SMITH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   State health officials told an aggressive fraud consultant last
year that his services no longer were needed and that a panel of
experts would be assigned to watch for irregularities in the Texas
Medicaid dental program.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, when the state's top health official sent out form
letters soliciting members of the new panel, one of them went to
the ousted consultant, dentist Donald Crow.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nov. 24, 1998, letter seeking ``expert consultation,''
Health and Human Services Commissioner Don A. Gilbert also
solicited at least two prospects whose expert credentials likely
were out of date.
</P>
<P>
   Crow said one gave up dentistry almost 20 years ago and now owns
a beer distributorship, and another dropped his Texas dental
practice more than five years ago and lives in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The letter to Crow was mailed to a 5-year-old address.
</P>
<P>
   Crow, 54, said the apparent carelessness of the mail-out
suggests a lack of serious commitment to fraud enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Postal Service spent more time tracking me down than the
Health and Human Services Commission did in attempting to find
skilled and experienced dentists,'' Crow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent nothing more than boilerplate letters using a very
old mailing list.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission spokesman Charles Stuart insisted that the Houston
Chronicle submit any questions to him in writing about the Nov. 24
letter, the process of selecting its recipients and the status of
any panels that have been formed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; He said Gilbert declined to be interviewed on the matter.
Stuart had not responded to the written questions by late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Crow and the Health Department have been
strained since 1993, when he sued the department over an earlier
reassignment. The case was tried this week in Austin before state
District Judge John Dietz, who told the parties that he would rule
within a week. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Crow said he believes the proposed expert panel was a
``transparent attempt'' by state health officials to make the
public believe they were doing something about Medicaid fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He said the panel of dentists, serving as part-time consultants,
ultimately may cost taxpayers more than dentists paid full time to
review cases in the $146 million dental program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to have a full-time staff,'' Crow said. ``That's
better than having all these people stumbling around not knowing
what they are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow served more than two years at the helm of a high-tech
anti-fraud effort. He had been assigned to the job at Health and
Human Services from other duties at a subordinate agency, the Texas
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Perusing data generated by a new supercomputer at the Health and
Human Services Commission and following his own instincts, Crow
decided which dentists warranted investigation for possible
overbilling or improper patient treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He said he routinely had several dentists review a case once he
developed it, to avoid concern that a single reviewer's biases
might affect enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In late August, shortly after the president of the Texas Dental
Association and several pediatric dentists complained about him,
Crow was told that he would be returning to the Department of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after that, he was informed that he was being placed
on paid ``emergency leave'' and would be out of work, effective
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert described Crow last year as ``aggressive'' and ``very
conscientious,'' and said that his return to the Health Department
had nothing to do with the dentists' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of this, I understand, provokes a lot of questions,
but it was not connected,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision already had been made to replace Crow with a panel
of dentists from different specialties ``to ensure we have a broad
range of dental expertise to evaluate dental practices,'' Gilbert
said.
</P>
<P>
   The change in Medicaid review methods followed a scathing letter
from TDA President Stephen Schwartz to Gilbert. Schwartz complained
of intimidation by investigators, selective enforcement and lack of
due process.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Chronicle earlier this year, Gilbert said the
computer system, called the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Detection
System, or MFADS, had resulted in more than 50 fraud investigations
and at least two probable criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of stories beginning in 1995, the Chronicle has
reported on allegations that state health agencies have deferred
too readily to dentists' complaints that fraud investigators were
aggressive and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Some dentists have billed the tax-funded programs for procedures
that dental experts said were unnecessary or even dangerous, the
Chronicle's investigation found.
</P>
<P>
   Although Crow wouldn't discuss specifics, he said ``six to eight
major cases'' involving Medicaid fraud and abuse remain backlogged
in the Human Services Commission's Office of Investigations and
Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Crow sued the Health Department in 1993 after being replaced as
dental bureau chief by Dr. Gloriana ``Nana'' Lopez, a friend of
then-Health Commissioner David Smith. Lopez and Smith have since
left the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Crow alleges that it was improper for the Health
Department to remove him from his position as dental bureau chief
without a hearing to show he had performed inadequately at his job.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department contends that it did not have to show any
cause for his removal.

<P>
   JEFFERSON, Texas _ Just the words whispered out loud have
restorative powers: Piney Woods. ``Piney Woods.'' Feel that blood
pressure dropping, the pulse slow a little bit? Close your eyes.
See the sunlight filtering through trees, forest floor carpeted
with pine needles, a red-shouldered hawk soaring overhead, at one
with the sky, the earth, you even.
</P>
<P>
   To wander the pine forests of East Texas is to see what the
Anglo pioneers saw, and before them Spaniard explorers, and before
that Indian tribes such as the Caddo and the Coushatta. The past is
very much alive here, the history breathing, in the woods and in
the towns spacing them, places such as Nacogdoches and San
Augustine and Jefferson, places whose very names trace the state's
lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you have to even care about history to enjoy an East
Texas getaway. This region is very much about the here and now.
Sitting here in a boat gently rocking, rocking on Red Hills Lake or
Toledo Bend or Caddo Lake. Shopping now in the gift and antiques
shops facing Jefferson's brick-lined streets.
</P>
<P>
   East Texas has a little something for just about everyone,
except Big City stress. Want that? Stay home. Otherwise, point that
hood ornament a little bit north, a little bit east, right on up
U.S. 59. There are myriad destinations in the Piney Woods, but this
story is taking you right past most of them (don't fret, we detour
in related stories) and aiming upward, toward Jefferson, just past
Interstate 20.
</P>
<P>
   East Texas tourism is defined by the triad of history, nature
and antiquing, and you'll find a confluence of all three in and
around the little town of Jefferson, about a 4 1/2-hour drive from
downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Long a weekend getaway for Dallasites, Jefferson touts itself as
the bed-and-breakfast (there are 50-plus) capital of Texas, and the
town is also home to a couple of historical hotels. There are
museums to see, excursions to take, shops to explore, all within
walking distance of the historic downtown area. If nature calls _
the trees, the lakes, we mean _ it's a short drive to the shores of
Lake O' the Pines or the spooky (in a good way) Caddo.
</P>
<P>
   But first ...
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A LITTLE HISTORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, Jefferson's population hovers at around 2,500. Once
upon a time, when steamboats carried cargo all the way from New
Orleans and commerce boomed, some 30,000 souls lived there.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the early 1840s, Jefferson was a major inland port
and home to iron smelting plants, slaughterhouse and lumber
industries as well as to some very wealthy Texans. From the 1850s
to the 1880s, they built large homes using the finest materials.
</P>
<P>
   Confident in the power of the steamboat, city decision-makers
spurned the proposal of railroad tycoon Jay Gould to lay tracks in
Jefferson and their fate was sealed. Angry, Gould predicted the end
of the town and took his railroad elsewhere. His prediction was
right in a way: The steamboat era waned and Jefferson as they knew
it waned with it. But Jefferson didn't die, it just shrank, and
with ``progress'' halted, time pretty much stood still.
</P>
<P>
   Plaques denoting historic interest dot the landscape in downtown
Jefferson: More than 100 Victorian homes and 19th-century buildings
still stand in and around the 20-block historic district. Many of
the homes are bed-and-breakfasts, some open for tours. Other
buildings house shops, galleries and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WALK THIS WAY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because Jefferson's historic downtown is compact, you can park
your car on arrival and not turn that ignition key again until it's
time to head back home. Strolling is big in Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   So are long weekends. Most visitors come in for Friday-Sunday
getaways, giving the town a slowed-down feel on weekdays. Most
shops are shuttered on Mondays; some close early on other days, but
there are two distinct advantages to midweek visits: no crowds and
lower rates at many of the inns.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you visit, a Turning Basin Tours cruise down Big
Cypress Bayou is a good place to start. Back when Jefferson was the
second biggest town in Texas _ and Galveston was first _ Big
Cypress was its lifeline. Sitting in this day for Capt. John Nance,
local artist and occasional river pilot Mac Spruell tells
passengers of the town's heyday and colorfully explains the
waterway's role in it.
</P>
<P>
   The pristine passing scenery represents progress in reverse.
Serene and green, the bayou's pretty banks now are lined with
cypress trees and little else, unless you know what to look for.
Spruell points out subtle signs of a long-ago boom, a commercial
surge that, 140 years back, crowded the banks with meat processing
plants, iron ore smelters and loading docks.
</P>
<P>
   Spruell tells us that, if we were of a mind, we could take that
boat all the way down through Louisiana to the Gulf of Mexico. That
some 85 species of fish live in this bayou, which is 20 feet deep
in places. That the cypress trees we're passing look large, but
they're nothing compared to the centuries-old trees harvested to
build the fine houses of Jefferson. When Spruell cuts the engine,
the quiet is deep and lovely, intense enough to scare the kids and
startle the adults.

JEFFERSON, Texas: startle the adults.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back on land, you've got a very short walk to downtown. If
you're in the mood for shopping, there are a number of antiques
malls and shops, mostly concentrated along North Polk and Walnut
streets, and gift shops. Stop for an ice cream soda at the
Jefferson General Store, 113 E. Austin. Fudge, coffees and a
variety of fruit preserves, including some sugar-free items, tempt
at the Old Store, 123 Walnut. Pick up sweet souvenirs at
Blackburn's Factory Outlet, 108 E. Lafayette, where a prettified
quart jar of the Jefferson-made syrup will cost you just $2.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry for more history? Check out the 2-year-old Texas Heritage
Archives and Library, corner of Dallas and Market, to view hundreds
of rare maps _ some dating to the 1500s _ and books, old Texas
currency and other Texana. Not far away, the Jefferson Historical
Museum, 223 W. Austin, is home to all sorts of artifacts,
everything from cannonballs to pioneer doctors' instruments to some
of Sam Houston's papers. There are guns, farm tools, old Bibles,
dolls, and a 200-year-old loom.
</P>
<P>
   For an up-close look at antebellum Jefferson, take a short drive
west out Texas 49 and tour Freeman Plantation. The Greek Revival
house, built in 1850 by Williamson and Drucilla Freeman as a cotton
and sugar plantation, originally sat on 1,000 acres of land. Nicely
restored, the home is furnished with impressive antiques of the
period, largely Empire, including petticoat tables and
plantation-style tester beds, and worth a visit, despite the
somewhat reluctant tour guide (and lady of the house).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FOOD FOR THOUGHT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's get the bad news out of the way first.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson has no shortage of restaurants, but service can be
less than exemplary on weekdays (you know you're in trouble when
your waitress wears a sweatshirt proclaiming ``Whatever!''). At
least, most folks are friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The better news is that the town includes several good
restaurants, places you'll look forward to for return visits.
</P>
<P>
   Considered Jefferson's best by most, Stillwater Inn is a short
hop from downtown, serving what may be the finest grilled duck
breast in the state, maybe the world. The chocolate mousse on
chocolate meringue dessert isn't bad, either. Surroundings are
comfortably elegant, with the restaurant situated in an 1890s
Victorian house that doubles as a bed-and-breakfast operated by its
chef/owner. Also on the menu: pork tenderloin, Cornish game hen,
New York strip steak, scampi and veal chops.
</P>
<P>
   Also recommended by locals for dinner: the Black Swan, across
the street from the Excelsior Hotel, and Lamache's Italian
Restaurant, located in the Jefferson Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Riverport Bar-B-Que on North Polk is a favorite, too, especially
for lunch. And why not? Stephen Joseph's place serves up the real
thing, plus atmosphere to boot: tall, 19th-century ceilings, a bar
that goes on forever, and the feel of a place that's seen a lot of
good meals dished out. Customers order at the counter, swing by the
iced tea table, then pick up their squeeze bottle of warm barbecue
sauce. It's a sauce with body, a little sweet, a little spicy, with
real depth of flavor. Chopped or sliced beef sandwiches are $3;
potato salad (89 cents) is very good, creamy, with a little black
pepper, green onion and eggs. The restaurant makes its own fries,
onion rings and buttermilk pie, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamburger Store on Market Street is another good lunch spot,
with burgers, sandwiches, innertube-sized onion rings and
fresh-baked pies with meringue peaked like cavalry tents.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a club scene? There isn't one. Diamond Bessie's
Saloon and Dance Hall can get frisky, especially on weekends when
live entertainment is featured. But like most small towns,
Jefferson pretty much shuts down a few hours after dark.
</P>
<P>
   There's talk among some Jeffersonians that what the town needs
is more nightlife, something to draw a younger crowd than the
boomers and empty-nesters who partake of Jefferson's low-key
pleasures now.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, that might spoil the mood. Most of Jefferson's
visitors come from places that offer a vibrant nightlife. They're
here, in this pleasant little Piney Woods enclave, for something
else: a slower pace. And after a leisurely day of sightseeing and
shop walking, they just want a good dinner, maybe a good look at
the stars as they stroll back to their inn for the night. They want
a nice, soft bed. A chorus of crickets outside their window might
be nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's nightlife.

<P>
   CADDOAN MOUNDS STATE PARK _ Standing there, in the clearing, you
wonder what this place looked like 1,200 years ago when a group of
Caddo Indians decided it was the right spot for a village.
</P>
<P>
   A natural prairie, the site lay a short distance north of the
Neches River. Offering lots of wildlife (food), plenty of water and
good soil, this must have seemed like prime real estate in those
days. It's pretty nice now, too, with a breeze whipping through
ankle-high grass and the sweet fragrance of clover in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Caddo who lived here are long gone, but the mounds they
built remain, now part of a state park six miles southwest of the
town of Alto on Texas 21.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Caddoan Mounds State Park begins at the interpretive
center, where a video gives historical perspective and talks about
the present-day Caddo. Though this village, believed to have
operated as a regional trade center for some 500 years, was
abandoned around A.D. 1300, Caddos from other sites were rounded up
in the 1850s and exiled to Oklahoma. This may have been the
westernmost site for the Caddo, who built their mounds across a
wide swath of the southern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mounds were built for temple sites and burials. The largest at
the state park is a burial mound. Excavated by archaeologists in
the late 1970s, it yielded the remains of some 90 individuals
buried during a 400-year period beginning about A.D. 900. Visitors
now can climb to its top, which affords a wide view of the prairie
site, once a thriving village of farmers and traders. Artifacts at
the center give us an idea of what the inhabitants' lives were
like.
</P>
<P>
   An interpretive trail guide picked up at the center explains the
trail, about seven-tenths of a mile long, that winds visitors past
the burial mound, a low temple mound and a borrow pit, where
workers picked up the dirt used to construct the mounds.
</P>
<P>
   Texas 21 _ or El Camino Real _ bisects the one-time Indian
village, separating the park from the high temple mound. You can
check it out when you leave; just cross the road and park. Before
you go, however, visit the park's reconstruction of an early Caddo
house, a thatch and timber structure resembling a beehive.
</P>
<P>
   The Caddoan Mounds State Historical park is open 9 a.m.-4 p.m.
Thursdays through Mondays. Admission is $2. For more information,
phone 409-858-3218 or access the Texas Parks and Wildlife Web site
at www.tpwd.state.tx.us.

MARSHALL IS UNDERGOING TOURISM TRANSFORMATION

<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ Some travelers might see Marshall as a blip on
Interstate 20, a chance to gas up before heading on to the
bed-and-breakfasts of Jefferson or the casinos of
Shreveport/Bossier City, La.
</P>
<P>
   But something's afoot. This East Texas city has the feel of a
town on the cusp of becoming a destination in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Newlan senses it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marshall is a great little town,'' says the restoration
architect, who enjoyed a visit so much he decided to move here _
from Austin. ``Things are happening in Marshall,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Newlan is busy restoring Wisteria Garden, a bed-and-breakfast
owned and operated by Mary Lynn and John Vassar. The 1884 house at
215 E. Rusk is in Marshall's historic district, an area abuzz with
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, restorations are under way at the county courthouse and
the city's lovely old Texas &AMP; Pacific depot, soon to be a railroad
museum. Just across the tracks, the Ginocchio Hotel, at the core of
the city's historic district, now is home to a budding antiques and
collectibles mall. Other shops, bed-and-breakfasts and restaurants
are within walking distance, as is the first-rate Michelson Museum
of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors are finding Marshall a good base camp for
exploration of this corner of East Texas. Jefferson's attractions
are only 20 minutes away, Louisiana's casinos about 45 minutes.
Caddo Lake is only a short drive.
</P>
<P>
   History is at home in Marshall, settled in 1839. Later a
manufacturing center (saddles, clothing, ammunition) for the
Confederacy, Marshall became the seat of civil authority west of
the Mississippi River after Vicksburg fell. Still later, railroads
brought growth and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   That prosperity is evidenced in some of the grand old homes
located in and around the historic district as well as the splendor
of the Ginocchio Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1896 by Charles A. Ginocchio (jen-ock-ee-o), the hotel
served railroad workers and other travelers. It boasted magnificent
curly pine woodwork and fine architectural details. The lobby looks
today much as it did decades ago, featuring the original check-in
counter and Edison archway, which brought the first electric lights
to this part of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The antiques and collectibles mall opened in the hotel in May
1998. Some 45 dealers have goods scattered about the two-story
hotel, worth a visit for anyone enamored of old buildings,
regardless of any interest in antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Between browsings, you can sit and relax over a cup of coffee or
head next door to Suzie's Soda Shop for a sandwich and soda.
</P>
<P>
   Just up the street are several historical old houses, including
the Allen House, built in 1877, at 610 N. Washington, and Three
Oaks Bed and Breakfast at 609 N. Washington. Three Oaks, a fully
restored 1895 Victorian home, is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places and features spacious, high-ceilinged rooms, many
with clawfoot tubs, sitting areas and antiques. Especially nice:
the Magnolia bedroom with its huge bathroom/sitting area, situated
in a former sunroom. The Victorian room in the back of the house is
really a suite, with a king-size iron bed in its own alcove, plus
wicker double bed, sofa, rolltop desk and clawfoot tub. For more
information or reservations, call owners Tony and Laurie Overhultz
at 800-710-9789. Prices range from $85 to $95 per night.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, Newlan is at work on the Wisteria Garden,
which he anticipates will remain open through the largely exterior
restoration. This bed and breakfast offers four rooms, including
the Sleigh Room, with antique sleigh bed (double), bay window and
antique rockers, and the Eastlake Room, with a queen-size iron bed,
rockers, chaise lounge and clawfoot tub. Rates range from $75 to
$85. For more information, phone 903-938-7611 or access
www.prysm.net/wisteria on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street and down the block is the Michelson Art
Museum, home to an extensive collection of paintings, watercolors,
sketches and drawings by internationally known post-impressionist
Leo Michelson.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, worthy of cities many times Marshall's size
(population 26,000), also schedules traveling exhibitions of other
artists. It is located at 216 Bolivar, and is open noon-5 p.m.
Tuesday-Friday and 1-4 p.m. Saturday-Sunday. For more information,
phone 903-935-9480.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for lunch? What probably is the best restaurant in
Marshall is only a short walk away. Housed in a quaint old home
built in 1875 by Lady Bird Johnson's uncle, the Taylor House, at
212 W. Bowie, seems to be every native's answer to the question,
Where is a good place to eat?
</P>
<P>
   And they're right. Linen tablecloths, fresh flowers, a glass of
spiced iced tea before you, sunlight pouring in through the
windows, you know you're in for a good meal. Maybe sauted catfish
or shrimp salad, flavored with bits of cucumber and dill or spinach
salad with sweet pecan vinaigrette. In the evening, from a menu lit
by candlelight, you might choose crab cakes with a macadamia nut
crust or veal Oscar or a salmon tapenade with garlic, black olives
and capers.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Steve Mylar and his wife, Ginger, opened Taylor House in
1997 and are very hands-on. So is Ginger's mom, who makes the
desserts. Reservations are required for dinner (903-938-8549). The
restaurant seats about 70 people total in its three main dining
rooms. A charming one-table room offers an especially intimate
dining experience. Entrees range from $6.50 to $8 for lunch; $14 to
$19 for dinner.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of us appreciate the beauty of East Texas best with a
fishing pole in our hand. Though often fish have nothing to do with
it. It's more about a state of grace, the enormously complex
simplicity of sun flashing off the water's surface, the chance to
just sit.
</P>
<P>
   In the lakes of the Piney Woods, visitors and area residents
find many opportunities to soak up cosmic oneness _ or just catch a
fish. What kind of experience are you looking for? Here are three
choices available:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vast expanse of water, wide open sky, powerboats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small, serene lake, shoreline pines reflected in its surface,
canoes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Large, mysterious cypress-lined lake, kayak or bass boat or
steamboat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TOLEDO BEND &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vast expanse of water, wide open sky, powerboats. This huge,
manmade body of water (the South's largest) has 1,200 miles of
shoreline, an average depth of 24 feet and unlimited opportunities
to catch your dinner. Forming the boundary between Texas and
Louisiana, Toledo Bend seems to go on forever, stretching from
Logansport, north of Center, to well south of Hemphill. And along
the way there are put-in points, campsites, picnic areas, fishing
camps and inns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this place,'' says Wayne Johnson, who's brought his
bass boat over to Hemphill from his home in Austin. He and a friend
will spend three days and some evenings out on the water, cramming
in as much fishing as they can.
</P>
<P>
   They've got the lures lined up, lunch in the cooler, Chee-tos
for later. Their prey: striped bass (although any fish will do).
Texas Parks and Wildlife says the best fishing for striped bass is
February through June. Not only that, but specimen up to 25 pounds
have been caught in the lake and 15 pounders are common.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RED HILLS LAKE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Small, serene lake, shoreline pines reflected in its surface,
canoes. If Red Hills Lake were an apartment, it'd be called
intimate, as in petite. It's also quiet, with boating restricted to
motorless craft that glide rather than ptt-ptt-ptt. Surrounded by
rolling hills covered in pines, this place looks more like Arkansas
than Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors enter on the honor system, slipping the $2 fee into the
provided envelope and dropping it into a box. According to the map,
there are just a couple of ways to go. Both take you past campsites
and screened shelters and pretty views of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the lake is sectioned off for swimming, making this a
family-oriented haven.
</P>
<P>
   Located about three miles north of Milam on Texas 87, Red Hills
Lake is part of the Sabine National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CADDO LAKE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Large, mysterious cypress-lined lake, kayak or bass boat or
steamboat. This is Texas' spookiest lake. Good spooky. Writers
always get around to using the word ``primeval'' to describe Caddo,
because it just is.
</P>
<P>
   Straddling the line between northeast Texas and Louisiana, Caddo
encompasses more than 25,000 fresh-water acres, a meandering maze
of bayous and inlets. It's easy to get lost. First-timers might
want to take a guide along or take a tour.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. David Applebaum, who grew up on this natural lake, says
his Mystique Tours visit all three parts of Caddo _ the swamps,
bayou and big lake areas. Narrated tours go out several times a day
on a regular basis from mid-May through mid-September, though the
boats go out year-round weather permitting, leaving from the dock
behind Bayou Landing Restaurant on Cypress Drive.
</P>
<P>
   For a different kind of excursion, consider the Graceful Ghost,
an authentic re-creation of an 1890s steamboat. Lexie Palmore and
her husband Jim McMillen take turns piloting the steam-driven craft
on 90-minute tours of Caddo. The Ghost goes out several times a day
in the spring and summer months, less frequently in the fall, and
not at all during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   A call ahead is a good idea. You'll need reservations and
directions for both tours, based in the little town of Uncertain.
For information on Mystique Tours, call 903-679-3690. For
information on the Graceful Ghost steamboat, call 888-325-5459.
</P>
<P>
   You can check out the lake from shore at Caddo Lake State Park
in nearby Karnack, or rent canoes there if the urge to paddle is
overwhelming. A pontoon boat tour runs Thursday-Tuesday from March
to November.
</P>
<P>
   The visitor center's exhibits and artifacts give perspective on
the area and the Indians the lake is named for. There are cabins
($40-60 a night), screened shelters ($16) and campsites ($8-15
night) at the park, plus nature trails and short hiking trails. For
more park information, call 800-792-1112; for reservations, call
512-389-8900.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of visitors come to the shores of Caddo to eat catfish,
not catch and clean 'em. Two favorites: Bayou Landing on Cypress
Drive in Uncertain and Dawn's Caddo Crossing in Karnack.
</P>
<P>
   Several bed-and-breakfasts and camps also are located along the
shores of the Caddo.

<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ To some folks traveling the Piney Woods,
Texas 21 is just a pretty east-west stretch of road. It'll get you
where you're going, all right. Or it can take you back in time.
</P>
<P>
   If you start at the Rio Grande and follow Texas 21 across the
state, you'll pass through a string of towns with historic
significance: San Antonio, San Marcos, Crockett, Nacogdoches, San
Augustine and Milam. You'll also be following the approximate route
taken in 1691 by the Tran-Mazanet expedition, which crossed the Rio
Grande and trekked across Tejas to the Sabine River and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Spaniards got most of the credit for carving out El
Camino Real _ the Royal Road _ the route was already an existing
network of Indian trails and natural stream crossings, some dating
well before the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Nacogdoches is the largest of the East Texas towns on El Camino
Real, which runs through its very heart as Main Street. Named for
the Caddo family that lived in the area centuries before the first
Europeans arrived, Nacogdoches makes a good base camp from which to
explore other sites on the Royal Road, including the Caddoan Mounds
State Historic Park to the west and San Augustine and Milam to the
east.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STAY AWHILE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But first, there is a lot to see in Nacogdoches, which has a
rich history coupled with the energy of a college town.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of the 33,500 inhabitants attend Stephen F.
Austin State University, and the collegiate influence on this old
town is huge. But the future coexists nicely with the past on and
off the pretty campus, located on another historic road. North
Street, once known as Calle del Norte, is believed to have begun as
an Indian trading trail and may be the oldest existing thoroughfare
in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The two ancient roads, El Camino Real and Calle del Norte,
converge in downtown Nacogdoches to form a pleasant quadrant of
shops, restaurants and historical buildings. One block east of
North Street, which also is Business U.S. 59, sits the town square,
or Plaza Principal. It was here that Nacogdoches, as an official
entity, was born, having received the designation from the Spanish
government in 1779.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Antonio Gil Y'Barbo, political chief of the area,
established his headquarters in a stone house erected on the north
side of the square, adjacent to El Camino Real. Though the home was
torn down in 1902, its stones were used to create a replica in
1936. The replica, built on the SFA campus, now is known as the
Stone Fort Museum and houses a number of important artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The Nacogdoches Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau conducts walking
tours of the downtown area, but historical markers fill you in if
you cruise the red-bricked streets on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown offers more than history, with a number of antiques,
gift and specialty shops as well as restaurants to explore.
</P>
<P>
   Among shops worth a visit are the Old Pineapple Post, 102 North
St., an antiques mall; Old Pilar Street Antiques, at 108 E. Pilar,
a large shop offering 18th- and 19th-century American furniture and
glassware; and the Colony Mall, 209 E. Main, various boutiques in
the three-story shell of an old building.
</P>
<P>
   The Oldtime String Shop and General Mercantile, at 206 E. Pilar,
is an odd and fascinating space, a general store for pickers, who
gather 'round on Saturday afternoons to jam, and for the kids, who
wander in and out to admire the tin toys and the old dog snoozing
in the middle of the floor. The shop sells an assortment of items
besides banjo strings and toys, including Marshall pottery and
Jefferson syrups.
</P>
<P>
   Though you'll find lots of old-timers in downtown Nacogdoches,
there is new blood, too. Young shopkeeper Kevyn Barnes opened her
used book store, Serendipity, in 1996 and offers incense and old
LPs along with a good selection of mysteries, biographies,
science-fiction and Texana. She's at &UR;  &LR; 203 E. Main.
</P>
<P>
   In the next block, at 119 E. Main, Laura McKinney has opened
McKinnon's Linens, an upscale linens store carrying lines such as
Peacock Alley, Peter Reed and Banana Fish. The shopkeeper, who's
still in college, is a Nacogdoches native and a fine judge of
restaurants. Asked to recommend a place or two to eat, she names
two local spots that turn out to be winners, a ``down-home'' place
named Aubrey's and Taqueria Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   It's Sunday noon at Aubrey's Cafe, 1523 E. Main, just a short
drive east of downtown. A diverse cross-section of Nacogdoches is
crowding in for lunch. SFA students in jeans and ponytails, ladies
fresh from church in big hats and young families all have come for
soulful standards that include chicken and dumplings, collard
greens and black-eyed peas. On this day, a child, maybe 8, maybe 9,
struggles with his order _ the Mile High Meat Loaf Sandwich.
Desserts such as banana nut cake and sweet potato pie are hard to
pass up. Aubrey's prices are reasonable and the food, fine.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of Taqueria Garcia, an unpretentious family-run
spot at 2710 South St. The guacamole? Bueno. The busy kitchen also
turns out tasty gorditas, little cornmeal pockets stuffed with
fillings such as chorizo (Mexican sausage) and cheese or shredded
poblano peppers and cheese for $1.65 each. On weekends, offerings
include chicken mole ($5) and tamales ($6 a dozen). The Garcia
family is revamping the menu, adding more Mexican specialties and
promising good things.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Now that you've eaten, maybe you're ready for more sights. One
Nacogdoches landmark has a Houston connection. At Millard's
Crossing, visitors tour a number of 19th-century Texas homes
gathered at this reconstructed village under the direction of Lera
Thomas, nee Millard. A Nacogdoches native, she was the wife of the
congressman who served as representative from Harris County for 29
years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ON THE ROAD AGAIN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Short treks from Nacogdoches let you explore El Camino Real in
both directions. Head west and check out the Caddoan Mounds State
Historic Park. A pretty 40-minute ride from Nacogdoches, the park
and its visitors center interpret what is believed to be the site
of the country's westernmost Caddo village.
</P>
<P>
   Following Texas 21 to the east from Nacogdoches will bring you
to San Augustine, where the Mission Senora de los Dolores de los
Ais was founded in 1717. The mission is gone, but the Mission
Dolores Visitor Center and historical markers identify the site
four blocks south of the courthouse on Texas 147. A short distance
away, the Ezekiel W. Cullen home, built in 1839, is open for tours
by appointment. A ballroom occupies the entire upper floor of the
Greek Revival-style home at Congress and Market streets. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Continuing east, there is Milam with its settlers' park and old
cabin, and, a little farther still, Toledo Bend. Standing at the
edge of this big body of water, you won't be seeing what the Caddo
saw, nor the Spaniards, for this impoundment of the Sabine River is
a relatively new development as East Texas goes.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't history that draws visitors to Toledo Bend, but the
Piney Woods' other great attraction: natural beauty. Known
nationally for its bass fishing, the reservoir's shoreline is in
part the Sabine National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Densely wooded and lovely, you won't find a prettier spot to
contemplate the end of the road.
</P>

 &HT;    Three questions for . . . Lily Tomlin
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to know who is more famous, comedian/actress Lily
Tomlin or the quirky cast of characters born from her fertile
imagination. There's Trudy the bag lady; Crystal, the hang-gliding
quadriplegic; '60s flower child Glenna; nasal-voiced telephone
operator Ernestine; and, of course, the precocious 5 1/2-year-old
Edith Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin has used her multiple personalities to score success on
television (``Laugh-In''), in film (``Nashville,'' ``Nine to
Five'') and as a Tony Award-winning stage actress (the one-woman
show ``The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe'').
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, she brings them all to the Fox Theatre as part of the
Unique Lives &AMP; Experiences Lecture Series, a warm and often
intimate evening in which women of achievement share their
memories, perspectives and insights about life. Expect Tomlin's
tale to come from her and her characters. Here's what she had to
say when we caught up with her at her Los Angeles office:
</P>
<P>
   Q:Next year is the 25th anniversary of your first film, Robert
Altman's ``Nashville,'' and he is thinking about rereleasing it.
What are your memories of that movie?
</P>
<P>
   A:Being in that film was a pretty unique experience. It was a
great summer. Everybody in town was in the movie. My family is
Southern, from Paducah, Ky., and I know how sensitive Southerners
are, so I said to Bob, ``I hope we get out of here before people
see this movie.'' And, yes, they were terribly offended.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's the difference between the Lily who spent the summer of
'74 in Nashville and the one who spent the summer of '98 in Italy
shooting a movie with Franco Zefferelli?
</P>
<P>
   A:They were two summers to remember. In Italy, I probably was
just a whole lot older, so I was a more experienced actor. But I
don't think I was that radically different emotionally or
temperamentally. I remember a scene in ``Nashville'' where we were
all sitting in a cafe listening to Keith (Carradine) sing, and when
I saw the dailies, I felt like I failed this whole scene. I went
back to my condo and cried. But you know what? I did that all
summer in Italy, too. You still do it; you give it up a lot
quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you had it to do over again, would you choose to be
famous?
</P>
<P>
   A:I like being famous in the sense that you have a rather warm
place in the world, and people are very generous to you and mostly
affectionate. As my mother says, ``I always get an appointment at
the beauty parlor.'' Her name is Lily Tomlin, too. There's a
certain aspect to it that you love it when you're very young. You
love your whole art.
</P>
<P>
   I still get very excited working on something new or having a
great new idea. But I'm naturally more reflective at this point in
my life. Time suddenly becomes a true, finite reality. These are
the most common of epiphanies. You want to still have that
breathless passion. A lot of people tire out. I can't say that's
happened to me.
</P>
<P>
   Lily Tomlin
</P>
<P>
   7:30 tonight. Speaking as part of the Unique Lives &AMP; Experiences
lecture series. $22.50-$37.50. Fox Theatre, 660 Peachtree St. N.E.
404-817-8700.

 &HT;    Series looks behind scenes at glamour of Hollywood
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 2.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're passionate for all things fashionable but missed last
week's premiere of the new ``Hollywood Fashion Machine'' series on
American Movie Classics (AMC), don't feel bad. The initial
30-minute telecast, which profiled legendary costume designer Edith
Head, was far less riveting than the episode that airs Monday (7:30
p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Monday's episode, ``The Star Makers,'' turns the spotlight on
the ways in which movie idols' appearances were altered to win them
fame and adoration. Among other things, it reveals how Marilyn
Monroe and Judy Garland had dead-end film careers until they
changed their hair color, how Liz Taylor's violet eyes were framed
by eyebrows painted on one hair at a time, and how Rita Hayworth's
Latin features were cloaked by dyeing her hair red and having
electrolysis done on her natural hairline. Hayworth, incidentally,
had mismatched eyes; the larger one was camouflaged with oversized
false lashes.
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Star Makers'' points out, Hollywood glamour was, is and
will continue to be achieved by zealous manipulation of hair,
makeup and apparel. Fittingly, the show's host, actress Daryl
Hannah, looks nearly unrecognizable with her blond locks pressed
straight and her customary bohemian look tempered by a demure Dolce
&AMP; Gabbana gown.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Lauren Bacall is hosting a companion series called ``The
Hollywood Fashion Collection,'' which features movies such as ``How
to Marry a Millionaire'' and ``Pillow Talk,'' noted for their
costume design. That series airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on AMC.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming episodes of the ``Fashion Machine'' series will focus
on Parisian designers' influence on Hollywood and on George
Hurrell's groundbreaking work in glamour photography. If they're
anything near the quality of the ``Star Makers'' episode, this
series will truly be running at full throttle.

 &HT;    Sowing seeds of loving competition
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Everyone loses, everyone wins, so gardening is not a
competitive sport, I've always said _ despite the strange contests
that solicit growers of the biggest tomatoes, the biggest
watermelons, cucumbers and on and on. I said it even as I heard
people brag about having the prettiest azalea in the neighborhood
or the sweetest peaches in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes further challenge to my assertion: Competition is
running hot in LA (Lower Atlanta). A family battle _ between mother
and daughter, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Smith of Coweta County (Ga.) and her mother, Karla
Seymour, who lives about 40 miles south, in Greenville, have taken
the gloves off, or put them on, in a digging and planting and
watering and pruning contest that will be decided next summer. The
other day, I joined the two women at Terri's garden to check on the
rivalry at midpoint.
</P>
<P>
   This war of spades began innocently enough. Last year, when they
visited relatives in Michigan, mother and daughter, neither of whom
gardened, made a crucial discovery, Terri recalls:
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to Midland, my cousin, Cindy Ullery, had these
fabulous gardens, really beautiful. We realized that real, regular
people could have beautiful yards. She dug up all these little
bitty baby plants she had in her yard, saying, `You like this and
you like this?' and showing us what they'd look like. She'd say,
`Do you want it?' and we said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   And the plants got loaded: ``The front seat was full of
plants,'' says Terri. ``The back seat was full. Four of us in the
car and a hundred little plants.''
</P>
<P>
   They drove the thousand miles back to Georgia, back from the
land of rich, black loam, back to the land where hard red clay
loves to intimidate newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Karla notes, ``We came back with great enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they had that certain superior confidence with which
Southerners are endowed, a confidence stemming from mild climates
and abundant moisture. Terri, scanning the ``Yankee plants'' in
Michigan, had a vision: ``We figured if they could grow up there,
they could really grow down here where we have some sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping at Terri's home, they divided the plants, including
calla lily, iris, hosta. When they discovered the joy of success,
Karla recalls, they took their new-found passion to another level:
``We decided to have a contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will judge is still under debate. Meanwhile, a year before
the competition ends, clearly both these new gardeners have reaped
benefits _ in the same way that parents and children always find
common ground in the garden, unearthing lessons for life.
</P>
<P>
   Always close, the two have grown even closer, noting that their
relationship has taken on the added dimension that shared
experiences bring.
</P>
<P>
   Says Karla: ``We call a little bit more often to check on the
flowers and ask how is this one growing or what that one was.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri says, ``It's fun for us to learn new things together,''
acknowledging that, until recently, her familiarity with plants
didn't go much beyond azalea, hydrangea and dogwood.
</P>
<P>
   A walk through her garden shows how far she has come. How far
both have come (they share everything). Like veteran gardeners,
mother and daughter trade stories, traditions and jibes (``You've
got to rub the rosemary,'' says Terri. ``You don't have to bend
down to rub mine,'' retorts her mother), as we admire the pansies,
foxglove, aster, geranium, rose campion, ice plant, thistle, toad
lily, astilbe, yarrow, aucuba, mahonia, lenten rose, fern, Japanese
maple.
</P>
<P>
   Learning breeds thirst for more knowledge. So, constantly in
search of new information, Karla and Terri dig through gardening
books and magazines and horticulturists' minds. ``Now,'' says,
Karla, ``We know what the questions are.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri says her Michigan cousin consults via e-mail: ``I'll say,
`This pulmonaria you gave me has just started to bloom,' and she'll
say, `Now, as soon as it finishes, you've got to pinch off these
flowers.' She'll tell me exactly what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   I had come to Coweta County to chat about a good-natured contest
between mother and daughter. But I also found two people who have
discovered a refreshing new passion, always a treat to witness.
They have a fire in the belly, a light in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the light and fire are being passed along to
Terri's 5-year-old son, Jake, who's taken a special liking to
marigolds and pansies. When Terri, talking about the
mother-daughter contest, asked Jake who had the prettier garden, he
answered: ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another generation joins the beautiful battle.

 &HT;    Latest in loungewear goes from dawn to dinner without skipping a
beat
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 2.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This Mother's Day, consider giving the woman who does everything
a gift as versatile as her busy lifestyle: a comfortable lounge
outfit that she can wear at home, in the school car pool or to a
laid-back dinner without the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Loungewear has evolved from Victoria's Secret-style satin and
lace to uncomplicated pieces that make an easy transition from day
to night, public to private. Whether she's a stay-at-home mother, a
busy career woman or a retiree with limited activities, these
clothes won't collect dust in her closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loungewear seems to have gotten more popular,'' said Kaye
Davis, fashion director for AmericasMart. ``Comfort is what we're
all looking for these days. It can be an oversized T-shirt or
something silk that you can greet a guest in. It's gone into a more
trendy look and not necessarily a behind-the-bedroom-door look.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot new drawstring pant is one of those crossover styles
that offers form and function for women of all sizes. So do pants
with elastic waistbands. Top them with a large shirt or a fitted
tank for an outfit mom can relax in.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeveless unconstructed dresses, or short shifts, offer added
variety and elegance on hot summer days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women want to look pretty and feminine at home, whether their
own family sees them or nobody sees them,'' said Amy Doelling,
public relations manager at Neiman Marcus in Lenox Square. ``We
even sell to women who live in assisted-living homes who want to
look pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Loungewear comes in a wide selection of fabrics, from knits and
silk to linen and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   To make color selection easy, consider the colors Mom wears most
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two most popular colors now in loungewear are the greens
and blues,'' Doelling said. ``I don't know why. That's just what's
selling.''

 &HT;    Sweeps week, Frasier rips Dr. Laura
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling Dr. Laura. ``Frasier'' has your number.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial radio shrink Dr. Laura Schlesinger, known for
her stern judgments (and those Internet photos!), gets ripped
stem-to-stern tonight to kick off May sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   The always-glorious Christine Baranski, late of ``Cybill,''
guests as Dr. Nora Fairchild, an ill-advised addition to Frasier
Crane's radio station. When being interviewed for the job she's as
oily as bad Caesar salad, but once she gets behind the mike, she
turns into an avenging devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your knees together!'' Dr. Nora barks at one woman.
``Staple 'em!'' Another, who's having a problem with her mother, is
told the lady is ``a tumor ... a toxic harpy!''
</P>
<P>
   Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) unable to tame the shrew, uncovers her
spotty past: two divorces, an affair with a married man, and her
Achilles' heel: her own mother. Enter Piper Laurie, putting a new
spin on the hellion mom she played in ``Carrie.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Frasier,'' the alpha-sitcom of the Emmy Awards, is
not known for parodies or issue-wrestling, folks who find the good
doctor intolerant and obnoxious will be whooping their way through
this dig.
</P>

 &HT;    Best of show: Menswear sleek, chic
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 2.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent ``Rubbing Noses'' runway show staged by Neiman Marcus
was aptly named. The spring/summer styles it showcased offered men
in the audience _ especially those who've been behaving badly in
the sartorial department _ a not-so-subtle reminder of their need
for a wardrobe update.
</P>
<P>
   The season's most sharply dressed men are the ones wearing
clothes that are sleek, chic, sexy and colorful. Comfort is always
a consideration when the temperature rises and the days get longer,
but slouchy and carelessly casual aren't the ways to go. Instead,
be aware of the modernistic, body-conscious and dressier turns that
menswear is taking.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Rubbing Noses'' show featured clothes from some of the
priciest lines Neiman's carries: Gucci, Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, and
Missoni. But paying top dollar _ $600 for a shirt, say, or $350 for
a pair of linen pants _ isn't as essential to appearing stylish as
self-confidence, attention to detail and knowing what to look for.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pants: The most stylish slacks now have a trim fit to them.
They're tailored without cuffs or pleats and can even be worn
beltless. Neutrals and pastels look right for the season.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shorts: Just as Capri pants revolutionized the way women
dressed last year, the trend in men's shorts has them hemmed at the
knee and somewhat snug through the thighs and seat. Cargo pockets
are equally trendy. Just make sure those shorts are pressed if you
want to impress.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Footwear: Sneakers and sandals are fine, so long as they're
kept tidy. Sandals, by the way, get sexier and strappier all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tops: Healthy skin is a trendier accessory than jewelry these
days, and this season's muscle-hugging tops (in eye-popping colors
and patterns) afford ample opportunity for skin displays.

 &HT;    Vibrant Indian culture, Spanish opulence meld in a colorful
capital perched in the Andes
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 2.
 &HT;    By William Schemmel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Like most Latin American capitals, there are
two Quitos.
</P>
<P>
   There's the modern might-as-well-be-Nashville city of
1.5-million, with five-star hotels, international restaurants,
tourist shops, museums, foreign embassies, airline offices and
dusk-to-dawn nightlife.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the compelling reason for visiting: the Spanish
colonial Old City, a congested web of narrow cobblestone streets
and confection-colored buildings that open onto enormous plazas and
spectacular churches.
</P>
<P>
   After the Spanish conquered the Inca empire in the 16th century,
they shrewdly set about to win over the native Indians by replacing
their temples with Catholic churches, monasteries, convents and
palaces that in sheer blinding opulence eclipsed the Old Country's
cathedrals and holy shrines.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many, it's impossible to walk more than a block or
two without being drawn into one more freighted with gold leaf,
stained glass, statues and religious paintings than the last.
International volunteers are restoring several damaged by a 1987
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The Monastery of San Francisco, on a raised terrace above the
huge plaza of the same name, is the epitome of bombastic baroque
extravagance. Franciscan priests began it in 1534, mere months
after Quito was founded on the ruins of the Inca empire's northern
capital. When it was finished 70 years later, its altars and
columns fairly dripped gold-leaf ornamentation, religious art and
intricately carved Moorish arches and roofs. (The Spanish, who'd
recently evicted the Moors from their homeland, kept their
architecture as a souvenir.) A bell ringer in a cubbyhole near the
main door sounds huge bells that beckon the faithful to Mass.
</P>
<P>
   To outshine the Franciscans, rival Jesuits began their La
Compania Church in 1605. When it was finally dedicated 163 years
later, it was the most opulent in Spanish America. Some visitors
claim they get dizzy looking at walls, ceilings and altars
shimmering with 7 tons of gold.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be just the effects of altitude. Fifteen miles from
the equator, in a valley 9,350 feet in the Andes, Quito is the
world's second-highest capital, after La Paz, Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   San Agustin Monastery is Ecuador's Independence Hall.
Revolutionary heroes who signed the nation's declaration of
independence from Spain on Aug. 10, 1809, are buried in the
17th-century crypt. Part of the old church is now a school. As a
young nun shepherds her charges through a colonnaded passageway,
under the moldering ruins of ancient frescoes, an imp about 8
stretches his mouth and sticks out his tongue at us. With the
back-of-the-head eyes that come with the veil, the nun sees the
malefaction and zings him on the knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Plaza de la Independencia, a scrupulously clean open space with
heroic statues, flowers and benches from which to observe the
passing human parade, is the Old City's hub. In colonial fashion,
the two traditional symbols of power, the presidential palace and
the cathedral, preside over the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   You can walk down the palace's colonnaded portico and photograph
the honor guards in their blue and white colonial uniforms. They
won't even blink at your flash.
</P>
<P>
   After traipsing through drafty old churches all morning, you'll
be happy to take a table in La Cueva del Oso (the Bear's Cave), a
cool, sophisticated art deco-style restaurant facing the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and well-dressed businesspeople come for Ecuadorean
and continental lunch and dinner. Fresh fish and shrimp are
prepared many creative ways.
</P>
<P>
   If you're watching your sucres (Ecuador's currency), and aren't
afraid of Montezuma's revenge, street vendors sell soup, meat pies,
fruit, fruit juice, soft drinks and bottled water. Many of the
usual U.S. fast food suspects hold forth in the new city's hotel
district.
</P>
<P>
   Highly skilled pickpockets are the Old City's unfortunate
downside. They frequently work in pairs and groups. We were
repeatedly warned not to wear jewelry and to keep money secured in
a neck or belt pouch _ not in a visible hip pack. Even if you
normally prefer to travel alone, a group tour or private guide is a
big advantage. Our Metropolitan Touring guides kept constant vigil,
and none of us had any problems.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy colorful tapestries, embroidered cotton shirts and
blouses, folk art paintings, beautiful woolen sweaters (including
alpaca), leather goods, ponchos, rope sandals, traditional dark
felt hats and Panama hats at endless street stalls in the Old City
and the new. However, it's much more fun to shop for these
handicrafts at Indian markets two or more hours from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the Panamerican Highway south of Quito toward Latacunga
and other market towns, the highway's nickname, ``Avenue of
Volcanoes,'' is self-explanatory. Eight snow-capped volcanoes,
several still active, appear. Chimborazo, a dormant 20,702-foot
snow cone overlooking the city of Riobamba, is Ecuador's highest
peak and a popular climbing destination. Cotapaxi (19,347-feet) is
the world's tallest active volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Latacunga's Tuesday and Saturday market is a warm-up for the
most famous, the Saturday market at Otavalo, 2 1/2 hours north of
Quito. Handicraft hunters can have a field day in the town of
22,000 where hundreds of stalls cover the main plaza and spill into
side streets. Most items are temptingly inexpensive _ you'll rarely
pay more than $5 to $10 for anything. Even at that, some
good-natured bargaining is expected.
</P>
<P>
   I bought three embroidered cotton shirts, a woolen wall hanging
with a scene of Mount Chimborazo, three folk paintings, a felt
fedora and a wooden wolf's-head mask, all for about $50.
</P>
<P>
   When I ate lunch at the Plaza Cafe, my ears did a double take.
Waitress Cray Sheedy, a recent Western Carolina University
graduate, said she ``wanted to see a different part of the world,
and Ecuador definitely is different.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 stores in Cotacachi, 10 miles north of Otavalo,
sell beautifully made, full-length leather coats, jackets,
briefcases, belts and luggage at sharp discounts.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of your shopping day, you needn't drive back to
Quito. Hacienda Pinsaqui, a restored 1790s hacienda three miles
from Otavalo, has 16 suites furnished with antiques and modern
baths, a restaurant, gardens, horseback riding and mountain biking.
(Rates are $75-$100 a night.) In a twist on ``George Washington
Slept Here,'' northern South America's early-19th-century
liberator, Simon Bolivar, was a frequent guest.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: The least expensive way to get to Quito or
Guayaquil is to fly Saeta or Ecuadorian from Atlanta for $607 and
$614, respectively. In the same price range, you can fly Lacsa
round trip from Miami for $350; add round-trip airfare of $158 to
Miami on Delta, AirTran, American or United for a total of $608.
The catch: On Lacsa, it's a 7 1/2-hour flight from Miami through
San Jose, Costa Rica. If you prefer a U.S.-based airline, American
flies direct from Miami in four hours, but the fare is $527 through
June 14, $577 June 15-July 31. If you book on American from Atlanta
through Miami, the fare is $789 before June 14, $839 June 15-July
31, and the flight time is around 7 1/2 hours. Restrictions apply
on all these flights. Your best bet may be to ask your travel agent
to check consolidator fares from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Quito or Guayaquil, strike off on your own or join a
tour arranged by Metropolitan Touring, Ecuador's major tour
operator. You can join a group tour or customize a private tour. In
the United States, Metropolitan is represented by Adventure
Associates, 13150 Coit Road, Suite 110, Dallas, TX 75240,
1-800-527-2500.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Precautions: Visitors unaccustomed to high altitudes sometimes
experience dizziness and nausea in 9,350-foot Quito and the higher
Andes surrounding the city. Diamox, a prescription drug taken
before arrival, can ward it off. Some of our group experienced
minor difficulties the first two days but quickly adjusted and had
no more problems. We drank only bottled mineral water and took
other food precautions. The high altitude keeps the temperature
cool and springlike. Bring a sweater or light coat for nighttime
and the high places. Only a passport is required to visit Ecuador.

 &HT;    Riding rails to adventure in the Andes
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 2.
 &HT;    By William Schemmel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIOBAMBA, Ecuador _ With no bells, whistles or audible
announcement, train men jump aboard, and the Trans-Andean Railroad
(Ferrocarril Transandino) pulls slowly out of the station, a few
minutes behind schedule. We pass the backs of churches, shops,
whitewashed houses with red tile roofs, then rural shanties where
children and adults stand and watch and dogs run crazily along the
tracks, pleased that, like yesterday and the day before, they've
chased the clattering iron monster out of town. Forewarned, we've
brought bottled water, fruit, crackers, cheese and bread and
cushions whose worth accelerates with every jostling mile.
</P>
<P>
   The slow, lolloping speed _ the train rarely travels more than
35 to 40 mph _ and sardined humanity prevents anyone from tumbling
off the nearly flat roof, whose only safety feature is an
ankle-high guardrail.
</P>
<P>
   The roof-riders are a mixed bag of ages and nationalities _ kids
traveling with their parents, groups of twentysomething backpackers
and senior citizens, Europeans, Americans, Canadians, Latins,
Aussies and a party of Japanese. Wrapped in layers of sweaters,
jackets and ponchos, we huddle together against the chilly mountain
air.
</P>
<P>
   Some will depart after the white-knuckle ride down the Devil's
Nose. Others will go all the way to Guayaquil _ a 10-hour journey _
and ride back the next day. A group of us plan to overnight in
Guayaquil, then fly out to the Galapagos Islands and walk awhile
among wild nature.
</P>
<P>
   Like our transcontinental railroad, the Transandino was a
monumental project that gripped Ecuador's imagination. Construction
of what Ecuadoreans proudly call ``the world's most difficult
railroad'' began at Guayaquil on the Pacific coast in 1899.
Sacrificing countless lives, many of them Jamaicans imported for
the cruel work, it cut through rain forests, rivers, desert and
perpendicular rock walls more than 10,000 feet above sea level. It
reached Quito, the nation's capital, 280 miles from the coast, in
1908. Since then, floods, landslides and earthquakes have taken
their toll on bridges and tracks. Some sections were washed away in
the 1982-83 El Nino floods, but because of the revenue it generates
from foreign tourists, the line between Riobamba and Guayaquil has
been kept open.
</P>
<P>
   Free of Riobamba, the diesel-powered train puts its show
onstage. Behind us, Mount Chimborazo _ Ecuador's highest peak,
20,702 feet of snowcapped volcanic splendor _ is the dramatic
scrim. On both sides of the tracks, steep mountainsides 8,000 to
10,000 feet high are terraced with cornfields, potatoes and furrows
of beans and squash.
</P>
<P>
   High up, Indians in brightly colored shawls look like patches of
strawberries and raspberries against the verdant foliage. At rural
crossings, others wait patiently with flocks of sheep and goats. We
wave, but they don't wave back. Dogs rush out and chase us around
wheat fields and past rivers and streams shaded by aromatic
eucalyptus trees and wild purple lupine. Waterfalls race down from
creases in the mountains. A Japanese photographer utters mortified
apologies when the lurching train tosses him onto a pile of
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The train stops frequently in the center of small towns and
villages with streets so narrow we can reach out and shake hands
with people hanging out their windows. We spill off to stock up on
fruit and bottled water and line up for cafe banos.
</P>
<P>
   The German woman I met in Riobamba comes back to the roof with
cuy, a whole roasted guinea pig wrapped in a greasy newspaper.
``Delicious,'' she smacks her lips, grins and tears off chunks of
the meat _ a sort of Ecuadorean barbecue, handed down from the
Incas _ and offers it around. The taste is reputedly somewhere
between chicken and rabbit, but the critter's rat snout, little
rodent teeth, upturned paws and tightly shut eyes turn off all but
the most daring.
</P>
<P>
   When we pull onto a rural siding to wait for the Riobamba-bound
train to pass, we jump down to stretch our legs. A tipsy man whose
breath would buckle bamboo totters out of his lopsided wooden hut.
With flapping arms and slurred Indian-Spanish dialect, he tries to
explain the mysteries of the yellow and blue butterflies that swarm
around us. ``Para la nina'' _ ``for the child,'' he says. We drop
Ecuadorean sucres into his outstretched palm and hope without much
conviction that the waif watching expressionless from the window of
the hut will get some small share of our charity.
</P>
<P>
   At another stop in a rural village, some say goodbye to the
train and board the autoferra, a sort of Greyhound bus with iron
wheels that rides the tracks like the train. It lacks the
Transandino's camaraderie and on-the-edge excitement, but padded
seats, a bathroom and a rooftop railing high enough to keep you
from pitching overboard in the precipitous mountain passes make it
a good alternative for those who want a few comforts with their
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Jungly foliage segues into mountainous desert peppered with
pampas grass, mesquite bushes and cactus. At the town of Palmira,
the line climbs to 10,623 feet, its highest point. Then comes the
ride's hair-raising showpiece. The steep drop from 7,655 feet at
the village of Alausi to 5,996 feet at Sibambe takes the train down
El Nariz del Diablo (the Devil's Nose), an almost perpendicular
rock wall hanging precariously above a river gorge. The descent is
an engineering feat, accomplished by a painstaking seven-mile
series of zigzagging switchbacks down a ledge cut into the
mountainside. On the way to the small Sibambe station at the
bottom, it crosses rickety bridges over yawning ravines and rushing
streams. When I overcome acrophobia long enough for a quick look
over the edge of the roof, there's nothing between me and eternity
except a few thousand feet of clear mountain air.
</P>
<P>
   Macho guys stand up and scream and flap their arms, daring the
train to toss them into the Andean blue yonder. Anxious friends
yank them down as the train rushes through dark tunnels, where
clearance is barely more than a foot or two and the ceiling a
scythe of jagged rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The roof riders laugh and scream like roller coaster riders at
Six Flags. I scrunch down, white-knuckle the railing and grin like
a man possessed. Under the rusty tin roof of the Sibambe station,
the welcoming committee is a mute little boy sucking his thumb and
a scrawny pack of dogs looking for a handout.
</P>
<P>
   After Alausi, we shuck our early-morning layers down to shorts
and T-shirts and ramble through tropical rain forests. OSHA would
have a field day with this: Branches overhanging the tracks sting
faces and arms. We could reach out and pick mangoes and papayas
from the passing trees.
</P>
<P>
   Termite nests high in the trees are so large an NFL linebacker
would have difficulty getting both arms around them. Brilliant
clouds of butterflies lead us into Bucay. We slice through banana
plantations, cattle ranches and aquafarms, where the shrimp in your
neighborhood grocery are hatched.
</P>
<P>
   The equatorial sun is ferocious now, ignoring layers of 30- and
40-SPF sunscreen. Many retreat inside the car. A few of us swab on
more high-powered lotion and ride it out. Japanese photographers
keep on clicking.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, we finally get to the end of the line,
the sweltering sea-level town of Duran. Drenched and dehydrated,
pumped up from derring-do, we swagger down from the train and
wobble around on rubbery legs.
</P>
<P>
   We slap hands with fellow rooftoppers and board a bus across the
wide and muddy Guayas River to Guayaquil, Ecuador's Pacific coast
port and largest city. Over there somewhere is a hotel with air
conditioning, a pool and maybe a ``Seinfeld'' rerun on satellite
TV.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Traveling on your own rachets up the train's
adventure factor. There's no central information number, and
tickets must be purchased at the station where you board. As noted,
departure times are not completely accurate and cancellations are
often without notice. But it's an incredible bargain _ a one-way
ticket from Riobamba to Guayaquil is $14. It goes on Sundays,
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays and returns from Guayaquil the
same day or the next day, depending on freight and the number of
passengers. You can come by train from Quito to Riobamba (140
miles) only on Saturdays. So most travelers take a bus from the
capital and overnight in Riobamba.
</P>
<P>
   The hacienda-style Hotel El Troje, three miles from town, has
modern air-conditioned rooms, a good restaurant, bar, pool, tennis
and folkloric entertainment for about $50 a night. You can avoid
the hassles and uncertainties by booking through a reputable tour
operator, such as omnipresent Metropolitan Touring (represented in
the United States by Adventure Associates, 1-800-527-2500).

 &HT;    REBEL WITH A CAUSE TAKES ON COCA-COLA
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 2.
 &HT;    Eds: Note biography box at end of story.
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a young boy, Cyrus Mehri marched with his
parents to protest the Vietnam war. Before he was a teenager, he
was spellbound by the Watergate hearings. As a young man, he became
a field organizer for Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   These things, former colleague Michael D. Hausfeld said, helped
shape a lawyer who is still taking on the establishment, still
trying to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   This time the establishment is Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, a
``cultural icon,'' in Mehri's words. Mehri is suing Coca-Cola on
behalf of one former and three current employees of the company.
The suit alleges Coca-Cola discriminates against African-Americans
in promotions, pay and evaluations. The company says the suit ``is
without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be several years _ and the spending of ``a small
fortune'' by his law firm, Mehri, Malkin &AMP; Ross _ before the
Coca-Cola case is resolved, Mehri said.
</P>
<P>
   Mehri, who started the Washington firm last year after being
part of the winning team in a $176 million discrimination suit
settlement with Texaco, picks his fights carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take a case unless not only is it a solid
case, a well-rounded case, a viable case, but also has a public
dimension to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The public dimension in the Coca-Cola case, Mehri suggests, is
race relations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Mehri noted, has talked in abstract terms
about starting a national discussion of race relations. The
Coca-Cola case, Mehri predicted, ``is going to trigger a
conversation about race with concrete examples: What it really
means to have a glass ceiling. What it really means to have people
channeled off into certain areas. What it means to have the full
panoply of opportunities that there would be for white employees,
not to be there for the black employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri has been described as ``cocky,'' but lest he be
underestimated, recall his training under one of the nation's most
prominent consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Nader ... was a tremendous experience for me
because I learned so much about taking on very powerful
institutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has had some success, notably in the Texaco case, in which
inflammatory tapes of conversations by company executives were
dropped into his lap. ``Masterfully'' orchestrated publicly
generated by the lawyers who took on Texaco also helped, according
to an article in The American Lawyer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Was Mehri good in the Texaco case? Or was he lucky?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good, lucky lawyer,'' responded Hausfeld, a partner in
the firm of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll, for whom Mehri worked
at the time. ``Every good lawyer, now and then, needs a little
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   And media savvy, according The American Lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say we use the media, but my vision of this kind of
work is that we are like a private attorney general, and just like
an attorney general, there is a constituency, there is the
public,'' Mehri said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he denied leaking information to The New York Times,
whose front-page stories about the Texaco tapes were followed
shortly by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word leak is not an accurate term, because that suggests
that something that was not public was leaked,'' Mehri offered.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Mehri shared in a $20 million payday for the
plaintiffs' lawyers. He wouldn't disclose how much much he got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just say I'm doing fine financially,'' he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   But money is not the only motivator, Mehri said. ``For me, this
practice has twin goals. One, you need to be successful from a
business point of view, to survive, to keep going so you can
litigate other cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of my brethren in the bar miss the other side of
it, which is that you have to be in this for the justice, you have
to be in this to open the doors and give access to the legal system
that ordinary people don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say the most gratifying moment I've had as a
professional was the day we had the hearing approving the Texaco
settlement,'' Mehri said, with a hint of tears in his eyes as he
recalled the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a no-press-allowed event with over 100 of the
(plaintiffs) at a hotel down the street from the courthouse. One by
one, the people came up, the African-American employees, with
testimonials. Hearing how much those folks appreciated what we had
done, and what I myself had done personally, because my life was
that case, and I put my career on the line for that case, when I
heard those words, that really moved me. It was worth it for that
one moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think this is a cause for Cyrus,'' said Stanley Weiner,
who represented Fina, a petroleum company, in a mediated settlement
last year involving discrimination complaints by clients of Mehri.
</P>
<P>
   The financial reward is probably part of the equation, too,
suggested Weiner, of Jones, Day, Reavis &AMP; Pogue in Dallas, But, he
added of Mehri: ``He's doing this because he believes in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri said he credits his father for his business sense and his
mother for a sense of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are immigrants from Iran,'' he said. ``They came to
the United States because they wanted their kids to grow up in a
free society.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately enough, Mehri was born on Bastille Day.
</P>
<P>
   In the Coca-Cola case, he will need more than the coincidence of
a birthday marking the French revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The American Lawyer, in its exhaustive story on the Texaco case,
noted that ``class action employment discrimination suits are
notoriously hard for plaintiffs to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri's personality is a plus in such cases, according to
Hausfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an amazing facility with people,'' he said. ``They
trust him. He creates a good attachment with them so they feel free
to talk with him about what is bothering them.''
</P>
<P>
   Specializing in employment opportunity has ``magnified the best
of his talents,'' Hausfeld adds.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the Coca-Cola case is likely to be a longer haul
than the relatively short Texaco case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did pretty well in a sprint,'' noted Weiner. ``But how well
he will do in a marathon? I don't know.''

NEW PLACE, NEW ADVENTURE FOR THE INIMITABLE FATHER TIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN GRIFFIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hallelujah! Father Tim's back.
</P>
<P>
   But in Jan Karon's ``A New Song'' (Viking, $24.95), he's left
the small town of Mitford, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   That might not seem like a big deal on the surface. Pastors
change parishes all the time. But to those of us who are fans of
Karon's Mitford series, such news is tantamount to heresy.
</P>
<P>
   Through four novels, we have followed the adventures of Father
Tim Kavanagh and have grown quite fond of this aging, though not
elderly, Episcopalian priest who has found love and family later
than he ever thought. There's a kinship not only with him but also
with his wonderfully eclectic and somewhat eccentric neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Father Tim's world is incomplete without the likes of
his adopted son, Dooley; the jokester Uncle Billy and his
schizophrenic wife, Miss Rose; the hymn-loving Louella; the
industrious, gossipy Emma; Puny and her twins.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on. And all are dear old friends.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps too old, for after four novels, Karon probably felt she
had no place to take Father Tim in Mitford, so she removed him and
his wife, Cynthia, to the North Carolina coast and an interim
position with a church on Whitecap Island.
</P>
<P>
   Such a change would be hard for anyone, especially someone like
Father Tim, who's genuinely homesick and spends a great deal of
time on the phone with old friends. Too often, it seems, for he is
admonished for not tending to the needs of his new church and a
whole new set of challenging parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   As in the previous installments, the good Lord lays out much for
the priest to grapple with. Like Abraham, who became a father late
in life, Father Tim learns the joys of parenthood when he and
Cynthia take in a 3-year-old whose mother suffers from debilitating
bouts of depression. And like Abraham, Father Tim eventually deals
with having to sacrifice the child.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the novel succeeds this well. Too much of the
plotting, such as an awkwardly rendered ``Phantom of the Opera''
rip-off, descends into the predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, predictability on a certain level has always been one
of Karon's strengths. Her readers love knowing that, by novel's
end, at least one lost soul will find salvation and that, despite
life's rocky path, universal truths about God's love will come
shining through.
</P>
<P>
   But Karon's writing in the earlier novels, especially in ``A
Home in Mitford'' and, my favorite, ``Out to Canaan,'' had an
effortlessness about it while the storytelling displayed a
disarming simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A New Song,'' though, the humor is sometimes forced and
there's a slight strain in a couple of the stories. But the
author's heart is, as always, in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   And if some of her new characters don't have the same resonance
as our old Mitford friends, it's probably just because we don't
have the same history with them. That's sure to come, too, for
Karon has wisely left many a string untied, a sure sign that Father
Tim's inspirational story is far from being at an end.

`ELECTION' WINS WITH SUBTLE SATIRE AND GREAT ACTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been said that the new comedy ``Election'' puts former
``Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' star Matthew Broderick on the other
side, as a befuddled and malevolent teacher. It's a glib
description and an inaccurate one. He's Jim McAllister, a caring
teacher who loves his kids and loves what he does. And it's his
love for doing what's right that gets him into trouble. He goes
nose-to-nose against the perky and ambitious Tracy Flick (Reese
Witherspoon), who's determined to add the title of class president
to her already waist-deep pile of accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Director Alexander Payne, who co-wrote the script (with Jim
Taylor, who has a featured role), has gone deeper and less broad
than he did with his previous comedy, the rambunctious ``Citizen
Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' works much closer to the bone, taking place under
cool gray skies that cast a somber tone to this MTV Films-produced
social satire that is, of all things, subtle.
</P>
<P>
   A key exchange early in the movie sets things up, in a funny and
painful classroom scene in which McAllister asks students to define
the difference between morality and ethics. The students, caught in
the vortex between indifference and boredom, try to force an answer
when they're singled out. But they're wrong, and they don't exactly
care. Tracy throws her arm up as if it were a flare, and McAllister
refuses to acknowledge her until he has to.
</P>
<P>
   If this were ``Ferris Bueller,'' the soundtrack would point up
the student's triumph so mercilessly that you'd have to duck the
Dolby bombast. Payne and Taylor make the point elegantly. Tracy is
the future, oblivious to everything except her own determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' is built on the kind of delusion that makes the
best American comedy, in which all are convinced that they're doing
what has to be done _ the hilarious and ultimately self-destructive
impulse to hurl themselves into the breach.
</P>
<P>
   In McAllister's case, it's finding the right person to run
against Tracy. He finds just the guy, the hobbled football stud
Paul (Chris Klein), an amiable born winner who seems stoned on his
own charisma. Which fires up Tracy even more. And which really sets
a fire under Paul's adopted sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), whose
jealousy _ her girlfriend dumps her for Paul _ prompts Tammy to run
for the office on the apathy ticket. (A ticket that gets the
biggest audience response at a school assembly.)
</P>
<P>
   Payne is equally interested in all of his characters. And, as he
did in ``Citizen Ruth,'' he fashions an observant social comedy in
which a woman is at the center of the action. Provisionally,
``Election'' is McAllister's story. But it's deceptive, because
although McAllister does most of the narration, we get to hear what
is going on in almost everybody's head.
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon's pinging enthusiasm is beveled to a nightmarish
point. And Campbell is a wonder; her anguish and resentment have
twisted her into an angry knot, and Campbell makes Tammy's
suffering real and funny.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder how well ``Election'' will do. This kind of brainy,
sourball comedy isn't a high-concept wonder that pulls kids into
the tent like ``10 Things I Hate About You'' (which features one of
the best performances of the year, from Julia Stiles) or ``She's
All That.''
</P>
<P>
   And the subject matter ain't the kind of thing that might
attract adults, who would definitely like it. (The title doesn't
help either, although it is taken from the novel.) It's undeniably
one of the best comedies of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, content and accomplishment aren't enough to
bring in viewers. Let's hope that's not the case here.

BOMBS FOR BELGRADE, BOMBAST FROM WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If I were watching the debate over Serbia on
C-SPAN, it probably came as a surprise that the power to declare
war is reserved for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Don't presidents have the right to bomb any country that
displeases them? Recently we've only seen Congress declare war on
the president. For decades, Congress has stood by while presidents
blew up things around the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House of Representatives stood up for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, our courageous members of Congress stood up halfway,
stooping to please, kneeling to pray or crouching to keep their
heads low.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to pass a proposal to declare war. It was sponsored
by Rep. Tom Campbell, a California Republican whose constituents
declared war on him for voting to impeach President Clinton. He
probably wants to go out on a high-minded note.
</P>
<P>
   They voted to make the president seek their approval before
sending infantry into the mud of Kosovo. Members of Congress are
experts in mud. Flinging it.
</P>
<P>
   They tied, 213-213, on what was meant to be a symbolic vote
supporting Clinton's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean? Congress seems to like its wars
undeclared, without ground troops and deadlocked in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the way Clinton likes his wars, too, so what's
the fuss?
</P>
<P>
   The measure that passed, sponsored by Republicans with lots of
Democrats voting for it, would require Clinton to get congressional
approval to send ``ground elements'' to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress debated what ground elements means, the Pentagon
was ordering more air elements to the war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A tie goes to the runner, and Clinton is on the run. He
maintained his traditional power to declare air war.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on movies or video games, but Americans act like air
wars aren't really wars. Maybe this is because we've never had an
air war waged against our cities.
</P>
<P>
   It was amazing to listen to the squawking of Democratic hawks
and Republican doves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing for peace is wrong and it's not working,'' said Rep.
Doug Bereuter, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to cut and run,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos of
California, echoing the words of his fellow Democrat Lyndon
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked Congress to ``speak with a single voice'' so he
can demonstrate unity in the face of atrocities by Serbian leader
Slobodan Milosevic. Congress didn't speak with a single voice, and
in a way represented the American people better than it usually
does.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the war in Serbia, America is a barnyard of
hawks, doves, chickens and those who merely want to duck.
</P>
<P>
   Those birds do not flock together along party lines. For a year
everyone has called for bipartisanship, and we finally got it _ a
bipartisan ship of fools.
</P>
<P>
   I'm starting to feel for Clinton. He underestimated Milosevic,
thinking a few cruise missiles would cow the guy. He didn't
anticipate Milosevic would swamp his neighbors with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thought bombing would be enough. And since bombing is a
de facto power of the presidency, he wouldn't have to go to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, his war with Congress isn't over any more than his
war with Milosevic. We have a weakened president, and maybe that's
good in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson had been weak in 1964, maybe he wouldn't have been
able to get Congress to go along with the Gulf of Tonkin
resolution, authorizing presidential power to launch military
actions in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, we have all those Albanian refugees and we
owe them something.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to speak with one voice. There are always a bunch
chattering inside our consciences and our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   We don't want to see refugees raped, killed and run out of their
homes into filthy camps. We also don't want to see American troops
trudge through the mud and die in Kosovo, a place most of us never
heard of a couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us don't like the idea of shooting guided missiles at
the home of the president of a country we haven't declared war on.
</P>
<P>
   But if they'd have found him at home, we probably wouldn't have
minded.
</P>
<P>
   Our president declared air war, which many Americans believe is
within his powers. But winning wars with aircraft alone is not
within anyone's power.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are, stuck 10,000 feet over the quagmire with our
precision weapons that have a disturbing way of becoming imprecise
right into villages and refugee convoys. The results don't look
like the Pentagon video games seen at press briefings.
</P>
<P>
   Our elected representatives are hard at work, though. Congress
has urged Clinton to meet with entertainment industry leaders to
curb media violence.
</P>
<P>
   I have a feeling, though, that we'll be seeing videotapes
showing bombs hitting buildings in Belgrade for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Keep declaring it isn't a war, and hope for the best. That seems
to be what both Clinton and Congress are doing.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to declare war on ``The Matrix'' and ``Doom.''

BIGGER, BOLDER TREND IN WEDDING CAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(HAS ART)  
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When it comes to wedding cakes, anything goes
these days. While the classic three-tiered wedding cake will never
go out of style, there are plenty of other options _ including
nontraditional shapes and bolder colors. The buzz word is (BEGIN
ITALICS)individual(END ITALICS).
</P>
<P>
   The bride's selection depends on her style, taste and dreams,
say local wedding cake experts who customize and design cakes to
suit each individual, the wedding location, the dress and the color
theme.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the bride decides on, the cake should delight the
palate as well as the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we're seeing more soft, romantic cakes, more flowers
_ whether they are fresh or buttercream _ and very soft colors in
the flowers and the cake,'' said Jane Lockhart, owner of Sweet Lady
Jane in Los Angeles. ``White or ivory colored cakes are most
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   And nowadays, many brides are opting for a larger cake based on
visual impact rather than the number of guests to be served.
</P>
<P>
   Colette Peters, owner of Colette's Cakes in New York, likes
doing different cakes that reflect the bridal couple's personality
and has fashioned many fanciful cakes, among them one that
resembled a flowered cloisonne bell and a country cottage with a
white picket fence.
</P>
<P>
   She has also created a Blue Delftware cake in a bright
blue-and-white design to incorporate a Delft ginger jar. Her
Majolica Cake, inspired by Italian majolica ceramics, has
different, brightly colored layers with colorful designs depicting
sunflowers, fans and more.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a glimpse of some of her fabulous designs in her
book, ``Colette's Wedding Cakes'' (Little, Brown and Co.).
</P>
<P>
   ``People right now are doing more rolled fondant (or rolled-out
icing) _ made out of sugar and gelatin _ rather than icing smoothed
on with a knife,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Regal Bakery in the suburb of Woodland Hills, customers also
favor the smooth fondant look along with white chocolate shavings.
Also, realistic-looking handmade sugar paste flowers in different
sizes, shapes and colors are often requested, especially by those
who want an outdoor look but are skeptical about using fresh
flowers (they can wilt or contain pesticides, and the stems may be
poisonous).
</P>
<P>
   But fresh flowers on cakes still rank among the top choices with
brides.
</P>
<P>
   If using fresh flowers, check with the bakery regarding who will
order and arrange them on the cake. The flower colors usually
complement the colors of the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Neon colors _ like bright orange, lime green and hot pink _ are
being used for both the decorations and the cake itself these days,
said Teresa Leung, Regal's cake designer. ``We've also been doing
cakes in blue fondant with white chocolate seashells for weddings
at the beach _ and brown sugar is used to simulate sand around the
cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Plusko's Valley Bakeries in Canoga Park ``turns out more
traditional three-tiered cakes with white columns and buttercream
roses _ in colors ranging from purple to pink to burgundy and teal
or other colors to match the bridesmaids' dresses _ than anything
else,'' said owner Darlene Plusko, who has been in the business for
more than two decades. Second in popularity are their cakes on
individual stands that have been trendy for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The most-requested cake finishes are basket weave, chantilly
(which resembles really fine lace) and elegance (created by piping
buttercream up and down the cake with a border cake-decorating
tip), said Plusko. And cakes decorated with edible white and dark
chocolate seashells along with real seashells on the tiers are
currently very popular, especially for Malibu weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Toppers on cakes range from fresh or buttercream flowers to old
porcelain vintage or Lladro brides and grooms, crystal or porcelain
dolphins, ceramic teddy bears, Cinderella and Prince Charming and
family heirlooms, say the cake experts. Regal Bakery can even
create a cake basket creation that can hold fresh fruits such as
grapes, blueberries and raspberries, depending on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Today's brides have more adventurous choices in cake flavors and
fillings than in the past. Cakes today run the gamut from lemon,
chocolate Grand Marnier, cappuccino, Bailey's Irish Creme, banana
nut, cheesecake and carrot cake to marble cake, German chocolate,
yellow, chocolate and more. Among the various filling choices are
fresh fruits, raspberry whipped cream, chocolate pudding, rum
custard, apricot marzipan, banana custard, tiramisu, cappuccino
cream and much more.
</P>
<P>
   At Plusko's, the selection includes eight cake flavors and 12
fillings, while at Regal Bakery there are a dozen cake options and
more than two dozen filling possibilities. Sweet Lady Jane offers
18 flavor choices (the bakery has already paired the cakes and
fillings that work best together), including lemon cake with lemon
curd, coconut with pastry cream, and chocolate cake with raspberry
filling.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Lady Jane's most popular wedding cake flavor is triple
berry _ yellow butter cake with three layers of fresh berries _
raspberries, blackberries and strawberries with cream _ followed by
the chocolate old-fashioned cake with chocolate European
buttercream, notes Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   At Plusko's, the champagne cake _ yellow sponge cake with
champagne custard filling and whipped cream icing _ takes the top
spot and is the signature cake, says Plusko. Second in popularity
is the chocolate and white cake with chocolate chip custard
filling. At Regal Bakery, the most ordered cake is chocolate filled
with chocolate fudge and chocolate mousse or Bailey's Irish cream,
says Leung.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary greatly, so plan to taste cake samples, which most
bakeries will provide with no obligation, before ordering. Pricing
is quoted either by the slice or person, or by the completed cake.
It ranges anywhere from $1.85 to $15 per person per serving,
depending upon the elaborateness of the cake design.
</P>
<P>
   At Plusko's, an average three-tiered cake that will serve about
125 people is about $190 with whipped cream icing. At Regal, an
average three- or four-tiered cake for 150 guests costs about $400,
while at Sweet Lady Jane, a three-tiered cake that serves 100
people will be about $700, including fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The most extravagant, pricey cake for Regal was a $4,000 castle
cake with an elevator that served 300 people. Sweet Lady Jane's
most expensive cake was a $5,000 six-tiered cake for 300 people
that Lockhart was commissioned to do in Napa. &UR;

THE MELTDOWN OF THE NUCLEAR FAMILY MYTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the familiar orgy of finger-pointing and
cultural analysis continues in the wake of the Littleton massacre,
a few facts should be underscored before they're forgotten. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Complete answers died with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, so we
may never know exactly why they stockpiled weapons, then launched
themselves on a murderous rampage through Columbine High School.
But we do know that decidedly absent from the case are some of the
customary social dogs that people love to kick around.
</P>
<P>
   The two teen-agers _ who allegedly planned to kill hundreds of
people _ were not members of a racial or ethnic minority, were not
poor and did not come from broken homes.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the next time a politician or condemnatory
clergyman heaps the blame for society's woes atop welfare mothers,
divorce, violence-prone minorities and the decay of traditional
family values.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Klebold nor Harris was scarred by the pain of divorce;
both boys came from that much-touted panacea for society's ills:
the intact nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   The killing spree had nothing to do with years of harassment and
discrimination over skin color, ethnic origin or family religion.
While Harris and Klebold were ridiculed and ostracized, it seems it
was because of a highly counter-cultural lifestyle they voluntarily
adopted in their teens.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were the boys products of the much-maligned welfare system
or the lower working class.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' father, a retired Air Force pilot, is employed by a
flight safety company. Harris' mother works for a caterer. The
Klebolds live in a $400,000 home. Dylan Klebold's father was a
geophysicist but now runs his own mortgage management company. His
wife provides vocational training for disabled community college
students.
</P>
<P>
   One long-time neighbor of the Harrises called them ``dream
parents ... supportive, not critical. They didn't put undue
pressure on their son.'' A friend and neighbor of the Klebolds
said: ``This is a conscientious, normal family that's done
everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, the rabid blame layers will no doubt find
something wrong with the Klebolds' and Harrises' parenting; the
couples are human after all, which means they make mistakes. But
will it be enough to explain the enormity of their boys' crimes?
</P>
<P>
   When all the facts are known, the why of the Columbine massacre
may not be so tidily laid at the parents' feet.
</P>
<P>
   Then what? To whom will the indictment _ ``Why did no one see?''
_ be handed down?
</P>
<P>
   Just after the Littleton shootings, people in that community
repeated the same myth that sprang up in Jonesboro, Ark.; West
Paducah, Ky.; Springfield, Ore.; and Pearl, Miss. _ sites of other
rampages by middle-class, white teen-age boys: ``Things like this
just don't happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   They repeated it because _ despite the growing body of contrary
evidence _ most Americans still believe that explosive violence and
senseless destruction arise primarily in big urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   They expect kids to kill each other in places where unhappy,
attitude-wielding minorities are the majority; where teens drop out
of school or don the colors of street gangs; where fathers are in
short supply, and welfare is the common legacy from one generation
to the next.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Klebolds' neighbors told the Associated Press:
``There are so many kids whose goal in life is to hide their plans.
Most of us are the last ones to see our kids in trouble. You're
just blinded by ... love.''
</P>
<P>
   Love. And perhaps the belief that violence and insane rage don't
live in places like Littleton, Colo.

PATAKI ATTACKS CLINTON'S BALKAN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York Gov. George Pataki blasted President
Clinton's foreign policy and his handling of the conflict over
Kosovo, saying the administration's ``track record of
indecisiveness'' helped create the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slobodan Milosevic did not fear us, and he had no reason to
fear us ... which is one of the reasons we're in this crisis in the
first place,'' Pataki, referring to the leader of Yugoslavia, told
an audience of several hundred people at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor said the Clinton administration's
pattern of repeatedly issuing threats against foreign dictators,
such as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and then backing down led
the Serbian leader to believe the United States would not act
forcefully to prevent attacks against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear in my mind that this administration's track
record of indecisiveness would endanger the very people we set out
to help,'' he said in the Wednesday night address.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's appearance here was part of a series of speeches
he has made around the country in recent months intended to bolster
his national stature.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has been flirting with the possibility of running for the
presidency, traveling to Illinois, Florida, Missouri and New
Hampshire, site of the first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has not said whether he would seek another office,
and the only race he has ruled out is the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the president's policy in dealing with Yugoslavia
have resulted in a complete failure to achieve the original goals
laid out by the administration when the NATO bombing campaign began
March 24, namely to protect the Kosovo Albanians and to weaken
Milosevic's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of deterring atrocities in Kosovo, the bombings are
intensifying the atrocities ... and instead of eroding support for
Milosevic, the bombings have rallied the Serbian people around
him,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia that once enjoyed relative
autonomy. Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, sees Kosovo
as an invaluable part of its history.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki urged Clinton to follow President George Bush's example
in the Gulf War and define what the country's goals are in the
Balkans and how he intends to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the president should stop escalating the war in a
``Vietnam-style'' gradualism and should instead be prepared to act
``boldly'' to achieve victory if military action is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parallels between President Clinton in Kosovo and
President (Lyndon) Johnson in Vietnam are frightening,'' Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has billed his various speeches as his attempt to
maneuver the Republican Party's agenda during the upcoming
elections. The governor has emphasized lower taxes and longer
prison sentences, a combination that Pataki aides said they believe
offers a Republican image with wider appeal than that offered by
social conservatives in the party.
</P>
<P>
   With its emphasis on Kosovo and America's role in the world,
Pataki's speech appeared to be aimed at showing Washington insiders
that the governor has the mastery of foreign policy issues to be
considered for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next century will be America's second century, but only if
we reclaim the bold American leadership the world has received in
the past and demands in the future,'' Pataki said.

CELTICS' FUTURE HAS ALREADY STARTED

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Rick Pitino knows something you don't. He sees something
you don't. You have to wonder if he carries a stack of tarot cards
in his back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   You hear him constantly say his team will begin the 21st century
with a playoff appearance. He doesn't say ``maybe.'' He doesn't say
``if.'' He doesn't say ``one more year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. It will be next year. Playoffs. Call the Celtics' ticket
offices right now. Get an early start. There will be playoff
basketball on Causeway Street in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   You see a quasi-lottery team just like everyone else (save for
the fact this lottery team probably won't have its own first-round
draft pick in June). What does Pitino see? The coach was asked that
Wednesday when his team, appropriately, practiced at the University
of Miami. Many students on campus were surprised when told the
Celtics were working out at a nearby gym. The undergrads were
expecting the pros to have hairlines that recede like South Beach
shorelines. But the Celtics look like them: young and college-aged.
They'll look that way next year too because that's exactly who they
are.
</P>
<P>
   So, what will change?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you're young and talented, what you need is
practice,'' Pitino explained. ``And I'm positive that we'll get the
necessary practice time and become a very good basketball team. I
think we have the necessary ingredients. Now, without (Tony) Battie
and (Vitaly) Potapenko, I wouldn't be quite as sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in Boston, Pitino has talked about the team's
lack of size. He has size now in the 6-foot-11-inch Battie and 6-10
Potapenko. He likes Battie so much that he has considered having
him guard smaller, quicker players. He likes Potapenko, too. He
will get a chance to tinker with the center's game this summer,
since he has already committed to playing in the team's summer
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've given us a new level rebounding-wise and a new
level from a physical standpoint,'' Pitino said. ``One is a big,
physical guy who will knock you on your ass. And the other is a
shot blocker. Those are the two necessary ingredients that we
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Pitino did not wish for an injured team, he said his
players' ailments have helped him evaluate. Now he knows he likes
Potapenko and Battie together on the court. He also has found some
things that may surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know something? I almost made the move (Tuesday
night); I almost put Tony Battie on Grant Hill,'' Pitino said. ``I
think eventually, if he was a year or two older, we could do that.
He's quick enough to guard a smaller man and he would be the best
guy to play Grant Hill in that scenario _ with another year of
seasoning.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenario Tuesday was the 6-8 Hill rarely had to look up when
posting up a Celtic. He had nearly two inches on Paul Pierce, an
inch on Ron Mercer, and could go around Walter McCarty, who is
6-10. Pitino insists that Battie, who went through a growth spurt
his first year of college (he had entered as a 6-7 freshman), has
the footwork to stay with Hill as well as the shot-blocking ability
to discourage soft turnarounds.
</P>
<P>
   So, just to be sure, this will help make the Celtics a playoff
team? Some of the players certainly believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that not only will we be a playoff team,'' Pierce
added after practice, ``I think we'll be fighting for that top spot
in the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was reminded that NBA neighborhoods are similar to
neighborhoods across the country: If you do something, your nosy
neighbor may try to do it better. The Cavaliers will most likely
have two lottery picks. Same story with the Raptors. Both of those
teams are ahead of the Celtics now. They may choose to keep the
picks they have or trade them for established players.
</P>
<P>
   If the Celtics are going to make the playoffs in 2000 they had
better be ready to leap a few people.

MASSACHUSETTS MAY GAIN FROM NFL RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- National Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue
finally got tired of presiding over the downsizing of the NFL and
the state of Massachusetts may be the first beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   The league's decision at the March owners' meetings to pass
Resolution G-2, the Stadium Construction Contribution Policy, was a
key impetus that led to the new stadium proposal agreed to late
Tuesday night between House Speaker Tom Finneran and Senate
President Tom Birmingham. It is hoped that deal will provide
Patriots owner Bob Kraft with a reason to reject Connecticut's
sweetheart proposal that would hand him a state-funded, $384
million stadium at no cost if he agrees to move his franchise to
Hartford by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   For the team to stay in Massachusetts, Kraft would have to turn
his back on the richest stadium deal in sports history, a
Connecticut proposal that would give him a state-of-the-art stadium
plus $120 million in maintenance funding and $1 billion in
guaranteed suite and club seat income over the life of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting that cash-rich offer, Kraft would have to agree to
privately fund a 68,000-seat stadium in Foxborough that would cost
him an estimated $225 million while he receives $70 million in
state-funded infrastructure that he would partially repay at $1.4
million a year out of parking fees or a ticket surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft formally rejects Connecticut's plan by Sunday's
deadline and accepts the Massachusetts offer (assuming it passes
through the Legislature as presently constructed), he would become
the first owner in sports history to agree to partially pay for
infrastructure improvements to state roads and utilities as part of
a stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   But Resolution G-2, which was approved by a 29-2 vote of NFL
owners six weeks ago, would make Kraft eligible for a low-interest
loan from the league that could account for up to 34 percent of the
building costs. That loan would be repaid by the league from
television revenue and visiting team shares of club seat tickets as
well as through a contribution from the players' union out of its
share of gross revenues.
</P>
<P>
   That resolution was passed in large part because of growing
concerns among league owners and television executives that stadium
problems in major cities were forcing teams to abandon the nation's
largest television markets for far smaller ones. That trend has led
in recent years to the Los Angeles Rams moving to St. Louis, the
Los Angeles Raiders moving to Oakland, the Cleveland Browns moving
to Baltimore, the Houston Oilers moving to Nashville, and expansion
teams going to Jacksonville, Fla., and Charlotte, N.C., while
cities like Houston and LA lay fallow.
</P>
<P>
   These shifts were not pleasing to television executives who have
paid billions to NFL owners for broadcast rights only to see the
league leave the nation's second and fourth largest cities and were
facing the possibility that the sixth largest TV market, Boston,
would be traded for Hartford because of stadium funding problems.
This new reality led the owners to approve Resolution G-2 and
stepped up Tagliabue's efforts to negotiate acceptable stadium
deals in cities such as Boston, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no formal talks between television executives
and the league on this but obviously you don't trade down from
Boston to Hartford unless you absolutely have to,'' a highly placed
NFL source said. ``This is a trend that has not been good for the
league or our television partners. We all recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Browne, the NFL's senior vice president of communications
and government affairs, admitted Wednesday that Tagliabue had
become ``more proactive. We have tried to keep franchise stability
in the past. We went to court in 1980-81 to try and stop the
Raiders from leaving Oakland, for example, but we are certainly
trying to learn from our experiences, some of which have not always
been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important we're in the major markets and it's important
we stay in our current markets. Franchise movement is not good and
our club owners sense that, especially if the moves are from larger
communities to smaller ones. The owners are reluctant to approve
such moves unless there is no alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue met with local politicians and Boston business leaders
several times over the past year to try to help resuscitate what
appeared to be a dead proposal to help Kraft fund a new stadium in
Massachusetts. But it was not until after Kraft signed his
record-setting stadium deal in Connecticut earlier this year that
those talks began to gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Had that happened sooner there would be no Hartford deal and
until the Massachusetts legislature passes its proposal, Kraft will
not agree to reject Hartford's offer. And even if the state's new
plan is approved as outlined, Kraft will be in a bind because sound
business principals would never allow someone to reject
Connecticut's deal for the Massachusetts offer on its merits alone.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean Kraft could not opt for his hometown over his
wallet, but to do so would involve serious financial sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people have to realize is Mr. Kraft has a major decision
to make,'' Browne said. ``The Massachusetts proposal does not come
close to matching what Hartford has offered. If he decides to stay,
he's doing it at a great financial loss to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important issue to the Kraft family is that the team
stay competitive. The best opportunity for that is to go to
Hartford. Does he go where his team will be better funded or stay
where his family was born and raised but where he's been taken for
granted by the city fathers until very recently?
</P>
<P>
   ``While we applaud the city leaders for the steps they've taken
recently, the Krafts are being asked to do what no other team has
ever done in sports _ to pay for infrastructure in addition to
their stadium. That is a question other owners will surely ask. Why
is he paying for infrastructure? It's an issue we'll have to
consider and address with the other owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kraft has a major decision to make between now and May 2,
when he has to tell the state of Connecticut that he'll play there
in 2002 or reject their offer. He is both a businessman and a
sportsman. The businessman viewing the difference between
Hartford's proposal and Massachusetts's would go to Hartford. I
know there have been owners in our sport and in other sports who
have advised him that that is what he should do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither the league nor CBS, which owns broadcast rights
for the American Football Conference and therefore most Patriots
games, would be happy to see the Boston TV market replaced by
Hartford's, owners may not be terribly pleased if Kraft agrees to
become the first professional franchise owner in history to bear
the cost of stadium infrastructure that has traditionally been born
exclusively by cities and states.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, that issue may pale in comparison with the
downsizing of a league that today calls itself ``National'' yet has
no face in Los Angeles and Houston and, unless Kraft agrees to pay
to stay here, could lose one in Boston as well.

 UNDATED: ... self-esteem.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All kids recognize that seeing people like themselves is
important,'' said Lois Salisbury, president of the child advocacy
group Children Now, based in Oakland, Calif. The group surveyed
1,200 children ages 10 to 17 about media and race last year. ``It
gave them a sense of being included and provided role models.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are Hayeks and Nely Galans (Telemundo's
entertainment president) out there, Martinez says many of the girls
she knows want to become hairdressers. That, she adds, is what
people in their neighorhood do.
</P>
<P>
   Smart and sassy Martinez has a different path in mind. She's
contemplating a career as a journalist/photographer or an FBI
agent. The latter goal is influenced by her love of ``The X-Files''
star David Duchovny (whose picture Martinez carries in a locket
around her neck) and her idol, Puerto Rican actress Jennifer Lopez,
who played an agent in the film ``Out of Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to become the stereotype of what Hispanic girls
are,'' said Gonzalez's 15-year-old daughter, Annabelle Guerra.
``There are positive (role models) out there and we have to look
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra's search usually ends on television that's in Spanish.
Her role models are Univision talk show superstar Cristina
Saralegui and two female anchors on Univision's news show ``Primer
Impacto.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like most young Latinos, Guerra prefers gluing her eyes to
MTV if she's not watching the WB shows or ``Boy Meets World.'' Why?
``There aren't that many great shows'' in Spanish, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Telemundo and Univision, with their daily supply of soap operas,
talk shows, and game shows, have the unofficial reputation of being
for immigrants and the elderly. There's a local television station
that broadcasts in Spanish called Cuencavision, but Guerra said,
``It's extremely boring and half the time it's not even on.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra's love of American TV doesn't stop her from taking action
if she sees a Hispanic stereotype. She'll switch channels. It's a
response she shares with almost 60 percent of the Hispanics polled
in the Tomas Rivera reports.
</P>
<P>
   With TV viewership plummeting, talk of turning off the tube is
enough to make any advertiser or TV programmer jittery. Hispanics
spend $3.5 billion in goods and services annually in this country,
according to LULAC. If Latinos watch a lot of TV now, imagine what
might happen to sales and viewership if executives fed the audience
more palatable fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any broadcaster or network cable programmer who gets ahead of
this curve is going to capture meaningful market share,'' said
Salisbury.
</P>
<P>
   So by next fall, Hispanics may see Puerto Rican Rosie Perez play
a New York City actress in a sitcom or catch a fast-cutting,
MTV-style documentary on saints produced by Salma Hayek.
</P>
<P>
   They may switch to CBS to catch the proposed one-hour drama,
``Sherman Oaks,'' which features Latino actor Esai Morales in an
ensemble cast. Or they'll watch Diego Serrano star alongside teen
queen Jennifer Love Hewitt in Fox's proposed ``Party of Five''
spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's SiTV, the proposed 24-hour cable channel. Its
creators, who run a two-year-old production company catering to the
Latino market, plan to offer culturally sensitive sitcoms for 18-
to 49-year-old Latinos and educational programs for preteens. The
twist is that all of the shows will be in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, `You're nuts; you can't put English-language
programming on a Spanish network,' '' said Jeff Valdez, cochairman
of SiTV in Los Angeles, who conducted his interview the LA way: by
speaker phone from his car. ``I said, `You're wrong; Latinos speak
English.' It's like the dirty little secret we keep trying to
hide.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, SiTV's future is about as certain as finding a
Latino doctor on a sitcom. To make it on the air by 2000, SiTV must
raise money for the project, battle other wannabes for a
cable-provider berth and develop enough shows to fill a 24-hour
block.
</P>
<P>
   But Valdez is confident. SiTV has a talk show and stand up
comedy show in syndication. Nickelodeon and Disney recently picked
up SiTV sitcom pilots about two boys growing up in San Antonio and
a former soccer star adjusting to life off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our initial meetings with the money people have been
phenomenally positive,'' said Valdez, who counts Smits, Daisy
Fuentes, and Hector Elizondo as SiTV advisory board members.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts,
a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group Smits founded in 1997, is
trying to change things from within. The group mentors and gives
scholarships to Latino film students at New York University, Yale
University, Columbia University, University of Southern California
and University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The aid may help create the next Eric Tannenbaum (Columbia
TriStar TV's president) or Doug Herzog (20th Century-Fox
Television's president). And that level of success is sorely
needed. Today, according to LULAC, Hispanics hold less than
</P>
<P>
   1 percent of Hollywood's creative and business positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply haven't been able to penetrate the decision-making
slots in the business side of this industry,'' said Feliz Sanchez,
the foundation's president. ``Those are the real determiners of
what we are going to see next season.''

HELPING KIDS TO LEARN TO FIT IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as we put distance between us and the murderous rampage in
Littleton, Colo., no parent is free of anguish. If our child is
somehow different and therefore not part of the dominant school
culture, we worry, ``Is he on a trajectory that could prompt him to
violence?'' If he's a mainstream kid who is well accepted by peers,
we pray he is tolerant of differences and not causing pain to other
children.
</P>
<P>
   Our response to either child seems more important today than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Child and adolescent psychiatrist David Fassler of Burlington,
Vt., is quick to reassure us that the overwhelming majority of
children who feel targeted by peers do not evolve into teenagers
who commit violence, and those in the ``in'' crowd are not
automatically cruel. But marginalized children may be unhappy and
suffering, and popular children may be too easily swayed by peer
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful antidote in either case, say Fassler and
others, is a strong connection to parents who are able to
articulate values clearly and to support their children at all
times.
</P>
<P>
   From kindergarten on up, children go through developmental
stages when they are more preoccupied with peer friendships and
less able to let slights roll off their backs than at other, less
vulnerable times. Temperament has a lot to do with it, but even at
young ages, whether they come home crying (``Suzie wasn't nice to
me''), bragging (``Josh is weird and I told him so''), or having
been simply an observer (``Josh threw sand at Suzie''), how we
listen sets them up to consider or not consider their own feelings
as well as those of others.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't want to do is minimize or ignore their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any age, a child needs to be validated and supported. To
tell him, `It will go away' or `It's not a big deal,' leaves him
confused about his own perception and discourages him from coming
to you in the future,'' says Fassler. He is author of `` `Help Me,
I'm Sad': Recognizing, Treating and Preventing Childhood and
Adolescent Depression'' (Viking).
</P>
<P>
   Being supportive can be tricky. For instance, when:
</P>
<P>
   -- Perception doesn't match reality. A sixth grader reports that
no one likes him, but when you talk to the teacher, she says he's
in the social thick of things, and you can see for yourself that he
gets calls and invitations from friends. Though it may be tempting
to dismiss his statements, don't, says psychologist and
psychoanalyst Steven Marans of Yale University Child Study Center.
``There's a reason he's telling you things are lousy when things
are in fact going well,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that he feels you're neglecting him, and he sees
this as a way to get your attention. It could also be that he feels
awful about himself but can't articulate why. If you let it go, the
problem festers.
</P>
<P>
   -- The whining wears you down. A third grader who constantly
complains about being picked on can begin to seem like a loser,
even in the eyes of a loving parent. ``Kids who are victimized can
become less appealing to us, and we let them down without realizing
it,'' says Rebecca Coffey, author of ``Unspeakable Truths and Happy
Endings: Human Cruelty and the New Trauma Therapy'' (Sidran).
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's inadvertent, our diminished attention feels
like desertion and can lead to greater helplessness, hopelessness,
and isolation. Coffey tells parents always to validate feelings _
``Wow, that must have felt awful!'' _ and to follow up by asking,
``How would you like me to help you?''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of support and a willingness not to give up may
be the two most important things we can do, says psychologist Joy
Osofsky of Louisiana State University. She studies and works with
children exposed to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not be able to prevent your child from being unhappy,
but when you hang in there with her, even if she's cranky and moody
and pushing you away, even if she's stone silent, that feels to her
that at least someone cares enough to try to understand,'' says
Osofsky. ``That's the bottom line all kids need. That alone can be
an antidote.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at about 11, it can be hard to tell when cranky,
moody, pushing-you-away behavior is developmental and therefore
normal, and when it's not. Consider it a red flag when:
</P>
<P>
   -- He isolates himself not just in his room (or garage or
basement) but drops or doesn't show up for extracurricular
activities, shuns friends, or ignores long-standing areas of
interest;
</P>
<P>
   -- She hooks up with friends who don't pay attention to
academics or who glorify weapons or fascism or any other value that
is anathema to you. ``If a kid has gone through early school years
without a friendship group, that he has found kindred spirits in a
new school is a huge relief to parents,'' says Marans. ``Stay alert
for what it is that binds them,'' he warns. ``If it isn't healthy,
talk to him, get school input or professional advice.''
</P>
<P>
   -- He persists in his complaints over a period of months. When
it's transitory and developmental, a child tends to be able to move
on, says Marans. If it has a systemic impact _ not sleeping, not
concentrating _ and he's irritable and critical, it may be
something more.
</P>
<P>
   As important as all this is, there's still a piece missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Differences need to be celebrated and independent thinking
valued,'' says psychologist Susan Linn of the Judge Baker Center in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   This needs to start in the preschool years, when children notice
differences without necessarily passing judgment. ``Validate
them,'' says Linn: `` `Josh doesn't like to play soccer, does he?
But he sure is a great artist!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the elementary years, when judgment is proffered
frequently and harshly, your values need to come through loud and
clear. If you overhear your 12-year-old daughter and friends
disparaging a peer, there's a range of comments to make:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I don't think she's geeky; I think she's creative.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I was just like her when I was that age.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``It disappoints me when I hear you talk like that.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``You're proud of the necklaces you make. How would you feel
if someone didn't like you because of that?''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I admire someone who has different interests.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``It's true, she has an annoying hair-twirling habit, but
remember what an incredible skater she is?''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``You have a right to choose your friends, but you don't have
a right to be mean or disrespectful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if your daughter walks away, even if she's disdainful, at
least, says Linn, ``She will have heard you articulate your values.
That counts at any age.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the articulation of these values creates an
atmosphere in your home that helps children learn how to make good
decisions, including being able to say no to peer pressure.
Hopefully, there's reinforcement from school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools need to have mechanisms for supporting children with
minority interests and for articulating and reinforcing
respectfulness,'' Linn says.
</P>
<P>
   Osofsky urges parents to see the school as a partner and to
expect and demand appropriate intervention and social curricula.
``When the school allows humiliation to go unchecked, it's no
longer a safe place'' for a victim or a perpetrator, she says. In
middle school and high school, that can increase a sense of
isolation, of ``me versus them'' mentality, that leads to rage and
revenge including, perhaps, violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, says Osofsky, the child who finds a niche in school
and has a family that cares enough to pay attention and love her
will feel some intrinsic sense of connection and self-worth that
enables her to get though unhappy times.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Whiman of Temple Shalom in West Newton put it
another way in his sermon last Friday night. In trying to explain
how two young men could show such disregard for human life, he
turned to the cornerstone of Judeo-Christian morality, the Golden
Rule: Love thy neighbor as thyself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dangerous thing to base a rationale for ethical
conduct solely on a person's perception of his or her own value and
self-worth,'' he said. ``What if you do not love yourself very
much? What if you do not love yourself at all?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- The more isolated a child is, even if it's self-imposed, the
worse he'll feel about himself. Entice him out of his room with an
activity to do together; working or playing side by side is a good
way to begin a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   -- Help a young child who is teased to develop a repertoire of
responses, from walking away to standing up for himself: ``I don't
like it when you call me names.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The child who is neither the leader of the pack nor the
victim of it needs tools to intervene safely; to stand by and watch
behavior that he knows is wrong can make him feel as impotent and
enraged as the victim. Talk about the value of a kind word and when
and how to involve a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   -- Children of all ages need a healthy outlet for fun and glory.
</P>
<P>
   -- A child who is unhappy with himself and feaful of being left
out, even if he's not left out at the moment, may be most likely to
target differences in another child as a way to displace his own
fears.
</P>
<P>
   -- At the first sign your child is having trouble, check in with
the teacher: ``How can we help him?''
</P>
<P>
   -- If your child is persistently victimized or victimizing
someone else, get a professional evaluation.

DRAGON RECOGNIZES DIFFICULTY WITH OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a market that swoons over the latest hot technology stock,
this deal seemed like can't-miss material.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon Systems Inc. and its proposed initial public stock
offering had it all: a well-known name in a sexy software category,
pioneering founders, a reputation for cutting-edge innovation, and
a real financial track record.
</P>
<P>
   But the IPO that might have raised as much as $100 million for
Dragon and its voice-recognition software, already delayed over the
winter, was pulled indefinitely last week.
</P>
<P>
   It was a surprising setback for a company that had nearly
tripled sales and posted a solid profit in 1998. Voice-recognition
products, the software that allows you to talk to your personal
computer instead of typing material or commands, blossomed in the
last two years, and so had Dragon. More powerful computers and
software that could recognize continuous speech instead of a
staccato, word-by-word recitation began to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon Systems said in a statement that it had postponed the IPO
to instead pursue talks with ``several potential strategic
investors.'' Executives at the Newton, Mass. company could not be
reached for comment this week.
</P>
<P>
   Other people familiar with the offering said it was initially
delayed because Dragon's fourth-quarter financial performance fell
below expectations, and was later shelved when first-quarter
results did not generate growth that had been hoped for. Though the
IPO probably would have gotten off the ground, they said, the
pricing of Dragon shares could have been affected.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed by Dragon in March showed that sales in the
fourth quarter, usually a strong growth period, had increased to
only $21.8 million from $20.7 million in the previous quarter.
Fourth-quarter income from continuing operations improved slightly
to $1.6 million from $1.5 million three months earlier. Dragon did
not report first-quarter results in its public documents.
</P>
<P>
   But the anemic growth of Dragon business in the final months of
1998 may say more about the short-term ups and downs of an
individual software category than the company's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's market share of the retail voice-recognition market, in
both dollars and units, slipped just slightly throughout the last
nine months, according to software sales tracker PC Data Inc. of
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's share of retail units sold ranged from 35.6 percent in
the third quarter of 1998 to a low of 33.7 percent in the first
quarter of this year. Its closest competitor, IBM Corp., claimed
30.6 percent of the retail market in the first quarter of 1999,
according to PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most small software companies trying to go public, Dragon
Systems has been around for years and has been run by seasoned
computer scientists in their 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon was created in 1982 by biophysicist Janet Baker and her
husband, mathematician James Baker, and operated on a lean diet of
US Defense Department contracts and other small bits of business.
James Baker, who underwent back surgery last fall, resigned as an
employee of the company in December, but remains its chief science
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon operated in the black for years selling early computer
dictation products, staying small and relatively conservative. But
the Bakers changed tactics and decided to gamble in the early
1990s, diverting money and energy in an attempt to develop
continuous-speech software.
</P>
<P>
   They raised money by selling 35 percent of Dragon to Seagate
Technology for $26.5 million (the Bakers still own 52 percent of
Dragon). By 1997, they introduced Naturally Speaking to wide
critical acclaim and quickly growing sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the PCs got to the point where they were powerful enough
to do reasonable continuous speech recognition, Dragon was first to
come out with a product and that really changed the market,'' said
Bill Meisel of MTA Associates in Tarzana, Calif., publisher of
Speech Recognition Update.
</P>
<P>
   But they were hardly the last. Competition from IBM and Lernout
&AMP; Hauspie Speech Products quickly followed and remains today.
</P>
<P>
   They all see a growing market for software that will help
computer hardware recognize continuous speech of users. Small
hand-held computers, for example, would be easier to use with voice
commands, and spoken interaction over the Internet would be
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Large corporate customers also see opportunities. Fidelity
Investments has already launched a voice-recognition system to
provide mutual fund information and stock quotes over the phone.
Later this summer, Fidelity expects its customers will be able to
make account inquiries and execute financial transactions by
speaking to a computer over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon software consistently wins high marks for performance,
but it must rely on retail sales more than any of its big
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   IBM can bundle its product with hardware or turn it into an
added feature of its expensive Lotus software. Lernout &AMP; Hauspie
gets most of its revenue from other sources such as customized
corporate products and language-translation software.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Microsoft Corp., which has its own huge
in-house team working on voice recognition and owns a stake in
Lernout &AMP; Hauspie.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft adds voice recognition as a feature to its
omnipresent Windows operating system, as the company has suggested
it will, competitors like Dragon that sell the same thing as add-on
software face an uphill battle.

CLEARED BY THE COURT, VALHOL IS READY FOR THE DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The thoroughbred racing industry strives to
protect its image, but the Valhol incident gave the sport a black
eye on the eve of its greatest day.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough there are suspicions jockey Bill Patin used an
electrical device on Valhol in the $500,000 Arkansas Derby at
Oaklawn April 10, but to have it happen in a prep for Saturday's
Kentucky Derby makes it even worse for the sport. The matter was
not adjudicated until Tuesday when a Little Rock district court
ruled Oaklawn must release the $300,000 purse Valhol won, thus
permitting him entry into the Derby, which is limited to 20
starters based on earnings in graded races.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Derby is racing's showcase, but the Valhol
situation has been ugly. While Patin left Louisville Saturday and
remains in seclusion in his homestate of Louisiana, trainer Dallas
Keen, who is participating in his first Derby, has fielded
questions and been as diplomatic as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This took a lot of fun out of the Derby, but we'll make up for
it between now and Saturday'' said Keen, 41, Wednesday. ``Valhol
doesn't know anything about all the controversy and he's been
training very professionally. From the first day he stepped on this
track, he's been calm and relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Valhol, a gelding, won the Arkansas Derby at 30-1 as a maiden in
only the third start of his career. Owned by Texas oil mogul James
Jackson, who purchased the horse privately as a 2-year-old for
$30,000, Valhol ran second in a maiden race at Fair Grounds, then
finished fourth at 107-1 in the Louisiana Derby before going to
Oaklawn.
</P>
<P>
   After the Arkansas Derby, an Oaklawn employee found a battery on
the track, and a tape of the race showed an object falling from the
shoulder area of Valhol as Patin was pulling him up following a
four and one-half legnth tally.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling of the court was the purse could not be withheld
unless any illegal drugs were found. Granted permission to race,
Jackson and Keen named local jockey Willie Martinez as Volhol's
Derby rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a jockey is riding for you, you want him to think
positively,'' said Keen. ``Because of all the allegations against
Billy, we didn't think he could be at his best. I think Billy
understands. He hasn't ridden since the Arkansas Derby. I think it
was in the best interests of the horse to make a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but feel for Billy. He was the one who got us
high on this horse. Billy worked him and came back and said: `He's
the best horse I've ever been on.' Billy rode this horse with
confidence, even though he was a maiden. He was instrumental on
Valhol's road to glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the controversy broke, Billy told me: `There's no way I
carried anything on the horse.' I know this horse. If a buzzer had
been used, I don't think he'd have had the good disposition he did
after the race. I don't think a buzzer is going to make a horse run
faster then he can run, anyway. If anything, it messes him up,
makes him mentally unsound. A big part of training is keeping your
horse fit mentally, as well as physically.''
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of working under a cloud, the court's ruling
provided Keen with his first ray of relief. ``I feel real good
about it,'' he said. ``It was a big load off my mind. It's been a
pretty tough couple of weeks not knowing if the horse was going to
run, and he deserves the chance to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Keen's only bitterness was directed at Oaklawn Park officials.
``I didn't like the way it looked, it was not good for racing,'' he
said. ``I'm very disappointed in the way Oaklawn handled it. We
didn't know anything for 10 days. Everything we knew came out by
being leaked to the press. I think they were trying to make it look
worse than it really was.''

NOT A STYLISH TIE, BUT IT'S A MATCH NONETHELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- No one said it had to be pretty to be good. The Bruins
and Hurricanes have been at each other's tails and throats now for
four games, and it has not been what anyone _ purist, casual
observer, or mayhem lover _ would characterize as an artistic
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a 2-2 series now, and a pretty good one at that. What
it lacks in flow and playmaking _ dare we say lacks as a tour de
force? _ it more than makes up for in suspense, in elbows and face
mashing, in honest effort and some genuine, festering dislike
between two sides.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the delivery is quirky, awkward. The punch line
works. One only had to hear the noise generated at the sold out
Vault to verify that. The joint had some of that enchanting Garden
hum in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you love to see that wide-open stuff,'' said Bruins
coach Pat Burns, when asked if the series might open up in the next
game or two. ``I don't think you're going to see that here. You
might have to go to another town.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina coach Paul Maurice had about the same view on the
subject, and it was centered on the back of the two clubs' benches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it open up?'' he said. ``Not if the coaches have anything
to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's all about control, the tight-fisted will
that both Burns and Maurice twist like a roped towel around the
collars of their charges.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Canes moved to a 1-0 lead at 4:21 of the first period
Wednesday with Ray Sheppard breaking over the blue line with a long
Martin Gelinas lead pass and nailing in a top-of-the-circle
slapper. In that one flash, there was more available open ice than
in the three other games combined.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this was going to be the night the two sides stopped
trying to slip inside one another's sweaters?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the tractor pull would give way to a night of NASCAR?
</P>
<P>
   Forget that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing to remember: We're at Game 4 now, not Game 1,''
said Maurice. ``By that I mean guys are starting to pick their
favorites. You're seeing more after-the-whistle stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that after-the-whistle stuff, the aggravated pushing and
hacking when play is blown dead, that could come to benefit the
Bruins. Maurice knows that. He'll remind his team not to get
carried away with the Three Stooges two-fingered eye-poking the
rest of the way. When the refs whistle off one player from each
side _ as happened four times Wednesday _ the result, of course, is
a couple of minutes of four-on-four play.
</P>
<P>
   In a series that has less room than a European outdoor market
(picture fruits and veggies flying, live chickens pecking and
cackling), a couple of minutes of four-on-four is an afternoon
siesta, especially for the club that has the higher skill level
among its forwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, we think, have the higher skill level up front. We
can't say for sure, because skill hasn't had much room to work the
stage in this series. This has been a muscle, stamina, steel-nose,
buckle-your-chin-strap series. The best chance of it to transform
from a dandelion into a rose would be for more four-on-four hockey
and for one side to do something with that open ice. The bet here:
We won't see more than a couple of minutes of that the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   It just ain't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, and it's not going to be,'' said Sheppard, who has popped
in four goals thus far, which, in regular-season play, when there
is more room, would translate to something like a 351-goal season
(more or less, depending on the number of five-minute OTs). ``It's
going to be a tight-checking series. Guys are not going to be able
to freewheel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins finally began to buy themselves some space when
Landon Wilson jumped up and nailed a charging Keith Primeau with a
heavy check late in the first period. Primeau went down like one of
those buildings you see get imploded on the network news _ a pile
of bricks, a cloud of dust, passersby applauding _ and three goals
followed in the third period. There had been plenty of hitting
before that, in all four games, but this one provided a turning
point. At least in one game.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice felt the Hurricanes were off their game before that. He
thought the Bruins had the edge all evening. What can we say?
Coaches have their unique views. The 'Canes held a 1-0 lead for 33
minutes 57 seconds, until Don Sweeney knocked in the equalizer with
1:42 left in the second. If the Bruins outplayed his team as
thoroughly as Maurice said, they did good job of camouflaging it
for more than half the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only exciting part of the game'' said Maurice, ``is that
we weren't good and it was 1-1 going into the third.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to Greensboro they go. Skate and shoot have given way to
blocking and tackling. No one is picking corners or feathering
passes, but they are muscling down the slot and chopping the puck
into pate.
</P>
<P>
   And when someone gets to within 5 or 6 feet of the net, the
suspense ignites, the crowd noise swells, and every move, as
refined as it might not be, means something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams have assessed their talent and their speed,'' said
Maurice. ``It's not going to change much.''
</P>
<P>
   And the best part is, it doesn't have to change.

A LOOK AT THE 100 MAJOR MOMENTS IN AUTO HISTORY

<P>
   A car is far more than the sum of its mechanical parts. At the
base of any automobile purchase are utility and faith in its
reliability _ the basis of the lemon law. But that is boring. What
energizes our auto culture, a defined culture as much as are
sports, television, movies, dining or politics, are things far less
tangible.
</P>
<P>
   How does that new car sitting in the driveway make you feel? Did
you purchase daring? Recapture youth? Make a statement? Show the
neighbors how practical you are? Did you buy it for color? Speed?
Size? Manufacturer's aura? Did you first see it in an ad? A movie?
Someone else's driveway?
</P>
<P>
   These emotional responses comprise the culture of the
automobile. And they are what make it so much fun _ and treacherous
_ to attempt to list 100 great moments in the past century of the
auto. Making such a list is like poking a stick into a hornets'
nest, the hornets' nest in this case being the world of auto
aficionados. What about the development of the ball-joint? some
will ask. Or electronic fuel injection? The radial tire? The
buzzing begins. I pick up the stick and poke that nest: Here,
decade by decade but in no order of importance, are my top 100:

PEERFECTLY LOVABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We view the present through the filter of the past. By
remembering other people's judgments of us, we give them power in
our present lives. That's why last week Barry Kaufman asked me and
all the other participants in a weeklong ``Optimal Self-Trust''
workshop at the Option Institute in Sheffield to write down the
four worst things anyone had ever said to us.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, something my father once said to me popped into my
head. At 13, I'd begun to doubt my mother's assurance that my
father expressed his love by supporting us financially. I wanted
his version. One evening, when we were alone at home, I asked my
dad if he loved me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you done to deserve it?'' he replied, sending me
into a spiral of adolescent misery and self-doubt that lasted for
years. That phrase haunted me and has made its way into this column
several times. In fact, my dad once reproached me. ``How come
you've told that story three times?'' he protested. ``I only said
it once.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't tell him how many times his question, unanswered, had
echoed in my head. Over the years I analyzed it to death, exorcised
it from my repertoire of self-reproaches, and forgave my dad for
his inability to express affection. When I wrote his words down in
my notebook last week, I was sure the pain associated with those
words was gone.
</P>
<P>
   I'd come to the Option Institute for my yearly emotional
tune-up. According to Option, we're never finished, we just keep
moving further along, and I felt ready for the next step in being
more demonstrative. By now I know how to do things to show I care.
I've even taught myself to give praise and feel gratitude, skills I
never encountered at home. Still, I know I withhold some portion of
my feelings from everyone I love.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how delighted I am to see someone, I never light up
when he or she comes into the room. No matter how sad I am to leave
someone, I exit without a backward glance or a hug. I take a
certain guilty pleasure from feeling that I'm in the catbird seat,
that others are looking for approval from me while I'm not looking
for anything from anyone. At the same time, this coolness often
leaves me feeling disconnected and lonely. There's an uncomfortable
constriction that always goes with holding back; there's the
knowledge that letting go can truly be an ecstatic state. I wanted
to understand why something within me rebels against loving with an
overflowing heart.
</P>
<P>
   That was the agenda I'd come to explore at Option. Throughout
class discussions, exercises, and group sharing, I tried to
understand what was keeping me from letting down my guard. I didn't
doubt my feelings. I wasn't afraid. It was just . . . and then the
answer came to me.
</P>
<P>
   No one had done quite enough to deserve it. And, as I remembered
the list of my own shortcomings I review every day, neither had I.
</P>
<P>
   I was shocked to find that some small part of me was still loyal
to my dad's way of looking at the world. Were all the people in my
life not quite good enough, or had I set the bar so high that none
of us would ever jump over it? Is there some fixed external
standard, or am I free to make the word ``enough'' mean whatever I
want to to?
</P>
<P>
   In my free time, I settled into a gazebo on the institute's
grounds and began writing letters to my siblings, my daughters, my
sons-in-law, my grandchildren, and my husband. I focused on their
positive qualities. I described the reasons I admire them, the ways
in which they contribute to my happiness, the reasons I love having
them in my life.
</P>
<P>
   Within sight of the gazebo was a goose sitting on her eggs.
Every once in a while, she'd shift her position, then tuck a layer
of loose feathers tight against the nest. I was hatching something,
too, shifting the filters through which I see the world, nurturing
an emerging part of myself _ not the critic, but the fan. I wrote
about things I'd never noticed, or had discounted, or considered of
little importance. I saw how much effort and determination it had
taken to keep my eye on the flaws in such remarkable people. My dad
would have been proud of me.
</P>
<P>
   We all keep scorecards. We learn exactly how to fill them out
from our parents, but we can change the requirements anytime we
want.
</P>
<P>
   So the people I love aren't perfect? That's perfect. So I'm not
perfect? That's perfect. Now that I've given everyone perfect marks
for lovability, I can actually throw this old, tear-stained
scorecard away.

 UNDATED: ... East Coast cognoscenti.

<P>
   53. Ralph Nader writes ``Unsafe at Any Speed,'' paying
particular attention to the Corvair, and accuses the auto industry
of ignoring passenger safety. Congress listens.
</P>
<P>
   54. Pony Cars hit the streets and their names are Cougar,
Mustang, Camaro, and Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   55. The government requires shoulder belts, in addition to seat
belts.
</P>
<P>
   56. The Dodge Charger is introduced in 1966. A fastback with a
426-cubic-inch wedgehead V-8, it is the rumblin' suis generis
muscle car. Slap a hemi on it and it would wail.
</P>
<P>
   57. George Maharis and Martin Milner cross America on the
television show ``Route 66.'' If Seinfeld had owned a 'Vette, this
would have been his show about aimless wandering.
</P>
<P>
   58. Chevrolet introduces the Blazer. In the future, it will be
more politically correct than its big stablemate, the Subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   59. Arlo Guthrie narrates in ``Alice's Restaurant'':
</P>
<P>
   So we took a half-ton of garbage and put it in the back of a
red, VW microbus. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And the counterculture, flowered up and riding in the ultimate
counterculture vehicle, went out to meet The Man, in the person of
Officer Obie.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
1970-79:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   60. ``American Graffiti,'' a fine car movie featuring a high
school Class of '62, lights American movie screens. Before Kennedy
is killed, before we know what is happening in Vietnam, a
generation cruises: Richard Dreyfuss, scholar-in-waiting, in his
VW; Paul LeMat in his yellow hot rod going head-to-head with
Harrison Ford in a black and evil machine; Suzanne Somers, blonde,
pale and ethereal in a white and innocent Thunderbird. All to the
intonations of Wolfman Jack. Perfect.
</P>

   61. The 1973 fuel crunch. Lower speed limits, minimum gas
mileage rules come next.
</P>
<P>
   62. Ford builds the Pinto, a rolling, explosive can of gas.
</P>
<P>
   63. The Toyota Land Cruiser, the short box, not today's long
Yuppiemobile, goes off road in America.
</P>
<P>
   64. There is great mystique about the Volvo among the
counterculture. But since most of its members don't have to be
anywhere on time, it's like, you know, OK, if it doesn't run very
often. Meanwhile, those who do want to get somewhere on time
discover that those Slant-6 Darts and Valiants won't ever let them
down.
</P>
<P>
   65. In 1976, ABC televises the closing laps of the Daytona 500.
Richard Petty and David Pearson tangle on the last lap. Pearson's
crumpled car limps to the finish line as Petty's smokes in the
background. America watches. Here comes NASCAR fever.

   66. Bruce Springsteen, in affirmation of the open road and
working-class freedom sings:
</P>
<P>
   Roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair.

   The night's busted open, these two lanes will take us anywhere.

1980-1989: &QL;

reflect on this trend:
</P>
<P>
   I make a lot of money in my hi-tech job.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, sure, you bet, I drive a turbo Saab.

   And:
</P>
<P>
   My BMW draws applause.
</P>
<P>
   I am not bound by traffic laws.

tim-ing belts, but it hints of SUVs tocome.

   74. The convertible, once virtually extinct, makes a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   75. GM forms a new company called Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   76. Goodbye to the inflatable spare tire. Welcome the hard
little rubber doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   78. Mazda debuts the Miata _ sporty, convertible, and cheap. It
brings back the roadster.
</P>
<P>
   79. Ford launches the Taurus-Sable line.
</P>
<P>
   80. Weld-through, zinc-chromate priming is introduced. Boring?
Too technical? It's why cars don't rust like they used to.
</P>
<P>
   81. Freon is out for air conditioning; environmentally friendly
substances replace it.
</P>
<P>
   82. AMC gives us the Pacer _ ugliest car ever built, but what
would you expect from a company that once took over Harley-Davidson
and almost killed it?

   &QL; 
1990-1999: &QL;

   84. VW brings back the Beetle; restored Beetles soar in value.
</P>
<P>
   85. Airbags become standard. Unfortunately, no one did the tests

small adults.

   86. Thunderbird prototype is displayed. Plans to bring it back

   87. Dodge Power Wagon prototype is displayed. Bring it back.
</P>
<P>
   88. The Dodge Charger is reborn. Bring on the Muscle Car.
</P>
<P>
   89. At a shopping mall inNewton, the owner of a Honda Ac-cord
parks beside a ChevroletSuburban whose owner is just stepping down

</P>
<P>
   90. Subaru offers the Outback and the Forester. Politically
correct SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   91. The sports roadster is hot. Honda, Porsche, Jaguar, and BMW

</P>
<P>
   92. Global Positioning Systems in cars mean that men can
continue to never ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
   93. Mergers sweep the industry. Is

<P>
   95. In 1998, sales of vans, pick-up trucks, and SUVs surpass

NEXT GENERATION? 
 MOST CUBAN  PLAYERS OFF-LIMITS TO U.S. BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO Gomez  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reciting the merits of Cuban-born baseball players in the major
leagues is not very difficult. From Minnie Minoso to Luis Tiant to
Tony Oliva to Mike Cuellar to Tony Perez to Jose Canseco to ``El
Duque'' Hernandez, Cuban players have distinguished themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A new group of Cuban players, each of whom is considered taboo
for big-league clubs, will be on display at Baltimore's Camden
Yards on Monday. The Orioles will host a group of select Cuban
players in the second of a two-game goodwill exhibition series
between the two contentious nations.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting directors and general managers from all 30 major league
clubs will take a look at the mostly unknown players from the
island nation that rests a mere 90 miles from U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has long been known as one of the best cradles of baseball,
where the game is treated more like a religion than a sport.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's numerous championships in amateur competition over the
past three decades and the slow trickle of defectors who have
recently made their way to the big leagues and managed to stand out
is evidence enough to most baseball people of Cuba's exceptional
level of playing the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that they have some very
talented players,'' said Texas Rangers General Manager Doug Melvin.
``As an industry, baseball has done a good job of getting players
from places such as the Dominican Republic, Venezuela and other
Latin American countries. Cuba would obviously be another great
place for us to recruit and bring talent over here. It's somewhat
similar to those other countries in that there are a lot of quality
players there.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most of Cuba's current stars remain
relatively unknown to major league scouts and organizations.
Because Cuba remains communist, scouting Cuban players has been
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest reason all 30 clubs eagerly sent the allotted
one person to Cuba last month to watch the Orioles' historic game
in Havana. Most were left overwhelmed after Cuba's hard-throwing
right-hander, Jose Contreras, struck out 10 while pitching eight
scoreless innings in relief that sunny afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The well-built Contreras, 6 feet 3, impressed not only the
Orioles, but most everyone else who was at Estadio Latinoamerica as
well as big-league officials watching the game on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question they have a talented group of players,''
Florida Marlins General Manager Dave Dombrowski said.
``Particularly in pitching, which was apparent from what everybody
has seen and talked about. As for Contreras, anyone that can pitch
and has a power arm and shut down a club like the Orioles has to be
considered a top-level prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   The list, however, does not end with Contreras, who was 9-3 with
a 2.22 ERA in 109 innings in the recently concluded Cuban season.
Third baseman Omar Linares, Contreras' teammate on Pinar del Rio,
is probably the most talked-about Cuban player.
</P>
<P>
   It is now known that New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
offered a then-22-year-old Linares $1 million to defect and sign
with his club in 1989. Linares, a staunch member of the Communist
Party and one of Cuban President Fidel Castro's prized athletes,
never considered the offer.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that pitching is what most clubs seek, and Cuba has
them in pitchers such as Contreras, Pedro Luis Lazo (15-4, 2.34),
Jose Ibar (18-2, 2.28), Antonio Sanit (18 saves, 2.78) and Ciro
Silvino, whose 1.85 ERA was the best in the country last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban delegation has refused to announce the 25-man roster
that will be present in Baltimore, preferring to list a pool of 48
possible players. Shortstop German Mesa was among the players who
could make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, who is in his late 20s, was the player who kept current
New York Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez on the bench for several
seasons when the two were teammates for Havana's team. But Mesa
also got into trouble with the government when his name appeared
among those rumored to be thinking of defecting to the United
States to seek riches in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, whose skills were once ranked ahead of Ordonez's, recently
concluded a two-year ban from Cuba's official league and the
chances of his being part of the club in Baltimore seem very small.
</P>
<P>
   Havana closer Antonio Sanit, who comes from the side much as
Dennis Eckersley did and led all of Cuba with 18 saves, did not
make the list of 48, possibly out of fear he might defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'a apparent they are a talented group of players, and
several could play in the big leagues if they come,'' Dombrowski
said. ``You can see that by the ones who have come here and
excelled. But I don't think we know the depth of their talent
because don't see all their players.'' &QL;

WORLD'S ECONOMY SHOWS SOME VITAL SIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Dow Jones industrial average climbing to
new highs, US stocks have been a sure money-maker for millions of
investors. But at the same time, another class of stocks has made
the soaring Dow look like a laggard.
</P>
<P>
   Where are they? Try South Korea, Thailand and Brazil _ the very
nations that watched investors flee in terror during the last 22
months, setting off a downturn that swept through Asia, Brazil and
Eastern Europe and threatened industrialized nations as well.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, once considered a tumbling domino that might cripple all
of Latin America, has watched stock values double since September.
So has South Korea. In recession-plagued Japan, stock values are up
30 percent this year. Thailand and Indonesia have seen improvement
as well.
</P>
<P>
   This and several other encouraging trends have prompted analysts
to say that the global financial crisis is ending, and along with
it the fear of a prolonged global recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it is just that spring is in the air,'' said Stanley
Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund, in
a speech last week, but Asia ``seems to be recovering or about to
do so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The global financial crisis is now officially over,'' George
Soros, the international financier, declared last week after
investors gobbled up $2 billion in new bonds issued by Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, say some other analysts. The most encouraging
developments are coming so far in the financial markets, and they
are due largely to the decisions of global investors chasing high
returns. None of it suggests that real improvements have been made
in the underlying economies of these nations -- in the factories,
the banks and retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   A booming stock market is not always a reliable sign that a
nation's economy is on the mend. Since 1990, Japanese stocks have
rallied five times but the economy has never followed suit, noted
Richard Katz, author of ``Japan, the System that Soured.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, business conditions seem only modestly improved in
Asia, say Boston-area companies that sell goods and services in the
region. Many expect recession to remain for another year.
</P>
<P>
   After the Asian crisis hit in July 1997, several customers told
Raytheon Co. that they could not obtain the financing that would
have enabled the Lexington, Mass. company to build oil refineries
or other types of processing plants for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are seeing people starting to talk about doing study
work and talking about reinvesting in these projects,'' said
Vincent Barry, a senior vice president at the Raytheon Engineers &AMP;
Constructors unit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's just talk. ``It's nothing dramatic by any means, but
we think the down part has come to an end,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just in one of the largest malls in Korea, and the place
was buzzing,'' reported Bruce Nevins, Asia chief for Reebok-brand
sneakers, part of Reebok International Ltd. of Stoughton, Mass.
``There were bags in peoples' hands, rather than just being out
taking a look at the stores.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he predicted, the region would probably not
recover until the end of next year or even 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Thomas of Westborough, Mass. computer-maker Data General
Corp. said that business is up ``a little'' in Korea, Japan and
China. ``The problems probably bottomed out a year ago, but
business is still not what you'd call robust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette Co. of Boston offered a bullish assessment, saying
Asian sales were up 11 percent in the first quarter of 1999,
compared to the same period last year. It predicted that sales in
Eastern Europe and Latin America would soon follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also caution that the rising stock markets in Asia
and Brazil could blunt the drive for reforms that are needed to
prevent the next downturn.
</P>
<P>
   In their view, the Asian crisis was proof of the failure of
``crony capitalism,'' in which governments directed bank loans to
powerful conglomerates, which used the money to support inefficient
businesses or to overbuild ship and auto factories that are now
only half-used. Billions of dollars in debts still lie on the books
of Asian banks and corporations, and it is unclear whether
governments will follow through on promises to enforce new banking,
bankruptcy and financial disclosures laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Korea, the giant Daewoo chaebol, or conglomerate, has said it
will sell its shipbuilding operations, one step toward cutting its
manufacturing overcapacity and returning to health. But critics say
Daewoo must do more, as must the other chaebols.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the government has pumped $60 billion into debt-ridden
banks, which has allowed the banks and some of their client
companies to improve their books. But it has not prompted the banks
to lend new money to customers, which would spur the economy, said
Katz.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government has merely moved corporate debts onto
its own books, rather than forcing companies to go bankrupt and
banks to write off their bad loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has cut interest rates to close to zero, but
Japanese consumers still refuse to spend money. That leaves
government spending as the only fuel for the economy. Rather than
leading the rest of Asia out of recession, the Japanese economy
will shrink 1.4 percent this year after contracting 2.8 percent in
1998, the International Monetary Fund predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that Thailand has also failed to close
debt-ridden businesses, and the recent stock revival might blunt
any will to take tough political actions. They see a similar story
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected a big jump in inflation and damage to the
Brazilian economy this year when the country devalued its currency.
That never materialized. Instead, said Nariman Behravesh, senior
international economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington,
Mass., low worldwide inflation and a record Brazilian crop harvest
kept prices down, allowing the central bank to lower interest
rates. As the economy improved, Brazil's currency appreciated and
investors began putting money back in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Behravesh said, policymakers may become ``too
complacent'' to enact cutbacks in the country's ``very, very
generous'' pension system. They may not have the will to cut
government bureaucracy that is sapping tax revenues, or to improve
the tax collection system _ reforms the country needs to improve
its financial health, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia remains a constant worry. The country is in danger of
defaulting anew on foreign debt, and while the International
Monetary Fund has signaled it will provide additional relief loans
to country, many observers fear that Russian lawmakers will refuse
to enact the reforms that the IMF is demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists who see improvement in the global economy add
other caveats and cautions that plenty could still go wrong. The
fragile nature of Brazil's recovery, for example, was on display
only this week, when a single political event raised fears that
investors would flee once again. The arrest of a former central
banker and news of a probe into foreign-exchange insider trading
raised prospects that the current government would be tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, no one knows how much the slow-growing or
recession-bound nations can rely on the world's economic leaders.
Growth in Europe is exepcted to slow this year, for example. On
Tuesday, several German economic institutes cut their forecasts for
Germany, which accounts for one-third of the economy of the nations
embracing the new Euro currency. They said the German economy would
grow 1.7 percent this year, lower than the 2.3 percent they
predicted last fall.
</P>
<P>
   US economic officials have adopted a sober view of the news from
Asia. With the United States the only nation showing strong growth,
``the risks around the world are still very much tilted toward lack
of growth, spare capacity, and slowdown,'' Larry Summers, the No. 2
US Treasury official, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the doomsday scenarios of a global financial meltdown
seem more remote these days. ``We're back from really walking on
the precipice, where we might have fallen and not been caught,''
said Douglas Paal, president of the nonprofit Asia Pacific Policy
Center and a former National Security Council staffer. But much of
the world ``still has a long climb back to full health.''

 As broad waistlines age, health risks found to fall
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The health hazards of obesity appear to lessen with age, an AMA
Journal study has suggested. That's not to say waistlines can
expand without worry.
</P>
<P>
   People who are obese still face an overall greater risk of death
than thinner folks, the study found, even though that risk declines
as people get older.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, while the most obese 18- to 29-year-olds in the
study were at four times the risk of dying compared with their
thinner counterparts, 50- to 74-year-olds with the same so-called
body mass index were at just under twice the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excess mortality associated with obesity declined
considerably with age for both sexes in all degrees of obesity,''
the researchers wrote for the the Journal of the American Medical
Association, which was published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study followed 6,000 patients who had been referred to a
German obesity clinic for an average of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies have come to varying conclusions about age,
obesity and death. For instance, one report last year, involving
324,000 people, found much higher death rates, across almost all
age groups, for people who are substantially overweight.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AIDS drugs may obviate a need for antibiotics
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the US Public Health Service has recommended that
some patients infected with the AIDS virus take antibiotics as long
as they live, to prevent a rare but potentially fatal pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the advent of drugs known as protease inhibitors,
there may no longer be a need for such a lifelong antibiotic
regimen among some HIV-infected patients, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown that it is safe'' to stop the use of antibiotics
to prevent the pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among certain
patients who respond to the new AIDS drugs,'' a team of Swiss
researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, US health officials welcomed the
study as ``gratifying evidence'' of the new drugs' effectiveness in
boosting some patients' immune systems, but added that more
research is needed to identify which patients might still need
antibiotics to prevent the pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   The study also suggests that other recommendations for lifelong
therapies among HIV-infected patients may no longer be needed,
although more research must be done first, according to the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For Marfan syndrome, surgical prevention
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For patients with a disorder known as Marfan syndrome, a rupture
of the aorta, the major artery leading from the heart, is a
life-threatening possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery to replace the weakened aorta with a synthetic graft was
devised in 1968, but the question of whether to do the procedure
only after the aorta has ruptured, or as an elective, preventive
measure, has not been settled _ until now, according to a new
study.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by researchers from Johns Hopkins and elsewhere, and
published in the New England Journal of Medicine, finds that
patients have a much better survival rate if they undergo the
surgery early, rather than after the blood vessel has burst.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 days of surgery, only 1.5 percent of those who had the
elective procedure died, while about 12 percent of those who
underwent emergency surgery did. The study, the largest on Marfan
patients, followed 675 patients for about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The study ``underscores the need for people to be diagnosed
early with the Marfan syndrome'' so that those with a weakened
aorta can choose to undergo surgery before it ruptures, the
National Marfan Foundation said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects connective
tissue, can often go undiagnosed, since there are few outward
clues. People with Marfan are usually tall and lanky, with long
arms, hands and fingers, but not everyone with those features has
the syndrome. An estimated 200,000 Americans have Marfan and
related connective-tissue disorders.

<P>
   Debating the merits of Cabernet Sauvignon versus another red
wine?
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking to protect against heart disease, a researcher
based in the Bordeaux region of France says that Cabernet is the
red to choose, because it has high levels of resveratrol, which
increases the so-called good cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jean-Paul Broustet argues his point in the British medical
journal Heart.

TRANSGRESSING A SOFTWARE SIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though I now attend a Baptist church, I was brought up
Catholic, and have never forgotten the nuns' stern lessons about
honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   So what would Sister Amanda make of Monday's news from Boston
College and the University of Notre Dame? These two redoubtable
Catholic institutions were among the few places in the US to report
serious damage from the Chernobyl, or CIH, computer virus. And
considering how this virus spreads, it would appear that somebody
has been coveting thy neighbor's software.
</P>
<P>
   CIH makes viruses like the much-touted Melissa look downright
primitive. Much has rightly been made of the virus' ability to wipe
out a computer's hard drive. But I'm more impressed by its unusual
ability to destroy a computer's main circuit board, commonly known
as a motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, this trick would have been impossible. But the
effort to make computers cheaper has also given them a dismaying
new vulnerability, one I've experienced firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder how your computer knows enough to boot itself up?
When you first start it, the processor inside knows nothing. So how
does it figure out how to start up the operating system and get to
work?
</P>
<P>
   What's needed is a bit of software that's built into the
machine's hardware. This program is called BIOS, or basic
input-output system. It runs at startup, telling the computer how
to boot itself. The BIOS program is small enough to fit onto a
single chip called a ROM, for read-only memory.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that you needed special equipment to alter the
BIOS software on a computer's ROM chip. But these days, most PCs
store the BIOS program on a chip called a flash ROM, a cheaper kind
of chip which can be upgraded by running a program on the PC.
Indeed, advanced computer users often ``flash'' their ROM chips to
add new features to the BIOS, like enabling the computer to work
with larger hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   But flashing must be done exactly right. If you load the wrong
instructions onto the chip, it's toast. You must replace the chip,
or the entire motherboard. Lots of people &UR;  &LR; -- &UR;  &LR; me, for
instance &UR;  &LR; -- &UR;  &LR; have destroyed computers this way. Some manufacturers
guard against this by putting a ``jumper'' on the motherboard that
prevents careless ROM flashing. But many others don't.
</P>
<P>
   You begin to see the fiendish possibilities. A virus that
flashes the ROM would savage your computer so completely that you
wouldn't even be able to boot up with an emergency boot floppy or
CD-ROM. (You do have an emergency boot disk, right? Well, make
one!) Not all Chernobyl-affected computers lost their ROM
chips &UR;  &LR; -- &UR;  &LR; some had their anti-flash feature turned on. But others
wound up with a corrupted hard drive and a dead motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   George Smith, editor of the Crypt Newsletter and a respected
virus expert, could think of only one other virus that attacks ROM
chips, and he told me the other one doesn't work. That makes CIH a
fairly sophisticated menace. But then, unlike Melissa, CIH should
also be quite difficult to catch. That's because it works by hiding
itself inside another piece of software _ a computer game, say.
When you run the game, you also run Chernobyl. If you only run
clean programs, legally obtained, a CIH infection is very unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   This should give you a clue as to why so many college students
got the virus, and why it also swept across Asia. Smith doesn't
believe the claims of a half-million infected computers in China,
India and South Korea. Media hype, he says. I'm not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1995 visit to Hong Kong, I saw store shelves heaped
high with pirated software, sold by sales clerks who cheerfully
admitted the stuff was illegal. Since then, the Chinese are
supposed to have cracked down. Yet the Business Software Alliance
says that 96 percent of all business software used in China is
pirated. And we're not even talking about games.
</P>
<P>
   Like those who make pirated videos by bringing camcorders into
movie theaters, pirate software dealers are none too concerned with
product quality. If a virus slips into the product, that's just too
bad. But a good little Catholic lad would never fall into such a
trap. He'd only use safe, legal software. Which is why I'm so
saddened by the outbreaks at Boston College and Notre Dame. I'd
recommend two Our Fathers and two Hail Marys, but I figure a dead
computer is penance enough.

TO STOP THE VIOLENCE, THE PLAY'S THE THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Web sites. Two warnings. One brandishes a recipe for bombs;
the other offers an antidote to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kill who I don't like,'' boasts the creator of the first
site. ``What I don't like I waste.'' The words accompany drawings
of devils and daggers, pyres and pipe bombs, guns and gore. Throw
in a few references to Adolf Hitler, some blood-curdling lyrics,
and homage to shoot-'em-dead video games. In a screed devoted to
games like Quake and Doom, the author screams, ``Good luck, marine,
and don't forget, kill 'em all!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   On the second site, a parent worries. ``We are all waiting for
the shot to ring out. We're all dreading that phone call that will
follow the gunshot,'' the author writes. ``We are all bonded by our
anxiety that tomorrow morning a potential killer will rise up to
act out his fantasy using us as figures in a video game.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Web site, with its ominous threats, is gone, stripped
from the Internet Tuesday night by American Online. The profile of
its creator, Eric D. Harris, was also taken down by AOL hours after
Harris and classmate Dylan Klebold stormed through Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., killing 15. The site's content has been
preserved for investigators at the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The second Web site, masterminded by playwright William
Mastrosimone and a few colleagues, is mercifully intact. It was
launched three weeks ago as part of a grassroots effort to prevent
another Springfield, Ore., or another Jonesboro, Ark., or another
West Paducah, Ky. _ and, now, another Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers a gift for teenagers everywhere. That gift is a
play about violence, to be performed exclusively by students in
their own communities. It is available only on the Internet, and
Mastrosimone has vowed that it will never be presented by
professional theaters or be made into a film, despite lucrative
offers. ``I want them to see their peers so that the potential
killer will see the kid who sits next to him up on that stage,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The play was inspired one night last year when one of
Mastrosimone's three children came home from school in Enumclaw,
Wash., and reported that one of the other students had scrawled an
ominous message on the blackboard: ``I'm going to kill everyone in
this class. And the teacher too.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright couldn't sleep that night. He paced. His mind
raced. And he came up with the idea for the play ``Bang Bang You're
Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not an adult in the country who knows what to do
about this, but the kids do,'' said Mastrosimone during a phone
interview from New York. ``The power lies in the kids. The baby
boomers are a failure generation. The government doesn't have a
clue. Our kids are killing each other, and as a parent, I'm going
out of my mind. As I thought about it, in a lightning flash, I
realized these kids need a way to talk to each other. What better
way than the tool of theater?''
</P>
<P>
   The play, which can be performed on a bare stage with minimal
props, spotlights an adolescent who killed his parents and five of
his peers. It opens on his first night in jail, where he is haunted
by the specters of the victims, who ask unrelentingly, ``Why me?''
Their voices won't be silenced: ``Just five bullets wounded
hundreds.'' ``Thousands.'' ``Wounds that bleed.'' ``Wounds that
weep.'' ``Wounds that never heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastrosimone took the idea to Michael Fisher, theater director
at Thurston High School in Springfield, Ore., where a 15-year-old
gunman killed two students last May. ``I was guarded at first,''
Fisher recalled. ``The media loves to put everyone's pain on
display, and we weren't going to be parading children around for
the media.'' But Fisher was an admirer of Mastrosimone's work, most
notably his play ``Extremities.'' And the students supported the
idea. ``They all wanted to talk about it; it touched a nerve,''
Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Mastrosimone originally wanted to publish the play the
old-fashioned way (paper and ink) and deliver it to every high
school in the country. But that changed. ``If I believe my premise,
that the power lies with the kids and not the adults, I had to put
it out on the Internet,'' he said. ``And this is coming from a guy
who's been using a computer for four months.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's out there in cyberspace, along with hate sites like the
one Harris posted on AOL. ``Technology doesn't make us better,''
Mastrosimone said. ``It magnifies what's good in us, and it
magnifies what's bad in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Thurston High School debuted the play earlier this month,
scores of other productions have been launched nationwide. And
Mastrosimone is looking for funding to expand the site to include
chat for teenagers about violence.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the play's the thing. It ends with the gunman
surrounded by the victims as they list the things they miss and the
things they'll never get to do. Ordinary things, teen things, like
flirting or swimming at midnight, the sort of things now being
reported as pastimes of the slain students in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's site held a brash warning: ``I kill who I don't like.''
The on-line play, however, shows the gunman after the act. ``I
didn't know it would be forever,'' he says. ``I thought it was
`bang bang you're dead' again. I thought I could hit the reset
button and start over. Why can't I have another chance?''

THINNER CAN DRY UP OIL IN WOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am refinishing a maple table I built myself, with an
oil-turpentine and Japan dryer finish and would like to varnish it
instead. I have sanded it, but some oil continues to come to the
surface after sanding. The oil comes up in clumps. How can I get it
all off before varnishing?
</P>
<P>
   MARINA THOMPSON, Nahant, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It may be an ongoing thing, because that oil will continue to
come up as long as it is there. There are several ways to keep
after the oil. Try using paint thinner to soften, then a plastic
scraper or steel wool to scrape it off. Then sand again and wait a
while to see if more oil comes up. If it does, repeat until no more
oil comes up. Or, use a paint stripper, preferably a nonmethylene
chloride stripper such as Citristrip, which might pull out the oil
better than paint thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Then apply two or three coats of a semigloss, oil-based
polyurethane varnish. You could use a high-gloss varnish if you
like that look. If the oil does not continue to come up in clumps,
any oil left will be compatible with the polyurethane.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just moved into a house on Beacon Hill with very squeaky
stairs. How can I silence those squeaks?
</P>
<P>
   TERRY KING, Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah yes, the squeaky-step syndrome. It has been said before, a
thousand times, and it will be said again: Once more into the
breach!
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it is relatively easy to fix. The steps squeak because
the wood has dried out and shrunk, and the tread has loosened from
the riser. The tread moves when stepped on, and the squeak is the
sound of wood rubbing against nails.
</P>
<P>
   The cure is to stop the tread from moving. Here is how: Have
someone stand on the tread, pressing it down on the riser. This
person must stay on the riser during the entire process. Drill a
pilot hole through the tread about 8 inches from one end and into
the riser, and a 45-degree angle. Drill a second hole 2 inches away
from the first, at the opposite angle. Drive a hot-zinc dipped
galvanized finish nail 2 1/2 inches long into each hole,
countersinking them. The pilot holes are smaller in diameter than
the nails. Do the same thing at the other end of the tread, 8
inches in from the end. OK, now, you can release the person who
held the tread down.
</P>
<P>
   The nails will form an ``X'' in the riser, greatly increasing
their holding power.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the countersunk holes and you are home free. You can also
do this through carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I painted my ceramic tile bathroom floor with BIN, then a
latex floor paint, and added a design on some of the tiles. I was
going to finish with varnish as a protector, but it will yellow. Is
there a clear finish that will not yellow?
</P>
<P>
   SUE NOCERA, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You could try several coats of a water-based polyurethane
varnish, which would yellow less than other varnishes. But good
luck; I suggest you wear slippers and bare feet in the bathroom;
this finish is likely to be very susceptible to scuffing and
scraping. A small rug would help protect against this.
</P>
<P>
   But, hope springs eternal, and the handyman asks you to write
with a progress report, to let him know how that finish is doing
under wear and tear. Maybe you discovered something the handyman
doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have two fireplaces, one on each floor, that are served by
the same flue. The first-floor fireplace makes the darnedest sound
I ever heard, a low, slow, rising moan. It doesn't sound like an
animal, and it occurs on windy days as well as calm ones. Have you
any idea of what it might be?
</P>
<P>
   JOE LEWICKE, Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Simple. It's a poltergeist. It doesn't sound like an animal;
I think it's the wind. On calm days there is still a downdraft of
air going from outside (high pressure) to the house (low pressure).
You could make a hot fire in the fireplace to drive out any
animals, but I doubt if any are there. Then, seal off the firebox
openings of both fireplaces to try to stop the downdraft. If the
moans stop, you have found the cause. If they reduce a bit but
don't stop, close off the top of the chimney temporarily to stop
the downdraft even more.
</P>
<P>
   I think the draft coming down the chimney makes a sound when it
hits where the flue splits. That split may be forming an opening
that causes a sound when the draft goes down. It's a little like
blowing across a Coke bottle to make a toot, or a jug to make a
moan.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing it is another matter. But you at least you've found out
what it is and can live with. Call it Harry James or Wynton
Marsalis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

FAST COMPANY, ATLANTIC TAKE TOP HONORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Boston outposts of Mort Zuckerman's media empire took top
honors Wednesday when the American Society of Magazine Editors
announced the winners of the 1999 National Magazine Awards in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year-old Fast Company _ a business publication for the
new economy, high-tech era _ took the General Excellence Award in
the 100,000 to 400,000 circulation category.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty jazzed,'' noted associate editor Heath Row.
``We're young, and most people say that it takes about five years
for magazines to come into their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Atlantic Monthly, which received three
nominations, carried home the award in the Essays &AMP; Criticism
category for ``Hymn,'' a July 1998 article by Cambridge writer
Emily Hiestand that describes her Sundays in a black Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really thrilled,'' said staff editor Lucie Prinz, noting
that Hiestand's autobiographical essays have been published in a
book called ``Angela the Upside-Down Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The prestigious magazine awards produced several other notable
winners including Newsweek in the reporting category for its
coverage of the Monical Lewinsky scandal. The top design prize went
to the oversized upstart, ESPN The Magazine, best known for its
hyperkinetic and flashy graphics and Gen-X appeal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all of the scolding the media have taken for reckless
reporting during the Columbine High School massacre and for
painfully intrusive interviews with the mourners, one crucial issue
has gone unnoticed: racial and demographic stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Globe library search of newsclips concerning the
Littleton, Colo., tragedy, there have been nearly 1,400 references
to the so-called ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' and more than 900 references
to the perpetrators as members of a ``clique'' or ``group,'' but
only 74 references to the killers as members of a ``gang.'' This
raises the question whether the term gang _ with all its ominous
connotations _ would have appeared much more frequently in news
accounts had the high school marauders been poor and dark-skinned
instead of middle class and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have a group of students who all wear the same color.
They all hang together,'' said Greg Freeman, a St. Louis
Post-Dispatch columnist, who often writes on race-related issues.
``I think without a doubt if they weren't middle-class white kids,
the news media would be calling them a gang. . . . There's a little
stereotyping going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers of the Black Entertainment Television call-in show ``BET
Tonight'' recently expressed anger at the apparent double standard
used to describe violent, young criminals. Clearly, that point has
yet to permeate the mainstream media.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is the journalistic equivalent of a family values campaign.
In the most exhaustive analysis yet of the frantic and sloppy
``mixed media culture'' that reared its ugly head in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, Harvard Nieman Foundation curator Bill Kovach and
Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism, call for deep soul-searching in their book, ``Warp
Speed,'' to be published by The Century Foundation next month. (In
the preface, David Halberstam calls 1998 ``the worst year for
American journalism since I entered the profession forty-four years
ago.'')
</P>
<P>
   While many of the Lewinsky media post-mortems have focused on
technical issues like proper sourcing, ``Warp Speed'' gets much
more basic in its proposed remedies. The first, the authors say,
holds that ``each news organization should do a great deal more to
decide in advance what its news values and policies are.'' The
second is for the organizations to ``make it clear to those who
work there that these are the values in place.'' And then news
outlets must ``make these values clear to the audience. . . . In
effect, a newsroom must make a covenant with the public about what
it stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Kovach and Rosenstiel recognize that the new media
universe will be inhabited by everyone from Interent gossip Matt
Drudge to the august New York Times, they're just trying to get
journalists to choose a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of news organizations beginning to identify
themselves as fish or foul,'' in regard to journalistic standards,
said Kovach. ``I think it really is a democratization of
information and news, and people have to identify which side
they're on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, media maven Steve Brill is getting it from both
sides. MSNBC talk host John Hockenberry blasts the Brill's Content
founder in the May/June issue of Mother Jones, calling his view
that ``the media is to operate under the same standard as the court
system in terms of proof beyond a reasonable doubt'' nothing less
than a ``Stalinist concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Brill's Content is being lampooned for being too
squishy by Danny Schechter, the former WBCN-FM ``news dissector''
who is now an executive producer at Globalvision. Schechter's first
issue of the Brill parody ``disContent'' _ mailed to several
thousand media types _ attacks the magazine for ``slick personality
profiles and soft features,'' and complains the magazine is ``under
market pressure to water down its own content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I felt that Brill's Content was steering away
from harder-hitting media coverage,'' said Schechter, who claims
the magazine has failed to look at the vital issue of concentrated
ownership of media. ``We meant (disContent) as a friendly nudge to
him.'''

`ENTRAPMENT' DOESN'T ADD UP 
OUR RATING: 2 STARS
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Entrapment'' appeals to the eyes but fails to
engage the brain. And with a plot virtually free of nuance, not to
mention any genuine suspense, the pleasant visuals and agreeable
turns by its leads tend to evaporate after about an hour, leaving
you with another hour of implausible goofiness of the highest order
still on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jon Amiel (``Copycat,'' ``Sommersby'') seems to be
trying for the same sort of lush breeziness that made Alfred
Hitchcock's ``To Catch a Thief'' such a favorite with audiences.
But this caper film is handicapped by two insurmountable burdens _
a script light on wit and weighted with inexplicable contrivances
and a two-generation age gap between its romantic headliners.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Catch a Thief'' may be far from Hitchcock's finest, but few
flinched at the pairing of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Here, the
cringe factor is high. When Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones
finally lock lips (thankfully, it's just for a brief moment), your
first inclination is to turn away.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a knock on Connery, who still has charisma to spare
(although he uses it sparingly here _ think ``The Avengers,'' only
not quite as bad). He plays Robert ``Mac'' MacDougal, a legendary
master thief suspected of stealing a Rembrandt from a New York
office tower. On his trail is insurance investigator Virginia
``Gin'' Baker (Zeta-Jones), who tracks Mac to London and later to
his castle in Scotland, a spectacular locale that seems a little
showy for a thief trying to hide a lifetime of stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
   Mac and Gin soon form a tense partnership and set their sights
on a prized Chinese mask being exhibited at an English art museum.
Mac, making like Henry Higgins, puts Gin through her paces in
several scenes designed primarily to show off Zeta-Jones' posterior
to maximum effect. (Gin's fabric of choice: Lycra.)
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the slapdash screenplay (credited to Ron Bass and
William Broyles) has the two jetting to Malaysia to attempt a
computer heist that's so fundamentally silly and inadequately
explained that it completely undercuts the fireworks that follow.
</P>
<P>
   How stupid is it? Mac and Gin have a mere 24 hours to plan for a
job that requires them to foil a bank's formidable security team,
hack into the elaborate computer system and download $8 billion
before anyone is the wiser. (The plan, as Gin explains it, is to
steal one-tenth of a second from the bank's computer for every
minute of the last hour of the millennium, giving them 10 seconds
to shift the money. Never mind that, according to her math, they
would only have accumulated six seconds. Nothing else in this movie
adds up either.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we wouldn't have the time or the inclination to check
the story's arithmetic if we weren't bored out of our skulls. A
caper movie without tension is like, well, a romantic pairing
without sexual chemistry. And ``Entrapment'' fails on both counts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Juan De Los Santos channel surfs from ABC to MTV, but the
39-year-old Dominican rarely finds people who look like him. He
dumped ``NYPD Blue'' when Latino actor Jimmy Smits left the
program. Although there are several Hispanic news reporters in
Boston, the only one De Los Santos can name is Tim Estiloz, a
general assignment reporter for WLVI-Ch. 56. And when De Los Santos
finally catches Hispanics on the local news, the news is inevitably
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I see Latin Americans is if they're a gangster
or robbing a store,'' complained De Los Santos. ``The way they show
us is always negative. It's not a lawyer. It's not a judge.''
</P>
<P>
   De Los Santos isn't the only one getting that message.
English-language television often offers a skewed vision of
Latinos. You'll find them speaking heavily accented English on
``Jesse,'' ``Suddenly Susan,'' and the ubiquitous Taco Bell
commercials. Or they're playing detectives and cops on ``Law &AMP;
Order,'' ``Homicide,'' or ``Nash Bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   But often, they're simply invisible. Between 1994 and 1997,
Latino characters accounted for a meager 3 percent of the 7,000
characters shown on prime-time television, a Screen Actors Guild
report reveals.
</P>
<P>
   Television's poor track record hasn't made Latinos tune out and
turn off the tube, however. Recent studies by the Tomas Rivera
Policy Institute, a think tank based in Claremont, Calif., show
that Hispanics watch English and Spanish television more often than
Anglos do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Latinos aren't the only people of color
underrepresented in TV land. This is a world in which
African-American shows tend to be relegated to the UPN ghetto and
Asian-Americans and Native Americans barely register a blip.
</P>
<P>
   The invisibility of Latinos is particularly noticeable given the
community's explosive growth. In 1995, Boston was home to 71,000
Latinos, or 12 percent of the population, a 15 percent increase
since 1990, according to the Massachusetts Institute for Social and
Economic Research. The Census Bureau expects Latinos to be the
largest minority in the country by 2025, making up 25 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until very recently the (television) audience was not
disproportionately interested in Latin America or the Caribbean,''
said Louis DeSipio, a political science professor at the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who authored the two Tomas Rivera
studies, released in the fall and last month. ``What we're
capturing is that changing process.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is changing. Latina actresses Salma Hayek and Rosie Perez
scored televison development deals earlier this year. Two proposed
network programs slated for fall will feature Latino actors in
prominent roles. And just in time for the millennium, cable viewers
may get SiTV, a Latino-themed English version of venerable
Spanish-language cable channels Univision and Telemundo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``I watch a lot of TV . . . There's nothing else I have to do. I'm
still looking for a job. '' &QL; 
REINA AVILLAN MARTINEZ &QL; 
15, Roslindale &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 99 percent of Hispanics own televisions, according to
the Tomas Rivera reports, which surveyed 1,000 Latinos in
California, Florida, Texas, New York, and Illinois. Most viewers
gaze at those sets more than four hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a population that has a lower income,'' DeSipio said.
``They can't take advantage of as many recreational opportunities
outside the house so they take advantage of free . . .
entertainment within the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics who are bilingual keep their eyes on the small screen
longer, according to the report. Latinos not only catch their
favorite television shows in English, they look at their favorite
ones in Spanish as well.
</P>
<P>
   De Los Santos, whose three televisions serve his 9-year-old son,
11-year-old daughter, his wife and her father, mainly turns on the
tube on weekends. He'll catch Spanish-language specials about his
home country, the Dominican Republic. Then he may switch to shows
on the History and Sci-Fi channels.
</P>

   De Los Santos spends his weekday tube time flipping between
Spanish- and English-language news. That's not unusual. About 92
percent of Latinos in the Tomas Rivera study watched the news in
both languages.
</P>
<P>
   Local news provides information about the immediate community.
Spanish news fills in the gaps because ``American news does not
tell us what's going on in our countries,'' said De Los Santos.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Barrientos, 50, who is from Guatemala and now lives in
Lynn, Mass., agreed. ``When they have something about Latin
American countries it's because it's the coverage of the President.
Other than that they don't show us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Boston Latinos also complain about how often local news
shows Hispanics in handcuffs. About 60 percent of the people
surveyed by Tomas Rivera thought American news depicted Hispanic
men as undocumented aliens or criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear that (complaint) uniquely from the Latino
community,'' said Paul La Camera, general manager at WCVB-Ch. 5,
the longtime home of Latino reporters Jorge Quiroga and Amalia
Barreda, addressing the latter charge. ``We ask that they look upon
us as a whole. Hopefully, we provide a balanced positive picture of
our entire community.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tomas Rivera study respondents said community coverage
improved when a television news station hired a Hispanic anchor or
reporter, Boston Latinos disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have channels that have Latinos anchoring but they don't
care about the community,'' said Regla Gonzalez, 50, vice president
of the northeast region of the League of United Latin American
Citizens (LULAC), the Hispanic version of the NAACP. The Cuban, who
now lives in Boston, is so offended by the stereotypes on local
news that at times she switches to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Barrientos, who has two televisions in the home she shares with
her son and boyfriend, tries to avoid the news altogether. ``The
only reason I watch (it) is to see whether the weather tomorrow is
going to be good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The disaffection filters down to American sitcoms. Reina Avillan
Martinez, 15, dedicates 25 hours a week to cartoons, ``The
X-Files,'' and teen shows on the WB.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez knows that American television represents Latinos
about as authentically as the accent Luis sports on ``Suddenly
Susan.'' Most of the Latinos she spots on television play plumbers
or other minor characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they put a Hispanic on TV they're never Dominicans or
Puerto Ricans, they're mostly from Argentina, Chile,'' said
Martinez, a non-Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican who lives in
Roslindale with her mother and younger sister.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Even on Dawson's Creek, when do you see anyone except the
Caucasian race? I've never seen an African-American. I've never
seen Hispanics. I've never seen Chinese. Why? ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ANNABELLE GUERRA &QL; 
15, Boston &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 36 percent of the people polled by Tomas Rivera said
that television in English shows Hispanics negatively. Americans
who learn about Latinos on TV often accept these stereotypes as the
truth, said Gonzalez, ``because they have no idea about our
culture, our upbringing, our ways of living.''
</P>
<P>
   But negative images and invisibility can also have a devastating
effect on young people's self-esteem.

WILD CREATURES, AND A FEW TAME, POPULATE OUR SUBURBAN EDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fat, black bunny ran around my yard for the third day. When I
tapped the window, he came to it and looked at me and waited. He
was not wild because ordinary cottontails are gray and never come
to a human. He was someone's Easter bunny who was turned out into
the wild to die.
</P>
<P>
   House pets cannot survive when let loose in the wild because it
is a cold, cruel place, where everyone eventually eats everyone
else. Pets, unschooled in the law of the jungle, die of starvation.
Abandoned white bunnies and guinea pigs are buried in our animal
graveyard and we've had kittens turn up crying in our garage.
</P>
<P>
   Actually our yard is already filled with all kinds of wild
animals. Last year I caught a red fox in the trap set for the
rotten woodchuck next to her hole. We've watched a pair of foxes
jaunt through the yard off and on for several years, so, of course,
we let him go.
</P>
<P>
   The pheasants rarely visit now. They used to nest outside the
bedroom window in a large, impenetrable bramble patch. But, as the
forest has grown, blocking the sun, and the swamp has spread, the
brambles have receded and no safe nesting habitat exists for them
anymore. They also need lots of brush at the woodland's edge to
hide in as they constantly search for food.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, a coyote was caught in Boston's South End. No
surprise. They are all over. So are lots of other critters, though
you may not see them all. Raccoons, rats, mice, feral cats, skunks,
muskrats, Canada geese, woodchucks, moles and voles. A little
farther out of the city, add wild turkeys, foxes, deer and beaver.
(Beaver were hunted out of existence in Massachusetts by the time
of the American Revolution. A few came back in the 1920s, and, by
1998, there were thousands.
</P>
<P>
   There is a commonly accepted myth that there are so many animals
in city and suburbs because human beings are encroaching on their
forest habitat. This is absolutely wrong. What is happening is that
suburbia is a wild-animal Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Wild animals are not in the suburbs because we have taken away
their habitat. They are there because suburbia is safer and has
more food than the forest. We have succulent shrubs and tasty
pansies, vegetables, green lawns with fat grubs and, best of all,
lots of garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The simple scientific fact is that animal populations are
habitat-driven. Where there is food, they will follow. Where there
is a lot of food, their populations will multiply until they become
too numerous and outgrow their food supply. Then they begin to die
of disease and starvation.
</P>
<P>
   In city and suburb, animals have lots of food. They eat and
multiply. (Before the rabies epidemic, the population of raccoons
in cities was estimated at up to 500 per square mile.)
</P>
<P>
   Loving and humanizing our wild animals is in fashion these days.
It's called anthropomorphism. CNN almost always ends its newscasts
with an animal story because animals sell, and can sell anything,
particularly on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But back to my black bunny and my fox and the rotten woodchuck
who eats everything nice.
</P>
<P>
   The black bunny will probably be run over or eaten by the fox.
My battle with the woodchuck will go on forever. Meanwhile, the
skunks and raccoons are digging up the little bulbs of my white
flowered spring beauty (Claytonia), which the Indians loved to eat,
too.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the bottom line? Animal populations have grown
exponentially this century. Because they are humanized, as well as
protected by multiple wildlife laws, we have to learn to live with
them and their depredations.
</P>
<P>
   What can we do?
</P>
<P>
   1. Fence or trap problem animals. Fencing is more permanent.
</P>
<P>
   2. Frightening devices rarely work, so don't waste your money.
</P>
<P>
   3. Repellents may help for a short while. You can spray nibbled
tulips, pansies and perennials with Ropel, a bitter-tasting
fungicide. It may cause some browning on soft new leaves, and don't
breathe its mist.
</P>
<P>
   4. Put in poisonous plants that you hope the animals won't eat.
</P>
<P>
   5. And sometimes just throw your hands up and rail at the sky.
</P>

TURBO BEETLE FAR SURPASSES ITS LEGENDARY ANCESTOR IN POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 1970 and a 12-year-old Volkswagen convertible crawls
across a frozen landscape, 30-odd horses thumping in the rear
engine compartment as the Bug slowly climbs a long hill and traffic
builds up behind.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a college student heading back to campus from Christmas
break is dressed the way you dressed back then to drive a Beetle in
winter: heavy boots with felt liners, long underwear and wool
pants, parka, wool hat pulled down over his ears, mittens.
</P>
<P>
   His right hand is on the steering wheel and his left grips an
ice scraper with which he continuosly scrapes away the frost that
his own breath paints on the windshield inches from his nose.
Volkswagen and heating/defrosting systems were mutually exclusive
terms in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Jump ahead 29 years. A turbocharged, 1999 Beetle is fired up on
a chill, early spring morning. A touch of frost has caked the
windshield and the road out to town starts with a steep climb. In
only a minute, heat pours from vents and the frost disappears. The
Beetle bursts up the hill, its 1.8-liter, turbocharged engine as
silky and quiet as an electric motor even as the transmission is
shifted into fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the highway, the Beetle moves nimbly, bursting ahead
here, changing lanes there, catching many other drivers by surprise
to be passed by a . . . Beetle?
</P>
<P>
   But though its shape _ half an egg with bulbous fenders _ may be
evocative of the Beetles of the days of peace and love, this is not
Sunshine's Beetle. That old Bug, afterall, chugged its way though
the counterculture years. This one has a rear spoiler on the roof
that pops up automatically at 93 miles per hour _ warp speed in
Sunshine's day _ or can be raised with the push of a button at
lower speeds.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1999 turbocharged new Beetle, Volkswagen has reached
back to the past, even while bringing us stealthily into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   They've put the engine up front and put the body on what is
virtually the same platform that sits beneath the Golf or Jetta.
They've kept it so ugly on the outside it's still cute. Inside,
they have maintained the feel of sitting inside a dome, though this
one, with large windows all around, is more like a glass bubble
than a tin egg. It's a look that works; ask any dealer how long the
waiting list is to buy one. And, those lists will only continue to
grow even as the cost of this hot, next generation of new Beetles
hits the $20,000 price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The huge windshield is positioned well away from the driver, out
there on the flats of a dashboard reminiscent of the Toyota Previa
van. In the GLX model tested, the seats are leather and heated, the
steering wheel is wrapped in leather, and six-spoke alloy wheels
make the low-crouching Bug look like it is ready to leap.
</P>
<P>
   The lilac glow of the instrument panels, offset by the red
stripes of needles on gauges, lights the cockpit in a futuristic
glow at night. The basics are right before you in one round panel:
speed, tachometer, fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Two things differ greatly from the old Bug: There is no fuel
tank in front of you, and all that empty space that would crush
like a cheap can in a crash has been filled with engine. Meanwhile,
the spear-like steering column of the old Bugs has been replaced
with a collapsible one. The government crash tested 14 cars in this
class last year and Volkswagen came out on top.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, also, is the distinctive sound of the thumping, air-cooled
VW engine. Have there been more distinctive engine sounds on
America's highways than those of the Harley-Davidson V-Twin and the
Volkswagen?
</P>
<P>
   In handling, the new Beetle is reminiscent of the early Saab
900s, with the distinctive tight steering of front-wheel drive
autos and a snappiness when given gas.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest complaint about the interior is with the seats, which
are quite comfortable from the butt and up through the back, but
far too soft beneath the thighs and knees. A more rigid front panel
to the seat would help.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pickering, a VW enthusiast from Exeter, N.H., owns a new
Beetle _ though not the turbocharged model _ and says it compares
wonderfully in terms of fun and nostalgia with his other Bug, a
1953, impeccably restored, maintained, and driven thousands of
miles every summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   This, the second model year of the new Beetle, shows that this
is still a work in progress. They've got the evocation down. Now
they're working on performance. The 1.8T, which goes on sale this
week, is powered by a transverse-mounted, 4-cylinder, 20-valve
engine that cranks out 150 horsepower. (Pickering points out that
he has a Judson supercharger that he could slap onto his 1953 Bug
and boost it from 36 to 50 horses.)
</P>
<P>
   Folks who rushed out to buy the 1998s or the early 1999s may
soon be found back in the showroom once word of this model gets out
_ which is, after all, how the car business works.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-speed shifter clicks deftly through the gears without the
clumsy long throw of the old models. The front suspension _
McPherson strut design with control arms, stabilizer bar and coil
spring struts _ is matched with a rear setup of independent torsion
beam axle and integrated sway bar.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good setup to a point _ the point being that with all
this new power in a 2,921-pound car ready to leap out of the
corners, a stiffer setup would be better. Power has gotten just a
bit ahead of suspension here.
</P>
<P>
   But again, this is a work in progress and right now, at this
price, this is as much fun as you can find in a sensible commuter
car. Unless, of course, you want to await the evolution. An Rsi
model prototype unveiled recently will almost certainly lead, a
Volkswagen spokesman said, to an ever higher level of Bug: a V-6
engine, 200-plus horsepower, all-wheel-drive model.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Webbed map pouches on each door.
</P>
<P>
   _ A sunglasses holder in the ceiling just above the driver's
door.
</P>
<P>
   _ A small storage compartment in the ceiling just above the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   _ The single joystick on the driver's door that operates both
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   _ I know this is purely personal taste, but as soon as I got in
the car, the daisy in the little vase mounted on the dash went into
the glove compartment. When I think of daisies and the '60s and
'70s, I see them stuck in gun barrels, not vases on Beetle dashes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The cup holders set ahead of the shift lever and partly under
the dash. Hard, if not impossible, to use.
</P>
<P>
   _ The tiny antenna mounted on the rear roof. Too much static in
places where reception is usually good. Give us a big antenna.

ADVOCATES SAY ELDERLY DRUG PLAN INCOMPLETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Dr. Mario Motta is seeing more patients these days
with worsening heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at their swollen legs and see them huffing and puffing
and I ask, `Are you taking your meds?' '' said the Salem
cardiologist. ``They say, `Well, I take my pills every other day.'
They don't volunteer that they can't afford their medicine, but
that's what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Motta's story is far from unusual. The Massachusetts Medical
Society reports dozens of recent calls from doctors worried about
patients who can't afford to fill their prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians are very concerned about patients who skip doses or
take a quarter-pill, or share their medications with a spouse or
friend,'' said Dr. Marylou Buyse, the Medical Society president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on Beacon Hill, a legislative push to address the
problem noticeably lost steam this week.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders unveiled a Senior Pharmacy proposal that
disappointed elders and their advocates for what it doesn't cover,
such as individuals with heavy drug needs. ``It's an inadequate
response to a grave problem,'' said Geoff Wilkinson of the
Massachusetts Senior Action Council.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis was precipitated in January, when 75,000
Massachusetts elderly and disabled people abruptly lost unlimited
drug coverage through their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   If elders are disheartened, advocates for the disabled are near
despair. The House proposal does nothing at all for people with
disabilities _ in violation of a recent private pledge from some
House leaders to include them, according to advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that legislators think more about the Patriots
than they do about elderly and disabled people,'' said Cynthia
Homer, a part-time radiology technician in North Andover whose
43-year-old husband Robert suffers from multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Homer's annual prescription drug bill runs $8,216, but
his quarterly Fallon Plan coverage limit is $175.
</P>
<P>
   Homer discovered Wednesday that his blood pressure has shot up
to 158 over 110, compared to 130 over 80 a week ago, because he has
run out of some pills and is carefully rationing the rest. He'll
run out of insulin within a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a pickle, to say the least,'' Homer said. ``I'm
probably within about three weeks of ending up in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   House leaders, intent on avoiding any proposal that involves new
spending, defend their $30 million Senior Pharmacy proposal as a
good first step toward a more comprehensive solution in a year or
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this does a very good job of giving relief for the
present,'' said Harriette L. Chandler, a Worcester Democrat who is
House cochairwoman of the Legislature's Joint Health Care
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal does not widen eligibility for the Senior Pharmacy
program to elders with incomes twice the federal poverty level
($16,488), as some had hoped, but leaves it at 150 percent of the
poverty standard ($12,360). It increases the annual drug benefit,
but only from $750 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fundamentally inadequate response to the problem,''
said Becky Derby of Health Care for All, a consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal does permit elders with limited drug coverage to
take advantage of the $1,000 benefit if their incomes are low
enough or their drug needs are hefty enough.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's primary innovation is to offer the $1,000 benefit to
elders with incomes up to $32,960 ($57,512 for couples) if they can
demonstrate that their prescription drug bills in the previous year
amounted to more than 5 percent of their gross income.
</P>
<P>
   This provision was designed to address the coverage vacuum left
when Massachusetts Senior Plan HMOs stopped offering unlimited
prescription drug coverage in January after a federal court
invalidated a state law requiring them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler acknowledged that the new proposal does not cover all
elders' drug needs, but she asserted that it would help take care
of 78 percent of the 75,000 elders who lost unlimited HMO coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HMOs tell us that 78 percent of seniors had drug costs
below $1,500 a year,'' Chandler said. ``If you take that as a
given, we should be able to reach approximately 78 percent, between
this program and the coverage that HMOs still offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics challenged that assumption, but said if it were true, it
would still leave 16,500 elders (22 percent) with higher drug bills
who formerly had unlimited HMO drug coverage. Among the entire
Massachusetts population over age 65, there may be 180,000 people
with drug needs greater than $1,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 83-year-old dad would qualify for the new Senior Pharmacy
benefits, but $1,000 is nothing,'' said Alan Kirby of New Bedford.
``He has like $900 in out-of-pocket drug expenses a month. He has
emphysema. He'll die before anything comes to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking people with catastrophic drug needs and putting them
into the Senior Pharmacy program with a $1,000 benefit is kind of
like spitting into the ocean,'' added Stephen J. D'Amato, a
Cambridge attorney who has been trying to design short-term and
long-term solutions for the drug coverage problem.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato had crafted a proposal, put forward by consumer groups
but rejected by House leaders, to restore unlimited drug coverage.
He said the plan would require beneficiaries to pay a monthly
premium of $80 and about $25 million in state subsidy for the
remainder of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term plan would be replaced by a scheme designed to
enroll healthy elders to offset the costs of sicker enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders acknowledge their proposal is only a first step.
``Our goal is to see this short-term remedy develop . . . into a
long-term solution that benefits all seniors who need assistance,''
House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran (D-Mattapan) said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A few days ago, many football fans viewed House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran as the man who forced the New England
Patriots into Connecticut's arms, while opponents of using public
money to lure sports teams praised his prudency.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Finneran might be able to enjoy the best of both worlds:
a chance to bask in the glory of putting together a package many
hope will keep the team at home, but without looking as if he caved
on any of his tight fiscal principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt about it,'' said one business leader
involved in the talks that led to the stadium accord. ``Others may
not like to hear it, but Finneran was driving the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were risks,'' Finneran said of his demanding
negotiations with Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, Governor
Paul Cellucci, business leaders, and National Football League
officials. ``And in the end, we got an agreement everyone could
live with, including, I hope, the team. But we did not pay tribute
or ransom, and I think that might be a lesson for other states.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran noted that no state funds would be used to buy land for
the Patriots or to help build the stadium. He also noted that the
final package aimed at keeping the Patriots in Massachusetts
requires them to repay the state for some of the infrastructure
improvements for a new Foxborough stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was a demand business leaders and NFL officials fought,
because infrastructure is considered the responsibility of
government. And during the talks, Finneran compromised and agreed
to lower the price of the demand, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end his principle stood: If the Patriots accept
Massachusetts' offer, they will pay the state up to $1 million a
year to help pay for infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a recognition that for the league, economics are
paramount, and that means TV revenues in this market,'' Finneran
said. ``But there is no burden on any taxpayer in any jurisdiction,
especially in Massachusetts, to step to the plate when in fact
there are abundant revenues generated by this franchise and this
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought our role was appropriately limited to
infrastructure. And this agreement reflects that precisely,''
Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   The final agreement increases the amount of state funding of
infrastructure by up to $20 million from proposals offered last
year in the House and the Senate. The additional funds would be
spent on roadwork, sewer, water, and utility lines that were not
anticipated under Finneran's previous proposal, which would have
renovated Foxboro Stadium rather than build a new one. Because the
original estimates were developed more than 18 months ago, and were
called conservative, lawmakers said inflation and additional
requirements helped raise the price tag for the state's investment.

   Some also credit Finneran's intransigence _ and willingness to
play brinksmanship and possibly lose the team _ with encouraging
the NFL to change its rules and allow low-interest loans to owners
building stadiums in the top six media markets. Although some NFL
officials deny it, others note that the restriction specifically
includes the Boston area, which is ranked the sixth largest media
market in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finneran's insistence that no public money go into the stadium
was clearly a force to be reckoned with,'' said advertising
executive Jack Connors, a leader of the drive to keep the Patriots
in Massachusetts. ``And from one perspective, it could be viewed
that Finneran brought the NFL to its knees. But in the end, working
with the governor and Senate president, I think we wound up with an
agreement that can keep the Patriots in Foxborough.''

HONEST LOOK AT BEING A GAY TEEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 3 STARS  
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It may be the land of Boy George and Tinky Winky,
but don't let that fool you. Growing up gay in England is just as
hard as growing up gay anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' is a generally credible, good-humored look at the
travails of teen-age homosexuality. It's essentially your basic
coming-of-age movie, just with a different orientation, accents and
more-or-less believable characters. Other than that, like such
recent U.K. exports as ``The Full Monty'' and ``Waking Ned
Devine,'' ``Real'' makes an extra-special effort to be charmingly
accessible for (hopefully large) U.S. audiences. Even the London
suburb of Basingstoke, where the film is set, looks more American
than British.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Silverstone (no relation to Alicia) plays 16-year-old Steven
Carter, who's known he was gay since the Cub Scouts but hasn't told
anybody except his plump neighbor Linda (Charlotte Brittain, doing
a kind of European Rosie O'Donnell). He spends his afterschool
hours hanging around the men's room in the park and his time on
campus trying to avoid bullying jocks, who don't know he's queer
but think calling him one is a big insult.
</P>
<P>
   The handsomest, most athletically accomplished of this otherwise
Neanderthal bunch is John Dixon (Brad Gorton). All the girls at
school dream about John; Steven barely dares to. But after running
into John at his favorite haunt, Steven can't believe his luck.
Unfortunately, John can't believe his inclination, and even though
the two boys embark on a passionate affair, John insists on keeping
it a secret. This, in turn, radicalizes Steven toward the door of
his own closet.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Patrick Wilde (no relation to Oscar), whose play
``What's Wrong With Angry?'' the film is based on, has a good knack
for ratcheting up universal teen self-consciousness a few notches
without making his characters unduly neurotic. Everyone should be
able to relate to Steven's embarrassments, triumphs and the mood
swings in between _ at least until things take an overly dramatic
turn toward the end.
</P>
<P>
   Director Simon Shore (nope, not Pauly's cousin) gets
terrifically believable performances out of Silverstone and Gorton,
and nice little moments from most of those playing their bewildered
parents, classmates and teachers. That said, many of these side
characters are nonetheless pat _ either naturally supportive or
threatened or designed to come around _ and you often wish that
more was specifically English about the movie than just kids in
school uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Get Real'' is pretty honest about what really matters to
its protagonists. That's not only unusual for a gay-themed film
aimed at the most mainstream of audiences, but for films about
young people in general. &UR;

IS THE AIR GOING OUT OF THE GORE BALLOON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton became the Democrats' presidential nominee in 1992
in large measure because his party's varsity players chose to stay
off the field. Certain that George Bush was unbeatable, Mario
Cuomo, Sam Nunn, Dick Gephardt, and Jesse Jackson gave the race a
pass. The result was that a second-string governor from a
third-tier state crushed the invincible Bush in what turned out to
be the most comprehensive defeat of a sitting president since
William Howard Taft.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think Democrats would have learned.
</P>
<P>
   This time around it was Vice President Al Gore who was deemed
too formidable to challenge, at least for the Democratic
nomination. Senators Bob Kerrey and John Kerry gave it some thought
and decided not to take a chance; so, once again, did Gephardt and
Jackson. Only Bill Bradley, the ex-senator from New Jersey who
barely held his seat the last time he ran for office (in 1990),
opted to go after Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, earnest, dreamy Bradley, the pundits said. Nice guy. But
face it: Gore's got the party sewn up.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was last month's conventional wisdom. This month the
U-word is suddenly in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The script for a possible upset is becoming clear,'' wrote
David Broder, dean of the nation's political reporters, in The
Washington Post on Sunday. Far from having the nomination in his
pocket, ``the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary look
increasingly hazardous for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, Bradley has been endorsed by three
Democrats as renowned _ and as different _ as Paul Volcker, the
sage former Federal Reserve chairman; Paul Wellstone, the
paleoliberal Minnesota senator; and Ed Koch, the hyperopinionated
New Yorker who served three terms as the Big Apple's irrepressible
mayor. And at least one certified superstar has put his money on
the challenger: Michael Jordan and his wife have written $1,000
checks to the Bradley campaign. (On the required form, Bradley
listed his occupation as ``retired.'')
</P>
<P>
   Polls that had Bradley down among the asterisks last year now
suggest that he is a player to reckon with. According to Gallup, 34
percent of Democrats say they would support Bradley for the
nomination today, up from 8 percent in May 1998. Gore, at 54
percent, is essentially unchanged from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has a problem, and its initials are B.C. Two
hours after the president was impeached in January, Gore declared
emphatically that Bill Clinton ``will be regarded in the history
books as one of our greatest presidents.'' That isn't how most
Americans feel. The electorate that twice held Clinton to less than
50 percent of the vote will be glad to see him go. In 1988, a great
swath of the public would gladly have reelected Ronald Reagan to a
third term; unable to do that, they did the next best thing and
elevated his second-in-command.
</P>
<P>
   But rare is the voter who pines for a third Clinton term. In a
Pew Research poll this month, Americans overwhelmingly agreed with
the statement, ``I am tired of all the problems associated with the
Clinton administration.'' The sentiment cuts across party lines: 83
percent of Republicans, 77 percent of Independents, and 64 percent
of Democrats share it. For Gore, those numbers are disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Other data in the Pew survey drive home the point. Respondents
were asked for a one-word description of Gore. In September 1996,
32 percent had something positive to say; now, only 19 percent do.
The share of those whose characterization is negative or mocking,
by contrast, has climbed to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, that Gore will surge once the primary
and caucus season gets underway. There is a respectable history of
front-runners stumbling early on only to pick themselves up and win
the nomination _ or the election _ in a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another history, just as respectable, of candidates
who once soared over the field beginning to lose altitude as the
nation learns more and more about them. Michael Dukakis was 17
points ahead of Bush in the spring of 1988. When voters began to
focus on Dukakis's record _ the ``Massachusetts Miracle'' that
melted, the furloughs for first-degree murderers _ the race turned.
By November, a 17-point lead had become a 40-state rout.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been vice president for more than six years, but many
of us are only just beginning to get a fix on him. How many voters
know, for instance, that Gore advocates a ``strategic goal'' of
completely eliminating automobiles? Or that he compares people who
disagree with his environmental views to those who appeased Hitler
in the 1930s?
</P>
<P>
   Expect to hear much more about ``Earth in the Balance,'' Gore's
1992 bestseller. Dan Quayle carries around a copy so he can read
aloud passages like this one:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pacific yew can be cut down and processed to produce . . .
taxol, which offers some promise of curing certain forms of lung,
breast, and ovarian cancer in patients who would otherwise quickly
die. It seems an easy choice _ sacrifice the tree for a human life
_ until one learns that three trees must be destroyed for each
patient treated.''
</P>
<P>
   A would-be president who can't decide whether it is more
important to save trees or human beings: Meet the real Al Gore. The
GOP is betting that the more you learn about him, the less you'll
want to put him in the White House. Bill Bradley is betting the
same thing.

THE GOP'S LEADERSHIP GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wednesday the Republican National Committee held a fund-raiser
in Washington that took in $14 million. It was the largest such
event (in dollar terms) in the nation's history. The money raised
will be used to help the GOP maintain control of Congress in the
year 2000 elections. The question is, for what purpose?
</P>
<P>
   What benefit, other than some special favors for special
interests, is derived from a Republican-controlled Congress?
</P>
<P>
   The answer Republicans offer is telling: A Democratic-controlled
Congress would be worse. That's almost certainly true, but it's
both beside the point and a dysfunctional electoral strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The point of being in charge, after all, is to do something. The
Republican congressional leadership is afraid of doing anything
that might cause its members to have to stand up and be counted on
tough issues.
</P>
<P>
   Having nearly lost control of Congress in the 1998 elections for
this very reason, the GOP leadership team is now adopting the same
stance in preparation for the 2000 elections. They're not just
fighting the last war. They're repeating it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider four issues of great importance to the electorate:
Medicare, Social Security, war in Yugoslavia, and cultural
violence. On all of them, the GOP congressional leadership has
either abjectly surrendered or maintained the political equivalent
of strict radio silence.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare cop-out was appalling. In 1998, President Clinton
appointed Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, to head up a
bipartisan commission on Medicare reform. Breaux took the work
seriously and developed a plan that was endorsed by every
Republican member of the commission, the Democratic Leadership
Conference, and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Kerrey's previous
work on entitlement reform lent his endorsement special weight.
</P>
<P>
   There was general agreement that the Breaux Commission report
provided a good framework within which to negotiate actual,
passable legislation. President Clinton, though, had other ideas.
Panicked by the notion that his party might lose one of its most
reliable ``wedge'' issues to bipartisan consensus, he disowned the
commission's report even before it was released.
</P>
<P>
   This presented the GOP congressional leadership with a rare
opportunity to ride to Medicare's rescue. The commission report
offered strong political cover, and both Breaux and Kerrey were
ready to make a deal. Instead, the GOP congressional leaders
disowned the issue almost as quickly as Clinton did, saying
(pathetically) they feared it would be used against them in the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bad as the Medicare cop-out was, it paled in comparison to the
Republican leadership's cave-in on Social Security Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is an issue that looms larger with each
election, as the baby boom nears retirement age. Everyone knows
that the system will go bust unless something is done to fix it.
The sooner reform is enacted into law, the less painful the
necessary adjustments will be. And real reform should and will
require some measure of privatization, which would allow people to
exercise greater control over their own retirement planning.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was an issue that ``fit'' responsible Republican
leadership, this was it. Too bad. Sunday, Senate majority leader
Trent Lott announced that there would be no Social Security reform
package in 1999 or 2000. GOP polling had vetoed the idea as both
too risky and too difficult. For Republicans who have been critical
of Clinton's poll-driven presidency, this was a grim reminder that
their congressional leadership was hardly any different.
</P>
<P>
   Polling is also driving the GOP leadership's response to the war
in Yugoslavia. Last June, Lott was all over the White House,
demanding that something be done about the humanitarian crisis in
Kosovo. Since the onset of NATO's aerial attacks, however, both
Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert have been struck dumb. The
silence of the GOP leadership is based on polling that suggests
that if things go badly in Kosovo, Clinton (and Gore) will be
blamed. Thus it is the unstated hope of the GOP leadership that
Kosovo end in disaster. That's politics at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, everyone agrees that something must be done about
cultural violence. Here the Republican leadership is afraid of
angering the National Rifle Association, even though roughly
three-quarters of the country agrees with the proposition that gun
ownership should require registration and licensing.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't seem like much to concede, if Republicans have any
real interest in addressing the culture of media violence. But the
truth is that the GOP leadership would like Littleton to fade away
from public consciousness so business as usual can continue.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of GOP leadership on these four critical issues augurs
ill for the coming congressional campaigns. Lacking anything
serious or substantial to say, Republicans will be left to argue
that Democrats would only be worse. That message didn't work in
1998 and nearly cost the GOP its majority status. It won't work in
2000 either.

MOONLIGHTING MUSICIAN FLIRTS WITH DREAM IN `STAR WARS' NOISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANT HILL, Calif. _ A long time ago in a galaxy far, far
away lived a man with a dream. Actually, he lives in Pleasant Hill
on the east side of the San Francisco Bay and the man is real.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not any ordinary man, he's Dan Killoran, the United
Parcel Service guy.
</P>
<P>
   And more than a year ago, he came up with an idea crazy enough
to get most people locked away on one of the moons of Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Killoran, 29, a musician when he's not donning the distinctive
brown suit and delivering packages, decided that he was going to
write a song celebrating ``Star Wars,'' and try to get it done in
time for the mega-grand premiere of the latest epoch from George
Lucas, ``Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace,'' which already
has people camping out in Los Angeles for the May 19 release.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple enough, but Killoran's method has never been used
before _ according to Killoran.
</P>
<P>
   He got the first ``Star Wars'' movie _ even if the new one is a
prequel or whatever _ and ran it from a VCR into his keyboard and
then into his computer, breaking down every sound effect in the
film into a separate sound element, or sample.
</P>
<P>
   Literally thousands of hours and 314 samples later (one saber
duel that lasted 90 seconds on film took two days and 35 samples to
deconstruct) and Killoran has a finished product. No, he didn't use
any actual music from the film, that would have been cheating.
</P>
<P>
   He has one song, 4 1/2 minutes long. That's it. And if you're
thinking he wants to get it to a big record company and try to cash
in big on the ``Star Wars'' craze, you're wrong. He just wants to
get his only CD to George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nuts,'' Killoran insisted, sitting in his modest condo
cramped full of computer monitors, musical instruments and
keyboards. ``I'm not even a `Star Wars' nut _ not as much as a lot
of people, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Killoran has hair nearly down to his waist and a computer geek's
understanding of the Musical Instrument Digital Interface _ or MIDI
_ computer musical program that he used to construct his song. Once
he had the film broken down into sound bites, his work was only
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to listen to all of what I had and categorize them as
either percussion, tone or vocals,'' he explained with remarkable
patience, which probably isn't surprising. ``And then if something
was percussion, for instance, I had to decide if it sounded more
like a snare drum, or a tom-tom or a bass. Then I had to group the
sounds together, so I knew what I had to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   For a guy who claims not to be a ``Star Wars'' freak, Killoran
has a remarkable knowledge of this particular movie. He'll play one
of his samples, which sounds like nothing in particular to the
uninitiated ear except for maybe the sound of a spoon hitting a
soup pan, and declare that this is the part where C3PO fell over on
his back. Which to him sounds like a snare drum, which he can then
loop through the record and create part of an ongoing drum beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do admit that when I was just about finished, I went over to
my friend's house and they had one of those `Star Wars' Trivial
Pursuit Games,'' he said. ``And I thought I was just going to kick
a__. I mean, I was ready to play for big money, that's how
confident I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what? I don't think I got a single question I
could answer. Those people just ate me up,'' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   But what motivated Killoran?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something no one had ever done before,'' he
said. ``And as far as I know, no one had ever done this before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose `Star Wars' because I really liked it as a kid and
because when it came out it just totally blew everything else
away,'' Killoran continued. ``No one had ever seen anything like it
and I figured that would be a perfect movie to use to try this new
idea I had.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Killoran, a former disc jockey, has had friends in the radio
business who have begged him to let them play his song on the
radio. And truth be told, it has enough of a catchy beat and
interesting loops and movie dialogue to likely go toward the top of
the dance charts. But Killoran is nobody's fool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how many lawyers George Lucas must have?,'' he
laughed, eyes agog. ``The copyright laws would just kill me, I'd
never own another computer or keyboard again. I'd be toast.''
</P>
<P>
   But Killoran does hope that somehow, somewhere, he'll be able to
present Lucas with his labor of love. and after that, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, I like my job at UPS, but imagine if I
could get a job doing songs like this for other movies? Imagine
getting paid for doing something I love.''

BOMBS FOR BELGRADE, BOMBAST FROM WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS lede and byline to add dropped words; pickup 2ndgraf:
Don't presidents)  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If anyone were watching the debate over Serbia
on C-SPAN, it probably came as a surprise that the power to declare
war is reserved for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Don't presidents have the right to bomb any country that
displeases them? Recently we've only seen Congress declare war on
the president. For decades, Congress has stood by while presidents
blew up things around the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House of Representatives stood up for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, our courageous members of Congress stood up halfway,
stooping to please, kneeling to pray or crouching to keep their
heads low.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to pass a proposal to declare war. It was sponsored
by Rep. Tom Campbell, a California Republican whose constituents
declared war on him for voting to impeach President Clinton. He
probably wants to go out on a high-minded note.
</P>
<P>
   They voted to make the president seek their approval before
sending infantry into the mud of Kosovo. Members of Congress are
experts in mud. Flinging it.
</P>
<P>
   They tied, 213-213, on what was meant to be a symbolic vote
supporting Clinton's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean? Congress seems to like its wars
undeclared, without ground troops and deadlocked in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the way Clinton likes his wars, too, so what's
the fuss?
</P>
<P>
   The measure that passed, sponsored by Republicans with lots of
Democrats voting for it, would require Clinton to get congressional
approval to send ``ground elements'' to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress debated what ground elements means, the Pentagon
was ordering more air elements to the war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A tie goes to the runner, and Clinton is on the run. He
maintained his traditional power to declare air war.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on movies or video games, but Americans act like air
wars aren't really wars. Maybe this is because we've never had an
air war waged against our cities.
</P>
<P>
   It was amazing to listen to the squawking of Democratic hawks
and Republican doves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing for peace is wrong and it's not working,'' said Rep.
Doug Bereuter, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to cut and run,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos of
California, echoing the words of his fellow Democrat Lyndon
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked Congress to ``speak with a single voice'' so he
can demonstrate unity in the face of atrocities by Serbian leader
Slobodan Milosevic. Congress didn't speak with a single voice, and
in a way represented the American people better than it usually
does.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the war in Serbia, America is a barnyard of
hawks, doves, chickens and those who merely want to duck.
</P>
<P>
   Those birds do not flock together along party lines. For a year
everyone has called for bipartisanship, and we finally got it _ a
bipartisan ship of fools.
</P>
<P>
   I'm starting to feel for Clinton. He underestimated Milosevic,
thinking a few cruise missiles would cow the guy. He didn't
anticipate Milosevic would swamp his neighbors with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thought bombing would be enough. And since bombing is a
de facto power of the presidency, he wouldn't have to go to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, his war with Congress isn't over any more than his
war with Milosevic. We have a weakened president, and maybe that's
good in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson had been weak in 1964, maybe he wouldn't have been
able to get Congress to go along with the Gulf of Tonkin
resolution, authorizing presidential power to launch military
actions in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, we have all those Albanian refugees and we
owe them something.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to speak with one voice. There are always a bunch
chattering inside our consciences and our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   We don't want to see refugees raped, killed and run out of their
homes into filthy camps. We also don't want to see American troops
trudge through the mud and die in Kosovo, a place most of us never
heard of a couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us don't like the idea of shooting guided missiles at
the home of the president of a country we haven't declared war on.
</P>
<P>
   But if they'd have found him at home, we probably wouldn't have
minded.
</P>
<P>
   Our president declared air war, which many Americans believe is
within his powers. But winning wars with aircraft alone is not
within anyone's power.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are, stuck 10,000 feet over the quagmire with our
precision weapons that have a disturbing way of becoming imprecise
right into villages and refugee convoys. The results don't look
like the Pentagon video games seen at press briefings.
</P>
<P>
   Our elected representatives are hard at work, though. Congress
has urged Clinton to meet with entertainment industry leaders to
curb media violence.
</P>
<P>
   I have a feeling, though, that we'll be seeing videotapes
showing bombs hitting buildings in Belgrade for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Keep declaring it isn't a war, and hope for the best. That seems
to be what both Clinton and Congress are doing.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to declare war on ``The Matrix'' and ``Doom.''

ON TROOPS, MCCAIN OFTEN A TOUGH SELL 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential
candidate from Arizona, for weeks has generated positive publicity
by outlining a clear policy on the Kosovo crisis, calling for
immediate preparation for a possible ground war. Wednesday, McCain
urged fellow Republicans to pass his resolution approving ``all
necessary force'' to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain is described as a defense hawk, a review of his
record since the former prisoner of war in Vietnam was first
elected to Congress in 1982 shows he frequently opposed military
interventions by both Democratic and Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, McCain objected to the use of US forces in Lebanon,
Somalia, and Haiti. Most significantly, McCain originally opposed
US intervention in the 1994 crisis in Bosnia. But McCain changed
his mind the following year and co-authored a resolution that
backed US peace-keeping troops on the ground. McCain did support
the use of force in Grenada and the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's stances on military intervention shows a complex and
contradictory record, much of it based on a world view developed
when he was a POW for five years, that is sometimes at odds with
his own party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's view is that if US interests compel intervention,
adequate military force must be deployed to ensure a swift victory,
something that many say did not happen during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has been a thorn in the side of both Democratic and
Republican administrations,'' said Chris Hellman, senior analyst
for the independent Center for Defense Information. ``Because of
his personal history, he has a lot of credibility on national
security issues, and as an individual he is not afraid to take on
the powers that be when he believes that our national security is
being done in an improper way, be it deployment or misallocation of
funds. That makes him both a loved and a hated man.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain denies he has taken a hawkish position on Kosovo for
political gain and is unsure whether it will help or hurt his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know and I don't care,'' McCain said. ``If I were to
somehow be guided by my political ambitions, then I would be guilty
of all the things I really did dislike in previous leaders.'' He
said he was referring to the way President Lyndon Johnson initially
played down US involvement in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after McCain was elected to the US House in 1982, he was
pressured to support a request from President Reagan to deploy US
Marines to Beirut. But the freshman Republican bucked his party,
saying he saw nothing for the Marines to do there except hunker
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not see a convergence of US interest and values,''
McCain said, citing his two conditions for military involvement.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's view seemed prescient when 241 people were killed at
the Marine barracks in Beirut by a suicide bomber in October 1983,
prompting a US pullout.
</P>
<P>
   But two days after the bombing, when Reagan authorized the
invasion of Grenada, McCain backed the intervention because of
concerns that the tiny Caribbean island had become a Soviet
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not, however, approve of Clinton's decision to send
troops to Haiti in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Haiti, as deplorable as it is, as distasteful
and odious as those people who are running that country are, is not
worth the sacrifice of any American lives,'' McCain said before
Clinton ordered troops there.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he still believes it was not worth going into Haiti,
saying that ``arguably Haiti now is as bad or worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   When a US mission to relieve starvation in Somalia in 1993
turned into a military effort to track down a warlord, McCain
wanted US troops out of the African nation as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did support the Gulf War in 1991. But three years later,
when Clinton was trying to get backing for military involvement in
Bosnia, McCain at first was against it.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, 1994, when McCain learned that NATO planes were
getting ready to conduct airstrikes in Bosnia, he went to the
Senate floor and said: ``I have long opposed this action. I am very
concerned about the ultimate outcome of the use of air power
without a full commitment of the US forces because I do not believe
it is a viable military option.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he changed his mind when the Serb leaders in
Bosnia laid siege to Srebrenica, feeling that only US military
pressure would bring peace.
</P>
<P>
   By December 1995, McCain was in a quandary. He was helping run
the presidential campaign of Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas
Republican who adamantly opposed putting US forces in Bosnia. But
McCain decided he agreed with Gramm's opponent, Senate majority
leader Bob Dole, who supported the Clinton administration's
proposal for peacekeeping forces in the region. Much to Gramm's
dismay, McCain co-sponsored a resolution with Dole that called for
US ground forces to keep the peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain emphasized that he warned in December 1995 that Clinton's
promise to bring the troops home within a year would never be
fulfilled. Today, 6,400 US troops remain in Bosnia, down from the
original contingent of 20,000. A Pentagon spokesman said there is
no timetable for reducing the remaining force.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said ``it was disingenuous'' for Clinton to say in 1995
that the troops would come home in a year, just as it is for
Clinton to now say no ground troops are necessary in Kosovo. That
prompted McCain to introduce his resolution allowing all necessary
force, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator did not originally call for military intervention in
Kosovo. But when he examined the initial airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, he concluded there was no way NATO could oust Serbian
forces in Kosovo without a credible threat of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   McCain stated that he fully supports the NATO effort in Kosovo.
Even if Clinton had not ordered the airstrikes, public reaction to
the refugee crisis eventually would have prompted such action, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that if there had been several hundred
thousand refugees in Kosovo and we had declared we would do
nothing, I'm not sure you hold to that position,'' McCain said.
``It does destabilize the region.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The teach-in, that seething caldron of antiwar
sentiment during the Vietnam years, is back. Only this time it's
``agenda-free.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts at Boston Wednesday staged a
campuswide teach-in on the Kosovo war, echoing the Vietnam protests
of yore. During the '60s, teach-ins were full of venom and passion,
all-night rhetorical marathons crammed with students and faculty
honing their antiwar stances to knife edges.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by the responses of students Wednesday, the Kosovo
war is murkier and more abstract than Vietnam ever was, and US
involvement is far more difficult to condemn.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 200 students and faculty members who filled the
Herbert Lipke Auditorium Wednesday were not, for the most part,
there to oppose US military action in Kosovo. Nor were they looking
for holes in the official version of events there. They were still
deciding on their positions, searching for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learn about Kosovo in an agenda-free atmosphere,'' proclaimed
the posters for the teach-in.
</P>
<P>
   According to organizers, there's a lot more tolerance and
empathy now than there was in the Age of Aquarius.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be as objective as possible,'' said UMass
student Amy George, a member of the philosophy club who helped
organize the event.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students weren't born until well after the last
soldier was drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term `teach-in' might be a good draw for the professors,
but I don't know if it means anything to students these days,''
said senior Daniel Rausch. ``That's why we put the word
`informational' before it.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophy professor Nelson Lande, who chaired the event, was at
a Vietnam teach-in at the University of Michigan during the '60s.
He described himself as a ``tentative hawk'' on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Though many observers have drawn comparisons between Kosovo and
Vietnam, arguing that a lack of clarity of US aims, its heavy
reliance on a bombing campaign, and the absence of a clear exit
strategy all mimic the early stages of Vietnam, Lande said the
parallels have been overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Vietnam, it didn't matter which side you were on; you
were quite confident you knew who the good guys were and who the
bad guys were,'' he said. ``In Kosovo, it's not entirely clear in
which direction the moral compass is pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   There were few unconflicted doves among the students who
attended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks ago, I thought we should be in there
fighting, but now I'm not so sure,'' said George. ``What gives us
the right? Then again, it's not right to tear people from their
homeland because of religous discrepancies. That's wrong, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think NATO is doing enough,'' added Hassan Mohamud, a
sophomore. ``They're bombing cities and destroying infrastructure,
but they're not engaging with the army.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The US forces should be there in some capacity,'' said student
Louis Spagnola, 40. ``Slobodan Milosevic can't just do (whatever he
wants). Something has to be done. Bribe him, bomb him, do whatever
you've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite his certainty that Milosevic should be brought to
justice, Spagnola said he is convinced the official version of
events in Kosovo is not complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a different perspective,'' he said. ``I wanted to
hear it from people who had nothing to hide. There's a lot of
spin-doctor propaganda on the television.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other echoes of the original teach-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't accept the stated premise that the purpose
of this war is to do something about the Kosovo refugees,'' said
Paul Atwood, 52, a professor in the American studies department,
and part of the William Joiner Center for the Study of War and
Social Consequences. ``That's just a smokescreen.''
</P>
<P>
   If the US were serious about aiding refugees, they would have
done more for the Kurds, or the East Timorese, Atwood argued.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood stood outside the auditorium, handing out fliers for a
talk on Kosovo next week by Noam Chomsky, the legendary leftist
cultural critic who made his name during the Vietnam era.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected the students, so measured now, to grow
angrier and more cynical soon enough. They aren't yet radicalized
because, in the absence of US deaths, and the draft, the war in
Kosovo hasn't really touched them yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying a price in Vietnam made people look with more open eyes
at what really was the root of the problem,'' he said. ``As long as
we're not paying a price right now, people can cling to their
delusions.''

BEAUTIFUL `THREE SEASONS' A FIRST FOR DIRECTOR, VIETNAM 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Three Seasons'' arrives with at least three
impressive pedigrees. It's the first film that's ever won both the
top jury prize and the audience prize at the Sundance Film
Festival. It's the first American production filmed in Vietnam (and
in, mostly, Vietnamese). And it's a lyrically beautiful, first
feature effort from its 26-year-old, Saigon-born, Sunnyvale-raised
writer-director, Tony Bui.
</P>
<P>
   All pretty impressive, as are Bui's unmistakable talents for
handling actors (both Vietnamese and American) and illuminating
telling cultural insights. The film is set in and around
contemporary Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), a place coming to
bustling commercial life after decades of war and communist
oppression but, even in revival, rapidly losing its traditions. Bui
has a good grasp of how those tensions affect the lives of those
who are not necessarily a part of them but caught up in them just
the same.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, little that's original in the film's
characterizations and story lines. Bui is going for the kind of
profound simplicity that has been the hallmark of great Asian
filmmakers, from Japan's Yasujiro Ozu to China's Zhang Yimou, but
his narrative skills have yet to mature to a point where he can get
very far beyond the merely obvious. ``Three Seasons'' unfolds with
a certain delicacy and conviction that prevents it from ever
seeming egregiously trite. But it never adds up to much that
resonates distinctively.
</P>
<P>
   Four story lines unfold here, intersecting tangentially as they
pad deliberately along. The most interesting one involves a young
woman from the provinces, Kien An (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep), who comes to
work at the lakeside estate of a mysterious, reclusive master,
Teacher Dao (Tran Manh Cuong). Her job is to pick lotus flowers
from the muddy water, then sell them in the nearby city. But she
soon learns the truth about her depressed boss and offers him an
indispensable service.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the former Saigon, Hai (Don Duong) barely ekes out
a living driving a cyclo, a kind of bicycle-powered rickshaw. He
becomes obsessed with the impudent prostitute Lan (Zoe Bui, no
relation to the director) he pedals to and from jobs in the fancy,
modern hotels that may as well be part of another dimension. In
order to afford a night with his beloved, Hai enters a cyclo race,
which may be one of the slowest races ever filmed but nevertheless
looks pretty grueling.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Keitel's ex-GI also wanders around the city, searching
for the daughter he left behind at the end of the war. Young Nguyen
Huu Duoc completes the picture as Woody, one of those plucky
urchins that seem to be a required commodity in every foreign film
these days. The orphan boy spends most of the movie searching,
``Bicycle Thief''-like, for a stolen briefcase of cheap trinkets
that represents his only hope of survival.
</P>
<P>
   All of these stories go in the sentimental directions you'd
expect. But there are occasional, fascinating side trips into
ethno-cultural territory. I have no idea what the seemingly painful
thing is that Hai does to Lan's back, but she likes it, and it
makes for one hypnotically sensual scene.
</P>
<P>
   Generally though, these are pretty elementary tales of rescue,
reconciliation and redemption. All done up, however, with a visual
gorgeousness that somehow meshes with a realistic depiction of
serious poverty. The director of photography is Lisa Rinzler, and
as she demonstrated with the American inner-city dramas ``Menace II
Society'' and ``Dead Presidents,'' she can effectively find formal
beauty anywhere, in a tumbledown railroad shack or an idyllic grove
of crimson-leafed trees.
</P>
<P>
   She often helps ``Three Seasons'' rise above the murk of
predictability and at least look like a flowering lotus ... like
something sublime.

MAMET'S `WINSLOW BOY' OVERSTARCHED 
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David Mamet has opened up Terence Rattigan's 1946
drawing room play ``The Winslow Boy'' for the screen, but he hasn't
done a very smart job of it. We still get major plot points _
including the climactic one _ reported back to the main house set
rather than dramatized on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some of the other locations adapter-director Mamet
chooses to show us _ an honor guard barracks, a suffragette office
_ seem like unnecessary wastes of what was obviously a limited
budget. Why not more courtroom footage for what is, among other
things, a legal drama? Why not a fascinating gauntlet of the
Edwardian equivalent of paparazzi, who we're told are laying siege
to the Winslow home but barely glimpse?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is, ``The Winslow Boy'' is still more like a
filmed play than an organically unfolding movie.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an actual, pre-World War I incident _ names were
changed, perhaps to protect the very easily upset _ the play
chronicles an apparently controversial incident in which a young
British naval cadet was accused of stealing a classmate's
five-shilling postal note. Expelled for the unthinkable act (the
fact that times have violently changed doesn't help a modern
audience appreciate the fine moral issues at stake here),
13-year-old Ronnie Winslow (Guy Edwards) returns in shame to his
banker father's modest yet comfortable home.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Arthur (Nigel Hawthorne), mum Grace (Gemma Jones) and
betrothed sister Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon, aka Mrs. Mamet)
Winslow all believe Ronnie's assertion that he did not commit the
crime. Jump ahead a few months, and Arthur's turned the case into a
very public cause celebre, generating rallies, cartoons, popular
songs and knickknacks in support of both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Due to complicated aspects of British law that are explained ...
and explained ... throughout the show, the Winslows must turn to
the star barrister of the era, Sir Robert Morton (Jeremy Northam),
just to get the consarned argument out of the House of Commons
(which we see) and into the courthouse (which we barely see), where
it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the royal legalizing is an intelligent examination of
family honor, loyalty and the price paid _ both socially and
psychologically _ to secure their satisfaction. Catherine's
nuptials are jeopardized by the scandal, as are the Winslows'
financial fortunes. And in a near-great performance, Hawthorne
(``The Madness of King George'') ages Arthur at an accelerated rate
through the trying proceedings while making the man question every
motive he could possess, except for his devotion to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the kid could be lying about the whole thing. Many
have wondered why Mamet, whose own plays (``Glengarry Glen Ross,''
``Speed-the-Plow'') wallow in verbal and spiritual degradation,
would be interested in Rattigan's ultra-polite work. But there are
various degrees of deception and gamesmanship operating in ``The
Winslow Boy,'' certainly not to the depth and extent that they run
through Mamet's tricky original work, but enough to make the
playwright's interest understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Understandable, but not necessarily infectious. There's a
starched quality to the movie that comes from numerous sources, not
the least of which is Mamet's own, somewhat hidebound way with a
movie camera. He's written fine adaptations of others' plays before
_ check out his Chekhov, wondrously preserved in Louis Malle's film
``Vanya on 42nd Street.'' But ``The Winslow Boy'' could have
benefited from a different hand at the helm.

 &HT;    Interior designer Bill Stewart assembles a shrine to postwar

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bill Stewart is like a kid on Christmas morning,
darting about showing visitors his favorite toys.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in his trademark black high-top sneakers, the Atlanta
interior designer cranks up one of his 100 robots, and his eyes
twinkle with a nostalgic fascination for all things '50s. For
Stewart, the mechanized gadgets represent an innocent age, when
artists, designers and inventors threw convention to the wind and
experimented with ideas that foreshadowed the future.
</P>
<P>
   They were ideas ahead of their time, like the 1960s Pulsar
watches he collects. ``There's something quirky about having a
calculator on your wrist _ it's so James Bond,'' Stewart says,
pointing to one of his favorites timepieces. ``Things like this
force you to look back at how far we've come.''

   For Stewart, collecting furnishings designed in the middle of
the 20th century is more than a hobby; his passion for plucking the
best of the postwar period is a lifestyle _ one for which he's
found a perfect backdrop in his 1951 modernist house in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   There Stewart is free to experiment with a style that is a time
warp removed from the traditional homes he designs for clients. ``I
choose to live this lifestyle because none of my clients do,'' says
the 44-year-old designer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the house isn't an attempt to re-create the past. It's a
shrine for emphasizing its highlights at a time when, as a new
century nears, retro influences are stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a reproduction of a home in the '50s. This is my
interpretation, a '90s fantasy, of another period,'' the designer
says of his Tuxedo Park home, believed to be the area's first
modern house. ``The diagnosis is the same; the treatment is what's
different.''
</P>
<P>
   But as serious as he is about his collection _ he spent years
researching modern design and talking to antiques dealers before
selecting pieces that were desirable and affordable _ Stewart knows
how to have fun with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to take design so seriously,'' he says, holding up
kitschy condiment jars with Smiley Fruit heads in his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida native, Stewart first fell in love with design as a
teenager while attending boarding school in Rome (Ga.). ``We took
field indows cast light on this classic home considered avant-garde
in its day, the kind inspired by legendary architect Frank Lloyd
Wright, who designed homes to blend with their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very Californian in that it was meant to be enjoyed
both inside and out. The pool was 10 feet from the house, it had a
landscaped garden lit at night and sliding glass doors with
screens,'' Stewart says. ``I suddenly realized this wasn't about
buying a house but buying a lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart made no exterior changes to the house, other than adding
crab orchard stone walkways to match the back yard's retaining
walls.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, his only renovations were to the kitchen and bathrooms,
where Stewart maintained the '50s look with multicolored tile
patterns he designed himself. The pastel shades of vintage china
from the '30s and '40s in green, salmon and yellow formed his
inspiration for wall colors.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fun began. The designer set out to create an interior
which, while not cozy with overstuffed sofas and chairs, is
comfortable for lounging.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart relishes the art of mixing old and new 20th century _
chairs by Frank Lloyd Wright, and Charles and Ray Eames, a
bookshelf and dining room furniture by Jean Prouve, china by
Russell Wright and lamps by Serge Mouille, with a 1992 chaise by
Ralph Lauren thrown in to keep things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces are used judiciously throughout the house. ``My
biggest fear is that I will want to fill the house with the
collection,'' says Stewart, who maintains a New York apartment for
shopping and gallery hopping. ``I want to keep some sense of
minimalism from the period.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the possibility of discovering a new passion
that would take him in a whole different direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot to go out on a limb, and I'm too immersed in
this to think about that,'' he says. ``This time I've kind of found
my bride and think I'll keep her.''

BABY BOOMER HEADS THE BOOM IN `CLASSIC' TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Next time you find little Johnny watching too
much television and you're about to snatch the remote away and
begin your patented Parental Lecture About the Great Outdoors,
think again.
</P>
<P>
   That kid could be in training to run a TV network.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for Larry Jones, 38, who spent a good deal of his
youth logging some serious TV time and now he's all grown up and is
the general manager of Nick At Nite and TV Land. That's akin to
liking soda pop and growing up to run Coca-Cola. Nick At Nite
redefined ``classic'' television and the popular TV Land spun off
from there, going on to become a 24-hour home to some of TV's
greatest shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a lot of TV as a kid,'' Jones says. His parents
never discouraged him from his pursuit _ as long as he got his
homework done (you don't become a general manager by flunking). In
fact, his whole house was TV friendly. ``None of my friends had a
TV set in their rooms,'' Jones says.
</P>
<P>
   But he did _ at age 8. So did his siblings. And his parents.
There were five TV sets in the house then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, all those years of watching TV paid off,'' Jones
says.
</P>
<P>
   He is the perfect man to be running a channel called TV Land,
which, in the spirit of Nick At Nite, bows to and cashes in on
nostalgia. Jones was born for this job. Even now, he says, his mom
has eight television sets in a four-bedroom house. ``You turn the
light on, and the TV goes on,'' Jones says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely, then, that Jones harbors the kind of
TV-is-the-enemy belief that some parents do. He has two kids. ``My
6-year-old watches a lot of TV,'' he says. ``Obviously they watch a
lot of Nickelodeon.''
</P>
<P>
   His son also supports the ever-increasing domination of the
3-year-old TV Land. ``My son's favorite show is `Emergency.' He
says, `Why can't you put `Emergency' on one hour later so I can see
it when I get off the bus?'''
</P>
<P>
   TV Land was spun off of Nick At Nite because the channel was
filled mostly with kids and teen fare _ all very popular _ and when
the channel transformed into Nick At Nite in the evening, there
were only about nine hours to program.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Nick At Nite only aired sitcoms. TV Land has everything
from Westerns to cop shows and comedies, dramas and specialty
shows. The titles are a testament to fond memories, fun times and a
good deal of quality: ``Dragnet,'' ``Family Affair,'' ``Leave It to
Beaver,'' ``Petticoat Junction,'' ``My Three Sons,'' ``Kojak,''
``Gunsmoke,'' ``Hill Street Blues,'' ``St. Elsewhere'' and a litany
of other chestnuts, some obvious classics, others that only aired a
season or two. TV Land has a vault of 23,000 hours of shows, and it
is growing. ``It gives us a lot more depth and more options for the
hardcore baby boomer.''
</P>
<P>
   While all kinds of people tune in _ some are seeing these shows
for the first time ever _ the target audience is 25-54, ``the first
generation that really grew up on TV,'' as Jones says. ``So many of
these shows define a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Back when Nick At Nite began to take off, based largely on
people rediscovering ``classic'' TV, Jones and others at the
channel had a wish list they could barely tap into because of the
limited time. Now they've gone out and pursued nearly every
available favorite. ``There've been shows we've had on the list for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently the channel got ``All in the Family,'' a particular
favorite of Jones. ``We're pretty selective about shows we pick
up,'' he says. ``We want shows that defined that generation. We're
superserving that audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea has taken off. Nick At Nite continues to increase even
with limited hours for nostalgia, but on its third birthday TV Land
is celebrating a recent upswing in prime-time ratings as well.
Jones says, ``We've clearly hit a chord with our audience.''

COMPLEX ARTIST EXPLORED WITH SIMPLICITY, HUMOR 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Manuel Ocampo: God Is My Copilot'' sure leaves
you wanting to know more about the Philippine-born, formerly
L.A.-based artist. One of the most distinctive stylists to come out
of the city's multicultural art scene, Ocampo has produced
confrontational paintings that expertly mix traditional religious
iconography with ghastly images of hatred, oppression and
degradation.
</P>
<P>
   A little in-depth examination of all that rich symbolism would
have been nice, but director Phillip Rodriguez takes a different
approach. In what becomes a conscious parody of art-world babble,
he gets a number of dealers, critics and collectors (including
actor Dennis Hopper) to make only the most superficial observations
about supercharged, complex work.
</P>
<P>
   Ocampo is expressing his people's colonized displacement, one
says. He hates the commercial crudity of the gallery business,
another proposes. Those swastikas are a comment upon, not an
endorsement of, anti-Semitism, a third assures us.
</P>
<P>
   Ocampo himself is something of a walking self-satire, decked out
in backward beret and goatee. He mutters about his paintings being
a way of creating dialogue but can't articulate what the discussion
should be about. Even funnier, he expresses impatience with being
categorized as an ethnic artist while actively exploiting the
identity art movement for all its worth.
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, Ocampo admits that he's very much in it for the
money _ refreshing because it's not just a cynical stance, as his
work's distinctiveness and terrible beauty hardly seems to have
been compromised by success. You get the same, upfront feeling when
his wife/manager confesses that she gets embarrassed when her
mother comes over and sees some of the freakier pictures, and when
Ocampo's own, well-spoken mom cheerfully punctures his rebel artist
stance.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his early 30s and living in Spain, Ocampo is moving
toward cartoony sketching _ a development his collectors find more
upsetting than his depictions of rampaging skeletons and rat
orgies.
</P>
<P>
   Are they clueless? Is he? ``God Is My Copilot'' isn't deep
enough to know. But it's smart enough to smirk when the situation
calls for it.

   SCI-MARS-TECTONICS (Undated) _ The Mars Global Surveyor has
detected bar-codelike magnetic stripes on Mars, indicating that the
planet may have once maintained an active plate tectonics system.
On Earth such stripes are thought to be caused by the spreading of
new sea floor in which iron-bearing minerals ``freeze'' in the
direction of the prevailing magnetic field, which reverses from
North to South and back again every 10,000 years or so. The results
suggest that, like Earth, Mars has been shaped in the past by the
spreading and colliding of such tectonic plates, pieces of crust
floating on a hot mantle, and that the planet's magnetic field is
also subject to reversal. On Mars the stripes are wider however,
suggesting either that the sea floor spread more rapidly or the
that magnetic field switched directions less frequently than on
Earth. By John Noble Wilford. (1000 words)

remain muted. The ECI rose 0.7% in the fourth quarter. Year to

 UNDATED: ... East Coast cognoscenti.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   53. Ralph Nader writes ``Unsafe at Any Speed,'' paying
particular attention to the Corvair, and accuses the auto industry
of ignoring passenger safety. Congress listens.
</P>
<P>
   54. Pony Cars hit the streets and their names are Cougar,
Mustang, Camaro, and Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   55. The government requires shoulder belts, in addition to seat
belts.
</P>
<P>
   56. The Dodge Charger is introduced in 1966. A fastback with a
426-cubic-inch wedgehead V-8, it is the rumblin' suis generis
muscle car. Slap a hemi on it and it would wail.
</P>
<P>
   57. George Maharis and Martin Milner cross America on the
television show ``Route 66.'' If Seinfeld had owned a 'Vette, this
would have been his show about aimless wandering.
</P>
<P>
   58. Chevrolet introduces the Blazer. In the future, it will be
more politically correct than its big stablemate, the Subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   59. Arlo Guthrie narrates in ``Alice's Restaurant'':
</P>
<P>
   So we took a half-ton of garbage and put it in the back of a
red, VW microbus. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And the counterculture, flowered up and riding in the ultimate
counterculture vehicle, went out to meet The Man, in the person of
Officer Obie.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
1970-79:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   60. ``American Graffiti,'' a fine car movie featuring a high
school Class of '62, lights American movie screens. Before Kennedy
is killed, before we know what is happening in Vietnam, a
generation cruises: Richard Dreyfuss, scholar-in-waiting, in his
VW; Paul LeMat in his yellow hot rod going head-to-head with
Harrison Ford in a black and evil machine; Suzanne Somers, blonde,
pale and ethereal in a white and innocent Thunderbird. All to the
intonations of Wolfman Jack. Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   61. The 1973 fuel crunch. Lower speed limits, minimum gas
mileage rules come next.
</P>
<P>
   62. Ford builds the Pinto, a rolling, explosive can of gas.
</P>
<P>
   63. The Toyota Land Cruiser, the short box, not today's long
Yuppiemobile, goes off road in America.
</P>
<P>
   64. There is great mystique about the Volvo among the
counterculture. But since most of its members don't have to be
anywhere on time, it's like, you know, OK, if it doesn't run very
often. Meanwhile, those who do want to get somewhere on time
discover that those Slant-6 Darts and Valiants won't ever let them
down.
</P>
<P>
   65. In 1976, ABC televises the closing laps of the Daytona 500.
Richard Petty and David Pearson tangle on the last lap. Pearson's
crumpled car limps to the finish line as Petty's smokes in the
background. America watches. Here comes NASCAR fever.
</P>

   66. Bruce Springsteen, in affirmation of the open road and
working-class freedom sings:
</P>
<P>
   Roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair.

   The night's busted open, these two lanes will take us anywhere.

1980-1989: &QL;

   67. Freedom gets passed by greed and ostentation. Saab and BMW
become the auto of the lucky monied. Singer Bill Morrissey would
reflect on this trend:
</P>
<P>
   I make a lot of money in my hi-tech job.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, sure, you bet, I drive a turbo Saab.
</P>
<P>
   And:
</P>
<P>
   My BMW draws applause.
</P>
<P>
   I am not bound by traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
   68. Subaru offers a small, 4WD station wagon. It rusts, it eats
tim-ing belts, but it hints of SUVs tocome.
</P>
<P>
   69. Toyota introduces the 4-Runner.
</P>
<P>
   70. Japan agrees to import limits.

   74. The convertible, once virtually extinct, makes a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   75. GM forms a new company called Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   76. Goodbye to the inflatable spare tire. Welcome the hard
little rubber doughnut.
</P>

   78. Mazda debuts the Miata _ sporty, convertible, and cheap. It
brings back the roadster.
</P>
<P>
   79. Ford launches the Taurus-Sable line.
</P>
<P>
   80. Weld-through, zinc-chromate priming is introduced. Boring?
Too technical? It's why cars don't rust like they used to.
</P>
<P>
   81. Freon is out for air conditioning; environmentally friendly
substances replace it.
</P>
<P>
   82. AMC gives us the Pacer _ ugliest car ever built, but what
would you expect from a company that once took over Harley-Davidson
and almost killed it?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
1990-1999: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   83. Saturn becomes the first new American make in 30 years.
</P>

   84. VW brings back the Beetle; restored Beetles soar in value.
</P>
<P>
   85. Airbags become standard. Unfortunately, no one did the tests
that would have revealed their danger to infants, children, and
small adults.
</P>
<P>
   86. Thunderbird prototype is displayed. Plans to bring it back
are welcomed.

ON TROOPS, MCCAIN OFTEN A TOUGH SELL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential
candidate from Arizona, for weeks has generated positive publicity
by outlining a clear policy on the Kosovo crisis, calling for
immediate preparation for a possible ground war. Wednesday, McCain
urged fellow Republicans to pass his resolution approving ``all
necessary force'' to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain is described as a defense hawk, a review of his
record since the former prisoner of war in Vietnam was first
elected to Congress in 1982 shows he frequently opposed military
interventions by both Democratic and Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, McCain objected to the use of US forces in Lebanon,
Somalia, and Haiti. Most significantly, McCain originally opposed
US intervention in the 1994 crisis in Bosnia. But McCain changed
his mind the following year and co-authored a resolution that
backed US peace-keeping troops on the ground. McCain did support
the use of force in Grenada and the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's stances on military intervention shows a complex and
contradictory record, much of it based on a world view developed
when he was a POW for five years, that is sometimes at odds with
his own party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's view is that if US interests compel intervention,
adequate military force must be deployed to ensure a swift victory,
something that many say did not happen during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has been a thorn in the side of both Democratic and
Republican administrations,'' said Chris Hellman, senior analyst
for the independent Center for Defense Information. ``Because of
his personal history, he has a lot of credibility on national
security issues, and as an individual he is not afraid to take on
the powers that be when he believes that our national security is
being done in an improper way, be it deployment or misallocation of
funds. That makes him both a loved and a hated man.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain denies he has taken a hawkish position on Kosovo for
political gain and is unsure whether it will help or hurt his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know and I don't care,'' McCain said. ``If I were to
somehow be guided by my political ambitions, then I would be guilty
of all the things I really did dislike in previous leaders.'' He
said he was referring to the way President Lyndon Johnson initially
played down US involvement in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after McCain was elected to the US House in 1982, he was
pressured to support a request from President Reagan to deploy US
Marines to Beirut. But the freshman Republican bucked his party,
saying he saw nothing for the Marines to do there except hunker
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not see a convergence of US interest and values,''
McCain said, citing his two conditions for military involvement.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's view seemed prescient when 241 people were killed at
the Marine barracks in Beirut by a suicide bomber in October 1983,
prompting a US pullout.
</P>
<P>
   But two days after the bombing, when Reagan authorized the
invasion of Grenada, McCain backed the intervention because of
concerns that the tiny Caribbean island had become a Soviet
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not, however, approve of Clinton's decision to send
troops to Haiti in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Haiti, as deplorable as it is, as distasteful
and odious as those people who are running that country are, is not
worth the sacrifice of any American lives,'' McCain said before
Clinton ordered troops there.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he still believes it was not worth going into Haiti,
saying that ``arguably Haiti now is as bad or worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   When a US mission to relieve starvation in Somalia in 1993
turned into a military effort to track down a warlord, McCain
wanted US troops out of the African nation as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did support the Gulf War in 1991. But three years later,
when Clinton was trying to get backing for military involvement in
Bosnia, McCain at first was against it.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, 1994, when McCain learned that NATO planes were
getting ready to conduct airstrikes in Bosnia, he went to the
Senate floor and said: ``I have long opposed this action. I am very
concerned about the ultimate outcome of the use of air power
without a full commitment of the US forces because I do not believe
it is a viable military option.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he changed his mind when the Serb leaders in
Bosnia laid siege to Srebrenica, feeling that only US military
pressure would bring peace.
</P>
<P>
   By December 1995, McCain was in a quandary. He was helping run
the presidential campaign of Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas
Republican who adamantly opposed putting US forces in Bosnia. But
McCain decided he agreed with Gramm's opponent, Senate majority
leader Bob Dole, who supported the Clinton administration's
proposal for peacekeeping forces in the region. Much to Gramm's
dismay, McCain co-sponsored a resolution with Dole that called for
US ground forces to keep the peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain emphasized that he warned in December 1995 that Clinton's
promise to bring the troops home within a year would never be
fulfilled. Today, 6,400 US troops remain in Bosnia, down from the
original contingent of 20,000. A Pentagon spokesman said there is
no timetable for reducing the remaining force.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said ``it was disingenuous'' for Clinton to say in 1995
that the troops would come home in a year, just as it is for
Clinton to now say no ground troops are necessary in Kosovo. That
prompted McCain to introduce his resolution allowing all necessary
force, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator did not originally call for military intervention in
Kosovo. But when he examined the initial airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, he concluded there was no way NATO could oust Serbian
forces in Kosovo without a credible threat of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   McCain stated that he fully supports the NATO effort in Kosovo.
Even if Clinton had not ordered the airstrikes, public reaction to
the refugee crisis eventually would have prompted such action, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that if there had been several hundred
thousand refugees in Kosovo and we had declared we would do
nothing, I'm not sure you hold to that position,'' McCain said.
``It does destabilize the region.''

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - Perhaps the oddest thing that the Warren Brothers have
ever heard is that some country stations are ``afraid'' to play
their music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's music, not a nuclear weapon,'' says Brett, lead singer of
the Florida-based duo. ``What are they afraid of? That their
listeners will love it? If they had been afraid of playing Shania
Twain, think of how many million of records wouldn't have been
sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Twain, Brett and his older brother Brad are pushing
Nashville's musical boundaries. But while the poster girl for
washboard abs goes for glittery pop hooks, the Warrens rely on
muscular harmonies, a smattering of pedal steel guitar and a
throbbing backbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Brett describes their sound as ``the Everly Brothers meet Steve
Earle.'' That's not a bad little label: The best stuff on the
brothers' debut, ``Beautiful Day in the Cold Cruel World,''
showcases their gritty songwriting skills and an incandescent vocal
blend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a sibling thing,'' Brett says modestly.
``It's in the genetics. With brothers, the voices are so similar,
but then you get the little differences. When you hear some
families sing together, it can give you goosebumps.''
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the Warrens can do that, although their success has
been limited so far, sadly. Critics write them love letters while
radio programmers seem oddly indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   The singles ``Guilty'' and ``A Better Man'' _ the latter
inspired by Jack Nicholson's ``You make me want to be a better
man'' speech in ``As Good As It Gets'' _ both did well without
cracking the national top 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the cities that play us, we're making waves,'' Brett says.
``We can go in and sell out a 1,500-seat club. But a lot of places
are saying we're not country enough. We're on Country Music
Television, we're signed to a country label (BNA Records) _ how is
that not country?''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the brothers' greatest exposure has been as Faith Hill's
opening act on her current tour. Her crossover sound works well
with the siblings' aggressive stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great,'' Brett says. ``We play for sold-out
audiences, then get to stare at her for 90 minutes. We're the kind
of band that works opening for Faith Hill, and I think we would
work opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd. We're not trying to cross over,
but music is music. I mean, the king of rock and roll is in the
Country Music Hall of Fame and the father of country music is in
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Explain that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Warrens, they're hoping the third time is the charm.
``She Wants to Rock,'' their third single, will head to radio May
17. They're keeping their fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the radio people that are resisting us?'' Brett asks.
``Well, that's just because we're different. But we'll keep
working, because it's the people that ultimately decide. At first
it's just 180 people at radio that decide. But in the end, it's up
to the people. And the people that hear the Warren Brothers, more
of them like us than don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just keeping the faith, man.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A few days ago, many football fans viewed House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran as the man who forced the New England
Patriots into Connecticut's arms, while opponents of using public
money to lure sports teams praised his prudency.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Finneran might be able to enjoy the best of both worlds:
a chance to bask in the glory of putting together a package many
hope will keep the team at home, but without looking as if he caved
on any of his tight fiscal principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt about it,'' said one business leader
involved in the talks that led to the stadium accord. ``Others may
not like to hear it, but Finneran was driving the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were risks,'' Finneran said of his demanding
negotiations with Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, Governor
Paul Cellucci, business leaders, and National Football League
officials. ``And in the end, we got an agreement everyone could
live with, including, I hope, the team. But we did not pay tribute
or ransom, and I think that might be a lesson for other states.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran noted that no state funds would be used to buy land for
the Patriots or to help build the stadium. He also noted that the
final package aimed at keeping the Patriots in Massachusetts
requires them to repay the state for some of the infrastructure
improvements for a new Foxborough stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was a demand business leaders and NFL officials fought,
because infrastructure is considered the responsibility of
government. And during the talks, Finneran compromised and agreed
to lower the price of the demand, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end his principle stood: If the Patriots accept
Massachusetts' offer, they will pay the state up to $1 million a
year to help pay for infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a recognition that for the league, economics are
paramount, and that means TV revenues in this market,'' Finneran
said. ``But there is no burden on any taxpayer in any jurisdiction,
especially in Massachusetts, to step to the plate when in fact
there are abundant revenues generated by this franchise and this
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought our role was appropriately limited to
infrastructure. And this agreement reflects that precisely,''
Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   The final agreement increases the amount of state funding of
infrastructure by up to $20 million from proposals offered last
year in the House and the Senate. The additional funds would be
spent on roadwork, sewer, water, and utility lines that were not
anticipated under Finneran's previous proposal, which would have
renovated Foxboro Stadium rather than build a new one. Because the
original estimates were developed more than 18 months ago, and were
called conservative, lawmakers said inflation and additional
requirements helped raise the price tag for the state's investment.
</P>
<P>
   Some also credit Finneran's intransigence _ and willingness to
play brinksmanship and possibly lose the team _ with encouraging
the NFL to change its rules and allow low-interest loans to owners
building stadiums in the top six media markets. Although some NFL
officials deny it, others note that the restriction specifically
includes the Boston area, which is ranked the sixth largest media
market in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finneran's insistence that no public money go into the stadium
was clearly a force to be reckoned with,'' said advertising
executive Jack Connors, a leader of the drive to keep the Patriots
in Massachusetts. ``And from one perspective, it could be viewed
that Finneran brought the NFL to its knees. But in the end, working
with the governor and Senate president, I think we wound up with an
agreement that can keep the Patriots in Foxborough.''

A LOOK AT THE 100 MAJOR MOMENTS IN AUTO HISTORY

   A car is far more than the sum of its mechanical parts. At the
base of any automobile purchase are utility and faith in its
reliability _ the basis of the lemon law. But that is boring. What
energizes our auto culture, a defined culture as much as are
sports, television, movies, dining or politics, are things far less
tangible.
</P>
<P>
   How does that new car sitting in the driveway make you feel? Did
you purchase daring? Recapture youth? Make a statement? Show the
neighbors how practical you are? Did you buy it for color? Speed?
Size? Manufacturer's aura? Did you first see it in an ad? A movie?
Someone else's driveway?
</P>
<P>
   These emotional responses comprise the culture of the
automobile. And they are what make it so much fun _ and treacherous
_ to attempt to list 100 great moments in the past century of the
auto. Making such a list is like poking a stick into a hornets'
nest, the hornets' nest in this case being the world of auto
aficionados. What about the development of the ball-joint? some
will ask. Or electronic fuel injection? The radial tire? The
buzzing begins. I pick up the stick and poke that nest: Here,
decade by decade but in no order of importance, are my top 100:
</P>

<P>
   13. Mitsubishi Motor Co. builds Japan's first production car.
They call it the Model A _ early industrial theft.

<P>
   14. Detroit installs the first three-color stoplights. Ninety
years later, many drivers in Massachusetts do not know what each
color means.
</P>

<P>
   21. In Camden, N.J., the first drive-in theater opens.

<P>
   22. The Airstream trailer is introduced. The sleek aluminum
homes-on-wheels show us that when it comes to vacation, you can
take it with you.
</P>
<P>
   23. Delco offers the first in-dash car radio.
</P>
<P>
   24. The Ford V-8 wins high praise _ from John Dillinger and

</P>
<P>
   27. In Japan, the Toyoda Loom Works opens an auto division,

later, in Massachusetts, many drivers still do not know what they
are for.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
1940-49:
</P>

   33. On Dec. 14, 1947, Bill France Sr. tells the organizational
NASCAR meeting in Daytona Beach, Fla., ``Stock car racing has got
distinct possibilites for Sunday shows and we do not know how big
it can get if it's handled properly.''
</P>
<P>
   34. That same year, a biker gang takes over the town of
Hollister, Calif. It inspires the Marlon Brando movie ``The Wild
One,'' and is an early instance of horsepower giving identity to
the alienated.
</P>
<P>
   35. The first Volkswagen arrives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
1950-59:

   37. Two brothers from Manchester, N.H., open the first
McDonald's in California.
</P>
<P>
   38. Hemmings Motor News, a bible in the industry, is first
published in Quincy, Ill., in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   39. The 1957 Chevrolet escapes the mammilate-chrome, soda
fountain school of auto design. It may be the best-looking American
car ever.
</P>
<P>
   40. The first Volvos and Toyotas arrive in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   41. 9/30/55: James Dean, driving a Porsche Spyder 550, is killed

Donald Turnupspeed.
</P>
<P>
   42. President Eisenhower launches the $25-billion, 30-year
project known as the Interstate Highway System.
</P>
<P>
   43. Chuck Berry sings:
</P>
<P>
   As I was motivatin' over the hill
</P>
<P>
   I saw Maybellene in a Coupe de Ville
</P>
<P>
   A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
</P>
<P>
   Nothin' will outrun my V-8 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   He's chasing a woman lost. Heartache, betrayal, and love merge
in a 110-m.p.h. auto chase. America is on the road with speed and
horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
1960-69:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   44. The Beach Boys _ just surfing music, right? Wrong. Their car
tunes of the '60s are among the best. I give you:
</P>
<P>
   She's a little deuce coupe with a flathead mill.
</P>
<P>
   But she'll walk a Thunderbird like it's standin' still.
</P>
<P>
   45. And Chuck Berry might have caught Maybellene long before
that hill with the Beach Boys':
</P>
<P>
   Four-speed, dual-quad, positraction 409.
</P>
<P>
   46. All that speed. All that power. The first emission controls
are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   47. Front seatbelts are standard in all American-made cars in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   48. Put those belts in the back seat as well, the government
orders.
</P>
<P>
   49. Ed ``Big Daddy'' Roth moves from sculptor of fine custom
cars to spokesman for a generation of pimple-faced, adolescent
misfits. His models, and the characters who drive them _ Rat Fink,
Drag Nut, Mother's Worry _ become the alter-egos of disaffected
youths who will later be called nerds.
</P>
<P>
   50. Beach Boys again. Fun, Fun, Fun:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, she got her daddy's car and she cruised through the
hamburger stand now . . ..''
</P>
<P>
   But because she was cruisin' a burger joint and and was not at
the library, where she said she was going, daddy took that T-Bird
away.
</P>
<P>
   51. Porsche introduces the 911.
</P>
<P>
   52. Tom Wolfe writes ``The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake
Streamlined Baby'' and Kustom Kars are revealed to the East Coast
cognoscenti.

TURBO BEETLE FAR SURPASSES ITS LEGENDARY ANCESTOR IN POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 1970 and a 12-year-old Volkswagen convertible crawls
across a frozen landscape, 30-odd horses thumping in the rear
engine compartment as the Bug slowly climbs a long hill and traffic
builds up behind.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a college student heading back to campus from Christmas
break is dressed the way you dressed back then to drive a Beetle in
winter: heavy boots with felt liners, long underwear and wool
pants, parka, wool hat pulled down over his ears, mittens.
</P>
<P>
   His right hand is on the steering wheel and his left grips an
ice scraper with which he continuosly scrapes away the frost that
his own breath paints on the windshield inches from his nose.
Volkswagen and heating/defrosting systems were mutually exclusive
terms in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Jump ahead 29 years. A turbocharged, 1999 Beetle is fired up on
a chill, early spring morning. A touch of frost has caked the
windshield and the road out to town starts with a steep climb. In
only a minute, heat pours from vents and the frost disappears. The
Beetle bursts up the hill, its 1.8-liter, turbocharged engine as
silky and quiet as an electric motor even as the transmission is
shifted into fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the highway, the Beetle moves nimbly, bursting ahead
here, changing lanes there, catching many other drivers by surprise
to be passed by a . . . Beetle?
</P>
<P>
   But though its shape _ half an egg with bulbous fenders _ may be
evocative of the Beetles of the days of peace and love, this is not
Sunshine's Beetle. That old Bug, afterall, chugged its way though
the counterculture years. This one has a rear spoiler on the roof
that pops up automatically at 93 miles per hour _ warp speed in
Sunshine's day _ or can be raised with the push of a button at
lower speeds.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1999 turbocharged new Beetle, Volkswagen has reached
back to the past, even while bringing us stealthily into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   They've put the engine up front and put the body on what is
virtually the same platform that sits beneath the Golf or Jetta.
They've kept it so ugly on the outside it's still cute. Inside,
they have maintained the feel of sitting inside a dome, though this
one, with large windows all around, is more like a glass bubble
than a tin egg. It's a look that works; ask any dealer how long the
waiting list is to buy one. And, those lists will only continue to
grow even as the cost of this hot, next generation of new Beetles
hits the $20,000 price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The huge windshield is positioned well away from the driver, out
there on the flats of a dashboard reminiscent of the Toyota Previa
van. In the GLX model tested, the seats are leather and heated, the
steering wheel is wrapped in leather, and six-spoke alloy wheels
make the low-crouching Bug look like it is ready to leap.
</P>
<P>
   The lilac glow of the instrument panels, offset by the red
stripes of needles on gauges, lights the cockpit in a futuristic
glow at night. The basics are right before you in one round panel:
speed, tachometer, fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Two things differ greatly from the old Bug: There is no fuel
tank in front of you, and all that empty space that would crush
like a cheap can in a crash has been filled with engine. Meanwhile,
the spear-like steering column of the old Bugs has been replaced
with a collapsible one. The government crash tested 14 cars in this
class last year and Volkswagen came out on top.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, also, is the distinctive sound of the thumping, air-cooled
VW engine. Have there been more distinctive engine sounds on
America's highways than those of the Harley-Davidson V-Twin and the
Volkswagen?
</P>
<P>
   In handling, the new Beetle is reminiscent of the early Saab
900s, with the distinctive tight steering of front-wheel drive
autos and a snappiness when given gas.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest complaint about the interior is with the seats, which
are quite comfortable from the butt and up through the back, but
far too soft beneath the thighs and knees. A more rigid front panel
to the seat would help.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pickering, a VW enthusiast from Exeter, N.H., owns a new
Beetle _ though not the turbocharged model _ and says it compares
wonderfully in terms of fun and nostalgia with his other Bug, a
1953, impeccably restored, maintained, and driven thousands of
miles every summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   This, the second model year of the new Beetle, shows that this
is still a work in progress. They've got the evocation down. Now
they're working on performance. The 1.8T, which goes on sale this
week, is powered by a transverse-mounted, 4-cylinder, 20-valve
engine that cranks out 150 horsepower. (Pickering points out that
he has a Judson supercharger that he could slap onto his 1953 Bug
and boost it from 36 to 50 horses.)
</P>
<P>
   Folks who rushed out to buy the 1998s or the early 1999s may
soon be found back in the showroom once word of this model gets out
_ which is, after all, how the car business works.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-speed shifter clicks deftly through the gears without the
clumsy long throw of the old models. The front suspension _
McPherson strut design with control arms, stabilizer bar and coil
spring struts _ is matched with a rear setup of independent torsion
beam axle and integrated sway bar.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good setup to a point _ the point being that with all
this new power in a 2,921-pound car ready to leap out of the
corners, a stiffer setup would be better. Power has gotten just a
bit ahead of suspension here.
</P>
<P>
   But again, this is a work in progress and right now, at this
price, this is as much fun as you can find in a sensible commuter
car. Unless, of course, you want to await the evolution. An Rsi
model prototype unveiled recently will almost certainly lead, a
Volkswagen spokesman said, to an ever higher level of Bug: a V-6
engine, 200-plus horsepower, all-wheel-drive model.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Webbed map pouches on each door.
</P>
<P>
   _ A sunglasses holder in the ceiling just above the driver's
door.
</P>
<P>
   _ A small storage compartment in the ceiling just above the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   _ The single joystick on the driver's door that operates both
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   _ I know this is purely personal taste, but as soon as I got in
the car, the daisy in the little vase mounted on the dash went into
the glove compartment. When I think of daisies and the '60s and
'70s, I see them stuck in gun barrels, not vases on Beetle dashes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The cup holders set ahead of the shift lever and partly under
the dash. Hard, if not impossible, to use.
</P>
<P>
   _ The tiny antenna mounted on the rear roof. Too much static in
places where reception is usually good. Give us a big antenna.

ALICE COOPER BOX SET SCORES A+ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If you're going to do a box set, you really couldn't
do it any better than the guys at Rhino did for Alice Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   This baby, which reached stores last week, has everything a fan
looks for in these things: There are 84 tracks, licensed from 12
sources. There are 11 unreleased cuts, including some intriguing
demo versions.
</P>
<P>
   The liner notes are colorfully informative, with Sex Pistol John
Lydon chipping in a gracefully written essay. Alice comments on
every track, sometimes revealing, sometimes funny. Even the
packaging is pretty righteous, with a leering Alice staring out
from behind a three-dimensional barred door.
</P>
<P>
   It's a handsome tribute to Cortez High's most notorious grad,
spanning 1965 to 1998. Like the best collections of its sort, it's
also revealing. Alice Cooper (the man, not the group) is such a
familiar institution _ particularly in the Phoenix area _ that the
music often tends to get overlooked. These days, the name brings to
mind a downtown restaurant and celebrity golf, not necessarily rock
and roll.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that is also due to the nature of Alice's celebrity.
Visuals were a dazzling part of the whole act. And during his '70s
heyday, Alice was Hollywood in every sense of the word, even
guesting on ``Hollywood Squares.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising thing about the box is how show-biz
Alice actually was. It's hard to remember, but there was actually a
time when people were threatened by the ghoulishness of him. Before
Marilyn Manson and Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper was the guy who had
parents and preachers quaking in fear.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's simply the desensitization of America, but it's hard
to imagine this stuff frightening anybody. Whenever it comes close
to being ``creepy,'' it's creepy in a ``Fangoria''/``Famous
Monsters'' kind of way. You know it's all theatrics and makeup and
muscular guitars and howling vocals. It's show-biz, not seriously
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Alice Cooper's corner of the block is more fun
to visit than you might expect. And maybe that's also a bit sad. In
this modern day and age, tunes with titles such as ``Dead Babies''
and ``Killer'' don't shock anymore, but instead carry the glow of
nostalgia around them. Ah, memories. &QL;

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS DEBATE SPIKE IN GAS PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A week-long breakdown at a Southern
California Arco refinery, kept from the public for more than a
month, was a major factor in the recent huge increase in gas prices
in California, state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation came during a special legislative hearing
Wednesday to examine why gas prices rose sharply during March and
April, one of the sharpest price spikes on record. Prices are at a
statewide average of $1.57 per gallon of unleaded, self-serve
gasoline, compared to $1.10 per gallon in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they can increase much more without driving
people to electric vehicles,'' said Senate President pro tem John
Burton, D-San Francisco, who called the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Oil company executives admitted Wednesday they had reaped
profits during the price spike, caused, they said, by the equipment
breakdowns and refinery explosions. Their ``refinery margin'' went
from 28 cents to 70 cents per gallon, an increase far too large not
to include profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Arco refinery shutdown was one of many explanations for the
price spike, which has prompted widespread complaints from
consumers, an investigation by state Attorney General Bill Lockyer
into possible price gouging and antitrust violations, and a
gasoline boycott planned for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   During the legislative hearing, an oil industry analyst for the
California Energy Commission said that five factors caused the
increased prices, including a Feb. 23 flash fire at the Tosco Avon
refinery in Martinez that killed four workers, another fire a month
later at the Richmond Chevron plant, and production delays at an
Exxon refinery.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst, Tom Glaviano, said he couldn't reveal the other two
factors because of confidentiality agreements with the oil
companies. The secrecy policy is in place because some fear that
making the information public might cause a further panic in the
gasoline market.
</P>
<P>
   But an Arco executive at the hearing chose to reveal the March
18 breakdown in a ``cracking unit'' that crippled production at the
company's Carson refinery in Los Angeles County, forcing Arco to
import an extra 800,000 barrels of gasoline from the Gulf Coast. No
workers were injured during the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you, at the time I did not know if I was going to
meet my customer's needs,'' said Chris Noble, senior vice president
of retail marketing at Arco, adding: ``It's very expensive to buy
fuel that has come around from the Gulf Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth major factor for the price increase remained a mystery
at the hearing, although lawmakers speculated it would have been
further problems at Tosco or Exxon, or a breakdown in the
distribution or oil pipeline systems.
</P>
<P>
   Noble and other oil company executives said higher crude-oil
costs had also played a role in the price rise, but the main
factors appear to be the refinery breakdowns and fears of lower
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Fear must be one of the factors, lawmakers said, since the
California Energy Commission recently reported there were adequate
supplies of gasoline to meet demand during March and April. The
commission said the huge price increases weren't warranted based on
a limited supply alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds to me that somebody panicked, that there was a
shortfall perception, but we really had supplies available,'' said
Sen. Hilda Solis, D-El Monte.

POP SINGER CANNOT LIVE BY BUBBLEGUM ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Freda Payne's been singing for as long as she
remembers, but there's one song that's forever identified with her:
The 1970 blockbuster ``Band of Gold,'' a classic slice of pop soul
with an urgent bass line and a silky, purring vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never realized how far-reaching it affected people, but it
did,'' says Payne, a striking woman who still performs about six
months out of the year. ``Sometimes I don't get it. People tell me
it's their favorite song of all time _ I mean, I like it, too, but
I'm kind of flattered and amused all at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   She's probably amused because ``Band of Gold'' doesn't exactly
boast the heaviest of lyrics. In fact, it's probably the bubbliest
song ever to deal with the subject of impotency.
</P>
<P>
   There were other hits for Payne, including ``Cherish What Is
Dear to You (While It's Near to You)'' and the poignant anti-war
song ``Bring the Boys Home.`` But she fills up her show with
jazz-oriented numbers and show tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who don't know my repertoire are sometimes surprised,''
she says. ``But I love to sing jazz, to sing ballads, to sing the
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Her profile hasn't been particularly high since the early '70s,
but she's stayed busy. She's done Broadway and even hosted her own
syndicated talk show. These days, it's corporate shows, symphony
gigs and club dates that fill her time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say I've been there and done that, but I haven't
done enough,'' she says. ``There's so much more I haven't done. I
mean, I guess I could be a stockbroker, but this is what I do. (The
late) Joe Williams was singing up to the end _ that's how I see
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the end comes, she'll probably be singing ``Band of
Gold'' _ unless she's at home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always sing around the house, but I (begin ital) never (end
ital) sing `Band of Gold,' '' she says emphatically. ``Nothing
against the song, but there's no reason to sing it when there's no
audience there.'' &QL;

COUNTRY CONVERTS LOVE THE BOOT-SCOOTIN' LIFESTYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When Rhode Island native Jack Joyce moved to the
Valley in 1979, it not only meant a change of scene, in some ways
it meant a change of identity.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, he owned his first cowboy boots: a pair of
light brown Justins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came out here, I just fell in love with Western wear,''
says Joyce, a landscaper who works in the East Valley. ``I fell in
love with country music. I even took some country-Western dance
lessons. It was like a whole change in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming change. It's rare to see Joyce without a pair of
boots these days. His feet haven't touched a pair of dress shoes
for more than two years, not since he had to go to a wedding in
England (``It's so cumbersome to fly with boots,'' he apologizes).
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years, Joyce was the principal of Mesa's Westwood High
School. He was known for his firm handshake, for being easily
approachable, and for his Western wear. He would pair a handsome
pair of black lizard wingtips with suits featuring delicate Western
touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put your boots on, and you're a couple of inches taller,''
says Joyce, in a voice that still retains its East Coast accent.
``When I'm dressed up in my boots and my Stetson, I feel good about
the way I carry myself. I have a little more jump to my step.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's part of the whole Western mystique. There's
something about the entire Western look and Western sound that
appeals to people who couldn't rope a calf if their lives depended
on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Arizona, after all,'' says Roger Saba, looking pretty
spiffy himself in a pair of black teju lizard boots. He oversees
marketing for Saba's Western Stores, a business his grandfather
started in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come here and they get into the lifestyle. It's more
acceptable than it is in the East. People may not be cowboys, but
they see something in the lifestyle they want to emulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce would agree. When he looks at himself in the mirror, he
knows what he wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I've never been a smoker and I don't have a mustache,
there's something about the look of the Marlboro man,'' he says.
``Kind of a romantic, swashbuckling look to that individual. Maybe
it's a little bit of the copycat syndrome. Maybe it's a little bit
of `when in Rome.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But even though we are in the West, there seems to be some
confusion about just how Western we are. There are people born and
bred in the Valley who would rather walk barefoot across hot July
asphalt than slip on a pair of Tony Lamas and a big belt buckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've basically got different types of people here in
Arizona,'' Saba says. ``You've got people who always wear this
stuff, day in and day out. You've got people who would never wear
this stuff. But most people are somewhere in between _ they own a
couple of pairs of boots and break them out when it's
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   And people can start out as one type of person and end up as
another. The late Herb Drinkwater is probably the ultimate example.
He was a native New Yorker, but the beloved mayor of Scottsdale
rarely was seen without a pair of ostrich hides and a Western
tailored suit. He embraced the lifestyle and embraced the look.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Lucy Peterson. When she was growing up in south
Phoenix, she never gave a second thought about the Western style of
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' the pretty brunette asks incredulously.
``(begin ital) No one (end ital) listened to country music. And
people just didn't dress like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But here it is, Saturday night at Tempe's Rockin Rodeo, and
Peterson looks perfectly at home in tight-fitting Wranglers and
black boots with their dagger-sharp toes.
</P>
<P>
   She was divorced 2{ years ago and wanted to meet new people and
try something different. The people she met at Western clubs,
people who liked country music and enjoyed country dancing, seemed
less threatening than people who populate most nightspots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good way to meet new people, people who were
interested in dancing and talking, not just the other stuff,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be another whole element of the appeal. Maybe it's
simply a myth, but there's something almost quaint and gentlemanly
about the social scene.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that is due to the dancing. It's not overtly sexual;
instead it is regimented and romantic. The steps are defined and
precise. There's little opportunity for hands to roam to forbidden
places, to paraphrase Conway Twitty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, it's about dancing,'' says Robin DeWitt, who works as a
registered nurse. ``You meet people and they're nice and they want
to dance. It's not like one dance means you're going to wind up in
bed together. It's almost more . . . refined.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, there's something about the way a man looks in tight,
pressed Wranglers,'' she says, devilish enthusiasm lighting up her
eyes. ``A nice pair of boots, a good hat _ it just looks (begin
ital) good. (end ital) ''
</P>
<P>
   She then takes a look at the loose-fitting Levi's a visitor is
wearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, your jeans really need to be tighter,'' she says,
pinching the denim material. ``This is too loose!''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie DeBenedetta knows how jeans should fit _ his Wranglers
almost look like they're painted on. He is studying to be a lawyer,
but right now he makes money teaching people the intricacies of
dancing the two-step and the Cotton-Eyed Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started dancing like this three years ago to meet a girl,''
DeBenedetta says. ``Pretty soon, she was gone and I was still
Western dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   It took him awhile to get into the Western mood: ``I'm
Italian!'' he exclaims. ``We don't usually dress like this!''
</P>
<P>
   Now he owns five pairs of cowboy boots, a couple of hats and
more than a dozen Wranglers. And he knew he'd found his destiny the
first time he walked into a country bar wearing a dark Stetson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chick magnet,'' he says with a grin, like he's
letting loose with trade secrets. ``I would go into a bar without a
hat and was just another guy. With the hat, the women took
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   So part of it has to do with the opposite sex. But more
important, it has to do with how you feel about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Take Dave Munsey. The Channel 10 (KSAZ) weatherman doesn't know
a whole lot about country music. But he sure as heck knows his
boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the Vietnam War, I had my folks send me a pair
of cowboy boots,'' recalls Munsey, getting ready for an evening
newscast. ``I would have on my uniform and my boots, and the other
guys would look at me like I was crazy. But that was me.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 51, Munsey may be the best example of the man who walks
the walk _ literally _ without walking the walk. For instance, you
won't find him line dancing on weekends or roping cattle in his
spare time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably have about 12 pairs of boots,'' he says. ``Every
color to match every suit I own. My tuxedo is cut for my boots. All
my suits are cut for my boots. Nothing looks better than a good
pair of cowboy boots.''
</P>
<P>
   He favors exotic leathers made by Lucchese, known as the
Cadillac of Western footwear. They're not cheap, with prices
sometimes running into the four-figure category. Munsey has no
children, but he sounds like a proud papa when he discusses a pair
of orange boots he owns made from kangaroo hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a set on Channel 10 where you could see my
whole body,'' he recalls. ``I would wear these orange boots, and
finally the director told me to stop: `More people are watching
your boots than are watching your weather.' It just about broke my
heart. They were really handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   It's become his trademark. Munsey is known for pushing pool
safety and for his fancy footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People I don't know will call me out of the blue because
they're going to buy a pair of boots and they want my opinion,'' he
says humbly. ``I try to do the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   There's really no better salesman for the darned roach killers
than Munsey, who originally hails from North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pull my boots on, I feel really good about myself,'' he
says. ``There are some boots I like better than others, but nothing
feels as good as a really well-made cowboy boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three pairs of dress shoes, the kind with the little
tassels on them. I try to wear them occasionally, but I feel really
funny in them, like I should be tap dancing. I just don't feel like
``me''.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Joyce understands. The first time he went to a Western-wear
store, he was a novice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of awkward,'' he admits. ``I didn't know how a hat
needs to be shaped. I didn't know how jeans were supposed to be
tailored. But I'm a good student _ I wasn't afraid to show my lack
of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I put on my boots, and it's just me. This is who I am.
This is how I dress. I don't feel conspicuous at all _ I feel like
me.'' &QL;

IT'S TOUGH BEING A PUNK IN SALT LAKE CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The funky clatter of ``SLC Punk!'' caused a minor buzz at the
Sundance Film Festival, perhaps because of its title alone _ the
SLC of the title refers to Salt Lake City, a few miles away from
the Utah festival. Or perhaps because the lanky Matthew Lillard,
who stars as Stevo, finally has a hairdo to go along with the
crackle of his personality _ it's glowing electric blue.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director James Merendino's film is about Stevo's
ingratiatingly rebellious attempt to set himself apart from the
status quo. Apparently he doesn't feel like he's different enough
by not being a Mormon. Stevo decides to pursue an Anarchy in the UT
lifestyle by following the road paved by the punks.
</P>
<P>
   ``SLC Punk!'' is funny because Stevo and his crew decide to
become punks in 1985, just about five years or so before the retro
movement reclaimed punk. Lillard ambles into every scene legs
first, as if his upper torso and lower body were torn in two
opposing directions. Stevo gives Lillard a chance to use his
skittishness. It's as if he loses interest in his thoughts before
he even completes them.
</P>
<P>
   So it's evident that he couldn't be less interested in trailing
his dad (Christopher McDonald, who should also be bored with this
part because he's played so often; it's hard to tell if he's
recycling lines from ``Leave it to Beaver'' or the more recent
``The Faculty'').
</P>
<P>
   Lillard's a born attention-getter. He makes as much of this role
as he did with the table scraps he was given in ``She's All That,''
in which he played a gross-out Prince patterned on ``The Real
World's'' Puck. That movie never recovered from his turn; the cast
seemed to be looking over their shoulders, waiting for him to come
back. Like the young Robert Downey Jr., half of Lillard's
performances may come from an effort to keep from getting bored.
You may find him irritating, but he throws himself bodily into a
part.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has the sense to be slightly embarrassed about the
snarling arrogance of its leads and the world they inhabit, which
isn't nearly as scary as they think it is; they're basically
suburban outlaws. Nevertheless, Stevo's pals try to match him on
the drama queen pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   His best friend is the ironically named Heroin _ ironic because
he doesn't do drugs. Merendino shows a sense of a humor, even
though the picture sometimes has as scattered an attention span as
its protagonist. ``SLC Punk's!'' star and creator imbue the picture
with energy, though, and they manage to succeed despite some
self-conscious storytelling devices.

HOW MUCH TROUBLE IS THAT DOGGIE IN THE MOVIE? A LOT

<P>
   Q: What kind of small dog is in the film ``As Good As It Gets''?
My wife wants one for Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   _ B.G., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Verdell was played by six Brussels Griffons, a rare European
breed that has become popular since the movie's release.
</P>
<P>
   The National Brussels Griffon Club reports an ``astounding''
increase in people wanting one of the dogs. ``The Brussels Griffon,
although enormously charming and endearing, has never before been a
popular breed,'' the club states on its World Wide Web site.
``There are some very good reasons for this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The club warns that some of the dogs are not suited for a house
with children and can be difficult to reliably house-train.
</P>

STOP `HANDS' WRITERS BEFORE THEY STEAL AGAIN

<P>
   It would be a lot easier to like ``Idle Hands'' if it weren't
such a patent rip-off of every horror movie I grew up watching, as
well as one I made in college.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if director Sam Raimi happens to stumble into theaters
to catch this derivative horror yarn _ the latest in a long line of
post-''Scream'' teen terrors _ the only thing he's likely to scream
is, ``Lawsuit!'' Most of the premise of ``Hands'' is largely
reminiscent of a scene in Raimi's inarguably classic gore outing
``Evil Dead II,'' in which hero Bruce Campbell does battle with his
own possessed paw after it's bitten by one of the evil dead.
</P>
<P>
   Insert ``hero'' Devon Sawa (''Wild America'') as Anton, a
slothful stoner whose right hand becomes a tool of Satan thanks
largely to his lethargic lifestyle _ idle hands being the devil's
workshop ... get it?
</P>
<P>
   Once he has figured out what his devilish digits have been up
to, his parents as well as a whole lot of locals have already
bitten the dust. Add to the body count buddies Seth Green (''Buffy
the Vampire Slayer'') and Elden Henson, who are unlucky enough to
point the finger at Anton's ... fingers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing the two return as zombies to provide comic
relief for the killing spree that ensues as Anton tries to keep his
murderous mitt from harming the hottie neighbor (Jessica Alba) who
has finally taken an interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Evil Dead,'' Anton cuts to the source of the problem,
hacking off the killer claw with a meat cleaver, but that only sets
it free to kill without the hindrance of a bulky body in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Vivica A. Fox is on hand as the obligatory evil expert stalking
the violent spirit, and Jack Noseworthy shows off his biceps as a
heavy metal meathead.
</P>
<P>
   What's sad is that the film wastes some really clever spins on
horror movie cliches and mires them in with a bunch of horror movie
cliches. Sawa is fine, especially when doing battle with his
rebellious appendage, and Green and Henson have enough amusing
asides to make their appearance _ an idea ``borrowed'' from ``An
American Werewolf in London'' _ seem like an homage.
</P>
<P>
   But for a horror comedy, it's neither scary nor funny enough.
And a comedic story about teen-agers murdered by a classmate seems
awfully ill-timed.

PASSION IS KEY TO LIFE AND WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you ever have a chance to see ``Rent'' _ or
if you ever had a chance to see Wayne Gretzky _ you might
appreciate why passion is more than a career counseling buzzword.
</P>
<P>
   The career counseling mantra is that you should find work that
you're passionate about, but keeping that passion is a lot easier
to philosophize about than to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Say you're passionate about romance. Would you still feel
passionate if you were obligated to focus on your spouse eight
hours a day, five days a week, 50 weeks a year, for 45 years?
Sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   So instead of tilting at windmills, take a few minutes to
appreciate the hokey play and the hockey player. (All right.
``Rent'' isn't really hokey; I just have a passion for deranged
sentences.) They're both about real passions, not fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rent'' spans a year in the life of several struggling artists
in New York, at a time when AZT was the main treatment for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   With death around the corner for many of them, life carries a
special urgency and preciousness. One of the main lyrics is ``no
day but today.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes ``Rent'' universal is their zest for life, their
belief that they have the answers, that they can change the world.
Their world is fresh, before all of life's distractions set in,
before money becomes a preoccupation, before ``homeless'' and
``numbness'' blend together.
</P>
<P>
   You need that stage in your life, those booster rockets of
ambition and arrogance. In your own opinion, at least, you're never
smarter than you are in your early 20s, a time when you still don't
know what you still don't know.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to find anyone more passionate about work than
Gretzky, the greatest hockey player who ever lived. But staying at
that level requires hard work, training throughout the year to be
in shape for the season. And he was long past the stage of youthful
exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky had been playing hockey for 35 years, since he was 3. It
was time to find another passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rent'' creator Jonathan Larson lived for only 35 years. He
died from an aneurysm just before ``Rent'' debuted off-Broadway.
But his passion is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Larson's ``no day but today'' theme is mostly about
relationships, and how AIDS makes them even more tenuous than
usual. But unless you're threatened with death's urgency, life
tends to turn into more of a marathon race, and it's easy to forget
about passion when you're sucking air at the 15-mile mark.
</P>
<P>
   Have you lost your passion? Not your passion for work,
necessarily; lots of people lose that. What about your passion for
life? Does something _ anything _ matter to you? Sure, you're
passionate about family and friends, right? But are you so wiped
out at the end of the day that you can't give them the time, much
less the passion? If all you're doing is staggering toward that
finish line, ask yourself if work is partly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   If you're constantly overwhelmed, ask for a week off _ without
pay if you have to. If you're a good employee and your boss isn't a
complete idiot, you'll get it. In a market like today's, the
company would lose a lot more time and money struggling to hire
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Think about what you need to get your passion back. In an ideal
world, the career counselors are right: You should be passionate
about work because it's still probably the most time-consuming
aspect of your life. If you've been passionate before but aren't
now, ask yourself what has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Has your employer become unreasonably demanding? Do you feel
unappreciated? Has the job changed so much that it is no longer
enjoyable? Those are all good reasons to speak up or move on,
either to another employer or another career.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you don't think you could feel passionate
about any job, ask yourself what you do (or would like to) feel
passionate about, and whether your job is stopping you.
</P>
<P>
   If the workload is overwhelming, analyze your habits. Can you
get in a couple of uninterrupted hours by ignoring the phone? Do
you constantly check e-mail when you could be doing it once or
twice a day? Are you too timid to tell your boss that your workload
has become unreasonable and you need help in setting priorities?
</P>
<P>
   Even if work demands 60 or 70 hours a week and you have a good
reason not to leave (such as mental illness), think about
restructuring the hours to fit your passion, like taking Wednesday
afternoons off to go to baseball games or making a point that
neither you nor your spouse will work on Thursday nights so you can
have an evening of romance.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling passionate about work is a luxury, but feeling
passionate about life is a necessity. If you've lost it, fight to
get it back. No day but today.

CALISTA FLOCKHART'S `MIDSUMMER' MIRTH

entertainment column)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Calista
Flockhart in ``Ally McBeal'' and with Dominic West in ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's neither the best of times nor the worst of times for
Calista Flockhart these days.
 &HT;    On the one hand, she's a certified hit as micro-miniskirted
television lawyer ``Ally McBeal.''
 &HT;    On the other, her success has triggered a barrage of media
stories, most fixating on her weight. It doesn't help that in
photographs Flockhart looks like a severely undernourished waif. It
doesn't matter that she's denied _ well, sort of _ that she is a
melting-away anorexic.
 &HT;    But on the whole the actress admits that, while she could live
without the stories on her weight, ``Ally'' has been good for her.
 &HT;    The toothpick-thin, 34-year-old actress, clad in a black jacket,
matching slacks and a black T-shirt, with her blonde hair falling
to her shoulders, is at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills,
Calif., to talk up her latest big-screen role, as Helena in
``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' which will
open nationwide on May 14.
 &HT;    Flockhart _ whose first name is Greek for ``most beautiful'' _
shares the spotlight with an all-star cast that includes Kevin
Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci, Christian
Bale, David Strathairn and Sophie Marceau.
 &HT;    ```Ally' has given me the kind of power in Hollywood I could
only dream of,'' the actress admits. ``No one would have given me a
role in `Midsummer' without `Ally.' I suppose opportunities like
this are worth losing some of my anonymity for.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, she says, the anorexia stories definitely
hurt.
 &HT;    ``All that intense scrutiny made me want to retreat and hide,''
Flockhart says. ``I honestly thought it was the end of my career,
and I was frightened it would destroy everything I had worked for.
Some of the stuff published about me was hurtful and vicious. I
wasn't prepared for it. At one time there was even a story that my
dog was anorexic!''
 &HT;    She insists that she doesn't think she's unusually thin.
 &HT;    ``It's difficult for me to be analytical about how I look and
appear to people,'' she says. ``You can't have the same perception
of yourself as others have of you.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, that's precisely the kind of not-quite-denial
that convinces many eating-disorder professionals that the actress
does indeed have a problem.
 &HT;    If so, it's of long standing, since Flockhart was rail-thin even
in her days on the New York stage.
 &HT;    The daughter of a businessman father and a schoolteacher mother,
Flockhart grew up in suburban Iowa, Minnesota and New York. Her
first taste of acting came at Rutgers University, and in l987 she
moved to New York to try it professionally.
 &HT;    It wasn't easy. She landed a few bit parts in television soaps,
got a cable-television movie and worked part-time teaching
aerobics.
 &HT;    Gradually, however, breaks came her way. She made her Broadway
debut with Julie Harris in ``The Glass Menagerie'' (1994), and had
a small film role in Robert Redford's ``Quiz Show'' (l994). Mike
Nichols hired her to play Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest's daughter
in ``The Birdcage'' (l995), but hardly anyone noticed her amid the
buffoonery of Nathan Lane and Robin Williams.
 &HT;    Most of the time, Flockhart recalls, Hollywood wasn't
interested. Even when she got an audition, she didn't get the part.
She lost out to Courtney Love for the role of Althea Flynt in ``The
People Vs. Larry Flynt'' (l996), and was beaten out by Cameron Diaz
for ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' (l997).
 &HT;    But then ``Ally'' producer/creator David Kelley heard about a
Broadway actress who might be right for the lead in his latest
television opus, and the rest is history.
 &HT;    Flockhart comes to ``Midsummer'' no stranger to Shakespeare,
having played Juliet and Cordelia onstage. This time out she plays
the sex-hungry Helena, enamored of the callous Demetrius (Bale).
 &HT;    ``People call Helena obsessed, but I'd like to think of her as
hugely determined,'' the actress says. ``I think she knows that,
somewhere inside him, Demetrius loves her, and she just has to get
his attention. That's what gives her confidence.
 &HT;    ``Helena is fixated on Demetrius,'' she adds. ``The play for me
is about love ... and how far we are willing to go to get what we
love.''
 &HT;    It's actually fun to return to her acting roots, Flockhart says,
after the changes wrought in her life since ``Ally McBeal'' hit the
airwaves in 1997.
 &HT;    ``I've lost a lot of my privacy,'' Flockhart says, ``but I try
to maintain my sense of humor and don't take it personally. `Ally'
has afforded me so many opportunities that I'd never have had. It's
been fast and fun, and I have no regrets _ I'd do it all over again
in a heartbeat.''
 &HT;    But that doesn't mean she wants to wear those miniskirts
forever.
 &HT;    ``I hope that people in Hollywood know I'm an actress and that
I'm not Ally McBeal,'' she says.
 &HT;    To reinforce that message, later this year she plans to take a
huge salary cut to return to the Off-Broadway stage in a new
production of ``I Am a Camera,'' playing Christopher Isherwood's
amoral, reckless Englishwoman Sally Bowles in the story set in
1930s Germany.
 &HT;    As for the big screen, ``Midsummer'' director Michael Hoffman
believes Flockhart has a major movie career ahead of her, perhaps
following in the footsteps of another beautiful but thin actress.
 &HT;    ``One day while we were talking on the film set in Tuscany,'' he
recalls, ``Calista told me she would like to star in a remake of
`Breakfast at Tiffany's' (l961). She sees herself resembling Audrey
Hepburn, and I agree she should exploit that.''

 &HT;    SMALLER CLASSES HELP STUDENTS FOR YEARS, STUDIES SHOW
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Students placed in smaller classes in the early
grades continue to do better academically all the way through high
school, new research showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings may bolster the chances that a reluctant Congress
will continue to fund President Clinton's plan to hire 100,000
extra teachers over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of researchers looked at the long-term effects of
Project STAR, in which 11,600 Tennessee students and their teachers
were assigned randomly to either small or large classes in
kindergarten through third grade between 1985 and 1989. The small
classes had 13 to 17 students and the large classes had 22 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the smaller classes did better in tests administered at
the time. After that, all the students were in regular classes for
their rest of their elementary and high school years.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies show that the benefits from the small classes
lasted for years. The students from the small classes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Had higher test scores in math, reading and science in grades
4, 6 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   _ Were less likely to drop out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Were more likely to graduate from high school on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   _ Were more likely to graduate in the top 25 percent of their
class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Were more likely to take college entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
   The results were hailed by Democrats, who earlier this year
blocked Republican attempts to dilute Clinton's $12 billion teacher
hiring initiative by letting schools shift some of this year's $1.2
billion into special education. Over seven years, Clinton's bill
would help local districts reach a national target of no more than
18 students per class in the first through third grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and teachers have known for a long time that children
learn better in smaller classes,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
She and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., predicted that the new
findings will help their bill, which calls for a $1.4 billion
second installment on Clinton's plan for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical Republicans didn't challenge the findings, though they
said class-size reduction might not be as cost-effective as higher
federal investment in improving teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome a debate on class size,'' responded Chairman Bill
Goodling, R-Pa., of the House Committee on Education and the
Workforce. But, he added, ``While smaller classes are an important
element too, quality teaching is the paramount factor in
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those aren't contradictory goals,'' said Education Secretary
Richard Riley. ``Our initiative sets aside 15 percent of the
(class-reduction) funds for professional development.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Sandra Horner of Knoxville, Tenn., told a House
education subcommittee that smaller classes would help keep good
teachers from accepting higher-paying jobs in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the classroom for 25 years, and I know for
certain it makes a difference in the teacher's life when you ask
that teacher to teach 30 students, instead of 15,'' Horner said.
``A lot of a teacher's work is done at home, and teachers with 30
students in a class have very little life of their own.''

<P>
   BELGRADE _ ``So let's tell people the truth...we are alone.''
</P>
<P>
   With those nine words, Vuk Draskovic has written himself into
the history of NATO's war against Yugoslavia, a roaring, harsh
voice demanding reality and an end to propaganda, peace with honor
and an end to lies.
</P>
<P>
   NATO misquoted him, of course. The Serbian regime responded in
shocked silence. But Yugoslavia's now-sacked deputy prime minister
and leader of the Serbian Renewal Party had struck.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was not about to break apart, he told Serbs. It was growing
stronger. Russia was not about to send its squadrons of Sukhoi
bombers to rescue Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   International public opinion had turned against Serbia after
``horrible scenes of Albanian refugees and human suffering
overwhelmed the western world.'' Serbia must be ready to accept
them back _ and to accept a U.N.-led international ``presence'' in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even for Yugoslav viewers, this was strong stuff. Was Vuk
Draskovic preparing himself to be the ``interlocuteur valable'' of
Yugoslavia? The next president, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, NATO took what it wanted from Draskovic's
extraordinary soliloquy on the small Belgrade Studio B television
channel, happy to quote his condemnation of government ``lies'' and
his assertion that NATO is growing stronger _ but equally content
to censor out all his references to NATO's ``aggression'' against
Yugoslavia and NATO's failure to obtain U.N. Security Council
backing for its bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have been cheated by claims from the start that
it's only a question of time before NATO breaks apart _ that
divisions are growing between Europe and the United States,''
Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has
enabled NATO to dominate Europe and to homogenize NATO itself. So
Nato is becoming stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumania and Bulgaria will enter Nato...it may even become a
kind of world military organization. If Russia joins...then it will
be the greatest army in the world. So it is important that the U.N.
places this machinery under international control.''
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Secretary George Robertson selectively quoted
only the first and third sentences of this remarkable statement.
Nor did NATO leaders mention Draskovic's demand that Albanian
Kosovo refugees should return home with the help of world
humanitarian organizations after ``U.N. troops have come.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear the Yugoslav deputy prime minister was
responding to last weekend's NATO summit in Washington, warmly
reminding his supporters that Yugoslavia was a founder member of
the U.N. and that the U.N. covenant was little different to the
constitution of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Rambouillet and Paris agreements had, in effect, provided
for an independent Kosovo. That no longer applied.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his implicit criticism of those around President
Slobodan Milosevic that will have stung nationalist Serbs. ``Many
people talk about `unity' and `endurance,''' he said. ``But I
believe the most important thing is to understand and get a grip on
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders of this country must clearly tell the people where
we are and who we're with...Will NATO break apart? Some false
prophets claim that in a couple of days we will celebrate victory
over NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must tell us what is the world public opinion...Let's not
lie to the people anymore that we are getting the Russian Sukhoi
(bomber), or S-300s or S-400s or military aid or that Russia is
entering World War Three.''
</P>
<P>
   World public opinion supported Yugoslavia in the first week of
the NATO bombardment, Draskovic said, because of its historical
ties with the country in two world wars.
</P>
<P>
   But the sight of human suffering among the Albanian refugees had
turned the world ``almost entirely against us _ but this is
concealed here...''
</P>
<P>
   Western countries were ``mainly reasonable and moderate.'' Words
were being misused. Why did the state media refer to ``criminal
NATO aggression'' as if aggression could ever be anything but
criminal?
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night, someone said (on the television) that the
three NATO POWs should have been taken to `Branko's Bridge' (in
Belgrade) and roasted there on a spit. I protested about this in
the Federal Government - although I'm willing to defend the media's
freedom, I demanded that these people be taken off the television
because they shame Serbia and our tradition. Serbs do not roast
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, only loose-lipped dissenters, it seems. There can be
little doubt that several leading figures in the regime delighted
in seeing Draskovic roasted for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Novelist and journalist and leader of the democratic movement a
couple of years ago _ he and his wife were beaten up after
condemning Milosevic's government _ the deputy prime minister is
nonetheless regarded as a turncoat by many intellectuals for
joining the Milosevic coalition.
</P>
<P>
   No, he didn't cry surrender Monday. He didn't call for the
overthrow of the regime. The ``cracks'' in the government to which
Robertson referred had been there all along.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic's words just might provide a political path out of
a war which neither side seems able to win. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ We drive at speed over the Branko Most, the great
bridge over the Sava River that links the old city of Belgrade with
the glass suburbs of Novi Beograd.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, the air raid alert sounded as my driver
Georgije and I approached the first span. Georgije's eyes swivelled
to the north _ I suppose he thought he would be able to see the
cruise missile as it came swishing over the water in the darkness _
and just for a second, his foot left the accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgije,'' I said, ``keep going.'' After all, I reflected,
Belgrade is a city where NATO's bombs have the disconcerting habit
of exploding before the Air Raid alert or after the All Clear.
</P>
<P>
   But now that NATO has attacked 32 bridges, I let Georgije choose
his own speed over the Branko Most, sliding on the old tram lines
as he chases across the river.
</P>
<P>
   My hotel porter pointed at the bridge through the rain the other
day and told me to take a close look. ``It's not going to be there
much longer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to think he might be right. Any road in
Yugoslavia, it seems, can now qualify as a ``military supply
route.'' For after four weeks of bombardment, NATO is beginning to
concentrate on those most familiar of ``military'' targets:
bridges, television transmitters, electricity relay stations,
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Like Iraq, like Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, the definition of ``military'' subtly expands to
embrace something we hadn't thought of. Like the tobacco factory in
Vranje.
</P>
<P>
   Outside my hotel now, every morning, a thousand people queue in
the rain for cigarettes. ``Rak'' is Serbian for ``cancer,'' ``rat''
for war. ``Smrt'' is Serbian for death.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is now ensuring that ``smrt'' claims its principal victims
from ``rat'' rather than ``rak.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, rescue workers broke through to the basement
cafeteria of the bombed-out RTS television station in Belgrade (``a
propaganda machine...a legitimate target'') to find more crushed
bodies where the staff were enjoying a coffee and a smoke when
NATO's missiles hit the building on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, 10 civilians _ Serb journalists among them _ died in
the explosion. But at dinner on Saturday night, I was sitting
opposite a former RTS reporter whose close friend _ a young woman
in the makeup department _ was burned to death by the missile, when
an old acquaintance approached him and muttered in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist shook his head and looked up at me and said:
``It's now 17 dead.'' I wasn't sure if he blamed me or NATO.
``They'll do the bridges next,'' he added. ``And the other
television stations.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (250-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They did. Within six hours, NATO had bombed the Serb television
transmitters at Avala south of Belgrade, taking RTS off the air for
the second time in 36 hours. And another bridge at Novi Sad _ half
of the city's electricity supply has now been cut.
</P>
<P>
   On the same night they attacked RTS television, American jets
destroyed two electrical transmission stations in the Belgrade
suburbs of Resnik and Batanica, cutting power to a large part of
the Zemun region. The same day, NATO bombed the Telekom building in
Uzice, cutting almost all telephone lines in the city.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, three small television channels were still
broadcasting in the capital and Belgrade radio continued to
transmit news _ news, needless to say, in which all Kosovo Albanian
refugees are fleeing from NATO bombs rather than ``ethnic
cleansing,'' in which President Slobodan Milosevic stands defiant
against ``fascist NATO aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid a population which is also told that hundreds of NATO
troops are deserting from their posts in Macedonia and that dozens
of U.S. soldiers have been killed there (secretly shipped home, if
you believe the press here, in a secret convoy of coffins through
Skopje), U.S. President Bill Clinton is personally blamed for the
raids on television transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Kosava television was bombed, locals have noted, it
had been broadcasting a film which depicted an actor as President
Clinton receiving oral sex from a Monica Lewinsky lookalike. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to see what NATO might have to gain by all
these attacks: if a society is deprived of news, it might
disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   When the official Tanjug news agency reports 40 missiles
exploding in just over two hours on Vranje _ as it claimed last
week _ and when the government is warning of an ecological disaster
after repeated missile strikes against petrochemical plants, NATO
might hope to spread panic around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of television and electricity did not break Serb
resistance in two world wars _ so why should it do so now?
</P>
<P>
   Serbs in neighboring countries are now sending e-mails to their
compatriots in Yugoslavia every time NATO jets pass over them,
estimating the time it will take for the planes to reach major
cities in Serbia _ the first time in the history of warfare that
the Internet has been used for air raid alerts.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the ecological consequences of the raids? According
to the Belgrade authorities, the Panchevo refinery attacks have
polluted both the air and the waters of the Danube with chlorine,
mercury, phosgene, sulphur dioxide, benzene and ammonia,
necessitating the evacuation of 80,000 people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it is in the regime's interest to accuse NATO of an
environmental catastrophe. But when NATO is boasting that it has
destroyed 100 percent of Serbia's entire refining capacity, what is
the effect on the atmosphere?
</P>
<P>
   Questions rather than statements, therefore, now permeate the
language of every Serb. How long can this go on? How long before
Belgrade, too, loses its electricity, its telephones, its bridges?
</P>
<P>
   The collapse _ however temporary _ of the Avala transmission
system has also cut live-image broadcasts from ITN, the BBC and CNN
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   A few of their reporters have been asking themselves whether
this, too, was one of NATO's intentions. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ We drive at speed over the Branko Most, the great
bridge over the Sava River that links the old city of Belgrade with
the glass suburbs of Novi Beograd.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, the air raid alert sounded as my driver
Georgije and I approached the first span. Georgije's eyes swivelled
to the north _ I suppose he thought he would be able to see the
cruise missile as it came swishing over the water in the darkness _
and just for a second, his foot left the accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgije,'' I said, ``keep going.'' After all, I reflected,
Belgrade is a city where NATO's bombs have the disconcerting habit
of exploding before the Air Raid alert or after the All Clear.
</P>
<P>
   But now that NATO has attacked 32 bridges, I let Georgije choose
his own speed over the Branko Most, sliding on the old tram lines
as he chases across the river.
</P>
<P>
   My hotel porter pointed at the bridge through the rain the other
day and told me to take a close look. ``It's not going to be there
much longer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to think he might be right. Any road in
Yugoslavia, it seems, can now qualify as a ``military supply
route.'' For after four weeks of bombardment, NATO is beginning to
concentrate on those most familiar of ``military'' targets:
bridges, television transmitters, electricity relay stations,
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Like Iraq, like Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, the definition of ``military'' subtly expands to
embrace something we hadn't thought of. Like the tobacco factory in
Vranje.
</P>
<P>
   Outside my hotel now, every morning, a thousand people queue in
the rain for cigarettes. ``Rak'' is Serbian for ``cancer,'' ``rat''
for war. ``Smrt'' is Serbian for death.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is now ensuring that ``smrt'' claims its principal victims
from ``rat'' rather than ``rak.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, rescue workers broke through to the basement
cafeteria of the bombed-out RTS television station in Belgrade (``a
propaganda machine...a legitimate target'') to find more crushed
bodies where the staff were enjoying a coffee and a smoke when
NATO's missiles hit the building on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, 10 civilians _ Serb journalists among them _ died in
the explosion. But at dinner on Saturday night, I was sitting
opposite a former RTS reporter whose close friend _ a young woman
in the makeup department _ was burned to death by the missile, when
an old acquaintance approached him and muttered in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist shook his head and looked up at me and said:
``It's now 17 dead.'' I wasn't sure if he blamed me or NATO.
``They'll do the bridges next,'' he added. ``And the other
television stations.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (250-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They did. Within six hours, NATO had bombed the Serb television
transmitters at Avala south of Belgrade, taking RTS off the air for
the second time in 36 hours. And another bridge at Novi Sad _ half
of the city's electricity supply has now been cut.
</P>
<P>
   On the same night they attacked RTS television, American jets
destroyed two electrical transmission stations in the Belgrade
suburbs of Resnik and Batanica, cutting power to a large part of
the Zemun region. The same day, NATO bombed the Telekom building in
Uzice, cutting almost all telephone lines in the city.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, three small television channels were still
broadcasting in the capital and Belgrade radio continued to
transmit news _ news, needless to say, in which all Kosovo Albanian
refugees are fleeing from NATO bombs rather than ``ethnic
cleansing,'' in which President Slobodan Milosevic stands defiant
against ``fascist NATO aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid a population which is also told that hundreds of NATO
troops are deserting from their posts in Macedonia and that dozens
of U.S. soldiers have been killed there (secretly shipped home, if
you believe the press here, in a secret convoy of coffins through
Skopje), U.S. President Bill Clinton is personally blamed for the
raids on television transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Kosava television was bombed, locals have noted, it
had been broadcasting a film which depicted an actor as President
Clinton receiving oral sex from a Monica Lewinsky lookalike. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to see what NATO might have to gain by all
these attacks: if a society is deprived of news, it might
disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   When the official Tanjug news agency reports 40 missiles
exploding in just over two hours on Vranje _ as it claimed last
week _ and when the government is warning of an ecological disaster
after repeated missile strikes against petrochemical plants, NATO
might hope to spread panic around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of television and electricity did not break Serb
resistance in two world wars _ so why should it do so now?
</P>
<P>
   Serbs in neighboring countries are now sending e-mails to their
compatriots in Yugoslavia every time NATO jets pass over them,
estimating the time it will take for the planes to reach major
cities in Serbia _ the first time in the history of warfare that
the Internet has been used for air raid alerts.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the ecological consequences of the raids? According
to the Belgrade authorities, the Panchevo refinery attacks have
polluted both the air and the waters of the Danube with chlorine,
mercury, phosgene, sulphur dioxide, benzene and ammonia,
necessitating the evacuation of 80,000 people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it is in the regime's interest to accuse NATO of an
environmental catastrophe. But when NATO is boasting that it has
destroyed 100 percent of Serbia's entire refining capacity, what is
the effect on the atmosphere?
</P>
<P>
   Questions rather than statements, therefore, now permeate the
language of every Serb. How long can this go on? How long before
Belgrade, too, loses its electricity, its telephones, its bridges?
</P>
<P>
   The collapse _ however temporary _ of the Avala transmission
system has also cut live-image broadcasts from ITN, the BBC and CNN
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   A few of their reporters have been asking themselves whether
this, too, was one of NATO's intentions. &QL;

<P>
   Having spent Easter in northern Italy with the sound of NATO
bombers screaming overhead, I travelled back to Sweden through
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   There, a number of retired generals were speaking out. One of
them, Gerd Schmueckle, was wounded six times on the Russian front
during World War II, but then served in the highest positions
inside NATO. And he warned of a new fascination with war. Perhaps,
he said, it is a question of generations. When the war veterans are
losing their hair and teeth, and disappearing into homes for the
elderly, the new generation suddenly has a different attitude
toward war.
</P>
<P>
   For Schmueckle, war was associated with horror beyond
imagination, leaving deep psychological scars on individuals and
nations. Bombs, he said, do not create peace; instead, they breed
hatred for years, perhaps for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Younger politicians believe that they can fight new types of
wars. And these new wars are becoming increasingly popular. Indeed,
they are now conducted a couple of times a year. They are supposed
to be clean wars: high-rhetoric, high-altitude and high-technology
wars; smart bombs for smart politicians. The ``third way'' in war.
</P>
<P>
   These smart wars can be used to beef up diplomacy when it runs
into problems which seem too complicated. But they can also be used
to replace diplomacy entirely and just express the outrage that we
feel over evil regimes doing evil things.
</P>
<P>
   It's evil, isn't it? No one can really defend the outrageous
acts of a Saddam Hussein or a Slobodan Milosevic. Well then, it
can't be wrong to bomb them.
</P>
<P>
   So in the West, we are in the strange situation that instead of
cashing in our peace dividend, we are on the verge of running out
of cruise missiles, or at least the air-launched version. The smart
wars are beginning to take their toll on war stock.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with these smart wars conducted from the air is that
they are often difficult to relate to political objectives, and so
far have not proved a great success in achieving those objectives.
In Baghdad, there are no longer any U.N. inspectors to look for
weapons of mass destruction, but Saddam Hussein is still there.
Wasn't it supposed to be the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the aim of the smart war was to keep the Albanians in
Kosovo and get rid of Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. So far, it
has turned out to be the other way around. The air war against
Yugoslavia has not prevented a humanitarian catastrophe; rather, it
has become associated with one.
</P>
<P>
   The air war against Serbia will not only be a war over the
future of Kosovo, but also a war over the future of smart wars and
the use of air power in isolation. If Milosevic throws in the towel
and agrees to all the NATO demands, smart wars will be here to
stay, to be used whenever diplomacy runs into too many
complications.
</P>
<P>
   But if the air war turns out to be a prolonged phase of wanton
destruction and humanitarian disaster preceding a reluctant
decision by NATO to mount a ground offensive against Kosovo (and
take responsibility for a long-term occupation of part of the
Balkans), the future of smart wars will be very different.
</P>
<P>
   We are now seeing the refighting of the war of words over the
use of air power in the Bosnian conflict. In that war, Washington
was always arguing that a few volleys of cruise missiles and
strategic strikes would sort out the problem, while others argued
that this would only aggravate the situation on the ground and
worsen the plight of exposed civilians and U.N. peace-keeping
troops.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the emotional debate about the responsibility
for the massacre of Muslims after the fall of the U.N.-declared
safe area of Srebrenica in July 1995 turned on whether it was NATO
or the United Nations which had prevented air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   This presumes that air strikes could have stopped the Serb
soldiers marching in. In Kosovo, massive NATO air strikes have
clearly done nothing to prevent or limit the Serb onslaught on the
Kosovo Albanians. It certainly felt nice to see the good missiles
heading for their evil targets. But one day we may discover that
the massacres in Kosovo during the days and nights when NATO was
striking from the sky were even worse than the terrible war crimes
in Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   We must learn again the lessons of war and power; we must
painfully start to reread the classics such as Clausewitz and all
those who learned about war and power the hard way. Perhaps there
are no smart wars, even in our smart age.

<P>
   Since the alternative is too horrible to contemplate, let us
assume that before long NATO succeeds in imposing its will on
President Milosevic, with or without the use of ground troops, and
that a kind of peace has descended on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to remember is that it is not only Kosovars who
have suffered as a result of Milosevic's murderous drive for a
Greater Serbia. As a consequence of his policies, hundreds of
thousands of Serbs have also been expelled from lands which their
forefathers have occupied for centuries in Croatia, Bosnia and no
doubt now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these people will conclude, as the Germans did 50 years
ago, that they must pay the price for following a deluded leader,
and learn to live within diminished boundaries. But it is more
likely that they will conclude that once again they have been the
victims of a historic injustice, and that they will brood in
bitterness, waiting to launch yet another futile attempt to reverse
the verdict of history.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the future tranquillity of the Balkans, the Serbs
will have to be brought back into the international community as
equal members.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the consequences go much wider than the Balkans
alone.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, NATO will be profoundly affected even in victory.
There were two main arguments about NATO enlargement. One argument
was that NATO would remain a purely defensive alliance, and that
those who remained outside had nothing to fear. The other was that
NATO would now acquire a new role: to promote human rights,
democracy, good government and market economics inside Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was never clear how a military organization could promote
civilian objectives. But the ultimatum which NATO delivered to
Serbia _ and the war which has followed it _ means that it can no
longer be portrayed as a purely defensive alliance. And many are
wondering where it will stop.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could gain or lose. Before the crisis, most Russians were
as ignorant of what was happening in Kosovo as most Westerners. If
Prime Minister Primakov's bid to act as a broker in the peacemaking
succeeds, he will boost the prestige of Russia as well as of
himself. But many in the West regard Russia as an irritating
irrelevance. Relations between Russia and the West could spiral
downward.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members have been surprisingly united in support of
military action. Milosevic's policies left them no decent choice.
But NATO has turned out to be a very blunt instrument. Even if a
halfway decent settlement is now cobbled together for Kosovo, it
will be more difficult to get people to support a repetition of the
trick in another European crisis. And America is now likely to find
it harder to get European support for the idea that NATO should
extend itself beyond this continent, to help maintain the peace
wherever it is threatened, and punish villains wherever they are
found.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the biggest question of all: the nature and the
future of U.S. global power. Americans believe that they have a
duty to slay dragons. But the record _ in Vietnam, in Iraq, in
Iran, in Somalia, even in neighboring Cuba _ demonstrates that
there are severe practical limitations even to the most awesome
military power, especially when it is exercised in the belief that
technology can substitute for body bags.
</P>
<P>
   All our relationships are likely to be more edgy as a result of
what has happened. NATO's identity crisis and trans-Atlantic
recrimination are likely to intensify, even as the Europeans wonder
whether they will ever be able to organize a peaceful continent
without external assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Countries such as India or China, which do not share the U.S.
view of its own role, will become more inclined to join in
resisting U.S. demands. Sooner or later America too will have to
adapt to an imperfect world. But there is a danger of going too
far, and retreating into sullen isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a glum prospect. Because there are no simple, cheap or
satisfying solutions, we will have to go for complex and boring
ones.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should abandon its wilder pretensions to set the rest of
the world on a right moral course. It should concentrate instead on
its basic function as a defensive alliance and expand its network
of partnerships with non-members. In Europe, the main, and most
successful body for the promotion of peace, prosperity and
democratic rights in Europe, is not NATO but the European Union. It
should give practical aid and political support to the countries
most immediately affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
includes Russia, should become the main pan-European agency for the
resolution of political disputes between its members.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the much despised United Nations. Of course
the U.N. cannot solve all, perhaps not even many, of the world's
problems. Of course it provides no basis for starry-eyed optimism
about universal peace and world government. But despite its
numerous failures, it is the only comprehensive, law-based body
which exists for the purpose of settling political disputes among
its members.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of
the 1990s, while the Permanent Members of the Security Council
still took one another seriously, it functioned as its founders had
intended. The theory which has recently gained currency _ that if
the United Nations cannot agree then the United States and its
allies have the right and the duty to take action on their own _ is
arrogant, subversive of the rule of law, and unattractive to a lot
of people.
</P>
<P>
   However inconvenient, it is time for the Western powers to try
once more to make the United Nations work.

<P>
   Since the alternative is too horrible to contemplate, let us
assume that before long NATO succeeds in imposing its will on
President Milosevic, with or without the use of ground troops, and
that a kind of peace has descended on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to remember is that it is not only Kosovars who
have suffered as a result of Milosevic's murderous drive for a
Greater Serbia. As a consequence of his policies, hundreds of
thousands of Serbs have also been expelled from lands which their
forefathers have occupied for centuries in Croatia, Bosnia and no
doubt now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these people will conclude, as the Germans did 50 years
ago, that they must pay the price for following a deluded leader,
and learn to live within diminished boundaries. But it is more
likely that they will conclude that once again they have been the
victims of a historic injustice, and that they will brood in
bitterness, waiting to launch yet another futile attempt to reverse
the verdict of history.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the future tranquillity of the Balkans, the Serbs
will have to be brought back into the international community as
equal members.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the consequences go much wider than the Balkans
alone.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, NATO will be profoundly affected even in victory.
There were two main arguments about NATO enlargement. One argument
was that NATO would remain a purely defensive alliance, and that
those who remained outside had nothing to fear. The other was that
NATO would now acquire a new role: to promote human rights,
democracy, good government and market economics inside Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was never clear how a military organization could promote
civilian objectives. But the ultimatum which NATO delivered to
Serbia _ and the war which has followed it _ means that it can no
longer be portrayed as a purely defensive alliance. And many are
wondering where it will stop.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could gain or lose. Before the crisis, most Russians were
as ignorant of what was happening in Kosovo as most Westerners. If
Prime Minister Primakov's bid to act as a broker in the peacemaking
succeeds, he will boost the prestige of Russia as well as of
himself. But many in the West regard Russia as an irritating
irrelevance. Relations between Russia and the West could spiral
downward.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members have been surprisingly united in support of
military action. Milosevic's policies left them no decent choice.
But NATO has turned out to be a very blunt instrument. Even if a
halfway decent settlement is now cobbled together for Kosovo, it
will be more difficult to get people to support a repetition of the
trick in another European crisis. And America is now likely to find
it harder to get European support for the idea that NATO should
extend itself beyond this continent, to help maintain the peace
wherever it is threatened, and punish villains wherever they are
found.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the biggest question of all: the nature and the
future of U.S. global power. Americans believe that they have a
duty to slay dragons. But the record _ in Vietnam, in Iraq, in
Iran, in Somalia, even in neighboring Cuba _ demonstrates that
there are severe practical limitations even to the most awesome
military power, especially when it is exercised in the belief that
technology can substitute for body bags.
</P>
<P>
   All our relationships are likely to be more edgy as a result of
what has happened. NATO's identity crisis and trans-Atlantic
recrimination are likely to intensify, even as the Europeans wonder
whether they will ever be able to organize a peaceful continent
without external assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Countries such as India or China, which do not share the U.S.
view of its own role, will become more inclined to join in
resisting U.S. demands. Sooner or later America too will have to
adapt to an imperfect world. But there is a danger of going too
far, and retreating into sullen isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a glum prospect. Because there are no simple, cheap or
satisfying solutions, we will have to go for complex and boring
ones.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should abandon its wilder pretensions to set the rest of
the world on a right moral course. It should concentrate instead on
its basic function as a defensive alliance and expand its network
of partnerships with non-members. In Europe, the main, and most
successful body for the promotion of peace, prosperity and
democratic rights in Europe, is not NATO but the European Union. It
should give practical aid and political support to the countries
most immediately affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
includes Russia, should become the main pan-European agency for the
resolution of political disputes between its members.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the much despised United Nations. Of course
the U.N. cannot solve all, perhaps not even many, of the world's
problems. Of course it provides no basis for starry-eyed optimism
about universal peace and world government. But despite its
numerous failures, it is the only comprehensive, law-based body
which exists for the purpose of settling political disputes among
its members.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of
the 1990s, while the Permanent Members of the Security Council
still took one another seriously, it functioned as its founders had
intended. The theory which has recently gained currency _ that if
the United Nations cannot agree then the United States and its
allies have the right and the duty to take action on their own _ is
arrogant, subversive of the rule of law, and unattractive to a lot
of people.
</P>
<P>
   However inconvenient, it is time for the Western powers to try
once more to make the United Nations work.

`THREE SEASONS': A TOUCHING FABLE ABOUT THE SEARCH FOR ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(rk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Three Seasons'' is a wistful, rain-streaked elegy for a
Vietnamese culture that is being swept away on the flood tide of
globalization. Too tenderhearted and lyrical to deliver a political
indictment, this touching film, which was chosen best dramatic
feature at the Sundance Film Festival in January, is a dreamy
cinematic poem whose interwoven voices offer different variations
of the same sad story.
</P>
<P>
   In that story, the gentle, common folk of Saigon are being left
behind as an emerging, hard-edged international culture symbolized
by Coca-Cola signs, luxury hotels and the peddling of plastic lotus
blossoms on the streets takes over the city. One of many symbols of
bald commercialization is a popular hangout once frequented by
American servicemen that is now vulgarly named the Apocalypse Now
Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Seasons'' is the first feature film by Tony Bui, a
26-year-old director who escaped from Vietnam with his parents when
he was 2 years old and grew up in California.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to his native country for a visit when he was
19, he became fluent in Vietnamese and went back to make a short
film, ``Yellow Lotus.'' Filmed in Saigon with a cast of Vietnamese
actors, ``Three Seasons'' portrays the Vietnamese capital as a city
of dissolving pastel colors, and the diffused palette reinforces
the film's romanticized vision of a world melting away under warm
tropical rains.
</P>
<P>
   All four of the film's principal characters are viewed as
innocent, struggling victims of economic forces beyond their
control. The opening scenes introduce us to Kien An (Nguyen Ngoc
Hiep), the latest recruit in an all-female work force hired to pick
white lotus blossoms on the temple estate of a reclusive boss.
</P>
<P>
   After gathering their crop, the women are bused to Saigon, where
they sell baskets of flowers on the streets. Business is good until
one day Kien An suddenly finds herself competing with vendors of
plastic, artificially scented imitations of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Summoned by her mysterious employer, who has heard her singing a
work song that transports him back to his childhood, Kien An
discovers an embittered poet dying of leprosy. This once handsome
man whose face is decomposing is the film's most jarring symbol of
a traditional culture being pushed into the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Another strand of the story follows Hai (Don Duong), a cyclo
driver who falls in love with Lan (Zoe Bui), an imperious
Vietnamese prostitute. Hai assiduously courts her by offering her
free rides from the luxury hotels in which she plies her trade.
</P>
<P>
   Lan scornfully accepts his transportation until the day he reaps
a windfall from winning a taxi race and purchases her professional
time. Beneath her hard, high-fashion exterior, he discovers a
frightened, alienated woman awash in shame and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Woody (Nguyen Huu Duoc), a wide-eyed street
boy who sells trinkets out of a suitcase. At the Apocalypse Now
Bar, the boy meets James Hager (Harvey Keitel), an American soldier
who has returned to Vietnam to search for his grown-up daughter.
When Hager leaves for a moment, the boy nods off and has his
suitcase stolen. Woody spends most of the rest of the movie trying
to retrieve the source of his meager livelihood in a drenching
rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Seasons'' doesn't pretend that its stories or characters
(who all cross paths before the movie is over) are realistic. Each
is a symbolic thread in a larger fable of people searching for
their roots. The movie is so languidly paced that it occasionally
turns vague and meandering.
</P>
<P>
   And its characters, especially the adorable, saucer-eyed Woody
and the sweet, self-abasing Hai, are sentimentalized to the brink
of saintliness. So much misty sadness and soft-focus guilt swirls
around that you almost wish for a purgative eruption of anger.
</P>
<P>
   But such an eruption would violate the movie's sweetly uplifting
agenda. Determined not to revisit the Vietnam War and to open up
old wounds, ``Three Seasons'' preaches reconciliation, forgiveness,
reverence for tradition and the salvaging of all that was best
about the past.
</P>
<P>

FRANCE RESTORES A LOOTED MONET TO OWNER'S HEIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Almost 60 years after the collection of a wealthy
French-Jewish art dealer and collector was plundered by German
occupation forces, the French government Thursday returned a Monet
painting to the man's heirs in a ceremony that suggested greater
French enthusiasm for settling claims to looted art than has so far
been apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The 1904 oil, ``Waterlilies,'' one of a series painted by Monet
in Giverny, was taken from Paul Rosenberg in 1940 and sent to
Germany. It was returned to France in 1949, but it was only
identified as forming part of the Rosenberg collection while on
loan to the ``Monet in the 20th Century'' show at the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting France's eagerness to show its good will in restoring
stolen art returned here after World War II, Culture Minister
Catherine Trautmann presided over the hand-over at the Jeu de
Paume. Rosenberg's daughter-in-law, Elaine, and granddaughter,
Elizabeth Clark, flew here from New York. His ailing daughter,
Micheline, however, was not present.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of the Jeu de Paume for the ceremony was, in Mrs.
Trautmann's words, ``highly symbolic.'' After Germany occupied
France in June 1940, the large gallery on the Place de la Concorde
was used to store art seized from Jewish dealers and collectors.
The Monet in question was also displayed there between 1950 and
1973 as part of a permanent Impressionist exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   After it was taken from Rosenberg's villa near Bordeaux, in
September 1940, however, this painting was not in fact brought to
the Jeu de Paume. It was appropriated by the German Embassy in
Paris and sent to German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop,
who included it in his private collection. After the war, the
painting was among thousands of stolen works recovered in Germany
and returned to France. Most were restored to their owners or their
heirs, including 160 paintings recovered by Rosenberg, but the
owners of some 2,000 paintings were never identified by the French
government. The best works were distributed among French museums,
with Rosenberg's Monet on display at the Musee des Beaux Arts in
Caen, Normandy, since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, however, American journalist Hector Feliciano published
a book in France, ``Le Musee Disparu'' (``The Lost Museum''), that
accused the French government of making minimal efforts to trace
the rightful owners of stolen works of art in its possession. The
book also prompted the heirs of numerous prewar collectors to renew
their search for missing paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Elaine Rosenberg sent a photograph of the missing
``Waterlilies'' to a London-based registry that operates a database
of stolen art. The organization reported that the photograph
matched a Monet at the museum in Caen. But it was only in November
that the family found the painting in the Boston exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The culture minister said Thursday that this Monet was the
seventh painting to be returned to its legal owner since 1996, but
she noted that ``it will be always be a mystery'' why the work was
not identified by either Rosenberg, who died in 1959, or by French
officials, since it was on permanent display in France and was
loaned to exhibitions abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano was not convinced. ``The big mystery is why the
government had pictures for 50 years that didn't belong to them,''
he said in a telephone interview from New York. ``It returns
pictures only when it is under pressure. But it still does not
actively look for the owners.''

MANAGEMENT BOOK TELLS WHAT MAKES EMPLOYEES UNHAPPY AND WHY THEY
QUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At last, a management book with a huge amount of statistical
evidence behind it that is set squarely in the real world of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Forget perks, parties, bonuses and parking spots, this book
suggests. The best and brightest employees say that what they want,
more than anything else, is to have a great boss.
</P>
<P>
   Not some jovial CEO at the top smiling down on the peons, but
rather an immediate supervisor who answers the most basic needs of
his or her direct employees, whether they are waiters or bond
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   And from the viewpoint of the other side, the boss, this book
throws out the management theories of hundreds of books as if they
were hogwash.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive surveying, here is one of the revolutionary
ideas of the good manager:
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't change that much. Don't waste time trying to put
in what was left out. Try to draw out what was left in. That is
hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bits of unconventional managerial wisdom such as this are handed
down in the insightful book ``First, Break All The Rules: What the
World's Greatest Managers Do Differently'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 271
pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   The book is written clearly and concisely by Marcus Buckingham
and Curt Coffman. Both are employed by the well-known Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of this book is based on two large studies conducted
by Gallup over a span of 25 years. The first asked 1 million
employees what they wanted most out of their company; the second
asked 80,000 managers, identified as talented by performance
measures in their companies, how they manage. Both questions sought
to pinpoint gray, nebulous areas of measuring that hundreds of
management books have tried to define.
</P>
<P>
   The results of this survey are eye-popping.
</P>
<P>
   What it found was not the Jacuzzi-in-every-bathroom mentality
brought out by such surveys as ``The Best Hundred Companies to Work
For.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by comparing positive and negative responses to rating
their managers, the study found the first real link between
employee opinion and business unit performance, across many
different companies. If the employees answered Gallup's questions
positively, the unit was ahead of the curve in productivity, sales
or other rankings; if the response was negative, the unit's
performance was lacking.
</P>
<P>
   And the positive responses to 12 specific questions that
identified those happy, productive employees were formed mostly
through the performance of their immediate supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had discovered that the manager _ not pay, benefits, perks
or a charismatic corporate leader _ was the critical player in
building a strong workplace,'' the authors write. ``The manager was
the key. ... People leave managers, not companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most powerful questions Gallup asked employees to
determine their happiness were:
</P>
<P>
   _Do I know what is expected of me at work?
</P>
<P>
   _Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work
right?
</P>
<P>
   _In the past seven days, have I received recognition or praise
for good work?
</P>
<P>
   Direct, defined questions. Much different from the Perk a Day
mentality of most companies who have come to realize that their
most valuable asset is their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that these employee-focused initiatives are
unimportant. It's just that your immediate manager is more
important,'' Buckingham and Coffman write. ``If your relationship
with your manager is fractured, then no amount of in-chair
massaging or company-sponsored dog walking will persuade you to
stay and perform. It is better to work for a great manager in an
old-fashioned company than for a terrible manager in a company
offering an enlightened, employee-focused culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The study of managers' opinions on how to manage successfully in
today's climate is equally enlightening. Buckingham and Coffman
also create a practical guide to hiring, firing, defining roles,
focusing on strengths and managing around weaknesses, again based
on the survey of thousands of managers.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the best, most practical, books I've seen on
managing in the six years I've been reviewing books. It should not
be missed.

   PARIS _ Almost 60 years after the collection of a wealthy
French-Jewish art dealer and collector was plundered by German
occupation forces, the French government Thursday returned a Monet
painting to the man's heirs in a ceremony that suggested greater
French enthusiasm for settling claims to looted art than has so far
been apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The 1904 oil, ``Waterlilies,'' one of a series painted by Monet
in Giverny, was taken from Paul Rosenberg in 1940 and sent to
Germany. It was returned to France in 1949, but it was only
identified as forming part of the Rosenberg collection while on
loan to the ``Monet in the 20th Century'' show at the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting France's eagerness to show its good will in restoring
stolen art returned here after World War II, Culture Minister
Catherine Trautmann presided over the hand-over at the Jeu de
Paume. Rosenberg's daughter-in-law, Elaine, and granddaughter,
Elizabeth Clark, flew here from New York. His ailing daughter,
Micheline, however, was not present.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of the Jeu de Paume for the ceremony was, in Mrs.
Trautmann's words, ``highly symbolic.'' After Germany occupied
France in June 1940, the large gallery on the Place de la Concorde
was used to store art seized from Jewish dealers and collectors.
The Monet in question was also displayed there between 1950 and
1973 as part of a permanent Impressionist exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   After it was taken from Rosenberg's villa near Bordeaux, in
September 1940, however, this painting was not in fact brought to
the Jeu de Paume. It was appropriated by the German Embassy in
Paris and sent to German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop,
who included it in his private collection. After the war, the
painting was among thousands of stolen works recovered in Germany
and returned to France. Most were restored to their owners or their
heirs, including 160 paintings recovered by Rosenberg, but the
owners of some 2,000 paintings were never identified by the French
government. The best works were distributed among French museums,
with Rosenberg's Monet on display at the Musee des Beaux Arts in
Caen, Normandy, since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, however, American journalist Hector Feliciano published
a book in France, ``Le Musee Disparu'' (``The Lost Museum''), that
accused the French government of making minimal efforts to trace
the rightful owners of stolen works of art in its possession. The
book also prompted the heirs of numerous prewar collectors to renew
their search for missing paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Elaine Rosenberg sent a photograph of the missing
``Waterlilies'' to a London-based registry that operates a database
of stolen art. The organization reported that the photograph
matched a Monet at the museum in Caen. But it was only in November
that the family found the painting in the Boston exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The culture minister said Thursday that this Monet was the
seventh painting to be returned to its legal owner since 1996, but
she noted that ``it will be always be a mystery'' why the work was
not identified by either Rosenberg, who died in 1959, or by French
officials, since it was on permanent display in France and was
loaned to exhibitions abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano was not convinced. ``The big mystery is why the
government had pictures for 50 years that didn't belong to them,''
he said in a telephone interview from New York. ``It returns
pictures only when it is under pressure. But it still does not
actively look for the owners.''

MIKE NESS/``CHEATING AT SOLITAIRE'' (Time Bomb)
<TEXT>
<P>
   His guitar is decorated with the autographs of Buck Owens and
Johnny Cash. He's got tats from head to toe and wears a black
cowboy hat. And he can hardly write (or sing) a decent melody to
save his life. The first solo album by Ness, leader of Social
Distortion, is just what you'd expect from the singer of a mildly
successful punk band that secretly wanted to be the Blasters.
</P>
<P>
   All the one-dimensional sound and fury of Social D. is funneled
into roots-rock, country, r&AMP;b-tinged material that passes by
without causing too much trouble or notice. Along with Ness' spate
of originals are covers of Dylan and Hank Williams (a convincing
``You Win Again''), while old pal Bruce Springsteen drops by to add
backup vocals and guitar to ``Misery Loves Company.'' At least
``Cheating at Solitaire'' isn't as bad as Joe Strummer's album. 2

BEN FOLDS FIVE/``THE UNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY OF REINHOLD MESSNER''
(550 Music)
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who loved ``One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces,''
``Battle of Who Could Care Less'' and the other charmers on the
Five's refreshing 1997 disc ``Whatever and Ever Amen,'' turn back
now. The new album reveals a band that's either lost its sense of
humor, run out of steam or doesn't have anything more to say. Or
all of the above. We eagerly slapped the disc on, expecting the
skewered lyrics and pleasingly twisted Broadway of the previous
effort. Instead, we got few catchy melodies, overly serious lyrical
concerns and that most tired of '90s recording gambits, a
voice-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Why did ``Reinhold Messner'' turn out so badly? Probably because
Folds wrote the majority of it in the studio after spending the
past four years on the road. 1 1/2 stars

ESA-PEKKA SALONEN AND THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC/``SENSEMAYA: THE
MUSIC OF SILVESTRE REVUELTAS'' (Sony Classical)
</P>
<P>
   Modernism came relatively late to Mexico. But when it arrived,
it arrived with a vengeance, as can be gleaned from the L.A.
Philharmonic's coolly measured, fitfully volcanic new recording of
music by Revueltas.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of Mexican Stravinsky by way of Charles Ives, Revueltas
(1899-1940) had his life and career cut tragically short by alcohol
and personal demons. Here, his explosive, enigmatic sensibility
receives its full due. The disc opens with ``Sensemaya'' (1938), a
marvelously bombastic synthesis of polyrhythmic Afro-Cuban cult
music and lush, nationalistic orchestral textures.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, ``8 x radio'' (``Ocho por radio'') bends mariachi
trumpets and mestizo folk-tune fragments into a jaggedly sardonic
four-minute chamber work. ``La Noche de los Mayas,'' written for a
1939 film of the same name, weaves stately processions of horns and
strings together with brutal percussion into a rich sonic tapestry
that evokes the mystery and might of an ancient empire.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining works _ ``Homenaje a Federico Garcia Lorca,''
``Ventanas for Large Orchestra,'' ``First Little Serious Piece''
and ``Second Little Serious Piece'' _ are equally well-performed by
Salonen and company.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if Diego Rivera had composed music instead of murals,
and you'll begin to get a feel for this sumptuous disc and its
worthy honoree. 3 1/2 stars

DUKE ELLINGTON/``SUCH SWEET THUNDER'' &QL; 
``BLACK, BROWN &AMP; BEIGE'' &QL; 
``ANATOMY OF A MURDER'' &QL; 
``FIRST TIME! THE COUNT MEETS DUKE'' (Columbia Legacy)
</P>
<P>
   Ellington had three vital periods during his time with Columbia.
These four albums, taken from his last years with the label
(1956-62), have been lovingly reissued with previously unheard
bonus tracks and alternate takes along with beautifully illustrated
and informative 36-page booklets. For anyone who loves Ellington or
is wondering what all this centennial hubbub is about, they are
well worth picking up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such Sweet Thunder'' (4 stars) is Ellington's grand take on
Shakespeare, and the album gives his celebrated sidemen _ notably
trumpeter Cat Anderson and sax men Johnny Hodges and Paul Gonsalves
_ inspired opportunities to transform the rhythm of the Bard's
writings into music. It's a fascinating record of one giant paying
tribute to (and expanding upon) another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black, Brown &AMP; Beige'' (3 1/2 stars), Ellington's musical
representation of the black experience in America, premiered at
Carnegie Hall in 1943 to disappointing reviews from critics who
wanted him to stick to punchy, four-minute songs instead of
long-form statements. Ellington occasionally reworked it in the
intervening years and re-recorded it in 1958 (the sessions that
make up this album). Star saxophonist Hodges was absent; in his
stead, Ellington employed gospel singer Mahalia Jackson with
stunning results. Jackson's rendition of ``Come Sunday'' has become
a standard, and her closing rendition of the 23rd Psalm is spare
and inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anatomy of a Murder'' (3 1/2 stars) is the only soundtrack
Ellington composed leading his own orchestra. His writing fit the
1959 Otto Preminger courtroom drama perfectly, and the reissue's
bonus tracks add insight into his working methods and composition
techniques. This is a soundtrack worthy of the film, which is
saying a lot, since the movie might just be the greatest courtroom
picture in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Count Meets the Duke'' (4 stars), the historic meeting of
the two competing orchestras, works better than you might expect
due to careful planning and mutual admiration. The fact that
Ellington's band is heard on the right channel with Basie's on the
left makes for absorbing listening as the two great orchestras
hurtle through their respective themes (``Take the `A' Train,''
``Jumpin' at the Woodside'') and the wonderful, aptly titled
``Battle Royal.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IAN TYSON/``LOST HERD'' (Vanguard)
</P>
<P>
   Canadian cowboy Ian Tyson takes a long time between albums _ and
the last one, ``All the Good 'Uns,'' was a greatest-hits
compilation. So large expectations greet ``Lost Herd,'' his first
all-new collection in five years.
</P>
<P>
   But this most lyrical of western songwriters gets off to a
wobbly start as he tries to work soft pop and smooth jazz elements
into the early cuts. While you wouldn't want to begrudge the
dedicated traditionalist some new creative range, when saxes bubble
up on ``Summer's Gone'' and the title tune, you worry that Tyson's
hung up his boots at the Kenny G Dude Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   By midalbum, though, he's firmly back in the saddle, herding a
pack of good 'uns. Marked by some fine saloon piano and lots of
elegant strumming, a passion for good horseflesh and the
contracting but ever-inspiring Wide Lonesome runs through such
instant classics as ``Roll on Owyhee'' and ``La Primera.'' The
latter is an ode to Spanish mustangs from a horse's point of view;
potentially hokey, it comes off majestically. That's the kind of
authentic risk this cowpoke should stick to. 3 stars

`YOU'VE GOT MAIL' TOPS THE STACK OF NEW RELEASES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To paraphrase a recent New York cartoon on
independent films: ``Too many videos _ too little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, like indie films, there is never a shortage of video and
DVD product _ a lot of it of dubious merit, though. But this week
and next, there's a wide array of interesting stuff _ whether
you're in the mood for the lightly romantic or wish to trip the
light ``Future Fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the big event in next Tuesday's releases will be
``You've Got Mail'' from Warners, which comes out on VHS ($22.95)
and DVD ($24.98). ``Mail'' was a big hit last December as the
holiday feel-good movie, and why not? Its stars, Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan, are just so gosh darn cute together.
</P>
<P>
   The film brings back the ``Sleepless in Seattle'' team,
including director Nora Ephron. As a remake of Ernst Lubitsch's
1940 film ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' Ephron's film never
achieves a ``counterpoint between sadness and gaiety that
represents the Lubitsch touch,'' as film critic Andrew Sarris
described it. Nevertheless, ``Mail'' didn't lack charm, taking the
story of two rival store clerks who are having an anonymous romance
through the post and updating it into the electronic age.
</P>
<P>
   So, e-mail and the Internet play a part in the film _ along with
a part of the DVD. If your computer plays DVD-ROM, you can link up
with other ``Mail'' fans, enter chat rooms, send ``Mail'' Web
greeting cards, build your own Web page and search for your own
online romance (success not guaranteed). Meanwhile, the DVD also
contains cast interviews, commentary from Ephron, and a comparison
between scenes in ``Mail'' and ``Shop'' and another film version of
the story, the 1949 musical-comedy ``In the Good Old Summertime,''
with Judy Garland and Van Johnson. Oh, yeah, you can also watch the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   FICTION AS POSSIBLE FACT: One of the most amazing things about
``Future Fantastic,'' a co-production of the BBC and The Learning
Channel that looks at science fiction as possible science fact, is
just how relaxed Gillian Anderson appears. As repressed FBI agent
Dana Scully on ``The X-Files,'' Anderson often has a look on her
face like her shoes are too tight, but as host of ``Future,'' she
seems to be having fun and not taking it all that seriously. And
that is the best way to approach ``Future,'' which manages to be
relatively entertaining as it speculates about scientific
developments, some of which sound loopy, but they probably said
that about the light bulb. The double cassette from BBC Video,
which is released this week, is priced at $29.95, and covers such
topics as cybernetics, longevity and, of course, the possibility of
alien visitations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, BBC Video also put out ``Intimate Universe: The Human
Body,'' which tracks the development of the human body, from
conception to death, with _ you guessed it _ speculation about the
great beyond. The four volume set, which was also a co-production
with The Learning Channel, lists at $59.95.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVIS REVISITED: The phrase ``You talking to me?'' has almost
become a humorous cliche, but when Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro)
said it in Martin Scorsese's 1976 film ``Taxi Driver'' it was truly
frightening. On Tuesday, Columbia is releasing a VHS special
edition ($14.95) of the landmark film, which includes a 20-minute
documentary on the making of ``Taxi Driver.'' A wide-screen version
also is available at $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   But real fans of Scorsese's dark vision, which also starred a
young Jodie Foster as a teen prostitute, may want to wait until
June 1, when the DVD comes out. Digitally remastered for audio and
video, the DVD will include a 70-minute making-of documentary and
have a suggested price of $19.95. &QL;

MARILYN MANSON STOPS THE MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marilyn Manson says he has postponed the last five
dates of his tour _ including May 8 at the Universal Amphitheatre _
out of respect for those lost in the Colorado school killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great atmosphere to be out playing rock 'n' roll
shows, for us or the fans,'' Manson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn had urged that a Reno concert set for
Monday not take place, saying in a letter to the organizers that
cancellation would be ``a fitting show of respect for the victims
of the Colorado tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson blamed ignorance, hatred and access to guns for the
tragedy, adding that the music industry, Goth kids and his own act
had been unfairly singled out.
</P>
<P>
   Before Manson (real name Brian Warner) pulled out of the dates,
Mike Antonovich of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors said
the rocker's performances, which offer a sort of poor man's Alice
Cooper stage show without many memorable songs, ``emit hate'' and
should be boycotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He advocates racism, fascism, Satanism, mass murder and
suicide,'' the supervisor said. ``Surely there should be an outcry
against Manson's type of filth and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   To get downright Freudian about it, the more these guys give
Manson legitimacy, the longer the shock tactics will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the defunct German industrial-rock act KMFDM, linked to
the Colorado killings because one of the gunmen included lyrics to
the group's songs on his Web site, also responded to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, KMFDM would like to express their deep and
heartfelt sympathy for the parents, families and friends of the
murdered and injured children in Littleton,'' said Sascha
Konietzko, co-founder of the group. ``We are sick and appalled, as
is the rest of the nation, by what took place in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``KMFDM are an art form, not a political party.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
NO LOLLAPALOOZA IN '99: Lollapalooza has gone bust-apalooza.
</P>
<P>
   The alt-rock package _ founded in 1991 by Perry Farrell _ will
not hit the road this summer for the second year because organizers
couldn't book a strong enough lineup. The event may be staged next
year, but don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the third and final edition of the all-female Lilith
Fair will feature the Pretenders, r&AMP;b singers Mya and Monica, indie
rockers Cibo Matto, rapper Queen Latifah, Sixpence None the Richer,
Beth Orton and country acts Kelly Willis and the Dixie Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   The caravan tour was founded by Sarah McLachlan, who'll also
perform. And why is this the final Lilith? McLachlan has decided
she wants to spend more time with her family.
</P>
<P>
   Lilith '99 will play 40 dates in 32 cities over two months,
kicking off July 8 in Vancouver, hitting Los Angeles on July 17 at
a venue to be announced, and closing up Aug. 31 in Edmonton,
Alberta.

`ENTRAPMENT': ACTORS ADD STRENGTH TO ROMANTIC ADVENTURE  
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(rk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The caper film ``Entrapment'' summons the days when being a
thief with taste was the profession of choice for the soigne movie
hero. It resurrects that art of gamesmanship by casting Sean
Connery as Robert ``Mac'' Macdougal, the kind of baronial art
connoisseur who has assembled his collection by unorthodox means.
</P>
<P>
   He presumably meets his match in Catherine Zeta-Jones' Virginia
``Gin'' Baker, the most glamorous of insurance investigators. When
the story sends these two to an elegant party, extras swivel their
heads to gape at Ms. Zeta-Jones in ways that don't look rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   Production notes for the film refer to the ensuing romantic
adventure as ``an electric pas de deux of wariness and
attraction,'' adding that it involves ``a daring plan for a
multibillion-dollar heist tied to the dawn of a new millennium.''
So it may not be a surprise to learn that the idea for
``Entrapment'' was sold on the basis of a seven-line proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the explanation for who the characters are and how they
got that way is similarly brief, since there's no good way to
explain them. Says Mac, when asked about his past: ``My situation
is so complicated, I can't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   And actually, he doesn't have to. Combine two stars of this
wattage with a lot of techno-talk and elaborate heist plotting and
you get plenty of good reasons to pay attention. The match between
these two may sound unlikely, but it works because it isn't forced,
and because both actors are so mischievously game. Besides, it's
not hard to believe that when Ms. Zeta-Jones' Gin begins performing
feline gymnastics at Mac's Scottish castle (another selling point),
Mac would pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Jon Amiel with cool efficiency like that of his
``Copycat,'' the film engages in mild cat-and-mousing about whether
either character is out to deceive the other. (The answers: yes and
yes.) But all it really needs are a surface gloss, a flirtatious
tone and a couple of thefts that are planned like military
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Truth in advertising department: ads that depict Ms. Zeta-Jones
in spidery crouch fake a much lower neckline than she wears in that
particular scene and give a sinister cast to what is actually a
gymnastic workout. Gin is actually preparing to dodge a cat's
cradle of laser beams during a burglary rehearsal so graceful it
suggests the movements of tai chi. The film finds many
opportunities for Ms. Zeta-Jones to show off her slithery skills in
this department.
</P>
<P>
   While she plays her role in fresh, headstrong fashion, Connery
has the effortless authority to give the film some ballast, and the
unalloyed charisma to make the whole thing look easy. It helps that
the romance isn't overworked and that his Mac has an imperious,
crotchety streak to keep his much younger partner at bay.
</P>
<P>
   With Ron Bass and William Broyles (the former editor of Newsweek
and Texas Monthly) as screenwriters, the script tosses in a
convenient prohibition that it would be ``against the rules'' for
these two to get involved. This is only slightly less credible than
the duo's ultimate gambit of trying to steal billions from a
Malaysian bank in the world's tallest building on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   That sequence, a vertiginous show stopper, combines new ways to
make the palms sweat with a humorous nostalgia for how heists
worked when this genre was hot. Among the film's high-tech details
are its scheme for outwitting computers during only a few hugely
profitable seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It all boils down to getting access to a highly guarded computer
or two. ``This is it?'' Connery's character complains in disbelief.
``Whatever happened to money? Where's the good old-fashioned
loot?''
</P>

`WINDHORSE': STRUGGLES OF TIBETANS UNDER CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  ( Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earnest and committed, ``Windhorse'' dramatizes the plight of
the Tibetan people under Chinese occupation and repression by means
of the story of the disintegration of a single family.
</P>
<P>
   The film's claim to attention is enhanced not only by its focus
on yet one more example of the 20th century's bloody skein of
ethnic obliteration and the particular matter of China's attitude
toward human rights but also by the clandestine manner in which
parts of ``Windhorse'' itself were made.
</P>
<P>
   By necessity, according to the filmmakers, portions of
``Windhorse,'' which tells of murder, official brutality, cultural
and religious subjugation, exile and efforts to dilute the Tibetan
populace through intermarriage, were filmed within Tibet as if by
tourists making home movies.
</P>
<P>
   The credits for ``Windhorse,'' in Tibetan and Chinese with
English subtitles, are notable for the actors and crew members
whose names are withheld for fear of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   It is clearly a film with a cause, and it tells its story in a
straightforward manner beginning with a brief historical lesson
referring to the invasion by China in 1959, the destruction of
6,000 Buddhist monasteries and a million deaths attributed to
Chinese aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Produced, directed and co-written by Paul Wagner, whose credits
include the Academy Award-winning documentary ``The Stone
Carvers,'' ``Windhorse'' is also notable for its exotic locales,
including the Himalayas and the streets of Lhasa, the Tibetan
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Its primary characters are a brother, sister and cousin, seen
first as playful children in a rural village, where the prayerful
grandfather of the brother and sister is executed by the Chinese in
1979 for espousing Tibetan freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The film then vaults across 18 years to Lhasa. The brother,
Dorjee (Jampa Kelsang), and sister, Dolkar (Dadon), are still
living with their parents and grandmother, but these children have
followed different paths, as has their cousin, Pema, whose actual
name has been withheld.
</P>
<P>
   The sullen, angry Dorjee, who hates the Chinese, has no job,
drinks heavily and hangs out in pool halls and brothels. Dolkar, on
the other hand, is fluent in Chinese, sings regularly and
remuneratively in a disco and has a Chinese boyfriend, Duan-ping
(Richard Chang), an up-and-coming television producer who is eager
to promote her career. Pema has entered a Buddhist nunnery.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's life changes after the Chinese forbid the display of
images of the exiled Dalai Lama. Pema, who has seen one of the
other nuns dragged off by the authorities after they find one of
the banned pictures, cries out publicly for Tibetan freedom during
a visit to a marketplace in Lhasa and is arrested and assaulted to
the point of death.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that she will die in their custody, the authorities
release her to the family of Dolkar and Dorjee. As a result, Dolkar
rethinks her commitment to sing Chinese propaganda on a television
broadcast to China and Dorjee decides to join the resistance by
enlisting Amy (Taije Silverman), a visiting American, in
videotaping Pema's story so her testimony can be smuggled out of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese authorities are not blind to their activities.
</P>
<P>
   The film takes its title from prayer flags and scraps of paper
in mountain passes, the windhorses on whose backs Tibetans send
prayers to the spirits who look after them. Among these prayers are
prayers for freedom. &QL;

 &HT;    WITH PHONY ARAFATS AND TRANCE MUSIC, ISRAEL'S POLITICAL ADS GET
TOP RATINGS
 &HT;    500&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The casts feature heroic commandos, the plots are
rife with menacing conspiracies and the soundtrack includes a
psychedelic version of the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Israeli political advertising makes for a prime-time
smash.
</P>
<P>
   Television advertising began this week for the candidates and
parties in Israel's May 17 elections. Under the country's elections
law, all ads are shown nightly in a block of time provided by the
government on two national channels.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of a country famous for life-and-death issues and masses
of news addicts, the premier Monday night was the highest rated
event on television, with nearly a third of the country's six
million people tuning in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to watch it because the day after, every one is
talking about it and you want to be with them,'' said Niva Bar-On,
a 47-year-old social worker.
</P>
<P>
   The ads appear after the evening news programs, which themselves
have always drawn high ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising time is doled out according to the size of the
political party and dozens of parties are vying for seats in
parliament. There are five candidates for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for a 40-minute series of commercials that provide a
view of the changing, always tense and sometimes humorous Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the ads are becoming less focused on issues and more
on candidates, a sign that American styles for campaigning have
crept into Israel just as they have for cuisine and dress. In fact,
shows competing unsuccessfully with the ads on their first night
included the popular American sitcoms ``The Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air'' and ``Caroline In The City.''
</P>
<P>
   And, while the ads become more American, many also have Russian
subtitles, a nod to immigrants from the former Soviet Union who now
make up more than 15 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile there's some sizzle. A party advocating the
legalization of marijuana invokes psychedelic graphics and a trance
rock version of Israel's solemn national anthem. A religious party
shows its animated logo emerging from a note crammed between the
blocks in the sacred Western Wall. The logo bows repeatedly in the
way customary for Orthodox prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The featured prime-time battle, though, is between the left-wing
Labor and the right-wing Likud parties.
</P>
<P>
   From Labor, Israelis view old photographs of candidate Ehud
Barak receiving a medal from slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
disguised as an airplane technician while storming a hijacked jet.
</P>
<P>
   Pitted against this hero is the villainous Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. Labor shows a video clip of Netanyahu winking
in slow motion to one of his cronies. ``The only plan he has,''
viewers are told, ``is to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu's Likud has a show of its own, casting him as the
hero.
</P>
<P>
   The villain is now Barak and he has a secret ally portrayed in
one Likud ad as a trembling hand marking the days until the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's somebody who wants Barak to win,'' says the narrator.
``Then the day will come when he gets everything he wants.'' As the
camera pans back, the hand leads to an actor in the famous head
scarf and fatigues of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Experts say ads in previous years were more playful, but
American influences have made campaigns more serious and
professional. James Carville, a campaign adviser for U.S. President
Bill Clinton, is one of several American consultants on the Israeli
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Yoram Peri, professor of communications at Hebrew University in
Jerusalem said candidates are taking American advice to repeat
their themes and simplify their messages.
</P>
<P>
   He found more focus on the candidate and less on issues. Barak
is shown jogging with his wife and shaking hands with Clinton -- a
popular figure across most of the Israeli political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   But all the ads face a tough audience. Polls show only about 10
percent of Israelis are undecided in the upcoming vote. As people
who serve compulsory stints in the army and face spells of
terrorism and turmoil, they are hard to impress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does Barak have to say, that he was in the army?'' asks
22-year-old Golan Hermon, a Netanyahu supporter. ``So what? So was
I.''

 VINCENT D'ONOFRIO GETS OFF AT `THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Inside Trek
science-fiction column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative

 Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Vincent
D'Onofrio in a scene from ``The Thirteenth Floor.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For a guy who's a regular on the science-fiction screen, Vincent
D'Onofrio has surprisingly little good to say about science
fiction.
 &HT;    ``As an audience member I'm usually not interested in them,''
the actor says. ``I think a lot of sci-fi is done very poorly.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't into comic books as a kid, and I wasn't very big on
`Star Trek' or anything like that,'' he adds. ``As an actor,
though, I can sometimes get pulled away from my vision of me
fancying myself a dramatic actor if the sci-fi is interesting
enough.''
 &HT;    The sci-fi of Barry Sonnenfeld's ``Men in Black'' (1997)
stimulated D'Onofrio enough to take on the physically tricky role
of a farmer-turned-alien-cockroach in what turned out to be a
blockbuster hit. And ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' D'Onofrio's latest
cinematic journey into the otherworldly, captured his imagination
as well.
 &HT;    Based on Daniel F. Galouye's novel ``Simulacron-3'' and
co-produced by Roland Emmerich of ``StarGate'' (1994) and
``Independence Day'' (1996) fame, ``Thirteenth Floor'' centers on
an enigmatic tycoon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) whose death has
unexpected ramifications for his right-hand man (Craig Bierko), a
cop (Dennis Haysbert), a mystery woman (Gretchen Mol) and a
computer genius named Whitney, played by D'Onofrio.
 &HT;    The plot thickens when it's revealed that all of the characters
are leading parallel lives in 1937, and that none of them may be
who they believe they are.
 &HT;    The versatile D'Onofrio _ whose credits include Stanley
Kubrick's ``Full Metal Jacket'' (1987), the genre outing ``Strange
Days'' (1995) and ``The Newton Boys'' (1998) _ thus plays two roles
in the May 28 release: the mild-mannered, emotional Whitney and the
mean-spirited, dry Ashton, a bartender at a swanky Los Angeles
night club.
 &HT;    ``What I do first with any character is to work on posture, what
he wears, how he looks and talks, the exterior stuff,'' the
soft-spoken 39-year-old says by telephone from his New York home.
``Then I cover the interior _ how he feels and reacts, and what he
thinks.
 &HT;    ``In this particular case,'' he says, ``I had to do everything
twice and make sure that I wasn't giving anything away too soon or
too late. That was interesting _ that was my challenge. You don't
fall asleep on the set, let's put it that way.
 &HT;    ``I tried hard, but it's always a crap shoot,'' the actor
concludes, ``because once you leave the set and the film is done
shooting, it's up to the filmmakers to sort out whatever they've
got of you on film. So I hope what I tried to achieve is on the
screen.''
 &HT;    Beyond D'Onofrio's dual performances, moviegoers heading up to
``The Thirteenth Floor'' can count on dazzling special effects,
stylized imagery and a complex plot that blurs the lines between
life and death, present and past, reality and virtual reality.
 &HT;    ``I hope `The Thirteenth Floor' is thinking man's sci-fi,'' the
actor says. ``Basically, though, it's a technological thriller, a
film designed to thrill and to entertain.''
 &HT;    D'Onofrio himself could use a doppelganger, so busy has he been
of late. In the next few months he'll turn up in ``Abbie,'' a
biopic he produced and stars in as 1960s activist Abbie Hoffman, as
well as in the black comedy ``Successful People'' and ``The
Velocity of Gary,'' a drama about AIDS, death and love in which he
co-stars with Salma Hayek. He'll even keep his science-fiction hand
in with a segment of the anthology ``Alien Love Triangle.''
 &HT;    ``I don't want to give too much away about `Alien Love
Triangle,''' the actor says. ``My segment is called `The
Impostors.' It's with Gary Sinise, Tony Shalhoub and me, and it's
directed by Gary Fleder.
 &HT;    ``I've seen the segment and it's great,'' he says. ``There's
this one amazing, amazing scene with Gary that you've just got to
see. It's me interrogating Gary _ and no, I'm not an alien.''
 &HT;    But back to ``The Thirteenth Floor.'' By opening the film on May
28, Columbia Pictures is gambling big that it can find an audience
in the shadow of ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.''
 &HT;    Does D'Onofrio think the ``Floor'' plan will work?
 &HT;    ``I'm hoping we do well,'' he says. ``I'm a little skeptical,
though, because it is going to be the summer of `Star Wars.'
 &HT;    ``I understand the idea of counter-programming us and,
hopefully, `The Thirteenth Floor' will stand on its own. You can
only hope for the best.''

VETERAN TRIES TO SPUR HISPANIC ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT

 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The toughest part, said Jorge Mariscal, is
getting past the pride and patriotism of the Hispanic community to
ask the harder questions about war. Especially since two of the
three prisoners of war being held in Yugoslavia are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Spc. Steven M. Gonzalez, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, and Staff
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles were captured along with
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, if Smiths Creek, Mich., March
31 on the Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal, a professor at the University of California at San
Diego and the editor of the new book ``Aztlan and Viet Nam: Chicano
and Chicana Experiences of the War'' (University of California
Press), served a tour in Vietnam before returning to take part in
the anti-war movement. Since then, he has lobbied to keep
Mexican-Americans out of America's wars, but he sees his anti-war
stance as losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between Vietnam and the conflict with
Yugoslavia are piling up, said Mariscal, while patriotism among
Hispanics seems to be on the rise. ``I've been distraught for the
last month, precisely because of that reason,'' he said. ``There's
no questioning going on ... A lot of history has been forgotten.
It's been removed and it's been erased.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many parents of these soldiers are first-generation
immigrants who say, `I want my son to be in the military to show
our appreciation for living in this country,''' said Mariscal, who
argued his case Tuesday before a small audience in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Mariscal said, Hispanics, including those from
Puerto Rico, have given more of themselves to the U.S. armed forces
than any other minority _ more enlistments, more casualties, more
medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that struck me was how we had been left out of
the history books,'' Mariscal said. He said there was ``absolutely
nothing'' on Mexican-Americans fighting in the Vietnam conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to ``Aztlan and Viet Nam,'' Mariscal writes
of his father _ a first-generation Mexican-American who fought in
World War II _ getting up from his armchair and standing at
attention whenever he heard the ``Marine Corps Hymn'' on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal's uncle was aboard a ship sunk by kamikazes, and his
father's cousin was shot in the face in Korea. (``The bullet went
in his mouth, bounced off a tooth and rolled around inside. He spit
it out and survived.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories took on a life of their own, but the essential
message was the same _ military service was a family tradition,''
writes Mariscal.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal, who served as a military policeman in Vietnam from
1968 to 1969, returned to join anti-war demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth ``Betita'' Martinez, who edited a newspaper for
Hispanics in New Mexico in the 1960s and 1970s, joined Mariscal
Tuesday as he called for anti-war activism. Martinez, now a San
Francisco resident, said, ``The pressure to be patriotic can be
seen in the yellow ribbons flying from the homes of the two
Chicanos captured in Kosovo. You've got a whole community of young
men under this increased pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't likely to change, said Mariscal. Demographics show
that the largest contingent of 18-year-old males in the United
States for the next 50 years will be Hispanics. ``And the U.S.
military is after Latina women in a big way,'' he added.

   WASHINGTON _ Heart-rending images of refugee children from
Kosovo have led to hundreds of adoption inquiries, but the
government and private agencies are advising prospective parents
that now is not the time to try to bring the children to this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We applaud the concern people have for Kosovo, but adoption is
not feasible at this point,'' said Maureen Evans, executive
director of the Joint Council on International Children's Services
of Cheverly, Md., which represents licensed international adoption
agencies and parent and advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Evans explained that with conditions so unsettled among the
estimated 500,000 Kosovars forced from their homes by Serbian
troops, children depicted as orphans in television and newspaper
accounts may actually have relatives who can care for them.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption is not a realistic possibility until relief workers
have sufficient time to sort out who is temporarily separated from
parents, who has relatives elsewhere and who is truly an orphan,
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department is echoing this view. ``In a crisis
situation such as Kosovo is experiencing at the present time, it
can be extremely difficult to determine if children whose parents
are missing are truly orphans,'' says a statement on a department
page on the Internet. For those who are orphans, ``staying with
relatives in extended family units is generally a better solution
than uprooting the child completely.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokeswoman Nyda Budig said officials also put
the statement on its phone-options menu. The agency's Office of
Children's Issues _ which oversees international adoptions _ has
been ``inundated'' with hundreds of adoption inquiries since
U.S.-led NATO forces began the air war March 24 over Serbia, she
said. Serbia is Yugoslavia's dominant republic, and the rebellious
Kosovo is its southernmost province.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption agency officials say they are used to a surge of
interest any time an international crisis puts displaced children
on the nightly TV news and newspaper front pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there's a lot of media attention, when you see the
heart-breaking images, that's when we get the calls,'' said Andrea
Stawitcke, executive director of Bay Area Adoption Services, based
in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Stawitcke said her agency has received about two dozen phone
calls and e-mail inquiries about Kosovo-related adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of refugee children separated from their
parents is difficult to determine. About 800 Kosovar Albanian
parents have reported missing children that so far have not been
found on International Red Cross lists of children alone. The
actual number may be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Another complicating factor is the uncertain legal status of
refugee children. Under U.S. immigration law, only children legally
classified as ``orphans'' can gain admittance to the United States.
To qualify, children must have parents who are be dead or who have
abandoned them. Such children typically reside in orphanages when
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, a child qualifies as an orphan if a surviving
parent has ``irrevocably released the child for emigration and
adoption,'' and says so in writing, according to a U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service advisory to prospective adopting
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The INS requires a mountain of paperwork to complete an
international adoption, including proof that the pertinent foreign
nation's laws for obtaining custody have been obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. must have diplomatic relations with the country and
an embassy through which the paperwork can be processed,'' said
Stawitcke. ``Otherwise, with few exceptions, the INS won't let them
in.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomatic ties to Yugoslavia have been broken since the
start of the NATO air campaign. ``There is no relationship,'' said
Tomilee Harding, executive director of Christian World Adoption in
Hendersonville, N.C., which has fielded ``a couple dozen''
inquiries since the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Harding says her group also counsels parents not to pursue a
Kosovo-related adoption. ``You really want to help these children,
but you have to be cautious,'' Harding said. ``You have to remember
you're dealing with human lives forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Bouwma of Bethany Christian Services of Grand Rapids,
Mich., which runs an orphanage and group home for children in
Albania, said refugees are arriving at border crossings to
neighboring Albania and Macedonia with no paperwork of any kind,
let alone documents that might form the basis of an international
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``this is not a child-supply frenzy that we
should be jumping into.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, relief agencies must concentrate on ``trying to help
these kids put their lives back together where they are,'' Bouwma
said. Eventually, he added, some of the refugee children might be
eligible for adoption. But that stage is ``a long, long way down
the road, as we see it.''

THE OLDEST ACTION HERO: HEY, MR. CONNERY: IT'S TIME TO SAY NEVER
AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike ``The Matrix,'' which says that nothing is what it seems
in a virtual sense, ``Entrapment'' lays out a
nothing-is-as-it-seems story the old-fashioned way. It's stuffed
with plot turns and character revelations that hark back to stylish
caper movies such the Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn picture
``Charade,'' and the Steve McQueen/Faye Dunaway film ``The Thomas
Crown Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   (A ``Crown'' remake with Pierce Brosnan is scheduled for release
later this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Like those movies, ``Entrapment'' depends mightily on the
presence of its stars, Sean Connery and the remarkable Catherine
Zeta-Jones, to do much of its work. The sheer charming sex appeal
of movie stars doing bad things, to the world and each other,
shouldn't be discounted.
</P>
<P>
   And it's paced a little slower, as well. In fact, the lolling
rhythm of director Jon Amiel is a contradiction to the 100 percent
crank that action directors add to movement sequences these days.
``Entrapment'' starts with a risky robbery of a masterpiece
painting from a skyscraper _ the kind of audacious burglary that
put an end to the phrase ``second-story man,'' and gives new
meaning to ``cat burglar.''
</P>
<P>
   But the low-key quality that Amiel gives the film seems almost
willfully benign. Zeta-Jones is the insurance investigator obsessed
with bringing in the master thief (Connery) who has eluded capture.
She stalks her prey, and goes undercover to apprehend him. Or does
she?
</P>
<P>
   When Connery shows up on the scene as the 60-year-old superthief
who has perplexed investigators forever, cinema's legendary
no-nonsense guy cuts a fine figure. But he looks his age. And as
Zeta-Jones circles him in the push-and-pull dance of opposites
attracting, we have a hard time looking at this screen romance
between a lush babe and a man who seems old enough to be her
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Even though we tend to cut Connery a lot of slack for his bluff,
bare-knuckled persona, it's embarrassing to witness this tableau.
We shake our heads in disbelief that this nearly 70-year-old man
can romp through these stunts, outrunning and outperforming a
twentysomething woman whose workout to prepare for their big theft
is like some strenuous, soft-core version of tae-bo. (He can't
blame being forced into this on ``Entrapment's'' producers, either;
Connery is one of the film's producers.)
</P>
<P>
   Connery gives one of his greatest performances here _ he does
all of this stuff with a straight face. When it comes to old-school
masculinity maintaining its hairy-chested cool in crisis, no one is
better than Connery. He still has the burly self-possession and
regal bearing of a tiger. His bemused gravitas and baritone purr
are what we go to the movies for, and they're almost enough to make
us forget that scene in ``The Avengers'' _ all nine of us who saw
it _ when we cringe because Ralph Fiennes hits him and Connery's
age registers more than it ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Zeta-Jones has the physical confidence of a movie star, not to
mention good looks bestowed by the gods. ``Entrapment,'' with its
high-tech devices and low-impact story, has a supporting cast that
helps enormously in keeping it going. Ving Rhames is Connery's tech
support, Will Patton plays Zeta-Jones' boss, and Maury Chaykin is
Zeta-Jones' bratty equipment supplier.
</P>
<P>
   By the last third of the movie, there's some jeopardy and
tension going. ``Entrapment'' begins to work up a sweat with its
gambit-switching, which is intent on leaving you unsure where the
characters stand with each other. But by then, you may no longer
care.

TOMATOES ASIDE, NAFTA IS A PEACHY DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give some of the credit to La Nina. But give most of it to La
NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking tomatoes here.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where you live in this party to the tripartite
(United States-Mexico-Canada) North American Free Trade Agreement,
you may, if you frequent the produce sections of supermarkets, have
detected a significant drop in the price of tomatoes during the
past month.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the mild, warm weather sent our way by the South
Pacific water nymph, most tomato growers have hauled in good
harvests, creating a welcome supply-over-demand ratio for U.S.
tomato consumers. NAFTA has made the deal even juicier for U.S.
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the free-trade agreement, Mexican tomato growers have
a decided advantage over Florida tomato growers. Because Mexican
tomatoes are cheaper, U.S. supermarket chains get 65 percent of
their tomatoes from Mexico and 35 percent from Florida. That's just
the reverse of the way that things stood tomato-wise before NAFTA
jumped from concept to reality in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Florida tomato growers are not happy. Some of
them are going out of business. To all of them, the five-letter
acronym NAFTA is a four-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   California Brussels sprouts growers and Washington apple growers
also know the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA obviously has its winners and losers. But overwhelmingly,
it is a winning proposition. Most farmers in all three countries
are benefiting from it.
</P>
<P>
   But we're talking more than fruits and vegetables here.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about a mushrooming escalation of trade in all
kinds of goods among the three countries. That increase in trade
can be readily discerned from the interminable caravans of
tractor-trailers snaking their way northward and southward through
Texas to other parts of the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of that trade is traffic congestion on the
interstate highways. That vehicular coagulation has become so heavy
that a lobby called the North America's Superhighway Coalition has
been formed to press for increased federal funding to expand and
maintain Interstate 35 from Texas to North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Congestion spawned by trade, however, is a good problem to have.
And the need for highway construction that it causes has the effect
of creating more construction jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, of course, are NAFTA's primary reason for being. It's
creating them in all three countries.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of NAFTA used to speak of a ``great sucking sound'' by
way of suggesting that U.S. jobs would be lost to Mexico because of
cheap labor in that country. But the United States is enjoying
historically low unemployment rates, and there is mounting evidence
of sucking in both directions. That trend was underscored
spectacularly a month ago when United Copper Industries opened a
manufacturing plant, corporate headquarters and national
distribution center in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   United Copper Industries is a wholly owned subsidiary of the
giant Mexican conglomerate Unida. Its $35 million,
373,000-square-foot complex in the North Central Texas university
town will employ 250 workers by this fall. Expansion plans indicate
that the plant eventually will hire more than 800 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The copper rod mill and wire and cable plant is believed to be
the first manufacturing plant built from scratch in this country by
a Mexican company. Some Mexican companies have acquired U.S.
factories or partnered with U.S. companies to build them. United
Copper's parent company is involved in joint ventures with General
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   But the real significance of the United Copper plant is that it
contradicts the sucking-sound predictions. Workers at the Denton
plant will average $37,000 to $38,000 a year. United Copper built
the U.S. plant because it needed a skilled labor force to operate
its high-tech, high-speed machines.
</P>
<P>
   It also needed the location along the NAFTA superhighway, I-35,
and near Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, Alliance Airport and the
railroad junctions in the area for shipping its products all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   United Copper is not likely to remain unique for long. Other
Mexican companies will build plants here for the same reasons.
European and Canadian companies, of course, were doing so before
NAFTA, and their numbers have grown since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   So we really are talking more than the price of tomatoes here.
We're talking bunches of additional jobs growing throughout the
NAFTA area, and a lot of green in the pockets and bank accounts of
Americans, Canadians and Mexicans.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Some combinations are just naturals:
baseball and kids, dogs and kids, T-shirts with dogs playing
baseball on them and kids.
</P>
<P>
   At least it seemed a natural to C.W. ``Dunk'' Duncan, owner of
Fort Worth's Arc Park, a family sports park where baseball, dogs
and kids often collide. Last year, Duncan decided his idea had legs
_ albeit shaggy ones _ and Sportsdawgz was born.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan plans to design an entire team of T-shirts. For now,
Sportsdawgz is offering Fetch, a golden retriever outfielder;
Slugger, an English bulldog power hitter; and Roc, a Rottweiler, at
catcher. The word is, Ivan Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers loves his
``dawg'' shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork is done by Fort Worth artist Dennis Farris. Coming
soon: Stretch, Heater, Flip, Chase, Shorty, Race, Digger and Cappy,
the team manager.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is donating a portion of the T-shirt sales to Alliance
for Children. He serves on the local board of the national,
nonprofit group, which works with victims of child abuse and has
centers in Fort Worth, Northeast Tarrant County and Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message of Sportsdawgz is to play the game for no
other reason than to have fun and be good sports,'' said Duncan.
``If we can help Alliance for Children toward that end, then so
much the better.''
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts can be ordered by calling Arc Park at 834-8888 or on
the Web at www.sportsdawgz.com. C.R. Paws, 4211 S. Cooper St. in
Arlington, also carries them. Youth-size shirts are $14.50,
adult-size $15.50 and XXL $17.50.

DEALING WITH GUESTS WHO GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being awakened by Casper-the-not-so-friendly ghost at 2 in the
morning is on my list of most frightening experiences ever. There
we were, face to face, his high-pitched wails blending with my
soprano screams.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I could control the shaking in my limbs, I ran out of
our bedroom so quickly that I left skid marks on the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with a run-of-the-mill sleepover one Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' I said to my son. ``Just don't invite that snoring
kid. He could wake the dead. You know I'm a light sleeper.''
</P>
<P>
   I picked the boys up after school, and they spent the afternoon
playing basketball in our driveway. After dinner, they played some
more until someone suggested telling ghost stories.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I did it. I made the suggestion, but I love to tell ghost
stories around a campfire. We didn't have a campfire, so we turned
out the lights and lit a candle. The stories got scarier and
scarier until my husband wrapped it up with his retelling of ``The
Headless Horseman.''
</P>
<P>
   When the boys bedded down, I suggested that we turn on the night
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' responded my son, who always uses a night light.
``Only babies use night lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'm not sure whether it was the spicy pizza or the tall
tales, but I soon found myself dreaming of ghosts and goblins. I
was running for my life in the twilight of my consciousness when I
felt a soft tap on my shoulder. My eyes flew open and there he was,
right at my bedside: the headless horseman himself!
</P>
<P>
   I screamed. He screamed. My husband sprang out of bed. All I
could see in the darkness was a pale, glowing mass waving its arms
like a Ninja windmill.
</P>
<P>
   Then the ghost spoke, ``Can I sleep in here?''
</P>
<P>
   After that, all you could hear was the pitter-patter of my feet
leaving the building.
</P>
<P>
   I was starting the car when I heard my husband's laughter.
``Honey, come back. It's only Dillon, our little guest.''
</P>
<P>
   I peeked through the door and sure enough, it was little Dillon
in a white T-whirt and white shorts. ``Can I sleep in here,'' he
asked again with tears on the rim of his blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I found my son's sleeping bag in the attic and slept
on the floor of his room so that Dillon and everyone else could get
some rest.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after Dillon had gone home, my son said: ``Can I
have a friend over next weekend? We don't have school on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just take a break next weekend. Maybe the following
weekend will be OK,'' I answered vaguely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great. Hmmm, now who should I invite?'' he pondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, son, did I ever tell you how much I like your little
snoring friend? He's such a nice boy.''

WEB SITE PLAYS ROLE IN FINDING MISSING GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHERINE SELIGMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A 5-year-old California girl was reunited with
her mother after a resident of a small Mexican town recognized the
faces of the missing child and her alleged abductor, the girl's
father, on an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the Polly Klaas Foundation's 3-year-old Web
site can be directly credited with solving a case, said Jenny
Thompson, a spokeswoman for the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma County authorities said the person in Mexico, who
requested confidentiality, had contacted the Petaluma, Calif.-based
foundation with details on the whereabouts of the girl. Foundation
officials gave the information to the district attorney's office in
Sonoma County, which had been working on the case since the girl
disappeared Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person just happened to be on the Web, picked it up and
put two and two together,'' said Sonoma County Deputy District
Attorney Ray Donnelly. ``It was the tip that got (the suspect) back
to the States ... We want to give full credit to that site.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Garstecki, 34, the girl's father, was deported from
Mexico on April 23 and is being held in Ajo, Ariz., on charges of
child stealing. An extradition hearing that would send him back to
California is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The girl ran into her mother's arms last weekend and was
``pleased to be back,'' according to Kristin Allen, the district
attorney's investigator on the case. The girl appeared
undernourished and was extremely dirty, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had clothing on that didn't fit her by a long shot,''
Allen said. ``She had toddler clothes on and a pair of shoes that
were two sizes too small, and it looked like she'd been wearing
them a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said additional charges could be filed against Garstecki,
depending on how the girl had been treated.
</P>
<P>
   Garstecki had been sighted at a former home in Joshua Tree in
San Bernardino County, Calif., and in Las Vegas, Allen said. The
man reportedly been working in the computer field while a fugitive
and was living in a house with his daughter when he was
apprehended, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, who has sole custody, declined comment
Wednesday, but told foundation officials she was grateful for
public support and help during her ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said foundation workers were excited about the role the
Web site had played. ``It's rare that you know this is why'' the
case was solved, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation had passed out brochures about the girl when her
father allegedly failed to return the girl to her mother at the
Santa Rosa Police Department after a visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site posted several pictures of the smiling child, who
was among 20 other missing children from the western United States
listed there.

   Looking Under the Hood
</P>
<P>
   Documentaries about the making of movies are turning up
frequently on digital videodisc, but a good one will be available
next week on videocassette.
</P>
<P>
   The film is ``Taxi Driver'' (1976), Martin Scorsese's dark
classic about the disturbed Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), who
goes berserk after life on the mean streets gets the better of him.
Viewers can watch the film, reissued by Columbia Tri-Star, and then
settle in for a few insights from Scorsese, screenwriter Paul
Schrader, De Niro, Jodie Foster and others.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader says he was between relationships at the time and
hadn't spoken to anyone for weeks. The taxi was a metaphor for
loneliness. He wrote the script, considered a masterpiece, in 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was in Rome working in Bernardo Bertolucci's ``1900,''
De Niro returned regularly to New York to practice his taxi
driving. He and Scorsese say they both identified with Bickle's
rage and craziness. ``I was 31 or 32, and I felt those feelings,''
Scorsese says.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Foster, who was barely a teen-ager, had worked for Scorsese
on ``Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.'' This time, she says, ``he
called up my mother and said he wanted me to play a street
prostitute in New York. My mother said, `I think she's totally
wrong for it, but if you want me to bring her in, OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   Declaring Independence  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy asked, `Should I Slamdance?,' and I had no idea what
he meant,'' said filmmaker Marina Zenovich. Shortly thereafter, she
took her camera to Park City, Utah, and roamed all the ``dances''
held there every January: the mainstream Sundance Film Festival,
its alternative spinoff, the Slamdance Film Festival, and the
alternative to the alternative, called Slumdance.
</P>
<P>
   Independent filmmaking is a much chewed-over topic these days,
but the observations take on some freshness in Ms. Zenovich's 1997
documentary ``Independent's Day,'' released this week by New Video.
</P>
<P>
   Slamdance, of course, is where some directors take their movies
after they have been turned down by Sundance. With everybody trying
to land a distribution deal, it gets frantic in Park City. ``Cheap,
mean, rude, pushy,'' says an exasperated local resident.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the festivalgoers, Robert Redford, Sundance's
founder, says he likes the sense of place and the collegiality.
Jeffrey Gilmore, the festival's artistic director, says it's not
the deal that's important but the learning and mixing with other
film makers.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but ``it's not about art, it's about business,'' Redford
says later. Steven Soderbergh, Bryan Singer, Tom DiCillo, Neal
LaBute, Eric Schaeffer, Tony Vitale and other better-known young
directors, most of them Sundance veterans, tell why the deal's the
thing. The most heartening case study belongs to Greg Mottola,
whose first feature, ``The Daytrippers,'' shot in 16 days, was
turned down by Sundance but was shown at Slamdance and then at
Cannes. In New York, the film ran for five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring a rare double on the Park City festival circuit, Ms.
Zenovich's film got seed money from Slamdance and finishing money
from the Sundance Channel. The price is $19.95. Information: (800)
314-8822.

   NEW VIDEO RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   You've Got Mail
</P>
<P>
   Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan converse
intimately and anonymously on the Internet about things they
wouldn't have the slightest reason to discuss if they knew each
other in the flesh. Kathleen runs a cozy little children's book
shop about to be put out of business by Joe's very big bookstore on
the Upper West Side of Manhattan. That suggests a difference of
approach, and when the two actually meet, while remaining unaware
that they are chat room confidants, they keep their defenses high.
Still, there's enough of a spark between them to withstand all the
expectable misunderstandings in Nora Ephron's film, which, Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``becomes a New York story
reminiscent of early Woody Allen romances.''
</P>

   1998. Warner. $22.96. 119 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Release
date: May 4.

<P>
   Babe: Pig in the City
</P>
<P>
   That sweet little porker who saved the day for farmer Hoggett in
``Babe'' has to do it again under decidedly different circumstances
in the big, bad city. After Hoggett takes a spill down a well, Babe
and Mrs. Hoggett fly off to a menacing, strikingly depicted
metropolis to raise money to save the farm. Left alone after Mrs.
H. mistakenly gets caught in a drug sweep at the airport, Babe
lands in a very odd part of town modeled after Venice. There he
finds shelter at the Flealands Hotel, which houses warring armies
of cats and dogs, some world-weary chimps, an orangutan named
Thelonius and a pregnant floozy of a poodle. The real charmer,
though, is a pit bull who envisions Babe as an animal-rights leader
in a film whose ``occasional taste for dark moments and
unappetizing sights makes its G rating somewhat questionable for
very young children'' (Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1998. Universal. $22.98. 97 minutes. Closed captioned. G.
Release date: May 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Thief
</P>
<P>
   Traveling by train with her 6-year-old son, Sanya (Misha
Philipchuk), a dewily beautiful young mother named Katya
(Yekaterina Rednikova) meets and immediately falls for Toylan
(Vladimir Mashkov), a seductive army officer with a likeness of
Stalin tattooed on his chest. The year is 1952 in the Soviet Union,
and to secure space in an already crowded apartment, Katya agrees
to pretend Toylan is her husband. Jammed into a single room with
the lovers, Sanya can only look on. While they disapprove of the
situation, the proprietors become fond of the boy and soon are
disarmed by Toylan, as are other boarders who are taken in by his
air of camaraderie and his boozy toasts to Stalin. Only later does
Katya learn that she has fallen in with a thief and schemer,
inspiring a bitter blend of love and fury that helps give Pavel
Chukhrai's ``story of fatherly betrayal its insinuating power''
(Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1997. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36. 97 minutes. Russian with
English subtitles. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time, appeared on television or been on
videocassette in earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   CROWS. In Dorota Kedzierzawska's small, exquisitely photographed
Polish allegory, a scrappy 9-year-old girl (Karolina Ostrozna)
fends for herself after being deserted by her mother, who brings
home a lover and locks the child out. Tossed into the street and
ostracized by everyone from hustlers to school teachers, the child
(who remains nameless) rebels by kidnapping a toddler and declaring
herself a mother. Though all of this is captured with great visual
appeal, the film, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times,
``yields little complexity and few surprises.'' 1996. New Yorker.
$89.95. 66 minutes. Polish with English subtitles. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   PAINTING THE WORLD. Four 30-minute programs from the National
Gallery in London illustrate styles and beliefs from the 15th
through the 19th centuries. Works discussed include Hans Memling's
``Donne Triptych,'' Paolo Veronese's ``Family of Darius Before
Alexander,'' Peter Paul Rubens' ``Autumn Landscape With a View of
the Het Steen'' and Joseph Wright's ``Experiment on a Bird in the
Air Pump.'' 1999. Home Vision. Two cassettes, $39.95. 120 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   REAR WINDOW. Broadcast on ABC, the film is less about remaking
the Hitchcock classic about a man with a broken leg who thinks he
has spotted a murderer than it is about reinventing Christopher
Reeve as an actor. ``Tasteful, engaging and extremely clever,''
Caryn James wrote in The New York Times. 1998. Artisan. $19.98. 89
minutes. Closed captioned.

Samuel G. Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia
University, is the author, most recently, of ``The Inheritance.''  
 (bl)  
 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``You see those trees, kids?'' I said to my
children, Aaron and Sarah, as our cab headed down Pennsylvania
Avenue toward the White House. ``Those are cherry trees.
Washington's famous for them. And it's a special time when the
blossoms are coming out, like now.''
</P>
<P>
   Poking my hand out the window into the balmy air, I indicated
the trees' long, tapered tongues of pink and cream. I was heady in
the hallowed role of father as tour guide, father as historian,
leading the family on its spring break tour of the capital,
inculcating the next generation in the glories of democracy, an
amalgam of ``Born Yesterday'' and ``Father Knows Best.'' Not even
the skeptical gaze of my wife, Cynthia, could shake me from my
reverie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, mister,'' the taxi driver interrupted almost
timorously, as if calibrating the effect of veracity on gratuity.
``Those are dogwoods. The cherries are down by the Tidal Basin.
They won't blossom till next week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogwoods, right,'' I mumbled, struck at just how long it had
been since I'd visited Washington for pleasure. Over the years I
had shuttled into the city scores of times as a journalist and
author: to sift through the National Archives, to interview the
star of a Broadway-bound show, to make the promotional rounds for
my latest book. Rarely did I allow myself any more leisure, though,
than paying homage at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial or taking a
daybreak run along Rock Creek Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years had passed since my parents brought our
family here for a long weekend similar to the one I was now
leading. And for two antiwar liberals _ Eugene McCarthy supporters,
avid members of the disarmament group SANE _ they had given my
brother and sister and me an unapologetically patriotic trek from
the Capitol to Mount Vernon to John F. Kennedy's grave. Now, in
retrospect, I recognized my folks' wisdom: they wouldn't abdicate
Americanism to the Cold Warriors and Vietnam hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia and I faced a similar challenge, albeit for tawdrier
reasons. We boarded the Amtrak from central New Jersey to
Washington on the first day of April with a goal of reclaiming the
capital from Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr and
Linda Tripp. Aaron, 7, had packed his red plastic binoculars and
Mickey Mouse autograph book for the journey. With every stop, even
pitiful Trenton and Wilmington, Sarah, 4, wanted to know if we
could see the Washington Monument yet.
</P>
<P>
   On arriving, we went directly to our hotel, a Doubletree Guest
Suites in Foggy Bottom, which we had plucked sight-unseen out of a
guidebook. Sarah dove for the covers and her afternoon nap, and
Aaron begged, successfully, for a visit to the Lincoln Memorial.
Drizzly as it was at the monument, the marble and limestone slick,
we found a tableau of populist communion. There were Rollerbladers
and veterans in fatigues, monks in saffron and women in chadors,
high school classes scrambling out of buses, fraternity brothers
practicing their cadence call.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron and I picked our way to the base of the Lincoln statue.
``Wow!'' he gasped. Then we turned to the southern wall, and I read
aloud the words inscribed there, the Gettysburg Address. Finally we
faced outward through the pillars, beholding the Reflecting Pool
and the Mall, dotted with open umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what happened here, right?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did he speak?'' Aaron asked. ``This side?''
</P>
<P>
   We were referring of course to the March on Washington and the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a Dream'' speech, which
Aaron had studied during Black History Month. We descended from the
portico to a small museum in the memorial's base to watch film of
King in majestic oratory as well as scenes of protesters for
legalized abortion and gay rights and Soviet Jewry and all the
other causes that plead their cases on this ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Martin Luther King know Abraham Lincoln?'' Aaron asked me
as we walked toward the Metro. For a long moment, I could not
answer.
</P>
<P>
   With every block we went, with each edifice we passed, more
questions arose. What's the Organization of American States? Why's
there a red cross on that building? Who was L'Enfant? The only
query I ducked concerned the Office of Thrift Supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the hotel, we rejoined Cynthia and Sarah, and on the
desk clerk's recommendation, one confirmed in our guidebook, we
decided to try the Italian restaurant next door, Donatello's. Three
main courses, one of them split by the children, and a few glasses
of wine came to $93 without tip. At least, I told myself, all the
Smithsonian museums are free.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, we set out for the Air and Space Museum,
the most popular attraction on this stretch of the Mall and, we
feared, the most crowded. Aaron and Sarah capered through the
Hirschhorn sculpture garden, just down the street from the museum,
as Cynthia and I surveyed the size of the crowd awaiting entrance.
We hurried in just after the 10 a.m. opening and made immediately
for the booth to buy tickets for both the Imax theater and the
planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   In between the shows _ the theater's history of manned flight,
the planetarium's introduction to astronomy _ we strolled through
an exhibit on the Apollo 11 moon landing and walked through a model
of Skylab, replete with exercise bike, collapsible shower and
``sleeping restraint,'' a sort of upright hammock.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you sleep like that?'' Aaron asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're tired enough,'' replied Cynthia, who had been roused
by Sarah at 5:30 every morning for the past week, ``you can sleep
anywhere.''

both lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Attractions
</P>
<P>
   THE CAPITOL, First and East Capitol Streets. We arranged a
family tour, free of charge, by getting in touch with Senator

ANTIQUES COLUMN: EAMES CHAIRS ARE BENDING THE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J., N.Y., Ill.)  (js) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1928 Charles Eames, an architecture student, was kicked out
of Washington University. Then he went on to have one of the most
distinguished careers in design.
</P>
<P>
   Eames' legacy is being celebrated in an exhibition that has been
touring Europe and that opens at the Library of Congress in
Washington on May 20. It will remain there through Sept. 14; in
October it moves to the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in
Manhattan. The show, ``The Work of Charles and Ray Eames: A Legacy
of Invention,'' also honors the contributions of Eames' wife, Ray,
who worked with him. The accompanying book, published by Harry N.
Abrams, costs $49.50.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is part of a renewed interest among auction
houses, galleries and museums in Eames and in 20th-century design
in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twentieth-century design is stronger than ever,'' said Mark
McDonald, owner of the Gansevoort Gallery in Manhattan. ``As the
century comes to a close, mid-century things are now antiques.'' He
continued: ``Americans were at the forefront of design in the
postwar period. There was a concentration of talent _ people like
Florence Knoll, the Eameses, George Nelson, Noguchi _ and a market
fueled by all the GIs coming home from the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wright, a Chicago dealer, said, ``Americans are finally
realizing Eames was one of the most important designers of the 20th
century.'' He added, ``It's sad that European museums were ahead of
us in collecting Eames furniture.'' He was referring to the Vitra
Design Museum in Germany, which has a large Eames collection and is
the co-sponsor of the traveling exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Wlodek Malowanczyk, who owns Collage 20th-Century Classics, a
Dallas gallery, said: ``Even Dallas is catching up. My customers
won't buy the expensive things yet, but they will buy collectibles
like Eames' 1945 DCM Chair, with metal legs and a plywood back and
seat.''
</P>
<P>
   After his dismissal from Washington University in St. Louis,
involving his advocacy of the ideas of Frank Lloyd Wright, Eames
(1907-78) traveled to Europe and designed a church in Arkansas that
caught the eye of the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen, then
president of the Cranbrook Academy in Michigan. He offered Eames a
fellowship at the academy. At Cranbrook, Eames met other
groundbreaking modernists like the artist Harry Bertoia and fell in
love with Ray Kaiser, an art student from California who would
become his second wife.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939 Eames went to work in Saarinen's architectural office.
The following year, while Eames was working as a resident
instructor at Cranbrook with Saarinen's son, Eero, the two
collaborated on a prototype of a modern chair that won first prize
at the Museum of Modern Art's Organic Design in Home Furnishings
competition. Nicknamed the Conversation Armchair, it had a plywood
shell, foam rubber cushioning, custom upholstery and four tapering
angled wood dowel legs. It was the first time a molded plywood
shell was shaped into three-dimensional curves. And it made a lot
of news.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 Eames married Kaiser, and they moved to Los Angeles ``to
try to mass produce molded plywood with complex curves,'' said
Eames Demetrios, Eames' grandson.
</P>
<P>
   He has created a Web site, www.eamesoffice.com, and opened the
Eames Office Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., to educate people
about the Eames philosophy. ``It's not about chairs,'' he said.
``It's a way of looking at the world.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II the U.S. Navy commissioned Eames to develop
plywood stretchers and leg splints for wounded American soldiers.
After the war the Eameses adapted their experience to the design of
furniture. In 1948 they designed the Eiffel Tower Chair, which had
a fiberglass shell with metal rod leg supports. It won the second
prize at the Museum of Modern Art's 1948 International Competition
for Low-Cost Furniture Design. The Eameses went on to create
chairs, storage units, tables and folding screens, most of which
were manufactured by Herman Miller in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two months work by Eames is expected to show up at
several auctions and at a fair devoted to 20th-century decorative
arts, beginning Saturday with David Rago's 20th-century modern
auction in Lambertville, N.J. (Information: 609-397-9374.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, dealers from as far away as Italy are expected to
participate in the Los Angeles Modernism Show at the Santa Monica
Civic Auditorium on May 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. is driving the market right now,'' said John Meany, a San
Francisco dealer who will be there. ``Since the movie colony
embraced modernism and started buying and restoring modern houses,
mid-century modern has gotten very trendy. Five or six years ago it
was Tokyo that was driving the market.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Los Angeles Modern Auctions, or LAMA, which specializes in
Eames, will also be at the Los Angeles show, along with
Malowanczyk. In addition, LAMA is conducting its own auction on May
16 in Beverly Hills. Highlights include the Eames Conversation
Armchair and three rare pieces that the architect R.M. Schindler
designed in 1934 for the Van Patten residence in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23 the John Toomey Gallery in Oak Park, Ill., in
conjunction with Wright, the Chicago dealer, and the Treadway
Gallery of Cincinnati is having four separate 20th-century sales in
Oak Park. For one, Wright assembled 150 Eames pieces for an
all-Eames sale.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's 20th-century decorative arts sale in Manhattan is on
June 10; Christie's is on June 11, at its new home in Rockefeller
Center, another icon of modernism.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald of the Gansevoort normally sells to American architects
and designers like Lee Mindel, Michael Formica and Thad Hayes, but
on Sunday he was in the Netherlands at the first Amsterdam Arts and
Design Fair, which focused on design after 1880. He was one of
three American dealers selling American furniture. Peter Loughery
of LAMA sold some Eames leg splints at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The icons go for very high prices,'' he added. ``In Europe
many can't afford to spend thousands on a side chair.''
</P>
<P>
   But the number of collectors is increasing everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when I recognized everyone who bid at my
sales in L.A.,'' Loughery said, ``Now it's maybe 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lambertville auction, also organized by John Sollo, will
offer several pieces by the craftsman George Nakashima, including
an end table with a beautifully figured Buckeye burlwood top, a
rare Makassar ebony console table with a trestle base, and a
spectacular walnut music stand.
</P>
<P>
   The market for mid-century modern pieces today ``is a lot like
the stock market,'' McDonald said. ``The business runs the way the
economy runs. People have money to spend, and they are optimistic
about the economy. Good things come out because people think they
will get good prices for them.''

`GET REAL': TEEN-AGE BOYS IN LOVE AND IN PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Carter (Ben Silverstone), the hero of Simon Shore's
likable British film ``Get Real,'' is a bright-eyed, principled
high school student who has known he was gay since the age of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his late teens, he has taken to cruising the public
restroom in a local park. While waiting in a stall one day, he
exchanges notes through a hole in the partition with a stranger
who, to his shock, turns out to be John Dixon (Brad Gorton), a
popular fellow student.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting each other outdoors, the two overcome their
mortification enough for Steven to bring John home with him (his
parents are out), where they have an evasive, bumbling
conversation, after which John, backing out of a tentative first
kiss, flees in terror.
</P>
<P>
   John isn't just any student; he's an Oxford-bound star athlete
and major high school heartthrob with a girlfriend, Christina
(Louise J. Taylor), who is a model.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Steven nor John can get the encounter out of his
mind. After a school dance in which they gaze longingly at each
other over their dates' shoulders, John barges into Steven's home,
drunk and in tears, and begs for help. A passionate, desperately
furtive affair develops, in which John swears he loves Steven but
forbids him to tell anyone or even to acknowledge that they're more
than distant acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' isn't the first movie to tell the star-crossed love
story of a gay teen-age nerd and his high-school jock boyfriend.
The same territory was covered a bit more fancifully in the 1997
British film ``Beautiful Thing,'' which was set in a working-class
housing project. The forthcoming American film ``Edge of
Seventeen'' (opening May 14), set in the Midwest during the 1980s,
also deals with an isolated teen-ager nervously dealing with his
own homosexuality and the suspicions of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Get Real,'' adapted from a play by Patrick Wilde, has
its sudsy moments, it offers a far more realistic and compelling
vision of teen-age growing pains and peer pressure than any of the
recent high-school movies from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Its finely tuned performances by Silverstone and Gorton have a
wrenching emotional veracity. The movie captures the excruciating
paranoia of a situation in which there's nowhere the lovers can be
alone except in each other's homes on the rare occasions their
parents are out.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has the more difficult role of the star athlete whose
aloof, self-confident pose crumbles when he is alone with Steven.
In the movie's most agonizing moments, John humiliates his lover by
playing it straight and barely acknowledging him. At one point, he
even has to beat him up to prove he's not gay.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways ``Get Real'' also feels like a formulaic
made-for-television drama. Steven's understanding mother (Jacquetta
May) and not-so-understanding father (David Lumsden) are familiar
types who never come into individual focus.
</P>
<P>
   Steven also has a best friend and confidante in Linda (Charlotte
Brittain), a next-door-neighbor who has her own little subplot
about an affair with a married man. Her character, an overweight
girl with a sassy mouth, is a cliched gay sidekick. The school's
ranking bully, Kevin (Tim Harris), is also a stock character.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Get Real'' and ``Beautiful Thing'' reveal how far movies
have come from the days of ``Tea and Sympathy,'' when a kindly
older woman intervened to ``make a man'' out of a persecuted
preppy, how far is that really?
</P>
<P>
   For these movies also sadly remind us that peer-group treatment
of those who are different (especially those who are perceived as
gay) is almost as brutal today as it was back in the dark ages of
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>

ELITE AIR FORCE TEAM GROUNDED AFTER ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force has suspended all performances by
the Thunderbirds, the service's precision flight team, for only the
second time since a fatal 1982 crash.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made after the Air Force reviewed an incident
in which two F-16 jets made contact while taking off at an air show
Sunday at Patrick Air Force Base south of Cocoa Beach, Fla. No one
was injured and both planes landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety is our No. 1 concern,'' said Maj. Gen. Glen Moorhead,
commander of the Air Force Air Warfare Center at Nellis Air Force
Base in Nevada, which oversees the team. ``We have a responsibility
to both the public and the team after an incident like this to step
back and take a hard look at our practices and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how long the Thunderbirds would be grounded was unknown as
team members flew home late Wednesday to Nellis, which is near Las
Vegas. An Air Force news release issued by the Air Combat Command
in Langley, Va., said the show schedule was suspended ``until
further notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Combat Command officials couldn't be reached for comment.
Master Sgt. Joe Kubistek, a Thunderbirds spokesman, couldn't say
how long the team would be grounded. The Thunderbirds are entering
the heart of their schedule, which calls for 66 shows at 43
locations this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moorhead's decision marks the first cancellation of
Thunderbirds' shows since 1993, when 14 appearances were scratched
because of a back injury suffered by the command pilot, Kubistek
said. The team's 1982 schedule was canceled after four pilots were
killed during a training exercise on Jan. 18, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suspension's only going to last as long as necessary to
ensure the safety of the public and the team,'' Kubistek said. Six
shows were planned for May, the first this weekend in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., followed by a stop at Nellis, the team's home
base.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing formation flying with solo routines, the Thunderbirds
typically perform about 30 maneuvers in a 75-minute demonstration.
The team is composed of eight pilots, four support officers, four
civilians and about 120 enlistees.
</P>
<P>
   Created on June 1, 1953, the Thunderbirds have made thousands of
appearances in the United States and around the world.

`ENTRAPMENT' FALLS SHORT OF POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 68-year-old Sean Connery is such an incomparable movie star
that he's probably incapable of making a totally bad movie. When
he's 105, he'll still be carrying big movies on his shoulders with
an ease that puts his younger rivals to shame.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true when it's a movie with exotic locations,
James Bondian production values and a co-star as a watchable as
Catherine Zeta-Jones, the young British actress who jumped out of
last summer's ``Mask of Zorro'' to something nearing major stardom.
</P>
<P>
   But their joint star vehicle, ``Entrapment,'' as enjoyable as it
is in a few scattered spots, could have been much better. It is
strangely paced (especially in the beginning), always confusing to
follow, and extremely awkward as a romance.
</P>
<P>
   Connery plays Robert ``Mac'' MacDougal, the world's greatest art
thief, an aging loner who lives in a Scottish castle, who has
become so wealthy from his life of crime he no longer needs to
steal, but can't resist the challenge of a lucrative caper.
</P>
<P>
   Zeta-Jones is Virginia ``Gin'' Baker, an insurance investigator
who long has been obsessed by MacDougal. She works for a company
that has just lost $24 million due to the theft of a Rembrandt
painting that has all the earmarks of a MacDougal cat burglary.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, Gin goes after Mac by pretending to recruit
him as her partner in a series of dangerous heists for which she
has inside information. But pretty soon it begins to look like Gin
may be a real thief herself, and right up until the fade-out we
don't know for sure who is what.
</P>
<P>
   To the film's credit, both stars hold the screen nicely, the
script provides some truly unexpected developments, the locations _
New York, Scotland, England, Malaysia _ are glamorous and
well-photographed, and there's a dandy climax outside Kuala
Lumpur's Petronas TwinTowers, the world's tallest buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But Jon Amiel's direction too often is ponderous and
disorienting when it should be light and smooth; and he makes the
twists and turns in Ron Bass's hyperactive script seem jerky and
annoying when they should be delicious and fun.
</P>
<P>
   Amiel also seems thrown by the problem of dealing with the
near-40-year age difference between his stars. There's a
self-conscious timidity to the romantic scenes that makes them
surprisingly uncomfortable to watch. Everyone, including Connery,
seems to be embarrassed by this relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Like all films that deal with modern high-tech crime, the
methodology is so complex and antidramatic that ``Entrapment'' is
never terribly engrossing as a thriller. The mechanics of bypassing
security codes or hacking a supercomputer are not visually
gripping. Too many of the film's robbery sequences seem like dead
screen time.
</P>
<P>
   Entrapment. Directed by Jon Amiel. Screenplay by Ron Bass and
William Broyles. Cast: Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving
Rhames, Will Patton. 20th Century Fox. 113 minutes. Rated R for no
obvious reason.

`IDLE HANDS': ONLY FOR IDLE MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If timing is everything, then the recent carnage at Columbine
High School indicates that now could scarcely be less opportune for
the opening of ``Idle Hands,'' a cheap-thrills horror film built
around a teen-age murder rampage that reaches its climax among
panic-stricken students at a Halloween dance in a small-town high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Even pretensions toward the humorous and hip cannot save this
blood-drenched film from its innate tastelessness, calculated to
find its audience among those, like its hero and his friends, whose
vapid lives are a celebration of truancy, marijuana and junk food
in a virtually parentless habitat that stretches only from bed to
television set.
</P>
<P>
   Anton (Devon Sawa), the 17-year-old victim and hero of ``Idle
Hands,'' is so alienated from a connection to anyone but his two
pals, Mick (Seth Green) and Pnub (Elden Henson), that when he wakes
up in his attic bedroom on the day before Halloween, detaches
himself from his headphones and goes downstairs, he manages to make
his way through the house and eventually across the street without
noticing that his parents have been bloodily murdered during the
night.
</P>
<P>
   According to the slapdash script, written by Terri Hughes and
Ron Milbauer and directed by Rodman Flender, who served his
apprenticeship with Roger Corman, the town, and others like it, has
been the site of a series of murders.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, the story of Anton, who is eventually
possessed by a homicidal hand, which leads him to plunge a broken
beer bottle into Mick's head and decapitate Pnub with a saw blade,
is interrupted to track the listless exploits of Debi (Vivica A.
Fox).
</P>
<P>
   Debi, it seems, is descended from a long line of druid
priestesses who are trying to put an end to an evil force that
takes over the the laziest soul around. Eventually she hooks up
with Randy (Jack Noseworthy), introduced in a scene that pokes fun
at high school students mourning at a flower-filled memorial to
teen-age twins who are among the more recent victims of the demonic
force.
</P>
<P>
   So the main question is whether the repentant Anton, separated
from his evil hand with the aid of a cleaver, and his good-natured
pals, in the form of ghouls, and Debi and Randy can get to the big
Halloween dance in time to save Anton's girlfriend, Molly (Jessica
Alba), before the hand whisks her off to to hell.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not something that most moviegoers will want to
pay to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Idle Hands'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It involves bloody murder, resurrected corpses,
severed body parts, partial nudity during sexual foreplay, sexual

`WHITE OLEANDER': MOTHER'S IN JAIL, BUT HER DAUGHTER IS THE
PRISONER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ``White Oleander,'' Janet Fitch's affecting but overwrought
first novel, is set in a Los Angeles that's part James M. Cain,
part Joan Didion. The Santa Ana winds blow relentlessly in Ms.
Fitch's L.A., sowing fires and migraines and discord. It is a place
painted in the colors of film noir, a place where the hot wind
smells of laurel and creosote, and the toxic oleander plant
thrives. It is a place where lovers who kill one another ``blame it
on the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder that takes place in the opening pages of ``White
Oleander'' is committed by the narrator's mother, an imperious,
narcissistic poet named Ingrid Magnussen who poisons her boyfriend
Barry when he tries to dump her. Ingrid has long since dumped the
father of her daughter, Astrid; and with her mother's arrest and
sentencing to prison, 12-year old Astrid suddenly finds herself
without a family. Her reminiscences recount the picaresque story of
her journey through Los Angeles' labyrinthine foster care system,
while chronicling her efforts to come to terms with her formidable
and frightening mother.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mother-daughter portrait in these pages will
doubtless be compared to the one Mona Simpson drew in her powerful
1986 novel ``Anywhere but Here,'' the two books vary widely in
their effects. This novel not only lacks the nuanced, psychological
detail of ``Anywhere'' but it also tries to do something very
different. Whereas Ms. Simpson carefully delineated the day-to-day
life shared by her heroine and her heroine's mother, Ms. Fitch is
more concerned with the ghostlike role that the ferocious Ingrid
plays in her daughter's memory once she has left for prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid assumes a kind of mythic stature in her daughter's
imagination. Astrid will continually measure herself against the
standards of her mother's beauty and fearlessness (and find herself
lacking) while at the same time learning to hate her mother for her
selfishness, her cruelty and her ability to manipulate and charm.
Throughout her peregrinations from one foster home to another, she
will look for another woman to fill her mother's role, to provide
the love and sustenance she never had at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitch's descriptions of those disparate foster homes provide
the reader with a sociological tour through a veritable cross
section of Los Angeles. Astrid's first foster mother, a former
topless waitress named Starr, buys her new clothes (a tight pink
dress and matching pink high-heeled shoes) and has her baptized as
a born-again Christian; Starr will later shoot Astrid with a .38
caliber pistol when she learns that Astrid has been having sex with
Starr's boyfriend Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's observation that he is married but hasn't seen his wife in
two or three years makes Astrid feel dizzy, ``like I wanted to grab
hold of something heavy and hang on.'' With the disintegration of
her own family, she realizes, she has entered a world of permanent
flux. ``This was the life I was going to be living,'' she thinks,
``everybody separated from everybody else, hanging on for a moment,
only to be washed away. I could grow up and drift away too.''
</P>
<P>
   Astrid's subsequent foster parents include Ed and Marvel
Turlock, a lower-middle-class couple who use her as a maid and baby
sitter for their children; a wealthy Argentine exile named Amelia
Ramos who starves the children she takes into her home, and a
hard-drinking trash picker named Rena Grushenka who teaches her
wards how to go through other people's garbage and recycle their
finds as flea-market treasures.
</P>
<P>
   For a time Astrid finds happiness with an impossibly perfect
Hollywood couple named Ron and Claire Richards. He is a television
producer and she is an actress, and they live in a ``Leave It to
Beaver'' cute house. Claire nurtures Astrid's gifts as an artist,
enrolling her in classes at the local museum, and she encourages
her to sign up for honors classes in high school. Astrid will later
learn that Claire is a deeply troubled manic depressive, fearful of
losing her husband and fearful of the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   When Ingrid hears of her daughter's wonderful new life, her
possessiveness turns toxic. She tells Astrid she would rather see
her ``in the worst kind of foster hell than with a woman like
that,'' and she begins writing to Claire, playing upon her
insecurities and doubts. When Claire commits suicide, Astrid blames
her mother. She must later decide whether she should help her
mother try to appeal her sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Such melodramatic developments fuel the roller-coaster narrative
of ``White Oleander.'' Ms. Fitch displays an irritating penchant
for punctuating Astrid's story every few dozen pages with a
terrible event (from a shooting to a dog attack to an assault by
other children) as well as an intermittent taste for romance-novel
prose. (``So I just rode, the ocean spray tingling all over me, the
tide rising, filled with starfish and phosphorescence, into the
dawn.'')
</P>
<P>
   What keeps ``White Oleander'' from devolving into a television
mini-series is Ms. Fitch's aptitude for delineating Astrid's inner
life, for showing us the pull she feels between her mother (and her
mother's destructive impulses) and her own need for independence;
for showing us her craving for family and the slowly dawning
recognition that she must invent herself. The resulting novel is
frequently obvious and over the top but at the same time oddly
haunting.

   NEW YORK _ There is much to appreciate and to contest in ``Dance
for a City: 50 Years of the New York City Ballet,'' an exhibition
that the New-York Historical Society is presenting through Aug. 15
on the occasion of the City Ballet's golden anniversary season.
</P>
<P>
   Two magnificent portrait photographs by George Platt Lynes of
George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, the company's founders,
introduce the story at its start.
</P>
<P>
   Although undated, the Balanchine portrait shows the
choreographer as he appeared in other photographs shortly after his
arrival in New York from Europe in 1933. Russian-born, Balanchine
looks like the half-Georgian he was. The still-black hair and sharp
features are pronounced. Nearby, a 1930s group photo of the
American Ballet, the City Ballet's first precursor, is still signed
Balanchivadze, the choreographer's original and Georgian surname.
</P>
<P>
   Kirstein, his American patron and advance man, wears a business
suit like Balanchine. But Lynes catches the temperamental
differences between the two men with telling artifice. Hardly over
30, Kirstein is depicted as a brooding intellectual, leaning to one
side as if he were about to fall off his chair. Balanchine twists
in his chair and, suit notwithstanding, is the self-assured artist
aware of his performance before the camera.
</P>
<P>
   How such disparate personalities came together, as well as the
City Ballet's evolution to the present time, is retold through an
intelligent chronological sequence and an imaginative installation.
Layman and specialist alike will find something of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Garafola, a dance historian who was curator of the show
with her husband, Eric Foner, professor of history at Columbia
University, has done an admirable job of assembling material, some
of it unfamiliar, from a vast variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the exhibition, which is not a City Ballet project,
is not without quirks or errors. The strangest mistake comes
glaringly early in a description of Balanchine's choreography for
Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Europe. ``Le Bal'' is called
``the last work Balanchine choreographed for the Ballets Russes,''
when, as is well known, it was ``Prodigal Son.''
</P>
<P>
   A larger quirk may be tied to the New-York Historical Society's
own focus on the city. Does the show need to justify itself in this
museum by identifying the company as the embodiment of New York?
Certainly this is the line promoted in the captions and in ``Dance
for a City,'' a book of essays published in conjunction with the
exhibition (Columbia University Press).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garafola notes in the book that after the City Center of
Music and Drama invited Ballet Society, another Kirstein-Balanchine
troupe, to join the center by becoming the New York City Ballet in
1948, a popular-price policy facilitated ``a large working-class
and lower-middle-class audience.'' Poets and artists were also in
attendance. ``This diversity helps explain the extraordinary
richness of the New York City Ballet repertory during the City
Center years,'' Ms. Garafola writes.
</P>
<P>
   Not true. No amount of determinist concepts can obliterate the
fundamental cornerstone of the Balanchine-Kirstein collaboration.
They led the way, they did not follow.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, it strains credibility to read Sally Banes'
strong suggestion in the book that Merce Cunningham perhaps
``influenced the look of Balanchine's `Agon' (1957) and `Stravinsky
Violin Concerto' (1972),'' especially in the use of stillness and
``disconnectedness of dance phrases.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the idea of influence is used to undermine the City
Ballet's basic premises. It is no secret that Balanchine's
springboard for choreography was music while Cunningham's works are
not only  &UR; not &LR;  choreographed to music but also are deliberately
dissociated from whatever sound score is heard in a theater on a
particular night.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's musical structures account for the way ``Agon'' and
``Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' look, not Merce Cunningham's
esthetics. The entire exhibition cannot be understood if the role
of music as the springboard for Balanchine and his disciples is
relegated to irrelevancy.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that the City Ballet created its own universe; its
creators and members lived in New York, but the company is unlike
any other. It is only because the City Center established resident
companies like the New York City Opera and the New York City Ballet
that the ballet company bears the name it does today.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's gallery texts, taken from Ms. Garafola's book,
recall Balanchine's professional antecedents in the Diaghilev era.
There are programs, designs, posters and a rare Italian dancing
manual, a gift from Diaghilev. How close Balanchine still remained
with his family in Soviet Georgia is revealed by a letter he
received in New York in 1935: his mother asks him to promote the
music of his composer-brother, Andrei Balanchivadze.
</P>
<P>
   The section devoted to the American Ballet, so named by Kirstein
in his 1930s nationalist phase, and two successor troupes, Ballet
Caravan (directed by Kirstein alone) and American Ballet Caravan,
is particularly good on rarely seen photographs of its dancers
(including Michael Kidd and Erick Hawkins) and colorful program
covers.
</P>
<P>
   The striking aspect here, as in rehearsal shots from Ballet
Society, the City Ballet's immediate predecessor (1946-48), is how
theatrical the productions were. Kirstein maintained a strong link
with visual artists (from whom Balanchine sought to liberate
himself onstage). Hence the number of portraits of both men and
dancers by Kirstein's painter-friends of the moment, including
Pavel Tchelitchev, Lucian Freud and Paul Cadmus, Kirstein's
brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, photographs best render a sense of the company's
evolution. Some of the most magnificent portrait photographs of
Balanchine and his dancers in the early 1950s were taken by the
ballerina Tanaquil LeClercq, Balanchine's last wife. Irving Penn's
more theatrically posed images are also outstanding, and a
curiosity is a 1952 shot from the wings by Stanley Kubrick, who
later married the dancer Ruth Sobotka.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the core of the photographic display lies in the
performance shots over the decades. Generations of dancers in the
same roles are often seen on the walls of boxlike or curved
installations by Stephen Saitas. A costume and props from ``The
Nutcracker'' is, for instance, surrounded by images of dancers in
the ballet. Recordings from the scores are also heard and
videotapes can be seen on monitors.
</P>
<P>
   There is, rightly, a focus on Jerome Robbins' work in one
gallery as well as designs and photographs referring to other
choreographers who worked in the company, especially in the 1950s.
The company today is represented essentially by photographs of
dancers, and Ms. Garafalo's introduction to Peter Martins, the City
Ballet's current artistic director, wisely drops the misplaced
attack on him in her book and pays tribute to his leadership. The
virtue of the exhibition is its clear sense of continuity,
reflected in the City Ballet's own history.
</P>
<P>

A TOUR OF CABLE COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the next month the network sweeps period will bring specials
based on a premise programmers cling to as if it were a life raft:
that viewers can never get enough of treacly inspirational dramas,
bloated historical pageants and exploding vehicles of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   But while Joan of Arc struggles to disarm a nuclear bomb on a
high-speed train while singing ``Baby Love'' with Diana Ross (or
something like that), the true signs of television life are
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Cable series haven't rejected stale television forms; instead
they are mocking them, turning them against themselves to wry comic
effect. The results are wildly refreshing if uneven, and offer rare
moments of iconoclasm.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend brings several tongue-in-cheek cable shows. As he
did in ``Roger and Me,'' Michael Moore brashly explodes the
documentary form in ``The Awful Truth'' on Bravo, confronting
corporate executives as he blends television with social activism
(and makes himself famous in the process). Comedy Central's
``Uncomfortably Close With Michael McKean'' sends up puffy
celebrity interviews even as the host conducts one with Jason
Alexander, sitting on his front lawn because his house is encased
in a brightly striped tent the exterminators put up.
</P>
<P>
   More startling and inventive, ``The Tom Green Show'' is a skewed
talk show with filmed comic stunts. The star, a 27-year-old
Canadian, has cross-bred David Letterman, performance art, ``South
Park'' and Howard Stern to become MTV's latest instant celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite victims are his parents, who have returned home
from work to find their house filled with llamas and goats, and
awakened to find naked women painted on the hood of their car.
</P>
<P>
   Since it began in January, ``Tom Green'' has quickly become
MTV's second highest rated series. No. 1 is ``Celebrity
Deathmatch,'' the sly, hilariously written claymation show that
mocks wrestling-mania and celebrity culture. In the ring this week:
Antonio Banderas versus Cheech Marin.
</P>
<P>
   The major networks would consider these shows subversive, though
in many respects they provide a better measure of social attitudes
than the cautious networks ever could. In their popularity, quirky
cable shows echo the public's weariness with network banalities,
yet their own vestiges of celebrity worship demonstrate how hard it
is to ignore the famous, even when your brain tells you to.
</P>
<P>
   And when they are willfully rude, as so many are, they reflect
the cultural grittiness that is given a cosmetic gloss by the
network entertainment machines.
</P>
<P>
   The theme song for ``The Tom Green Show'' sums up the host's
sensibility and deadpan spoof of the talk-show form. He sings the
kind of embarrassing ditty more likely to be heard in the privacy
of the shower. At its farthest reaches, the tune seems to extend to
four notes and the words are the essence of vapidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Tom Green Show,'' it begins. ``It is my fa-vor-ite
show/Because it is my show.'' The song, like the show at its best,
is absurdly funny and catchy.
</P>
<P>
   The show's star has a goatee that makes him look demonic, and he
comes with two nonprofessional sidekicks. One of them, Phil, does
nothing but stand behind the fake window in back of the host's desk
(the set itself is a talk show cliche), sip coffee and give those
hearty sidekick laughs every few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of ``The Tom Green Show'' are the mischievous
on-the-street stunts meant to shock an unsuspecting public.
</P>
<P>
   In one, he rides a cow into a grocery store. He also seems
obsessed with drinking milk straight from a cow's udder, which he
has already done twice. This is rougher than David Letterman
dropping watermelons from a window, but you can see the genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent show, Glenn, the sidekick who sits next to the desk
and actually speaks, said he wasn't able to get away from his job
at the phone company for the taping in New York. (Both sidekicks
came along from the Canadian version of the show.)
</P>
<P>
   So his head was shown on a monitor, as the 20-something audience
asked him questions perfectly in tune with their generation's
concerns and the show's bluntness. ``What kind of loser works at
the phone company?'' one asked. Another said, ``I dream of being on
television, so do you think you're better than me?''
</P>
<P>
   In a sillier mood, Tom Wopat from ``The Dukes of Hazzard'' was
interviewed while the host wore a giant string bean costume, and
his sidekick was dressed as a giant carrot. If you're going to
interview minor stars, you might as well dress like a vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Green'' is the perfect companion to ``Celebrity
Deathmatch,'' which shares its sardonic, love-hate attitude toward
fame. Now in its second season, ``Deathmatch'' has maintained its
bright writing. Last week, Oliver Stone fought Martin Scorsese. As
the announcer said, ``The only thing these guys enjoy more than
crushing skulls is the art of cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   The match itself was complete with flashbacks, when seen from
Stone's point of view, and 360-degree camera swirls from
Scorsese's. This week's Banderas versus Marin fight is set in
Havana, with Fidel Castro as the guest referee. ``I want a good
fight; no hitting below the belt,'' he instructs the wrestlers.
``No seizing the means of production.''
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of decapitations and plenty of clay blood and
guts in ``Celebrity Deathmatch.'' But even shows that are not about
body-slamming sports come with reminders that viewers pay a price
for creativity on cable, where budgets are low and audiences young.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it helps to have the mental attitude of a 15-year-old
boy, addicted to gross-out humor. There's no delicate way to
describe the ``Tom Green Show'' stunt in which he put dog poo on
his microphone before sticking it under the noses of people on the
street, saying, ``Tell me about New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Scatological humor is centuries old, of course, but it has
rarely been used so often and with less sophistication than on
these cable shows. (The writers of ``Tom Green'' as well as Comedy
Central's ``South Park'' and its sketch comedy ``Upright Citizens
Brigade'' must have a lot to tell their therapists about their
potty training.)
</P>
<P>
   Compared to such adolescent humor, the unevenness of these shows
seems like a minor annoyance, a tradeoff for the freedom they have
to take risks. But it is tough to sustain satire; sometimes these
shows are best viewed in five-minute gulps (not the worst quality
to offer an audience prone to channel flipping).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   With some shows, five minutes is way too long. Comedy Central's
new ``Strangers With Candy'' is simply boring. The idea sounds
funny enough: Jerri Blank (played by the Off Broadway writer and
performer Amy Sedaris) is a 46-year-old former teen-age runaway, a
one-time drug addict and prostitute who returns home and picks up
her life right where she left off, as a high school freshman. Jerri
whips up a batch of drugs to get the other students to come to her
party; Jerri has a catatonic father who likes her half-brother
better than her.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly mocking the Afterschool Specials, the show lands with
a thud, proving that irreverence is no guarantee of comic success.
Much of the problem is that Ms. Sedaris' Jerri is so abrasive and
obvious, with a perpetual frown and exaggerated overbite. The show
doesn't fail on the grounds of bad taste, but of bad comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Youth may be the main audience for cable, but it is obviously
not the only one; the studio audience gathered in Chicago for ``The
Awful Truth'' is filled with balding 30-somethings. And just as
accurately as the ``Tom Green'' theme song, the opening of ``The
Awful Truth'' positions the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the millennium five men controlled the media,''
the announcer says, as we see Rupert Murdoch, Michael Eisner, Ted
Turner, Sumner Redstone and Bill Gates on top of a spinning globe.
Moore's guerrilla television means to challenge that stranglehold
on power.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing on ``The Awful Truth'' has been quite as funny or
satisfying as a segment from the first episode, in which people
dressed as Puritans chase after Ken Starr's car, waving copies of
the Starr Report and howling like extras in ``The Crucible.'' But
the show energetically reflects the lunacy of living in a corporate
culture. What celebrities are to ``Deathmatch,'' big-money
executives are to ``The Awful Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the show sends a thuggish-looking dock worker named
Sal Pirro to UPS, trying to get the company to make good on a
promise to add jobs; confronted on camera, public-relations
executives say the agreement holds only if their business
increases. Though the show's tactics got one laid-off UPS worker
his job back, Moore spends too much time being predictably
stonewalled by public-relations people.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks Moore awards the title Year's Biggest Polluter to
the industrialist Ira Rennert and tries to deliver the award at
Rennert's Rockefeller Center office. The results are
disappointingly tame.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the show becomes lively when it documents the effects of a
temporary restraining order Rennert got, ordering Moore to stay 150
feet away. That meant Moore could not show up at NBC's ``Late Night
With Conan O'Brien,'' taped in Rockefeller Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is seen doing the interview by yelling out the window at
Moore, who is standing on the sidewalk at a legally safe distance.
``The Awful Truth'' is best when it captures such absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   So is ``Uncomfortably Close With Michael McKean,'' which begins
by mocking the celebrity interview _ the supposedly surprise visit
by the interviewer, the star whose house has bugs _ and ends up
doing one anyway. Though it is closer to a genuine interview than
to the mockery of ``This Is Spinal Tap'' ( McKean's best role), it
is amiable and intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Few shows would let its guest go on, as Alexander does, with a
dryly funny story about his abysmal audition for Twyla Tharp. (The
show is a series of occasional specials, with three more to appear
this year.)
</P>
<P>
   In a different vein, VH1's highest-rated show, ``Behind the
Music,'' calls for do-it-yourself irony. Charting the careers of
rock stars, it often focuses on stories of losers and comebacks.
Its straightforward documentary form and hyperbolic narrative are
so hokey the show becomes campy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice embraced his strange destiny,'' the narrator says of
this week's subject, Alice Cooper, and the creation of his demonic
onstage persona. A sign of the show's impact is that ``Saturday
Night Live'' parodies it relentlessly, featuring actors as flabby,
delusional, aging rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the contemporary interviews with the subjects can be
remarkably candid. Alice Cooper talks about his recovery from
alcoholism, and last week's subject, Julian Lennon, about the way
he was neglected by his father, John. Perhaps the subjects open up
because they no longer have much of an image to protect, or because
the show never depicts them as less than musical geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   However seriously it takes itself, though, the series' best
episode may be the goofy classic that showed Milli Vanilli
performing onstage; when the music began repeating itself like a
broken record, they stopped lip-synching, froze for a second, then
dashed off stage.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a sardonic sensibility on the viewer's part to enter
cable's mocking world. Even then, it can take a while to get on any
show's wavelength. (Just as dipping into ``The X-Files'' for a few
minutes and expecting to get it would be futile.)
</P>
<P>
   The pithiest statement of the premise these shows are built on,
and the sharpest satire, may come from ``Upright Citizens Brigade''
(now in reruns and beginning its second season on June 15). Their
sketches include one in which people peer into a Bucket of Truth;
it seems to be an ordinary bucket but the contents, which we never
see, are evidently horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``The Awful Truth'' and other cable shows, here is a view
of the world more honest and often more entertaining than yet
another encounter with the networks' deadly Bucket of Glitz.
</P>
<P>
   Like most cable shows, these are replayed several times during
the week. Here is this weekend's schedule, along with weekly
premiere days for new episodes where they apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TOM GREEN SHOW,'' MTV: Saturday night at 11:30. New
episodes Thursday nights at 10:30.

<P>
   ``CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH,'' MTV: Saturday night at 11. New

ON STAGE AND OFF: NOTES AND NEWS OF THE NEW YORK THEATER 
</HEADLINE>

   The Power Of a Tony Jolt
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Broadway season effectively ended Wednesday, the
deadline for Tony nominations, bringing to a close what most
theater veterans say has been an odd year, devoid of the spark of a
blockbuster new musical and witness to the continued invasion of
British and Irish plays and very few new American entries.
</P>
<P>
   The season's final days were bumpy for producers: of the five
shows that opened in the last week, four received mixed to poor
reviews. The one to receive uniformly good notices, ``It Ain't
Nothin' but the Blues,'' which opened at the Vivian Beaumont on
Monday, had lackluster sales, with only about $25,000 worth of
tickets sold on the day after the opening.
</P>
<P>
   But now begins Broadway's second season, Tony Time, the theater
world's equivalent of the postseason playoffs. While everybody
wants nominations, which will be announced on Monday, some shows
will  &UR; need &LR;  them as pegs for marketing campaigns and as morale
boosters. The next five weeks are likely to determine the fates of
several new shows that may suffer if they receive no nominations.
``Marlene,'' at the Cort Theater, has already announced its
closing.
</P>
<P>
   The most competitive Tony category will probably be best new
play, where half a dozen strong candidates must give way to four
nominees. For ``Side Man,'' Warren Leight's acclaimed jazz drama, a
Tony nomination for best play has been the goal for several months.
</P>
<P>
   The producers have stuck with the play despite consistently
shrinking audiences and many recent money-losing weeks. The play is
considered a good candidate by handicappers because it is the only
new Broadway play by a living American playwright. Another
sentimental favorite is Tennessee Williams' ``Not About
Nightingales,'' which has had slipping sales this month.
</P>
<P>
   Of David Hare's West End imports, ``The Blue Room,'' ``Amy's
View'' and ``Via Dolorosa,'' the latter two are stronger candidates
for best play. Of the other British and Irish productions, ``The
Weir'' and ``Closer'' are doing decent business and are also strong
contenders, but mixed reviews may spell trouble for ``The Lonesome
West.''
</P>
<P>
   An Advertising Assault
</P>
<P>
   A week after ``The Civil War,'' Frank Wildhorn's latest musical,
opened to a chorus of harsh reviews, the producers have rolled out
a marketing counterattack, hitting the airwaves and suburban
newspapers with a barrage of advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The show's early financial numbers were not good. Scott Zeiger,
president of the Pace Theatrical Group, one of the production's
producers, said the daily box-office grosses since the opening have
been between $50,000 and $70,000. For the $7 million musical, the
gross for the week ending Sunday was $336,616, and Zeiger said the
weekly running costs were expected to be about $400,000, though
more is being spent on advertising now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very cautious at this level,'' Zeiger said.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating dismissive reviews _ Wildhorn hasn't had many good
ones _ producers invested $500,000 in advertising last week, going
after suburban and tourist audiences with advertisements on
television, radio and commuter trains, as well as in regional
newspapers and airline magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is such a thing as Manhattan's theatergoing
intelligentsia,'' Zeiger said, ``it has been beaten over the head
with the message not to go to `The Civil War.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zeiger said part of the challenge of marketing the show lay in
its title and subject, which sound ``bookish and tutorial.''
Advertisements emphasize its ``entertainment factor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The show has an advance of $2.1 million, small for a major
Broadway musical, but the thinking seems to be long-term, a
financial mindset that has sustained Wildhorn's other Broadway
musicals, ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' and ``Jekyll and Hyde.'' Both
survived bad reviews, but neither has recouped its initial
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's our threshold for pain?'' Zeiger asked, considering his
question for a moment. ``We believe in the show, and we're digging
deep. It's not like we need to turn it around; it didn't collapse.
We just need to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Chasing the Blues
</P>
<P>
   Ron Taylor can't read music and says he plays spirited piano
with the style of an amateur typist. But he can sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had a good ear,'' Taylor said. ``I always knew what
sounded right.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment seems especially true for Taylor lately in his
role as creator, co-author, associate producer and performer in
``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' a musical survey of the history
of the blues at the Vivian Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   ``This part is easy,'' Taylor said of performing.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 47, is a native Texan, and appropriately large, who gave
up football for theater. His Broadway debut came in the mid-1970s
in ``The Wiz.'' He said the idea for ``Blues'' came in 1987 when he
was taking a break from playing the voice of Audrey II, the
carnivorous flower in ``Little Shop of Horrors.''
</P>
<P>
   While preparing for a role in a Hank Williams revue, he started
researching some of the century's great unknown bluesmen. ``I
thought, `When are we going to do a show on these guys?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Taylor wrote a outline set in a bus terminal populated by the
ghosts of bluesmen past. In fits and starts, Taylor has simplified
and developed the idea with his fellow cast members and with the
director, Randal Myler. For several years, they toured regional
theaters, eventually landing at the Crossroads Theater in New
Brunswick, N.J., and stages in New York. Gone were the bus terminal
and ghosts; only the blues remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple show with a big message,'' Taylor said. ``No
matter where you're from, no matter your culture, you can get the
blues.''

THE KRESS FOUNDATION GIVES OLD MASTERS NEW FOCUS  
 GRAPHIC DIPLOMACY IN U.S. EMBASSIES  
 SPRING CLEANING ON THE WHITNEY ESTATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1961 the Samuel H. Kress Foundation gave more than $1 billion
worth of European art to American museums, universities and
colleges. Now, as this New York-based foundation is approaching its
75th anniversary, it is starting a program to encourage
institutions to explain the origins of European art in imaginative
ways.
</P>
<P>
   This week the foundation approved a $20 million, five-year
program, ``The Art of Europe in Context,'' to help finance projects
by museums and scholars intended to sharpen the public's awareness
of Old Master paintings: how and for whom they were made and how
they were originally viewed. Funds will also go toward the
preservation of European architecture as well as training
conservators and art historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``All works of European art in American collections are
orphans,'' said Marilyn Perry, president of the foundation. ``They
were made for a different time, place and audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpretative installations, historical research and
conservation projects are included in the program. ``It is from the
research of art historians and the work of art conservators that we
gain our understanding of the historical context and physical
condition,'' Dr. Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   The program also seeks to encourage cooperation between
institutions: for instance, a museum and a university. All grants
will be awarded competitively. Planning grants can be as large as
$10,000, and implementation grants can go up to $100,000. Some of
the kinds of projects the foundation is hoping to support are
special exhibitions and the creation of architectural models that
illustrate the original environment of a work of art, as well as
lectures, publications and film and video presentations.
</P>
<P>
   A series of six panels in the Denver Art Museum that were given
in 1961 to the institution by the Kress Foundation may be the
subject of one of the projects. The panels were created for a
proposed marriage between two great Italian dynasties of the 15th
century, the Gonazaga family and the Szforas, and are thought to
have been part of the sumptuous furnishings in the bedroom of an
Italian palazzo.
</P>
<P>
   When the announcement of the program was made this week, Timothy
J. Standring, the curator of paintings and sculpture at the Denver
museum, said he planned to apply for a grant that would help
recreate a bedroom using the panels along with furniture and
objects from the museum's collection to provide a historical
setting.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic Diplomacy
</P>
<P>
   In years to come U.S. embassies around the world will have an
unusual collection of American art. Besides paintings and
sculpture, they will display a selection of prints by artists like
Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg and Ellsworth
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit foundation called the Friends of Art and
Preservation in Embassies, established in 1986 to help raise the
awareness of American culture in U.S. embassies, has raised money
for art and has been given about 200 American paintings,
sculptures, works on paper, photographs, decorative objects and
pieces of folk art. On Friday, President and Mrs. Clinton are to
unveil a 10-color print by Jasper Johns that has been donated by
the artist to the foundation's print collection.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Carole Lauder, chairwoman of the Federation of Art and
Preservation in Embassies and the wife of Ronald Lauder, who was
ambassador to Austria in the mid-'80s, oversaw the print project,
which has become an annual event. Every year a committee picks an
artist who is invited to make a print, which will then be offered
to any embassy that wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lived in Vienna, it was nice to show off something
American,'' Mrs. Lauder said. ``Everybody is very patriotic and
proud of what you see, especially in a building that represents our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns' print recalls a combination of past and present and
includes an American flag, a photograph of Johns' father as a boy
sitting at his grandfather's knee and a version of his galaxy
image.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Cleaning
</P>
<P>
   That winning combination _ a perfect pedigree plus furniture and
decorative objects that reflect the ever-popular English-style
decor _ made for a runaway success. In three days and one night of
auctions that ended at Sotheby's in Manhattan on Sunday,
attractions included the contents of five homes owned by Betsey
Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the New York socialite and
philanthropist who died last year. Mrs. Whitney, who was the wife
of John Hay Whitney, the financier, publisher and former ambassador
to Britain, who died in 1982, left more than $300 million worth of
art by van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso and other masters to four major
museums. Last week her two daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara
Wilford, sold the bulk of their mother's estate to help pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For five days Sotheby's transformed its York Avenue headquarters
into room vignettes that recreated Mrs. Whitney's many homes,
something it has successfully done for name-brand auctions like
that of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the auction ended on Sunday, sales totaled $13.1
million, nearly twice the $7 million high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights were a rare hand-printed copy of ``The
First Book of Urizen'' by William Blake, which set a record for the
artist when it fetched $2.5 million, and a watercolor by Sir Alfred
J. Munnings, ``Violet Munnings' Horse `Chips' at Chantilly,'' from
the late 1920s, which was sold to an unidentified collector for
another record price, $739,500. The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los
Angeles also paid a record price for a drawing by Aubrey Beardsley,
``The Dream,'' which sold for $173,000.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to come. The final installment of the Whitney
estate, a sale of fine art including works by Cezanne and Seurat,
takes place at Sotheby's on the evening of May 10.

OIL, GAS PRICES RESPOND TO SIGNS THAT OPEC CUTS ARE WORKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Convinced that a report of falling U.S. oil
supplies means OPEC production cuts might finally be working,
investors are pushing crude oil futures prices to their highest
levels in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas futures are also rising, and shares of energy
companies are surging.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices reversed a slump this week that reflected continued
skepticism over whether OPEC producers could make good on
production cuts announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Major oil-producing nations, led by Saudi Arabia, had tried
unsuccessfully for more than a year to impose production quotas and
stem a worldwide oil surplus. The economic recession in Asia
lowered demand, worsening the oil surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It finally looks like the big guys, Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela, are sticking to their quotas,'' a New York trader,
Chester Irvin, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Crude futures rose 64 cents on Wednesday to $18.41 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. That price, for the June contract, was
the highest since Dec. 23, 1997. Futures prices had dipped below
$11 per barrel several times in the intervening period.
</P>
<P>
   Even better news for hard-pressed Texas producers were posted
wellhead prices _ prices that refineries and pipelines pay _ that
ranged from $15.25 per barrel to as high as $16.85. Those prices
had slumbered below $10 per barrel earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   To round out a happy day for the energy industry, natural gas
futures ended trading Wednesday at $2.34 per thousand cubic feet,
up 44 percent since February.
</P>
<P>
   The news that touched off the price and stock increases was a
report that the American Petroleum Institute released late Tuesday
showing a 4.7 million barrel decline in oil inventories in the
United States as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The API said U.S. oil inventories dropped from 341.1 million
barrels as of April 16 to 336.4 million barrels on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   The API report showed that imports were down 17 percent for the
week, the clearest indication that international producers were
sending less crude oil to U.S. refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Kelly of API noted that the figures for last week also
were down by 6.6 million barrels from the same period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things go into oil prices, but clearly the surplus is
being reduced,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical energy analysts had predicted that the much-watched
weekly API report would show a reduction of about 1 million
barrels, barely a quarter of what was actually reported.
</P>
<P>
   Such a small reduction would have given credence to the widely
held notion that OPEC can no longer hold its members to any kind of
production discipline, and that new production from Iraq allowed by
the United Nations would continue to keep inventories at surplus
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest has been Venezuela, a major exporter to
the United States. Its energy minister, Ali Rodriguez, said
Wednesday that production for the United States will fall below
targets for the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez told news services that the country's state oil
company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, will fall short of its OPEC
quota of 2.72 million barrels per day ``due to technical reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts interpreted the report as a strong indication that new
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez will follow OPEC guidelines and
discontinue the country's recent practice of using its energy
production as a way to generate cash.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas prices also have strengthened on news of reduced
surpluses. The American Gas Association reported late yesterday
that supplies, while 15 percent greater than a year ago, are less
than the 20 percent increase reported last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices have been strengthened by late winter and early
spring demand from utilities in regions hit by cold weather,
reduced production in the United States caused by company cutbacks
and the shutdowns of several nuclear reactors that caused their
utility owners to switch to natural gas for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predicted that if natural gas prices hit $2.50 per
thousand cubic feet, a buyer panic could well push the price to the
$3 range.

A FEW WORDS IN DEFENSE OF SWAG  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Ty Burr is a senior editor at Entertainment Weekly  
 By TY BURR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting on a shelf in my office are two snow-globe paperweights,
each depicting a scene from the 1996 Coen Brothers film ``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of them, a teeny Marge Gunderson is squatting by an
overturned vehicle and a bloody dead body; in the other, she is
pointing a gun at the equally teeny figure of villain Gaear
Grimsrud as he stuffs what's left of Steve Buscemi's character into
the wood-chipper. The snowflakes in the latter globe are both white
and red. It's really cool.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, visitors to my office pick up the globes,
give them a shake, burst out laughing, and ask where they can buy
them. They can't; the ``Fargo'' tchotchkes were freebies given out
to critics like me for the film's home-video release.
</P>
<P>
   If they (italics)had(end italics) been made commercially
available, you can bet that somebody somewhere would have made a
tidy little bundle.
</P>
<P>
   As we head into the season of big movies and their little toys,
may I say a few kind words about tie-ins? The fact is, my ``Fargo''
snow globes actually enhance my appreciation of the Coens' deadpan
playfulness. At the same time, their plexiglass crassness doesn't
detract one iota from my experience of the film.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary: whenever I glance at the wood-chipper diorama,
my mind drifts to the wonderful scene that follows, the one where
the Coens at last commit to moralism (maybe) as Marge quietly says
to Gaear: ``There is more to life than a little money. Don't you
(italics)know(end italics) that?''
</P>
<P>
   How different is that response from the emotions invoked by a
moveable Obi-Wan Kenobi action figure? Less than you think, I'd
hazard. At their worst, licensed movie tie-ins are junk. In the
case of, say, a ``Mulan'' Happy Meal at McDonald's, the toys are
intentionally disposable: miniature billboards designed solely to
make the film inescapable and, therefore, desirable.
</P>
<P>
   But at their best, the products that spin off from films serve
the same function in our pop cosmogony as religious relics did in
medieval times: They're little bits of the immaterial (too often
literally, alas) made material. That may sound specious: The
toe-joint of a saint is not the same as a Klingon-English
dictionary. On the other hand, have you ever been to a ``Star
Trek'' convention?.
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting that I write these words in the Shadow of the
Approach of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' ``Star
Wars,'' of course, is both cause and effect of the licensing
phenomonen: the property that has sold, by one estimate, $2 billion
worth of tie-ins over the years and whose success sold movie
studios on the concept that bric-a-brac profits could cover film
production losses (somehow, the idea of better scripts has yet to
occur to these people).
</P>
<P>
   I don't have to spell out the negative results: more films that
are conceived as ways to sell toys; more films that are toys
themselves. Variety recently quoted someone from Warner Brothers
describing the coming summer film ``Wild Wild West'' as ``very
toyetic.'' I know; my flesh crawled, too.
</P>
<P>
   The creeping tide of synergistic shakedowns has infected all
media, in fact, from the recent mini-series ``The Sixties,'' which
shilled its soundtrack, to ABC ``specials'' devoted to Disney
movies, to pop-music cottage industries like the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   If it makes you feel any better, though, the licensing landscape
has its own sense of justice. Nothing sells worse than a toy tied
to a bad movie. Let us note, with pleasure, that when ``Godzilla''
tanked last summer, it took all those action figures and games and
sunglasses and bath accessories down the hole with it. In fact, the
secrecy-obsessed filmmakers proved to be their own worst enemy by
keeping all product off the shelves until ``Godzilla'' opened.
</P>
<P>
   A good film, on the other hand _ or, more precisely, a
successful one _ can make its merchandise mean many things. An
advertisement for the self, for one thing: Putting a ``Touch of
Evil'' re-issue poster on your wall, wearing a ``Wedding Singer''
nightshirt or toting the reproduction of the ``classic'' ``Lost in
Space'' lunchbox broadcasts your taste to the world (suffering the
consequences of that taste is, as always, your own business).
</P>
<P>
   Purchasing a $6,000 limited-edition bronze bust of Frankenstein
from Universal Studios, or a $7,500 replica of C-3PO from Party
Professionals, indicates that you have devoted your life to the
worship of one entertainment property, and also that you might be
better off with a skilled stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   Some tie-ins even abet literacy: the glitzy paperback edition of
```Shakespeare in Love': The Love Poetry of William Shakespeare''
may make snobs cringe, but who cares if it gets people reading the
stuff?
</P>
<P>
   At their most unpretentious, tchotchkes simply extend the
inherent fun of fun movies. (Serious movies like ``Saving Private
Ryan'' get extended by way of dreadful modern-dance tributes at the
Oscars). The swag that came with the first ``Austin Powers'' comedy
_ talking keychains and the like _ was goofily enjoyable even as it
mocked the whole notion of licensed merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The tie-ins that have been announced for this summer's ``Austin
Powers II: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' sound even better: a Mr.
Bigglesworth doll modeled after the villain's bald cat (``the
world's first hairless plush toy,'' a New Line executive has drily
noted), and a toy replica, made by Mattel's Matchbox division, of
the ``Shaguar'' that Austin Powers drives.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who still cherishes the Christmas morning memory of
unwrapping the Matchbox version of James Bond's Aston Martin (and
who mourns the disappearance of the little ejector-seat-guy under
the refrigerator 30 seconds later), this is the one that gooses my
tie-in lust.

TRUST IN GOD AND YOUR GIRLFRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday April 6)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Oprah was talking about her friend Maya. When
Oprah has a bad day _ she didn't tell us what gives her the blues _
she calls Maya who sometimes commiserates but mostly tells her this
crisis will pass.
</P>
<P>
   This is Oprah imitating Maya's clipped tones: ``Stop it ... Stop
it. Do you or don't you believe that your life is bigger than this
moment?''
</P>
<P>
   Oprah then advised the 6,000 women inside Moscone Center, ``Have
someone in your life who will tell you the truth about yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how many wildly successful men talk about needing
to unload on their friends. Does Bill Gates share and with whom? I
suspect that this is something that women acknowledge more, at
least publicly.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also Oprah's style. That she connects well with other
women is a $125-million-dollar-a-year fact, which is why she was
the plum draw at Mayor Willie Brown's conference on women. But she
wasn't the only one talking about subjects warmer and fuzzier than
the harsh reality of glass ceilings and disappearing affirmative
action usually discussed at women's power confabs.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than a dozen speakers for the day but two plus
Oprah stand out because they were funny, talked unabashedly of
faith and friendship and they are black, which says a lot for a
movement once chided for speaking only to middle-class white
issues, ignoring religion and having no sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never heard Dr. Lorraine Monroe speak, sign up for her
next talk. When she took over as principal of a public school in
New York City she worked with minority students to get test scores
up so that 96 percent of the graduates were accepted into college.
</P>
<P>
   This woman could unstick anyone. Not just because she herself
overcame personal odds _ parents who were high school dropouts,
violence in the home, being a latchkey kid _ but because when she
talks you start thinking you have no excuse not to go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of our lives is to make a difference,'' she says.
Figure out what it is and do it. For that, she advises being a
``crazy woman'' who doesn't accept precedent or rules or people who
say ``that won't work'' and ``you can't do it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid of being scared,'' she said, and stay open to
all possibilities. ``Life turns in a direction and you have to be
receptive to the angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't hang out with people who fret about what might happen, zap
your energy and don't respect your dreams. ``The dream killers,''
she calls them.
</P>
<P>
   She also says spend time ``to get back to you,'' which sounds a
lot like meditating. If you have no other time, go into the
bathroom, lock the door and ``have a vision quest.''
</P>
<P>
   For her time out, Oprah spends 15 minutes every morning with her
eyes closed talking to God.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Bertice Berry asks for help gospel style instead of
praying.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, a comedian, talk-show host and author, had everyone in
the audience - bank managers, steelworkers, women in saris and
purple hair _ turn to their neighbor and say how much we loved and
believed in each other.
</P>
<P>
   It's because she worries that ``Women don't support each other
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter, she said, who's a CEO or a welfare recipient,
``You don't have to understand my purpose to be in support of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Switching to humor, Berry, who is a gorgeous, big woman, said
she was sick of Monica talk but had to wonder ``If the president of
the United States prefers a large woman, shouldn't everyone?''
</P>
<P>
   On the same subject Oprah patted one silk-covered hip and said
``size 14. Amen 14.'' The audience roared back, ``Amen 14.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a girlfriend thing.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANALYZE THIS,' starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal.
Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and
teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down,
so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a
mobster whose confidence is shaken, De Niro is hilarious simply by
playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His
mobster finds just the right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as the
psychiatrist who utters the immortal, ``When I got into family
therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.'' There's a lot more
where that came from in this breezy comic treat (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro. Directed by
Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian
gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy.
There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of
Salles' film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a
fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly
to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles
brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate
their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one
of last year's very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `COOKIE'S FORTUNE,' starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close,
Patricia Neal and Julianne Moore. Directed by Robert Altman (PG-13,
118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit
of Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic return with a
Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and completely
enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a wealthy old
woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel niece (Ms.
Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest friend and
the niece's unwitting nemesis, Dutton is rock solid and appealing.
The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Altman makes the
most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS,' starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha
Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with
English subtitles). In this very special French film about two
freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by
sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more
head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a
rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with
unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she
views as imminent disaster. In the process, Zonca shows astonishing
acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every
aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EDTV,' starring Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres, Woody
Harrelson, Jenna Elfman and Rob Reiner. Directed by Ron Howard
(PG-13, 120 minutes). In this good-humored, deceptively easygoing
satire, Howard holds up a fun-house mirror to a world ruled by
voyeurism and specious fame. The subject matter is familiar by now,
but this film about a Trumanesque nobody as 24-hour-a-day
television star has a shrewd way of drawing the audience into its
web. Permeated by all the crassness and absurdity inherent in
celebrity-mad culture, and by our collective obsession with snoopy
trivia, it features a fine ensemble cast and a dependably jokey
screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. It helps that most of
the principals, in a cast that also includes Elizabeth Hurley, have
played this game for real and act their roles with a comic
vengeance (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ELECTION,' starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon.
Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the acerbically
funny director of ``Citizen Ruth'' comes this caustic satire of the
American electoral process in a high school setting. Its leading
candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms. Witherspoon, has a
mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from Connie Chung and
Elizabeth Dole. Broderick plays the hapless good-guy teacher who
thinks this wicked little front-runner needs to be stopped. And
hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in a
style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for
hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping
all the characters a few beats off of what they actually mean
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EXISTENZ,' starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law. Directed
by David Cronenberg (R, 90 minutes). The sleek futuristic look of
other films that play virtual reality games is not for Cronenberg.
This one has the insinuatingly ghoulish hallmarks of other
Cronenberg fever dreams (like ``The Fly,'' ``Crash'' and ``Naked
Lunch''). And it uses them to weirdly enveloping effect as a
renowned game designer (Ms. Leigh) and her wary companion (Law) try
to play the most dangerous game she has yet created. This sci-fi
scheme is disturbingly effective as it plays its own mind games
with the viewer, complete with a sharp final twist. The title is
pronounced ``eggs-is-tense'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GO,' starring Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant,
Taye Diggs, Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr. Directed by Doug Liman (R, 100
minutes). This three-episode demimondaine comedy borrows truckloads
of inspiration from ``Pulp Fiction'' but still has some flash and
personality of its own. Liman, who shot the film as well as
directed it, uses a supermarket as ground zero and sends a sullen
cashier (Ms. Polley) out to make a drug deal. Then he embellishes
this situation fully enough to send his film down the rabbit hole
into neo-Tarantino adventures, some of which (guys go to Las Vegas,
then get into trouble with strippers, gunplay, car theft and a
brake-screeching chase) are a lot more tired than others. The
ensemble cast shows cool comic flair (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HIDEOUS KINKY,' starring Kate Winslet. Directed by Gillies
MacKinnon (R, 99 minutes). Ms. Winslet knew best when she took on
this offbeat, richly atmospheric adventure in the wake of
``Titanic.'' The leading role in MacKinnon's vividly colorful film
offers her a field day. She plays a young hippie mother who brings
her reluctant English daughters to Marrakesh, circa 1972. The film,
about the mother's willfulness, the girls' reaction and the sheer
headiness of their surroundings, belongs to the striking subgenre
in which it is baby-boom adults, not their children, who most need
to come of age (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE,' starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence. Directed by
Ted Demme (R, 105 minutes). Though it's hard to miss the basic
unfunniness of seeing two black men sentenced to life at a
Mississippi state prison, this mild-mannered comedy is more likable
than it sounds. If it awkwardly straddles the line between period
piece (it begins during Prohibition) and comedy, it also keeps the
stars kidding their way from youth to curmudgeonhood. Murphy in
particular gives a more substantial performance than might be
expected here. Stick around for closing outtakes that show, for
instance, a cell phone ringing during a scene set in 1932 (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,' starring Jason Flemyng,
Dexter Fletcher, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran. Directed by Guy
Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since ``The Usual Suspects'' has
there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers in a single
film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that
bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials,
actually an advantage for a change. There's not much beneath the
surface here; what's most entertaining is Ritchie's droll,
hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast that he
has assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted miscreants
and four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking, can't shoot
straight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MATRIX,' starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne.
Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The
time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but
incomprehensible to nontechno-freaks. And the film borrows
unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt
to ``The X-Files'' in the paranoia department. But the storytelling
is intricately bizarre and the special effects are indeed special,
notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a gravity-defying
gusto. And Reeves shows that you can look like a Prada model while
behaving like an action hero. One of the main stars here is Bill
Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a
couch-potato epiphany: while the characters seem to be performing
marvelous feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of
virtual reality (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PUSHING TIN,' starring John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton,
Angelina Jolie and Cate Blanchett. Directed by Mike Newell (R, 115
minutes). This story of air-traffic controllers betrays its origins
as a magazine article, since it has more interesting data than
built-in drama. But with a cast like this, and with the director of
``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' at the helm, the tacked-on soapy
plot here has plenty of sparks. Cusack and Thornton, both tersely
good as professional rivals, become even more competitive once Ms.
Jolie sashays into view as the latter's show-stopping biker-chick
wife. Whatever possessed Ms. Blanchett to play Cusack's wife, a
heavily accented Long Island housewife who talks about casseroles
in the oven, she brings off the role with good humor and unexpected
grace (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' (the Oscar winner for best film, best
original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best
comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench
(best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113
minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm
and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of
his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a
fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SLC PUNK!,' starring Matthew Lillard and Michael Goorjian.
Directed by James Merendino (R, 97 minutes). Maybe only real
experience as an alienated teen-ager in Salt Lake City in 1985
could have led a filmmaker to such a (perhaps deservedly)
overlooked time and place. But Merendino supplies enough absurdist
humor to make sense of the setting. His film follows Stevo
(Lillard), the kind of anarchist who likes making rules, and whose
rebel streak is about as authentic as his blue hair. As the rare
punk who may be headed for Harvard Law School without even trying,
Stevo is glib but entertaining. For all the film's appealing
outlandishness, it's finally as mainstream as its hero proves to be
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A WALK ON THE MOON,' starring Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev
Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Paquin. Directed by Tony Goldwyn
(R, 107 minutes). This evocative 1969 period piece, set on the
brink of Woodstock in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive as
the handsome, itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside
down. Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a
housewife and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) into a
torrid extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences. With
a tenderness that's unusual for a contemporary American film, it
tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected
Woodstock-era music. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest
blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for
the movie (Maslin).

`THE WINSLOW BOY': DEFENDING A SON'S HONOR AT ALL COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Mamet's handsome, stately adaptation of Terence Rattigan's
play ``The Winslow Boy'' does not embellish upon its source
material. Instead it skillfully pares the play down to its
essentials, arriving at a faithful but tighter version of this
drama about a family defending the honor of its young son.
Especially notable for their absence are Rattigan's stage
directions about the characters' emotions, the ones specifying when
anger or relief, humility or confidence is an appropriate reaction.
Mamet likes his principals trickier than that.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Winslow Boy'' affords no gamesmanship on a par with
other Mamet films like ``The Spanish Prisoner,'' it works as a
precisely calibrated war of nerves in which truth and deceit are
all-important. Rattigan's 1946 play was based on the 1910 trial of
George Archer-Shee, a 13-year-old cadet at the Osborne Naval
Academy who was accused of stealing a five-shilling postal order.
The boy's father, a Liverpool bank manager, went to enormous
lengths to argue his son's case in what became a cause celebre. The
family enlisted the barrister who had prosecuted Oscar Wilde in a
notorious libel suit.
</P>
<P>
   The film's deliberate reserve makes the nuances of this
situation especially delicate. It is set in motion when the
schoolboy Ronnie Winslow (Guy Edwards) returns home unexpectedly _
the mysterious curtain-raising event for Rattigan, and one that
Mamet manipulates with greater suspense. By the time Ronnie
arrives, the rest of his family has been introduced:
cigarette-smoking suffragist sister Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon),
wayward brother Dickie (Matthew Pidgeon), refined mother (Gemma
Jones) and stern patriarch (Nigel Hawthorne). Another Mamet touch
is giving the father, Arthur Winslow, a casual opening reference to
the biblical dream of seven fat years followed by seven lean ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Winslows' lean years begin when Ronnie arrives, reveals the
theft and is asked by his father whether he is guilty. The inquiry
is staged with enough cool understatement to lend a shade of
ambiguity to Ronnie's denial, and to the family maneuverings that
follow. By keeping his expert cast so carefully in check, Mamet
trades in the possibility of high drama for a more quietly piercing
approach. As the Winslows grow determined to defend Ronnie at all
costs, the film fosters tension without ever making a histrionic
move.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``The Spanish Prisoner,'' the defiantly arch acting style
of the filmmaker's wife, Ms. Pidgeon, is central to the overall
tone. Ms. Pidgeon defines the film's eccentricity by ignoring the
conventional aspects of a character (a young woman with strong
ideals and several different suitors) who might well have been
played in more heated fashion. Instead, she spars dryly with the
story's many male characters, not least of them Jeremy Northam as
the famed barrister who deigns to take Ronnie's case. Her prickly
manner once again risks throwing audiences off balance.
Nonetheless, she bristles most effectively and plays Catherine with
strong presence and a sharp, lucid edge.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne, in a wonderful performance, inhabits the role of
Arthur Winslow with wry urbanity and stirring conviction, fully
capturing the weight of what the Winslows endure. The case brings
financial hardship, alters what was once Catherine's putatively
bright future, and rocks everyone's confidence in law, justice and
royal authority. Arthur handles all of this with an Edwardian
dignity that is heightened by the film's own brand of reserve:
keeping the events of the case and the public clamor it causes at a
deliberate remove, Mamet compresses vital plot developments into
glimpses of headlines and editorial cartoons, and lets major news
arrive almost casually from the family's memorable maid (Sarah
Flind).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winslow Boy'' is photographed, with a deliberate debt to
John Singer Sargent's composition and lighting, by Benoit Delhomme,
whose work on ``The Scent of Green Papaya,'' ``Cyclo'' and the
forthcoming ``Loss of Sexual Innocence'' is striking for its
radiant beauty. Though tethered to the past, it is mindful of the
present-day implications of its story. A scene in which a reporter
visits the Winslow home and casually demolishes their privacy is
artfully staged, carefully balanced, and fresh as ever.

INTERNATIONAL WINE EXPERTS TOUR WEST COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PEG MELNIK   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Robin Don said ``Hello,'' in a British
clip, tipped his beige hat and then struggled to keep it from
flapping away in the Carneros wind.
</P>
<P>
   Don and 35 of his colleagues are wine know-it-alls with a degree
to prove it. This week they were in the Carneros, the Appellation
at the southern base of Napa and Sonoma counties, visiting Acacia
Winery.
</P>
<P>
   These scholars, each with a Master of Wine degree (M.W.), are on
a mission, touring and tasting their way through California, Oregon
and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   While people in the wine trade travel through California with
some regularity, this international group has cachet. Most hail
from the United Kingdom, where people with an M.W. are said to
control 60 to 65 percent of the wine buying power as retailers,
distributors and importers.
</P>
<P>
   Don is from Norfolk, England, and has a cellar planning business
called Hicks and Don. As an M.W., Don has traveled to every
continent in the world, to every major vineyard area. Don was in
California 18 years ago on an official trip to the United States,
and he says he has already witnessed a remarkable change in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days my impression was that nearly every winery was
trying to grow every kind of vine to make both table wines and
fortified wines,'' Don says. ``It was very clear to me that some
areas were much more suitable to certain varieties over others.
From what I've seen so far, things are being sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hall, a vineyard consultant for Acacia and several other
area wineries, stood on a knoll with Don and his colleagues, a
huddle of M.W.s, overlooking the San Francisco Bay. Hall pointed
out rows of chardonnay and pinot noir grapes, explaining that the
appellation's shallow clay soils and cool climate bode well for
these varietals. She added that Carneros, perhaps more than any
other appellation, has made a commitment to these varietals, with
most of its vines planted to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our small vines are not particularly vigorous, so we get less
crop and the intensity that winemakers are looking for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the vineyard tour, the M.W.s stepped inside the winery for
a tasting of Carneros wines, a flight of chardonnay and two flights
of pinot noir.
</P>
<P>
   Between the pinot noir flights, Arabella Woodrow, who lives
north of Edinburgh, Scotland, said that since her last visit in
1985 ``I've seen a great development in new grape varieties
throughout California. I'm seeing more Rhone varietals and more
Italian varietals. It's changed a lot in 20 years when cabernet
sauvignon and chardonnay were the usual suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow is a wine buyer for Forth Wines Ltd., a firm which
imports wine and sells it wholesale. Woodrow says she already sells
a great deal of California wine but now she's inclined to sell
more.
</P>
<P>
   Dermot Noland, an educator and a free-lance consultant from
Dublin, Ireland, occasionally advises importers and retailers.
Dermot said he's reserving judgment until the end of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with California wines isn't that great,'' he
said. ``I look forward to see how they fit in with the wines of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic might of these M.W.s is not lost on vintners intent
on showing their most impressive wines. While the M.W.s are paying
for their own flights and accommodations, a host of wineries are
eager to wine and dine them. The long list includes Gallo of
Sonoma, Kendall-Jackson Vineyards, Beaulieu Vineyards, Opus One and
Robert Mondavi Winery. The M.W.s have even been invited to a
private dinner at the home of Robert Mondavi, an honorary M.W.
</P>
<P>
   Vintners know that the United Kingdom is the United States'
biggest value importer. In 1998 the United States shipped $143
million of wine to the United Kingdom or 16,851,000 gallons of
wine. What's more, the United States is expected to double that
amount in the next three to five years, according to Joe Rollo,
director of the Wine Institute International .
</P>
<P>
   Rollo says the distinction with M.W. travelers is that they
perhaps have ``a keener set of eyes and can put our California wine
industry into perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   To earn an M.W., wine enthusiasts study for three to five years,
pass a four-day exam and write a dissertation. There are only 224
in the world and a total of 19 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Masters of Wine, with its headquarters in
London, was established in 1955 to promote the highest level of
educational achievement for the wine industry. The Institute
organizes trips to wine growing regions every two years.

GAO CAN'T DETERMINE IF ANTHRAX VACCINE IS SAFE OR EFFECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional investigators reported Thursday that
they cannot determine whether the controversial anthrax vaccine
being administered to U.S. military personnel is safe or effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term safety of this vaccine has not yet been studied
and therefore one cannot conclude that there are no long-term
effects,'' said Kwai-Cheung Chan, the director of the national
security and international affairs division of the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO also said there are not enough studies to determine
whether the vaccine would actually protect U.S. forces from
becoming infected by the deadly anthrax disease if they are exposed
to the bacteria that causes it.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO reported its findings Thursday at a House Government
subcommittee on veterans affairs committee hearing on anthrax. The
panel's chairman, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., is investigating
the Defense Department's mandatory anthrax vaccine program after
several service members raised questions about the vaccine's
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The anthrax program ``seems a very broad undertaking built on a
very narrow foundation,'' Shays said. He said he believes the
program should be voluntary, but has no plans to introduce
legislation that would make such a change until additional hearings
are held on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 service members have either resigned or been
disciplined for refusing to take the anthrax vaccination, according
to the Pentagon. Service members who testified at a congressional
hearing last month said many more service members were afraid of
the unknown long-term health effects, but were pressured by
superiors to take the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that we don't have that much experience with
human studies,'' said Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., ``I'm wondering if
this forced vaccination is that effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the federal Food and Drug Administration, which licensed
the vaccine, and Defense Department officials reiterated Thursday
their beliefs that the vaccine is safe, effective and necessary to
protect service members who are at high risk of being exposed to
anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthrax is a major military threat faced by our armed
forces,'' said Army Brig. Gen. Eddie Cain. ``Death is the usual
outcome...of exposure to anthrax.''
</P>
<P>
   Cain, who manages the Defense Department's program for
biological defense, said more than 10 countries, including Iraq,
either possess anthrax or are suspected of having it.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is easy to manufacture in large quantities and can
easily be distributed as dry spores. An individual becomes infected
by inhaling the spores. If infected, a person can develop flu-like
symptoms, rapidly deteriorate and die within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Cain said he recently received the fourth of the six shots
necessary to be vaccinated against anthrax. The shots are given
over an 18-month period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you I have no reservations about taking the
vaccine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other service members, including three technicians from the
110th Fighter Wing Air National Guard Base in Battle Creek, Mich.,
testified that they do have reservations about the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta K. Groll, a technical sergeant with the Air National
Guard, said she has become ``seriously ill'' since receiving her
fourth vaccination on March 14. She said she felt like she had a
bad case of the flu, but on March 19 experienced a ``severe tremor
in my right arm and shortness of breath.'' She said her physician
told her she was having a severe reaction to the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Churchill, another technical sergeant, said he had no
reservations about the vaccine until he began suffering from severe
fatigue and body aches after receiving his fourth shot last month.
He said at least 11 other people also became sick after receiving
the fourth shot and have missed several days of work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such anecdotes, Pentagon officials maintain that most of
the 223,000 vaccinated soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have
experienced few side-effects. The Defense Department aims to
vaccinate 2.4 million active-duty and reserve military members by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has conducted on-going studies of the
effectiveness of the anthrax vaccine in animals. The GAO said while
the studies show that the vaccine is effective in animals it does
not mean it is effective in humans. The GAO noted, however, that
DOD has started studies aimed at determining whether the animal
studies can be translated to determine how humans would react to
the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine, approved by the FDA in 1970, has been used by
livestock workers, veterinarians and military lab technicians since
the mid-1970s. The vaccine was originally designed to protect
humans from anthrax transmissions from sheep or goats.
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that for persons at high risk (of exposure to
anthrax), the vaccine is safe and effective,'' said Kathryn Zoon,
M.D. the director of the FDA's center for biologics evaluations and
research.
</P>
<P>
   She said human clinical trials on the vaccine were conducted in
the 1950s and additional research was conducted by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in the 1960s that formed the basis
for the FDA's decision to license the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said that the 1950s study, however, focused on whether
the vaccine was effective in preventing anthrax from penetrating
the skin and could not determine whether the vaccine was effective
in stopping anthrax disease in individuals who inhaled
anthrax-causing spores.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO refused to take a position on whether it was safe for
the military's anthrax vaccination program to continue but said the
use of masks and antibiotics could also stop anthrax infection.

BIG-TOP KALEIDOSCAPE TAKES A CUE FROM `OTHER' CIRCUSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first thing that hits you are the smells _ the
sweet scent of cotton candy and caramel, the fresh popcorn and
hand-rolled pretzels, the roasted beef and bratwurst, and the
Wolfgang Puck pizzas and squeezed lemonade. And you're kicking
yourself because you ate a late lunch, although that doesn't seem
to be stopping your 7-year-old, who has already consumed four
courses of hyperactivity-inducing sugar and is running, as we
speak, back to the cotton candy stand for more ... more ... more.
</P>
<P>
   This, the outer tent of Barnum's Kaleidoscape, is the earliest
clue you have that this particular circus will be unlike any other
Ringling Bros. event you've ever attended. This is not a
hot-dog-and-soda circus. For their first trip away from arenas and
back to the big top tent in more than 40 years, Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey have pulled out all the stops to deliver a designer
circus that's distinct from other specialty spectacles winding
their way across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those other people don't even call their shows a circus,''
sniffs Kenneth Feld, president of Feld Entertainment, the driving
force behind Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey as well as
Siegfried and Roy's act in Las Vegas and a host of traveling ice
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``other people,'' of course, are the clowns, jugglers and
acrobats of Cirque du Soleil, the Canadian group that has morphed
into a multimillion-dollar entertainment giant during the past
decade. The Cirquers emphasize theatricality in their shows. No
smelly animals for them. Their clowns are artistes, their shows a
wistful look at humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Ringling Bros., having abandoned tents for the more profitable
arenas in 1956, took notice of all the upscale suburbanites
flocking to the Cirque and began planning their own one-ring show.
(They're not alone in that regard. The high-tech Cirque Ingenieux,
conceived in 1995, tours North America and is staging its
circus-style musical show at the Pantages Theatre.)
</P>
<P>
   Feld stops short of saying he was influenced by those ``other
people'' while creating the Kaleidoscape show. He's more intent on
differentiating this edition from bygone big tops and Ringling
Bros.' arena shows. However, his star performer, a remarkably
expressive clown named David Larible, can't resist poking fun at
the Cirque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their shows seem to have some kind of philosophical end they
want to impart,'' Larible says. ``We just want you to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kaleidoscape, the fun starts an hour before show time. In
the outer tent, amid the wafting sweet smells of good grub, a New
Orleans-style jazz band plays rousing renditions of ``Sweet Georgia
Brown'' and ``Yes, We Have No Bananas.'' One by one, the circus
performers enter and greet guests, pose for pictures and carry off
scaled-down versions of some of the stunts they will execute later
in the evening. Acrobats do handstands. Jugglers toss plates. A
midget eats a steak while standing on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The kids love it (as do the adults, but they just don't show it
as much) and seize the chance to twirl hula hoops and watch the
jugglers and acrobats at close range. Mom and Dad, meanwhile, gorge
themselves on fancy Puck pizzas and crab cakes and wash down their
meals with a Heineken or a Diedrich's cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone is ready to go inside the main tent, the action
doesn't miss a beat. Larible acts as an usher, escorting you to
your seats in the silliest manner possible. And what seats they
are. Each chair is cushioned with red velvet upholstery, and there
are even a couple of dozen divans mixed in for variety. No seat is
more than 50 feet from the ring, affording excellent, intimate
views of the performers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the usual arena sightlines we're accustomed
to when watching a Ringling Bros. show, which is precisely the
point, Feld says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make this an entirely different experience,''
Feld says. ``From the quality of the food to the comfort of the
seating to the fact that we don't have port-a-potties but actual
bathrooms with flowers ... this is our idea of a dream circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the two-hour, 15-minute show begins, we learn that Larible
isn't an usher _ he's the star. And he's entirely worthy of the
billing. As the puckish lead clown, Larible ties together the
show's many acts while artfully involving the audience through eye
contact and participation. When he selects ``volunteers'' for
routines involving plate throwing and the staging of an Italian
opera, Larible reveals a generous spirit and wonderful spontaneity
that distinguishes Kaleidoscape from Cirque du Soleil's scripted
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make the audience feel like they're seeing
everything as if it's happening for the first time,'' Larible says.
``And in many ways, they are. That's why a lot of people often come
back to see our show again. It's never the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The show itself combines the usual feats of derring-do _
acrobats leaping off of impossibly high platforms, gymnasts walking
tightropes and balancing incredibly large objects on their chins
and foreheads _ with some singular achievements like a 16-crossbow
ricochet sequence. And there are still a couple of animal acts,
perhaps Feld's defiant way of stamping this production as a
distinctly Ringling Bros. type of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things we do best,'' Feld says.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with that after watching Sylvia Zerbini and
her stable of white Arabian horses whirl around the circus ring,
which looks suddenly small when filled with these great animals.
Zerbini has the horses gallop and then stop on a dime and reverse
course, bow to the crowd and walk on their hind legs from one end
of the ring to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The audience's proximity to these magnificent horses makes their
feats all the more memorable as you can practically feel the breath
from their nostrils as they race around the ring.
</P>
<P>
   That same wonderful feeling of intimacy is felt again and again
during the evening. When juggler Picasso spits ping-pong ball after
ping-pong ball from his mouth, each one going higher and higher
into the air, and he somehow manages to keep them all aloft, you
can hear each sharp intake of his breath and feel the force of each
ball _ pwaah! as it's launched impossibly into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Or when crossbow marksman Guy Tell zings an arrow toward an
apple sitting precariously on the head of his lovely assistant, you
can follow its flight and almost taste the juice as the Red
Delicious splits in two. It's a feast for the senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in such a two-dimensional world today with television,
movies and the Internet that people have a hard time believing
anything is real,'' Feld says. ``With this show, we want to show
human beings doing almost superhuman feats and have people be so
close to the action that they have no choice but to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's reality, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey style. And that
makes for a pretty exquisite escape. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ The first thing that hits you are the smells _ the
sweet scent of cotton candy and caramel, the fresh popcorn and
hand-rolled pretzels, the roasted beef and bratwurst, and the
Wolfgang Puck pizzas and squeezed lemonade. And you're kicking
yourself because you ate a late lunch, although that doesn't seem
to be stopping your 7-year-old, who has already consumed four
courses of hyperactivity-inducing sugar and is running, as we
speak, back to the cotton candy stand for more ... more ... more.
</P>
<P>
   This, the outer tent of Barnum's Kaleidoscape, is the earliest
clue you have that this particular circus will be unlike any other
Ringling Bros. event you've ever attended. This is not a
hot-dog-and-soda circus. For their first trip away from arenas and
back to the big top tent in more than 40 years, Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey have pulled out all the stops to deliver a designer
circus that's distinct from other specialty spectacles winding
their way across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those other people don't even call their shows a circus,''
sniffs Kenneth Feld, president of Feld Entertainment, the driving
force behind Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey as well as
Siegfried and Roy's act in Las Vegas and a host of traveling ice
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``other people,'' of course, are the clowns, jugglers and
acrobats of Cirque du Soleil, the Canadian group that has morphed
into a multimillion-dollar entertainment giant during the past
decade. The Cirquers emphasize theatricality in their shows. No
smelly animals for them. Their clowns are artistes, their shows a
wistful look at humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Ringling Bros., having abandoned tents for the more profitable
arenas in 1956, took notice of all the upscale suburbanites
flocking to the Cirque and began planning their own one-ring show.
(They're not alone in that regard. The high-tech Cirque Ingenieux,
conceived in 1995, tours North America and is staging its
circus-style musical show at the Pantages Theatre.)
</P>
<P>
   Feld stops short of saying he was influenced by those ``other
people'' while creating the Kaleidoscape show. He's more intent on
differentiating this edition from bygone big tops and Ringling
Bros.' arena shows. However, his star performer, a remarkably
expressive clown named David Larible, can't resist poking fun at
the Cirque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their shows seem to have some kind of philosophical end they
want to impart,'' Larible says. ``We just want you to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kaleidoscape, the fun starts an hour before show time. In
the outer tent, amid the wafting sweet smells of good grub, a New
Orleans-style jazz band plays rousing renditions of ``Sweet Georgia
Brown'' and ``Yes, We Have No Bananas.'' One by one, the circus
performers enter and greet guests, pose for pictures and carry off
scaled-down versions of some of the stunts they will execute later
in the evening. Acrobats do handstands. Jugglers toss plates. A
midget eats a steak while standing on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The kids love it (as do the adults, but they just don't show it
as much) and seize the chance to twirl hula hoops and watch the
jugglers and acrobats at close range. Mom and Dad, meanwhile, gorge
themselves on fancy Puck pizzas and crab cakes and wash down their
meals with a Heineken or a Diedrich's cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone is ready to go inside the main tent, the action
doesn't miss a beat. Larible acts as an usher, escorting you to
your seats in the silliest manner possible. And what seats they
are. Each chair is cushioned with red velvet upholstery, and there
are even a couple of dozen divans mixed in for variety. No seat is
more than 50 feet from the ring, affording excellent, intimate
views of the performers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the usual arena sightlines we're accustomed
to when watching a Ringling Bros. show, which is precisely the
point, Feld says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make this an entirely different experience,''
Feld says. ``From the quality of the food to the comfort of the
seating to the fact that we don't have port-a-potties but actual
bathrooms with flowers ... this is our idea of a dream circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the two-hour, 15-minute show begins, we learn that Larible
isn't an usher _ he's the star. And he's entirely worthy of the
billing. As the puckish lead clown, Larible ties together the
show's many acts while artfully involving the audience through eye
contact and participation. When he selects ``volunteers'' for
routines involving plate throwing and the staging of an Italian
opera, Larible reveals a generous spirit and wonderful spontaneity
that distinguishes Kaleidoscape from Cirque du Soleil's scripted
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make the audience feel like they're seeing
everything as if it's happening for the first time,'' Larible says.
``And in many ways, they are. That's why a lot of people often come
back to see our show again. It's never the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The show itself combines the usual feats of derring-do _
acrobats leaping off of impossibly high platforms, gymnasts walking
tightropes and balancing incredibly large objects on their chins
and foreheads _ with some singular achievements like a 16-crossbow
ricochet sequence. And there are still a couple of animal acts,
perhaps Feld's defiant way of stamping this production as a
distinctly Ringling Bros. type of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things we do best,'' Feld says.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with that after watching Sylvia Zerbini and
her stable of white Arabian horses whirl around the circus ring,
which looks suddenly small when filled with these great animals.
Zerbini has the horses gallop and then stop on a dime and reverse
course, bow to the crowd and walk on their hind legs from one end
of the ring to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The audience's proximity to these magnificent horses makes their
feats all the more memorable as you can practically feel the breath
from their nostrils as they race around the ring.
</P>
<P>
   That same wonderful feeling of intimacy is felt again and again
during the evening. When juggler Picasso spits ping-pong ball after
ping-pong ball from his mouth, each one going higher and higher
into the air, and he somehow manages to keep them all aloft, you
can hear each sharp intake of his breath and feel the force of each
ball _ pwaah! as it's launched impossibly into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Or when crossbow marksman Guy Tell zings an arrow toward an
apple sitting precariously on the head of his lovely assistant, you
can folow its flight and almost taste the juice as the Red
Delicious splits in two. It's a feast for the senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in such a two-dimensional world today with television,
movies and the Internet that people have a hard time believing
anything is real,'' Feld says. ``With this show, we want to show
human beings doing almost superhuman feats and have people be so
close to the action that they have no choice but to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's reality, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey style. And that
makes for a pretty exquisite escape. &UR;  &QL;

NBC'S `NOAH'S ARK' HITS THE SHOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Almighty may not mind if you skip NBC's ``Noah's Ark.''
Honest. This turkey never should have been allowed on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noah's Ark'' is a shipwreck of a movie that might work as a
Sunday school diversion for 5-year-olds, but it isn't apt to do
much for anyone who has reached the age of reason. Like a bad
sermon, it's too long. Like a bad toupee, it's too obvious. Like a
bad Velveeta recipe, it's too cheesy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the choice of Jon Voight as Noah was a bad idea. Voight
is suitably monumental as the righteous man of faith. But the
swarthy F. Murray Abraham, who plays Lot, looks more the Middle
Eastern type. And if you're wondering what Lot and Noah are doing
in the same film, congratulations. You were paying attention in
religion class.
</P>
<P>
   This story of Noah begins in the toddlin' twin cities of Sodom
and Gomorrah, apparently because there just isn't enough meat to
the Noah story to fill two nights. So Robert Halmi Sr. and his
purveyors of classics to the masses have Noah and Lot as best
friends in Sodom, just before the towns get toasted. They escape,
Noah with his wife and three young sons, Lot with his wife but
without the two virginal daughters mentioned in Genesis. (Hollywood
has difficulty with virgins.) Lot's wife, featuring Carol Kane in a
revival of the scatterbrained Simka Gravas from ``Taxi,'' turns
back to see the devastation and is salt-lick city in an instant.
It's a good thing. Two nights of Kane's caterwauling would be harsh
penance for merely watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   If the foregoing seems irreverent, you have a good grasp of how
this miniseries approaches the story. With Henny Youngman chutzpah,
the misguided Lot cracks wise about everything, stopping just short
of ``take my wife, please!'' Noah's wife pokes fun at the media,
suggesting that the ``scribbling scribes'' will undoubtedly get the
story wrong. Even God gets in a few jabs at Noah.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lame bid to dispense Bible Lite (and maybe sidestep
criticism for proseletyzing), but it's also an admission that
there's not much story here, at least in the moviemaking sense.
With the exception of Noah, Peter Barnes' script fails to develop
any characters. Noah's sons and their wives-to-be are
interchangeable and unremarkable. Even Mary Steenburgen, as Noah's
patient and supportive spouse, seems more window dressing than
major player.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the special effects that aided other Halmi projects, such
as ``Merlin'' and ``The Odyssey,'' are awful in ``Noah'':
unsophisticated, clumsy, unimpressive. They couldn't even get the
ark to bob on the waves. Instead, it barges through the water like
a Disney ride guided from below.
</P>
<P>
   And that, ultimately, is the problem with ``Noah's Ark.'' Like
Disneyland, it's nice to look at. But even with the most elaborate
dressing, a turkey is still a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Noah's Ark. Four-hour miniseries based on the biblical tale of
Noah and the flood. Starring Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen.
Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m., KING/5. Parental guideline rating:
TV-14.

ANOTHER TOP 100 BOOK LIST: NONFICTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (EDS: 2nd take is list of 100 Best Nonfiction Books) 
(js) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Education of Henry Adams,'' the weighty but evasive
autobiography about growing up in a famous presidential family
(Adams never mentions his wife's suicide) tops the list of the 100
Best Nonfiction Books written in English during the 20th century as
selected by a panel of the Modern Library, a division of Random
House. The publisher issued the results Thursday at the Book Expo
America convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the list is represented by Random House
imprints, including the choices for second- and third-best books,
William James' ``Varieties of Religious Experience'' and Booker T.
Washington's ``Up From Slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Modern Library named its top 100 novels of
the century, with 59 Random House imprints, it was criticized for
its voting methods. This year, the voting was more scientific, said
David Ebershoff, the Modern Library's publishing director. ``The
books were evaluated on literary and intellectual merit,''
Ebershoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Each book was rated numerically by the judges, made up of the
Modern Library's editorial board. After an initial vote on 900
titles, the panel voted again when the books had been winnowed down
to 300 titles. Random House hired a statistician, Albert Madansky
of the University of Chicago, to shrink the list to 100 books based
on each title's numerical ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, perhaps, critics outside the panel took issue with
some choices. ``Obviously, the judges fared well,'' said Thomas
Bender, a professor at New York University and the author of ``New
York Intellect'' (published by the Random House imprint Alfred A.
Knopf). Five judges have books on the list: Shelby Foote's, ``Civil
War,'' Stephen Jay Gould's ``Mismeasure of Man,'' Arthur M.
Schlesinger Jr.'s ``Age of Jackson,'' Elaine Pagels' ``Gnostic
Gospels'' and Edmund Morris' ``Rise of Theodore Roosevelt.'' Judges
could not vote for themselves; but to forestall their natural
discretion, Ebershoff said, he had nominated all the judges' books.
</P>
<P>
   Other judges were: John Richardson, Charles Johnson, Carolyn
See, Caleb Carr, A.S. Byatt, Vartan Gregorian, Jon Krakauer and
Christopher Cerf, whose father, Bennett, owned the Modern Library,
which became part of Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Bender also noted that one book, James George Frazer's ``Golden
Bough,'' was first published in the 19th century, in 1890, with
other volumes following in the 20th century. Frederick Jackson
Turner's famous essay ``The Significance of the Frontier in
American History,'' the lead essay in his book ``The Frontier in
American History,'' was also first published in the 19th century,
in 1893.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is kind of an under-representation of the social
sciences'' in the Modern Library list, Bender continued. He
criticized the absence of Clifford Geertz's ``Interpretation of
Cultures,'' David Riesman's ``Lonely Crowd,'' Hannah Arendt's
``Human Condition'' and Daniel Bell's ``Cultural Contradictions of
Capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Another critic of the list was Camille Paglia. ``I burst out
laughing when I saw how many of the committee's books ended up on
the list,'' Ms. Paglia said. ``Please.'' She called it ``an act of
shameful narcissism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Paglia approved of Frazer, Rachel Carson, Virginia Woolf
and James Baldwin. She did not agree with some of the 13 female
authors selected.
</P>
<P>
   But then, some of the judges did not agree with the final
choices, either. ``Why William Appleman Williams, for God's sake?''
asked Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., adding, ``I'm not a great Virginia
Woolf enthusiast.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schlesinger said, ``I think the first 10 are quite
defensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Another judge, Ms. See, argued that Dr. Benjamin Spock, the
popular pediatrician, should have been chosen. ``But these guys
would never read it,'' Ms. See said. ``I'm still brooding about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's sole black member, Johnson, said he was ``very
pleased with the African-American representation,'' which amounted
to six books.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dickstein, a professor of English at Queens College and
the City University of New York Graduate Center, who was not on the
panel, approved of the ``strong criterion of good writing.'' He
liked ``Samuel Johnson'' by Walter Jackson Bate, and Richard
Ellmann's ``James Joyce.'' But Dickstein said he found the list ``a
little geriatric and a little male.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickstein asked, ``How could you have a list like that without
`The Feminine Mystique' '' by Betty Friedan? He also regretted the
absence of ``The Organization Man'' by William Whyte Jr. and books
by Hunter S. Thompson and Norman Mailer. Still, he said, ``anything
that encourages reading and promotes good books is fine.''

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    How could so many adults around the Littleton killers ignore so
many red flags?
 &HT;    Eric Harris had a sawed-off barrel of a shotgun on his dresser
and bombmaking materials in plain sight. Why didn't his parents ask
hard questions that could have averted the tragedy?
 &HT;    Harris and Dylan Klebold had made a video for a government class
that portrayed them killing athletes. Why wasn't the teacher
alarmed?
 &HT;    The parents of a boy threatened by Harris contacted police eight
times to report the threats, such as a computer game Harris created
that revolved around destroying their house. On his Web site,
Harris included instructions on how to make pipe bombs. Though
Harris was on probation, no further investigation was made. Such
neglect seems criminal.
 &HT;    More alarming, a Washington Post poll reports that a fifth of
high school students know someone who has brought a gun to school;
a third have heard students threaten to kill others and 40 percent
can think of students in their schools who are troubled enough to
be potential killers.
 &HT;    Therefore, President Clinton has proposed several gun-control
laws that deserve support:
 &HT;    1. Raise the minimum age for possessing handguns and
semi-automatic assault rifles to 21. The 18-year-old girl friend of
Klebold bought an assault pistol and a rifle at a recent gun show
that were used in the Littleton massacre.
 &HT;    2. Require background checks on people buying weapons at gun
shows or explosives.
 &HT;    3. Limit the number of handguns that can be purchased to one per
month. When Virginia passed such a law, the number of Virginia guns
used in New York crimes fell by more than half.
 &HT;    4. Restore a waiting period before the purchase of a pistol, a
Brady law that expired.
 &HT;    5. A Child Access Prevention (CAP) law would hold a gun owner
responsible for any crimes committed with his gun by a child. Since
16 states passed CAP laws, accidental deaths dropped an average of
23 percent, says Handgun Control. Guns kill 13 children every day.
 &HT;    6. Require new guns to have a safety lock with a combination
known only to the owner. As a 9-year-old, I remember opening my
father's sock drawer, where he kept his pistol. He once showed me
how to take out the clip, which I did, thinking that removed its
bullets. I put the gun into my mouth, then took it out and pulled
the trigger. BLAM! I shot a bullet into the drawer.
 &HT;    These laws would reduce deaths of young people. But far more
profound changes are needed. Most important, parents need to spend
more time with their kids.
 &HT;    I know a young woman who dressed in Gothic black in high school
because it was how she felt about the neglect of her parents and
their consuming drive for material success. Though other kids
mocked her, she felt she had to express the pain that was inside.
And the clothes formed a bond with other outcasts who hung
together. They hated the athletes and the Christians. But she was
not violent, not promiscuous, not a Satan worshipper.
 &HT;    A question for Christian kids: Why not reach out and befriend
someone who dresses differently? Wouldn't that demonstrate the love
of the Lord that you feel?
 &HT;    A week before the Littleton tragedy, Virginia's Attorney General
Mark Earley gathered 300 religious leaders in a Faith Summit to
consider mentoring young children as an answer for school violence.
He noted that he visited every juvenile detention center and met
one-on-one with 35 kids imprisoned for violent crime. ''With the
exception of one person, all of them came from homes in which a
father was not meaningfully present.''
 &HT;    Though he is a father of six children, ages 2 to 16, Earley
decided to become a ''Lunch Buddy'' to a fourth-grade boy, who is
at risk. He eats with him only once a month. The first time they
met, the little guy said, ''I'm so glad I have a lunch buddy.''
 &HT;    Another speaker was Virgil Gulker, who has created a church
mentoring program called Kids Hope that has matched up volunteers
who pledge to meet with one child once a week for one year. He
noted that suicide among children aged 14 and under is up 75
percent. Why? ''Kids are giving up finding that person who will
value them.
 &HT;    ''Don't tell me Jesus loves these children,'' Gulker says. ``So
what? Jesus does not have arms to hug them. He can't say their
names. He can't read to them. He can't laugh with them. We can.''

`LIMBO' MEANS WHAT IT SAYS  
 CREATING EFFECTS 
A HIP `TARZAN'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska)   (rk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It is a season of certainty in Hollywood, at least
as far as story lines in popular movies are concerned. There is
often a very pronounced difference between the good guys and the
bad guys, and movies tend to end on a note of clarity.
</P>
<P>
   There is a winner and a loser, a resolution. It is no accident
that many movies now are based on comic books, which tend to have a
clear conception of good and right.
</P>
<P>
   John Sayles attacks that approach in his latest movie,
``Limbo.'' In fact, few films have ever been as ambiguous as
``Limbo,'' Sayles' 12th movie, which will play at the Cannes Film
Festival in May and is to open in theaters in the United States on
June 4. Suffice it to say that the word ``cliffhanger'' hardly
captures the uncertain note on which the film abruptly ends, on a
lonely, wooded island off the Alaskan coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's called `Limbo,''' said Sayles, who wrote,
directed and edited the picture. ``One of the things about an
ending to a movie is it should send you back to the movie itself,
and it should make sense. This movie is about risks, emotional and
physical, and so I want it to end focused on that, not what happens
to them ultimately. People will fill in the end for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about a group of good-hearted misfits in Juneau,
Alaska, who slowly work their way into each other's lives. David
Strathairn plays a fisherman who no longer fishes because of an
accident years earlier in which two of his friends were killed;
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantino plays a lounge singer who stumbles into
one bad relationship after another before falling for him, and
Vanessa Martinez plays her daughter, who is afraid of drawing close
to anyone because of her mother's tempestuous love life.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, they begin to pull together when they find
themselves at a physical risk that mirrors the emotional risks they
are taking in trying to build a family.
</P>
<P>
   Sayles said the movie's tone was a throwback to the 1960s and
'70s, when ambiguity was more usual. ``I don't think it's as common
now to end a movie on a question as it was in the '60s and 70s,''
he said. ``Those were the days of the counterculture and
challenging authority. Heroes were flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, Sayles added, films with open endings make
audiences think. ``What you're hoping for is you don't want someone
to consume your movie like a fast-food meal and then forget about
it,'' he said. ``You don't want them to walk away thinking about
other movies, but about their own lives. This may do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating Effects
</P>
<P>
   George Lucas' ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' is
expected to be a major hit when it is released in May in a business
sorely hurting for blockbuster-size profits. But the film also
marks a coming of age for computerized special effects.
</P>
<P>
   When Lucas produced his first three ``Star Wars'' pictures, he
all but invented the modern special-effects industry. He made
innovative uses of computers and models of space ships, aliens and
the like to create realistic images of faraway worlds and far-out
characters. He eventually organized this expertise into a company,
Industrial Light and Magic, which was a pioneer in the
special-effects world and which rode the crest of Hollywood's huge
special-effects boom.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Phantom Menace'' is perhaps the most
sophisticated and one of the most costly special-effects pictures
ever made, it comes as Hollywood's ardor for the computer has
cooled, said Jim Morris , president of Lucas Digital, the parent
company of Industrial Light and Magic. He said this was partly
because of the costs, and partly because audiences were no longer
thrilled by what had become run-of-the-mill effects, like brilliant
explosions. As a result, the industry has been in something of a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a real cooling at the studios in green-lighting
these pictures, and some of the infrastructure built up is
collapsing under its own weight because there's not enough work
going around,'' Morris said. He said his company had been kept on
an even keel because of its work on ``The Phantom Menace,'' as well
as ``The Mummy,'' ``Wild, Wild West'' and a large number of
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said roughly half the new ``Star Wars'' movie's $120
million budget was used to produce special effects, an unusually
high figure. He added that the picture had more computerized
effects than almost any previous live-action film, with about 2,000
special-effects shots, compared with 200 or so in a regular
special-effects movie.
</P>
<P>
   In making ``The Phantom Menace,'' Industrial Light and Magic
geared up considerably, from about 650 employees a couple of years
ago to about 1,000 now. In addition, it had to make huge
investments in computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said that when the original ``Star Wars'' pictures were
made, about 90 percent of the costs of creating special effects was
labor, and 10 percent computers. Today, he said, the ratio is about
half and half because of the growing expense of computer stations
and software.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also said that in the old days, the Industrial Light
crews often had to put in grinding hours and seven-day weeks to
complete their work. Now, he said, the company has learned to pace
itself better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing their best work ever because they're not coming
in in a haze of exhaustion,'' Morris said. ``We avoided the
last-minute crunch.'' And so now, he said, several weeks before the
movie opens, many of the staff members have already left for
well-deserved vacations.

 HOLLYWOOD: well deserved vacations.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Hip `Tarzan'
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' is one of the most-filmed subjects in Hollywood
history, with Disney estimating there have been 47 adaptations of
the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories, second only to the number of
adaptations of ``Dracula.'' But it is a safe bet this famed ape man
has never before been a skateboarder.
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co.'s big animated feature film this summer will
be ``Tarzan,'' and as in its previous efforts, the company is both
trying to bring to life a classic story known to many and to make
it new, so it will be the foundation for everything from
merchandise sales to theme park rides.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting movie is long on outright adventure, with the
hero, Tarzan, adept at shooting through the jungle because he
slides along trees as if on a skateboard.
</P>
<P>
   The directors, Kevin Lima and Chris Buck, both veterans of
several Disney animated movies, used a new computer technique,
called Deep Canvas, to enhance the sense of motion and excitement
and to give depth to the jungle background. But their goal, also in
keeping with the unwritten rules of this genre, was to make the
movie something of a psychodrama, a record of a youth's wrestling
with his identity in a world in which he does not quite fit.
Indeed, one of the bigger changes from many previous Disney films
is that the personal struggle at its heart is more adolescent.
</P>
<P>
   The plot follows the boy who is raised by gorillas and struggles
to be one of them, until he catches his first glimpse of humans.
Tarzan, with Tony Goldwyn's voice, ultimately feels he has to
choose between the jungle, a world he knows but in which he remains
something of an outsider, and civilization, a world he does not
know but to which he feels drawn, even though he remains an
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the classic struggle most kids feel of wanting to
be in control of their worlds,'' Buck said. ``He's going through an
early college age kind of struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a Jane, with the voice of Minnie Driver. But the
attraction is innocent, the directors said, not sexual. As in other
Disney animated movies, there is music, provided by Phil Collins,
but it is used differently. ``This is the first Disney movie for a
long time where the characters don't sing themselves,'' Lima said.
``The songs are the voices of their emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close provides the voice of the gorilla who raises Tarzan;
Rosie O'Donnell is his gorilla sidekick, and Lance Henriksen of
``Millennium'' is the voice of the gorilla patriarch. They are the
friends who counsel Tarzan, helping him make his difficult
decision, and making him probably the first skateboarder best known
for his emotions and thinking.

IT'S SYNERGY, BABY. GROOVY! YEAH!  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Nancy Hass teaches journalism at New York University and writes
frequently about the business of entertainment.  
 By NANCY HASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery'' became a
surprise hit back in May 1997, the executives at Time Warner did
more than just congratulate the folks at their subsidiary, New Line
Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   They got to work.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the spoof, starring Mike Myers as a foppish secret
agent cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out in the
present, had more than just laughs and an obvious sequel going for
it (``Austin Powers II: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' opens on June 11).
</P>
<P>
   With its goofy characters, accessible irony and catch phrases
like ``Shag-a-delic, baby,'' it provided an opportunity to
demonstrate the raison d'etre of the modern entertainment
conglomerate: ``synergy.''
</P>
<P>
   That concept, which has powered a wave of mergers and
acquisitions in the last decade, is based on the theory that
so-called vertically integrated companies can spend the least money
to make the biggest profit if all the divisions work together on
every opportunity to market and merchandise every facet of a
concept or character.
</P>
<P>
   And there is indeed a great deal of money to be made. Not just
by Time Warner but by a slew of integrated behemoths like Disney,
Polygram, Sony and Viacom. In the past, such add-ons as soundtrack
albums, novelties, novelizations and foreign and television rights
were mere bagatelles dwarfed by the domestic grosses of films
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the equation has changed. And with advertising
and promotion costs for movies soaring, the companies can make the
most of the money they spend by selling everything _ from keychains
to theme park rides _ at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Licensing and the other revenue streams can now mean the
difference between a $90 million base hit and a $150 million home
run,'' said Ira Mayer, who owns Licensing Letter, an industry
newsletter. Last year, nearly $16 billion of movie-related
merchandise was sold.
</P>
<P>
   For New Line, synergy at such a heady level is relatively new.
For more than 30 years, the company was a scrappy independent
studio. Then, in 1994, it was bought by Ted Turner and, two years
later, absorbed by Time Warner as part of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, critics fretted that New Line's quirkiness would be
quashed by the corporate dictates of the parent company, that in
the quest for synergy it would be turned into a mainstream studio
like Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by most accounts, New Line has retained its off-beat
character _ in addition to developing Austin Powers, it has
released ``Boogie Nights'' and ``American History X'' _ while
growing downright comfortable with the resources of its parent
company. ``The opportunities presented by a movie like `Austin
Powers,''' said Michael Lynne, the president of New Line,
``actually make you glad you're part of a big corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving up potential profits on toys and television
rights, for instance, New Line can now keep the money all in the
Time Warner family. Better still, the corporate hoopla means that a
relatively modest movie _ ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' cost $30
million _ has been transformed into an ``event'' film.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a moment,'' recalled Lynne, ``when we all realized
that `Austin Powers' was our `Pink Panther,' that the first movie
was just the beginning of the franchise.'' Bob Friedman, who
oversees marketing and licensing for the company, puts it more
bluntly: ``To us, this `Austin Powers' isn't a movie; it's a cable
network.''
</P>
<P>
   And a board game. And a stuffed toy. And an animated series. And
a potential hit for Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, within weeks, Warner Brothers retail stores and Spenser
Gifts stores across the country will roll out a plethora of
merchandise from snazzy nightshirts to the Austin Powers Swedish
Penis Enlarger (``the perfect gift for Dad on Father's Day!'').
</P>
<P>
   TBS and TNT, two cable networks owned by Time Warner, will
feature wall-to-wall promotion of the movie. Entertainment Weekly,
the glossy magazine owned by Time Warner, is set to have an Austin
Powers cover.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Records will release the soundtrack album, which includes
a single, ``Beautiful Stranger,'' by Madonna, whose label, Maverick
Records, is also a Warner subsidiary. And by now, Warner Books has
probably delivered to stores the first of its no doubt multiple
printings of ``The Austin Powers Encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more. The home video, due out in the fall, will be sold
by Time Warner's sales force; early next year there will be an
animated series by HBO, a Time Warner subsidiary. ``We are working
on a relationship with the WB,'' said Friedman, referring to the
youth-skewed broadcast network also owned by Time Warner. ``They're
perfect for us.''
</P>
<P>
   There may also be a theme park tie-in with Six Flags Great
Adventure, which was sold recently by Time Warner but retains a
licensing agreement with the company. ``There's really no telling
how far this thing can go and for how long,'' Lynne said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite plucky New Line's smooth path to corporate nirvana,
synergy is hardly an answer to all the industry's woes. After all,
to make synergy work, studios need more than just a concept that
has good merchandising potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people need to remember in the midst of all this,'' said
Glen Brunman, the executive vice president of Sony Soundtrax, the
leading maker of movie soundtrack albums, ``is that none of this
means anything unless there's a successful movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a film is well-executed, too much synergy or too much at
the wrong time can boomerang. Disney, widely considered a citadel
of synergy, has learned some hard lessons of late. In the wake of
``The Lion King'' (1994), which raked in more than $1 billion in
licensing revenue, the company promoted its 1997 animated movie
``Hercules'' with such fervor that it probably undercut the actual
success of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Disney saturate the market with merchandise from
backpacks to sunglasses and wear kids out with television specials
and parades, but it also aroused a backlash with its enthusiastic
use of a flashing Hercules icon on promotions on ABC, the network
Disney owns.
</P>
<P>
   Among corporate entertainment executives, the ``Hercules''
campaign is now cited as an example of how too much synergy can
cause ``allegiance erosion.'' ``What `Hercules' taught everyone was
that you can make a huge amount of money, but you have to be very
careful about your timing and the appearance of
over-commercialization,'' said a former Disney executive who is now
a top marketer at a competing studio.

 UNDATED: competing studio.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To that end, Disney's corporate synergy program last year for
``Mulan'' was much more low-key. While Michelle Kwan skated in a
``Mulan''-inspired program on an ABC special, Disney made sure its
merchandising was kept relatively elegant and upscale, in keeping
with the nature of the animated musical about a young Chinese girl
who disguises herself as a boy and joins the Imperial Army to bring
honor to her family. Even the McDonald's Happy Meal tie-in didn't
start until just before the film opened.
</P>
<P>
   But restraint can be deadly as well. Sony, for example, waited
to introduce its ``Godzilla'' merchandise until just before the
film opened last summer, hoping to fuel demand _ despite the fact
that 40 percent of merchandise sales are typically made early on.
When the movie was not the blockbuster it was built up to be (it
made $136 million domestically; not bad, but not boffo), Sony
probably wished it had put its action figures out early, to at
least make up some of the slack for the film's disappointing box
office.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Roach, who directed both ``Austin Powers'' films but had
previously worked only in independent films, spoke effusively about
working with an entertainment conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tendency to glamorize the freedom of working in the
independent film world,'' said Roach. ``But when I was working with
individual backers, there were plenty of compromises. Everyone with
money thought they knew how things should be done.''
</P>
<P>
   For Roach, Time Warner's muscle means one thing: the ability to
grab more attention for his film. The sight of stuffed toy versions
of Bigglesworth, the hairless cat character that appears in both
``Austin Powers'' films, may raise cries about rampant
commercialism, but for Roach, it means the potential for a bigger
box office return. And bigger box office will mean that he will be
able to get not only more money for his next project, but more
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I was a little weirded out to see a life-sized doll of
Verne Troyer,'' he said of a 32-inch-tall actor who plays a role in
the sequel, ``but it doesn't make me worry that I'm selling out my
integrity. It makes me happy that the company has so much faith in
the film. What talks in Hollywood is success. If that means that
Time Warner makes money on the concept, I'm great with that,
providing it means that I keep getting to make the movies I want to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he feel any corporate pressure to make his film more
mainstream _ the better to insure its marketing possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Although marketing executives were given copies of the shooting
script and apprised of casting decisions, neither he nor Myers, a
producer and co-writer of the film, were asked to change a single
detail to conform to marketing or merchandising plans.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did they participate in much of the planning for the
firestorm of promotion. In a telephone interview late last month,
Roach said it came as a surprise when a reporter told him that
``Austin Powers'' would anchor the Warner stores nationwide
Father's Day promotion. ``They do their thing and we do ours,'' he
said, sounding a bit shocked.
</P>
<P>
   But even true believers like Roach concede that soundtrack
albums can be the troublemaker in a happily synergistic corporate
family.
</P>
<P>
   Once an afterthought released only when the movie was a musical
or had a notably good instrumental score, soundtrack albums in the
last few years have become one of the most lucrative spin-offs. The
soundtrack for ``Titanic,'' for example, made $31 million; ``The
Bodyguard'' raked in $29 million.
</P>
<P>
   But now that such albums are seen as an individual profit center
and most movie studios are under the same corporate umbrellas as
the recording companies, the possibility of conflict always lurks.
Record companies have a slate of music makers to promote and a
catalogue of songs to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only may the filmmaker reject the artists signed by the
parent company's record label; he may also want his studio to pay
for outside performers and songs.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that music companies sometimes push their own artists,
said Brunman of Sony Soundtrax, but in the end, ``the director
always wins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any company worth anything knows that you can't have the tail
wagging the dog,'' he said. ``The point of the whole exercise is
the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not always, especially with first-time filmmakers who are
often hired guns with little leverage. Even for Roach, who is a hot
property these days, the sequel soundtrack provided some tense
moments.
</P>
<P>
   He was extremely happy to take Warner's offer of Madonna's
``Beautiful Stranger'' for the movie's signature track, but in late
April, just a few weeks before the film was set to open, there was
some suggestion that he might be asked to include a few Warner
artists who he didn't think were quite right, a sort of quid pro
quo.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Warner Music backed off, which was an enormous relief
to Roach. ``I know there are sometimes strings attached,'' he said,
``but I have to say that I really wound up getting to do everything
I wanted in making this film. If you ask me about corporate
synergy, my personal experience is that everyone wins.''

`SLC PUNK' MAKES YOUTHFUL ANARCHY BORING AND PREDICTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nicholas Ray achieved it in ``Rebel Without A Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is capturing that elusive thing called teenage angst.
It's tough enough to present angry, rebellious teenagers in a
movie. But it's another thing entirely to impossibly stack the deck
by making them irresponsible, vain, self-laudatory and hell-bent on
a sort-of revenge as well.
</P>
<P>
   If only first-time writer and director James Merendino had
learned this lesson early on. In ``SLC Punk,'' which pulls from
Ray's classic as well as Gus Van Sant's spare, lean and
non-judgmental ``My Own Private Idaho,'' the kids are the ones who
won't forgive the adults for the world in which they are born. They
won't allow anyone other than themselves to err, be foolish _ or
out of control. Consequently, they come off as more priggish than
the parents who are products of their own generational mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``SLC'' stands for Salt Lake City and Merendino claims he lived
in Mormon territory in 1985. Though he says this first film is a
work of fiction, it's more a cinematic exorcism. It's way too
personal, mad and whiny to be entirely a work of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The title's joke is supposed to ask ``who knew there were punks
in Salt Lake City?'' A more obvious question might be, ``Where
better than in a place known for its right-wing, conservative
values?''
</P>
<P>
   But in this unforgiving, cold glance at growing up with a chip
on the shoulder, rich-kid punk protagonist and narrator Stevo
(Matthew Lillard) is so smug he can't see beyond his own attitude.
His mohawk-shorn best friend, Heroin Bob (Michael Goorjian), is
less assured. His family is itinerant and he is struggling to make
his place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Between the pair, we're given a tour of endless drinking
parties, clubs, music, fights, random sex and typical teenage
foolishness. But Merendino has made a mistake in handing the
narration to Stevo _ a bright bum of a guy who just happens to
throw away every chance he gets. We can't engage with him or feel
his angst because he won't let anyone in and he feels superior to
boot.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet Heroin Bob, on the other hand, is the best thing in
this ``complex world of fascism that is Utah.'' Goorjian has a
puppy dog face that conveys his every thought. His complex
performance fuels the film and compensates for Lillard's drooly
baby-faced wimpiness _ a trademark of the ``Scream'' actor that is
beginning to grow wearisome.
</P>
<P>
   Bob has fallen in love with the worldly Trish (Annabeth Gish)
and decides he wants to marry her. He's searching for a place in
the punk realm while enduring being the butt of a joke that reveals
``Heroin Bob'' is a sham name. It seems he hasn't taken a drug in
his life and refuses to have anything to do with mind-altering
substances.
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Stevo struggle to find answers. And just when a flash of
reason rains upon them, tragedy strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the film disintegrates too, becoming just another
indie movie about not taking responsibility for one's actions,
while making it seem glamorous and cool to stay on the fringe. It's
an unenlightening film that proves youthful anarchy is just as dull
as a midlife crisis, and sadly, as predictable, too.

   SEBASTOPOL, Calif. _ Apple processor Vacu-dry is used to seeing
demand for its dried, vacuum-packed foods rise and fall with crises
such as wars and monetary turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   But it has never seen anything like the demand generated by the
Year 2000 computer glitch. The company's sales to soared 1,000
percent earlier this year, although they have been slowing
recently. The reason: People stockpiling dried foods because they
fear economic chaos when the year 2000 arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The products have always been bought by some church members
who believe they need to be prepared for emergencies, by
survivalists and by those concerned about world crises,'' said
Vacu-dry president Gary Hess. ``But the last nine months' sales
have been 10 times the annual average.''

<P>
   The Y2K computer glitch, or Millennium Bug, refers to the
problem some computers and computer programs have in recognizing
the date Jan. 1, 2000, which could lead to inaccuracies or computer
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions on the impact of Y2K range from those who feel it will
be almost imperceptible to those who predict chaos, including
financial failures, blackouts and shortages of fuel, food and
water.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Vacu-dry comes in. In addition to processing
apples, Vacu-dry also owns Perma-Pak, a line of vacuum-packed food
products ranging from raspberries to imitation beef that have a
shelf life of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Perma-Pak products are sold largely by retailers who specialize
in emergency supplies of food, water and survival equipment. The
foods are usually packaged as one-year supplies of food, broken
into daily meals of 2,000 calories, and sold for about $1,500 to
$1,700. Many of the sales are made using the Internet, toll-free
numbers and mail.
</P>
<P>
   The largest seller of Perma-Pak products is Preparedness
Resources Inc. of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Holland, who with his father, Vern Holland, owns Emergency
Food Storage in American Fork, Utah, also deals in Perma-Pak
products and said Vacu-dry is merely experiencing the impact of
people getting prepared for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the increase has been the Y2K panic,'' said Holland,
who has seen his company's sales go from $5,000 a week to $30,000 a
day. ``They believe everything will shut down and they will need to
have a food source.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland said sales fluctuate, increasing during times of
international stress, such as Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in
1991. But Y2K has been the biggest boost yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales kind of go up and down, but as soon as the Y2K panic
hit, sales hit the roof,'' Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Larsen, a Santa Rosa anesthesiologist, bought a year's
supply of Perma-Pak meals last year, when Y2K fear was at its
highest, and is glad he did, even as Y2K fears ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel comfortable having a year's supply of food,'' Larsen
said. ``It just makes me feel calm and relaxed. I'm glad I have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess said that two years ago, guessing that the Y2K computer
glitch would lead people to stockpile food, Vacu-dry rebuilt and
updated its Sebastopol production line for Perma-Pak products, a
line that Vacu-dry purchased in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The products include fruits, vegetables, meat substitutes, dairy
products, beverages, grains, legumes, soup and corn starch that are
put through a special process for packaging.
</P>
<P>
   In the packaging process, cans are put into a vacuum to suck out
the oxygen, then flushed with nitrogen and filled with food. It
leaves the can with less than 1 percent oxygen, assuring a long
shelf life, said Vacu-dry product manager Chip Ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Between November and March, the production line ran in three
shifts as employment at Vacu-dry went from 275 employees to 350.
Officials declined to give production figures, except to say
production went up tenfold. The product is stored in Sebastopol and
in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said the first increase in sales was noticed in March 1998
and peaked between January and March of this year, when Vacu-dry
posted its record earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the sales of Perma-Pak, Vacu-dry in the third quarter of
this fiscal year, which covers January through March, had earnings
of $1.2 million, 77 cents a share, compared to $134,000 for the
same quarter a year ago, or 9 cents a share, said Bill Hartman,
Vacu-dry controller.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which is traded on Nasdaq, also has
fluctuated, trading between $6 and $12 during the past year.
Recently it has traded at around $8.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, Perma-Pak sales have declined as the U.S.
government, utilities, hospitals, banks and businesses began
reporting on efforts to deal with the Y2K issue.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said he expects sales will get back to the recent high
levels as the new year approaches and people who may have put off
stockpiling food and water start to prepare again.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Between five and eight inches of snow fell in the Spring
Mountains of southern Nevada Wednesday night and early Thursday as
a cold, upper-level low pressure system drifted east across the
region.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the lofty cold low will continue to produce pockets
of mountain snows across the southern Rockies as its eastward
advance remains blocked by a massive high pressure system covering
the Middle West. Showers and a few rumbles of thunder will affect
the valleys. Thunder is possible. The combination of clouds and
showers will keep daytime temperatures 15 to 20 degrees below
average in some of the deserts of southern Nevada, including the
city of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   With the pattern brought to a standstill by the unyielding high
over the midwest, a steady stream of moist air will continue to
ascend the sloping terrain of west Texas, eastern New Mexico and
southern Colorado, setting the stage for recurrent rains that could
lead to flash flooding in some areas. Severe thunderstorms are
possible in west Texas as moist Gulf air is further lifted by a jet
stream disturbance pinwheeling east around the stalled Nevada low.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southeast, interior showers and a few thunderstorms will
shift toward the coast as a weakening upper-level low pressure
system migrates seaward. Pockets of light rain may linger in the
southern Appalachians as moist winds from the Atlantic ascend the
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a cool morning will be followed by a sunny, mild
afternoon, although cumulus clouds will build over parts of the
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Welcome Rain
</P>
<P>
   Rain totaled 1.23 inches at Orlando, Florida, on Wednesday,
setting a record for the date. After a long dry spell, welcome
rains followed an increase in tropical moisture. The trigger for
rain came from the sea breeze, which developed in concert with
cooler air from the Atlantic spreading inland. At the sea-breeze
front, which marks the leading edge of the inbound ocean air, very
warm and moist air over the land was lifted, setting the stage for
showers and thunderstorms. Without the reliable sea breeze and its
front, Florida's summer rainy season would be, on average, much
less rainy. &QL;

 &UR; THE GLORY DAYS OF THE GRAND TURK
</P>
<P>
   BY FOUAD AJAMI
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The clock towers gave the thing away: shortly before the end
came for the Ottoman state in the latter years of the 19th century,
the rulers and the would-be reformers began to erect these towers
in their cities and towns, outside mosques or on the town squares.
Built for the most part by the royal architects, the Armenian
Balian family, those towers, Jason Goodwin tells us in this
arresting evocation of the Ottoman centuries, caught the confusion
of the Ottoman Empire. In their years of valor and triumph, the
Ottomans had not bothered with time and had dealt with it in a
lordly way. Now their confidence had cracked, and those towers --
some of which resembled minarets, others made in the shape of
pagodas or campaniles -- were a desperate attempt to graft onto the
Ottoman world the punctual ways of the West. It didn't work. ``The
harder the empire tried to secularize time,'' Goodwin writes, ``the
more absolutely ordinary it became,'' and the people of this
sprawling state grew ``disputatious and querulous'' by the day.
</P>
<P>
   We were bound to come around to the Ottomans. The furies of
nationalism in former Ottoman dominions in the Balkans have made
urgent a retrospect of that world. The power of the Turks has
disappeared, Communist rule has now slipped away, and what has
risen from the grave to avenge ancient slights is a pitiless
nationalism, one that mocks all those who thought that after the
Ottomans would come a better, more enlightened age.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Goodwin, a gifted English travel writer and journalist,
has gone back over the material of the Ottoman Empire, and returned
with a work of dazzling beauty. ``Lords of the Horizons'' is a
hybrid book -- part travel chronicle, part popular history and a
meditation on a vanished world that hovers like an apparition over
today's grim headlines. Goodwin's is a gift akin to that of Jan
Morris, the rare coming together of historical scholarship and
curiosity about distant places with luminous writing. Goodwin has
read deeply around the Ottoman world, and he takes his readers
effortlessly from the empire's modest beginnings, in the scrub
lands of the Eurasian steppe, through its time of ascendancy in the
15th and 16th centuries, to its time of lumbering sloth and
weakness in the 19th and early 20th centuries. He does it in a
beguiling way, the pace of his narrative catching, at times, the
speed and swiftness of those Ottoman horsemen of the frontier in
their days of glory, and then the ponderous style of a decaying
empire that answered the calls for reform with pretense and show
and outright cruelty -- as well as with a frenzy of palace building
that could not lift the gloom, as the unhappy sultans ``dragged the
terrible burden of their line from one palace to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   The origins of that great Ottoman enterprise have the simplicity
and the obscurity of the frontier. The Turkmen had quit the steppe
in the ninth century; they had adopted Islam, and the faith, a
``stripped-down, low-slung, racing sort'' of Islam, had carried
them into a vast imperial possession. They moved relentlessly
westward. A bey (lord) by the name of Osman began the great
imperial venture in the early years of the 14th century. His domain
was small, but Byzantium, all around him, was doomed. The Byzantine
city of Bursa at the end of the Silk Road fell to the new
conquerors in 1327. The factionalism of the Byzantine world gave
Osman and his descendants the space they needed, and took them
across the Sea of Marmara into Thrace. There, and across the Balkan
valleys, they were to discover ``a shepherd's paradise of cooling
water, greenery and shade.'' Edirne (Adrianople to the Greeks), the
region's capital, fell to them in 1362.
</P>
<P>
   With a world there for the plucking, the Ottomans came into the
inheritance of Byzantium and beyond: Constantinople in 1453, Athens
in 1456. Serbia was folded into the empire in 1459, Bosnia in
1462-66, Albania in 1468, Herzegovina in 1481. ``So hypnotic was
the Turks' advance,'' Goodwin writes, ``so rascally, duplicitous
and divided were their enemies, so beguilingly gentle was the way
they tickled their vassals to the halter, so otherworldly did their
success appear, that two centuries later Luther himself . . .
wondered piously aloud whether they should be opposed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nationalist histories -- 36 nations were, by one count,
incorporated into this Ottoman edifice -- it was a terrible tale of
conquest and subjugation. But the truth was different. The Turks
created what the great historian Fernand Braudel described as
``structures of collaboration.'' There had been no great missionary
impulse in the Turkish incursions, no urge to extirpate the old
ways, nothing here akin to the spirit Spain brought to the New
World. This empire was a polyglot world: ``It was, by common
consent, a Turkish empire, but most of its dignitaries and
officers, and its shock troops, too, were Balkan Slavs. Its
ceremonial was Byzantine, its dignity Persian, its wealth Egyptian,
its letters Arabic. . . . Its most brilliant sailors were all
Greek. Its canniest merchants were Armenian.'' The Greek world had
been overwhelmed by the Ottomans, to be sure. But Greeks had
``sniffed the wind,'' Goodwin observes, and had made their own
accommodation with the Ottoman order.
</P>
<P>
   It began early, that accommodation. No sooner had Sultan Mehmet
the Conqueror claimed Constantinople as his city and his imperial
capital than he offered the Orthodox Church his protection. He
styled himself as the inheritor of the Caesars, and in the Church
of the Holy Apostles, in January of 1454, he enthroned a learned
monk, George Scholarios, as Patriarch Gennadius II, handing him his
staff as Byzantine emperors in days past had done. The Serbs, too,
currently hacking away at all things Ottoman, at all the traces
Islam left behind, made their own peace with Turkish rule, finding
their way into the court and armies of the empire. (It was
hindsight, and 19th-century romantic nationalism, that made the
Battle of Kosovo in 1389, when the Serbs met the Turks on the Field
of Blackbirds, just outside the town of Pristina, a great divide in
Serbian history.)
</P>
<P>
   Such imperial luck was not destined to last; this pastoral
empire of the borderlands had grown too large, too complex, for its
rulers. There is no precise date, no fixed event, to attach to its
decline, which set in with the closing years of the 16th century.
In retrospect, inflation and a price revolution triggered by the
silver bullion of the new world had unsettled the realm. It had
devastated those living on rent and fixed incomes. No one quite
knew it, but the frontier had closed. A scramble had begun for
state employment. Between 1640 and 1656, the number of salaried
officials rose from 60,000 to 100,000. A great struggle was waged
for mastery over the Mediterranean between Spain and the Ottoman
state. Venice mediated that conflict, winked at the antagonists,
looked after its trading interests. Fate had its own cunning. In
Goodwin's summation: ``The three great Mediterranean powers,
Venice, Spain and the empire itself, all soon toppled into a
decline as protracted as it was profound, and a note of exhaustion
stole across the whole Mediterranean world.''
</P>
<P>
   Plunder and caprice now sought to squeeze from the realm the
booty and the wealth that once had been obtained in war. Then the
peoples of this diverse empire began ``to huddle together for
security.'' Nationalism came into this Ottoman world, the one force
that it couldn't withstand. The philologists and the poets, and the
winds of nationalism blowing in from Europe, and the Philhellenes
dreaming of a restored Greek world, unleashed on this multinational
edifice demands it could never accommodate. Russia was seized with
a new messianic impulse, a determination to restore Christian
worship to the Church of St. Sophia, and the Greek and Slavic
peoples within the ramshackle Ottoman domain lost their taste for
the Ottoman world and its limitations.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that the clock towers were built, and the palaces
with heavy chandeliers, and the promises of reform became a daily
occurrence, and the realm grew more repressive. It was then that an
insolvent empire took up its first foreign loans, in the 1850's,
only to succumb to bankruptcy and tutelage two decades later.
Official terror was not far behind, as this large ``prison of
nations'' was buffeted by the new claims of nationalism and the
upheaval of World War I. The terrible calamities and mass slaughter
let loose on the Armenian community were the last, defining act of
the Ottoman state, an indelible stain on its record and on the
record of the Young Turk regime that tried to rescue the empire
only to make it more brutal and intolerant than the old order. Then
the Turks themselves grew weary of the imperial world and pushed it
into its grave. Goodwin has not quite come to praise the dead. He
has, though, stripped that Ottoman past of its ``otherness,'' the
alienness that has been its lot in this age of unyielding
nationalism.

 &UR; NO TIME FOR THE YIPS
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVE ANDERSON
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In golf, the stature of the world's best players is based on
each year's four major tournaments: the Masters, the United States
Open, the British Open and the Professional Golfers' Association
Championship. No matter how many other tournaments or how much
prize money a golfer wins, he is considered flawed if he hasn't won
at least one major title, just as the superior players are measured
by how many majors they have won.
</P>
<P>
   If Jack Nicklaus deserves to be ranked as the best golfer in
history, it's because he has won a record 18 majors as a touring
pro: six Masters, four U.S. Opens, three British Opens, five P.G.A.
Championships. Nicklaus also won two United States Amateur titles,
which some historians still consider, along with the British
Amateur, to be a major out of deference to Bobby Jones's 1930 Grand
Slam. That year Jones, although an amateur, defeated the best pros
in the two Opens and also won both the United States Amateur and
the British Amateur. Over his career, he won four U.S. Opens, three
British Opens, five United States Amateurs and one British Amateur.

   Counting their United States and British Amateur titles,
Nicklaus has 20 majors, Jones 13. Next is Walter Hagen with 11,
followed by Ben Hogan and Gary Player, each with nine; Arnold
Palmer and Tom Watson with eight; Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead and Harry
Vardon, each with seven; Lee Trevino and Nick Faldo, each with six.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to rank history's 12 best golfers, you wouldn't go
very far wrong if you were limited to considering only those 12.
Although a surprise winner occurs occasionally in a major, the best
players often win the best titles on the best courses. And the
difficulty of winning any of the four is the driving premise of
John Feinstein's book ``The Majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, when Feinstein's ``Season on the Brink'' illuminated
the best and worst of Bobby Knight, the Indiana University
basketball coach, he has produced several sports books, the best of
which was ``A Good Walk Spoiled,'' an examination of the golfers on
the professional tour. Now he has returned to golf to concentrate
on 1998's four major championships through some of the game's most
prominent names, notably Mark O'Meara, Tiger Woods and David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, a five-time British Open champion and two-time Masters
winner, defines the majors, saying: ``It's almost like taking a
final exam. . . . This decides your grade.'' Last year O'Meara
finally made the grade, winning his first major at the Masters at
the age of 41 and also winning the British Open. Lee Janzen won the
U.S. Open, and Vijay Singh won the P.G.A.
</P>
<P>
   Most golf followers remember the results, so there's no suspense
as to the outcome of each of last year's majors. But Feinstein, a
relentless reporter, supplies the individual dramas involving the
winners: O'Meara's determination finally to win a major and then to
win another in a four-hole playoff; Janzen's golf ball that
appeared lost in a tree before it dropped out; Singh's advice
during the final round from his experienced caddie, Dave Renwick.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein develops the odd-couple relationship between O'Meara,
now 42, and Woods, now 23, who are neighbors in their
million-dollar homes near Orlando, Fla. They play friendly matches
there, and they sometimes travel together. And when O'Meara won the
Masters last year, Woods, as the previous champion, held the green
jacket that O'Meara put on.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's two birdies that snatched the Masters from Duval also
provide Feinstein with a recurring theme that he abbreviates into
``B.P.N.T.H.W.A.M.'' -- best player never to have won a major. It's
a theme that haunted O'Meara and Singh until last year. As this
year's Masters came and went, it still hung over Duval and Phil
Mickelson, the gifted left-handed golfer.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case so often in sports, the real charm of ``The
Majors'' involves those who didn't win, sometimes those who didn't
even qualify. The most poignant story is that of the adoption of
Larry Mize, the 1987 Masters winner, by British fans at the British
Open qualifying site. They appreciated Mize's willingness to risk
not qualifying in wind and rain and having to return to America,
all at his own expense if he didn't qualify and earn prize money.
(He qualified.)
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also chronicles the human dramas: the illnesses of
Fred Couples's father and future wife, John Daly's struggle with
alcoholism, the death of Stuart Appleby's wife in a freak
automobile accident in London, the fulfillment of the amateur Ken
Bakst's dream of playing in the Masters, the harassment of Colin
Montgomerie by U.S. Open fans, Justin Leonard's understandable
annoyance at Peter Kuchar's on-course antics while caddying for his
son Matt.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know how touring pros think, on and off the
course but particularly on the courses that are the crucibles of
the majors, this is the book. It also tells how golf officials,
especially those at the Masters and at the United States Golf
Association, think in setting up their courses, notably the hole
location on the 18th green at the Olympic Club in San Francisco,
which created so many putting problems on the second day of the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to establish when the majors emerged as the majors,
Feinstein mistakenly parrots the prevalent theory that Ben Hogan,
who swept the Masters, the U.S. Open and the British Open in 1953,
didn't enter the P.G.A. that year because of ``the difficulty of
rushing back from Great Britain and then going through seven days
of match play at a time when he still hadn't completely recovered
from the 1949 automobile accident that almost killed him.'' In
recent decades the P.G.A. has been played soon after the British
Open, but in 1953 the P.G.A. was completed before the British Open.
Its 36-hole semifinal matches were scheduled for the same Monday,
July 6, that Hogan had to be in Scotland to qualify for the British
Open that began two days later at Carnoustie. Not that Hogan would
have entered the P.G.A. had he skipped the British Open; his
damaged legs couldn't endure a possible 180 holes in five days.
</P>
<P>
   But that stubbed putt hardly spoils ``The Majors,'' another
major triumph for John Feinstein.

 THE AMERICAN MAYOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Best &AMP; the Worst Big-City Leaders.

</P>
<P>
   There are few activities Americans enjoy more than rating
things. The historian Arthur Schlesinger Sr. realized this a
half-century ago when he canvassed his fellow scholars to rank the
nation's Presidents. Schlesinger's survey, with its divisions into
the Great, Near-Great, Average and the like, spawned several
imitators and his own follow-up in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Now Melvin G. Holli, the author of several books on urban
politics, has set out to find the country's 10 best and worst
mayors. It is a worthwhile task, since the mayor's office is where
the political rubber meets the road. As Fiorello La Guardia noted,
there is no Republican, no Democratic, no Socialist way to clean a
street or build a sewer, but merely a right way and a wrong way.
And yet, at the same time, no mayor is fully master of his fate (no
matter what Rudolph Giuliani may think). Mayors must carefully
navigate past potential rivals on the city council, and in the
governors' and President's offices -- one reason why precious few
American mayors ever advance beyond city hall.
</P>
<P>
   Holli polled some 160 historians, social scientists, journalists
and other urbanologists in 1993. They were asked generally to
restrict their choices to mayors of major cities after 1820, when
most mayors were first elected by popular vote. The result is a
10-best list that includes the expected (Fiorello La Guardia), the
unexpected (Detroit's Frank Murphy), the controversial (Richard J.
Daley) and the obscure (Josiah Quincy, Boston's great mayor of the
1820's). As for the 10 worst, well, New Yorkers won't be surprised
that their city headed the list with three different mayors -- just
that the most recent one served over 65 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Holli includes a short biography of each man in the top 10, and
a description of his accomplishments, followed by several useful
chapters on the nature of leadership in the mayor's office. As he
points out, there is no one set of characteristics that makes a
great mayor, though it helps to be a determined individual, in
office at a time of crisis and following the administration of a
weak, corrupt or dastardly predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   There are some things to quibble with here. Holli occasionally
lurches into social science lingo, and one wishes that he had
devoted more pages to his 10 worst list: train wrecks are always
instructive. Like most of his correspondents, Holli tends to favor
old-style, pragmatically liberal or progressive mayors. He likes
tangible, brick-and-mortar accomplishments. In an age of empty
political symbolism this is largely refreshing, though critics of
the top 10 are too often dismissed with simplistic epithets. For
example, Angelenos opposed to offshore oil drilling and runaway
development are merely snobs from the ``fashionable west side.''
</P>
<P>
   I would also question the inclusion of Richard J. Daley on any
list of the nation's 10 best mayors. Daley's segregationist,
exclusionary politics helped to polarize Chicago for decades, and
his reckless, grotesque behavior during the 1968 Democratic
National Convention is a permanent stain on American democracy. It
is not erased by the fact that he made the buses run on time.
</P>
<P>
   But then, that's the attraction of top-10 lists: there's always
something to argue about. Big-city government has become a
neglected subject in recent years. May Holli stir up interest again
with this provocative, enjoyable work.
</P>
<P>
   And now the winners and losers. The 10 best, in order, are:
Fiorello La Guardia (New York, 1934-45); Tom L. Johnson (Cleveland,
1901-9); David Lawrence (Pittsburgh, 1946-59); Hazen S. Pingree
(Detroit, 1890-97); Samuel M. Jones (Toledo, 1897-1904); Richard J.
Daley (Chicago, 1955-76); Frank Murphy (Detroit, 1930-33); Daniel
Hoan (Milwaukee, 1916-40); Tom Bradley (Los Angeles, 1973-93), and
Josiah Quincy (Boston, 1823-28).
</P>
<P>
   The 10 worst, in order, are: William H. Thompson (Chicago,
1915-23; 1927-31); Frank Hague (Jersey City, 1917-47); James Walker
(New York, 1926-32); J. Michael Curley (Boston, 1914-17; 1922-25;
1930-33; 1946-49); Frank Rizzo (Philadelphia, 1972-80); A. Oakey
Hall (New York, 1868-72); Dennis Kucinich (Cleveland, 1977-79);
Fernando Wood (New York, 1855-58; 1860-62); Samuel Yorty (Los
Angeles, 1961-73), and Jane Byrne (Chicago, 1979-83).

 A GOLFER'S LIFE

 &UR; ARNIE'S ARDOR
</P>
<P>
   BY MICHAEL BAMBERGER
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For 10 or 15 years now, golfers have been looking for the next
Jack Nicklaus, the single person who could dominate the game for
years and even decades. For a while it looked to be Tom Watson, but
he failed to have Nicklaus's staying power. Briefly it appeared to
be Hal Sutton, but all he had in common with the Golden Bear was a
golden mane and splashy early success. More recently, golfers have
been talking about Tiger Woods and David Duval as being the next
Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   The curious thing is that nobody is trying to identify the next
Arnold Palmer. Golf buffs must know instinctively the underlying
message of Palmer's autobiography, ``A Golfer's Life'': there won't
be another Arnold Palmer. Palmer's rugged charm could be produced
only in a certain time and place, and that's where this enjoyable
book, every bit as unpretentious as its author, is rooted.
</P>
<P>
   It opens not on a golf course or in an office cluttered with
medals, but in Latrobe, Pa., at a class reunion sponsored by
Palmer, in this case the 50th-anniversary reunion of the class of
'47 from Latrobe High. Latrobe is the western Pennsylvania town
where Palmer has lived all his life, a town that was, in his youth,
both rural and industrial but definitely not suburban. (The modern
American touring pro, with rare exceptions, was raised deep in the
heart of suburbia.) Palmer's father, called Deke, was a course
superintendent, a drinker and a hard man. Palmer revered him and
spent his adult life trying to earn his father's praise. His
mother, Doris, was loving and vivacious and fun. Palmer spent his
adult life trying to bring her joy. If this sounds like a
Depression-era family out of central casting, maybe that's because
it is.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Golfer's Life'' -- the writing, which is simple and
excellent, is by James Dodson, a contributing editor at Golf
magazine -- is not sanitized and predictable. There's a refreshing
level of candor, and it yields interesting and unexpected stories
about Palmer's mistakes, disappointments and personal failings. He
describes, again and again, how much he needed cigarettes on the
golf course to calm his nerves, and how he never won a major
tournament after quitting. He writes about his father's drinking
and how upsetting that was to him (``It troubled me that the man
who rode me so hard about knowing the difference between right and
wrong often did something -- after too many shots at the firehall
-- he knew was wrong''). He writes about some of his bad
investments and some of his poorly considered business partners,
describing in detail his litigious involvement with a residential
development near Orlando, Fla., called Isleworth. (The project has
thrived since Palmer left the deal. Tiger Woods lives at Isleworth
today.) Palmer writes, movingly and sadly, about the death of a
great friend and fellow golfer, Bud Worsham, during their college
days at Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The book details several disappointments on the golf course,
too. The best known and oddest of these came in 1966 at the United
States Open, at the Olympic Club in San Francisco. With nine holes
to play, Palmer had a seven-shot lead over Billy Casper. With four
holes to play, Palmer still had a five-shot lead. In the end,
Casper defeated Palmer in a playoff, the third U.S. Open playoff
loss for Palmer. He discusses what went wrong. At some point during
the final round, Palmer stopped thinking about Casper and started
thinking about breaking Ben Hogan's record for lowest winning U.S.
Open score. Palmer must be the only person in the world who can
really know how Greg Norman felt after squandering a six-stroke
lead before losing the 1996 Masters to Nick Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, a golfing icon by 1955, when Palmer first arrived on the
professional scene, figures prominently in the book, but not
altogether positively. It becomes clear that Palmer respects
Hogan's skill but was deeply offended by his brusqueness. He is
more fond of some other golfers. He clearly likes Jack Nicklaus and
appreciates how much their rivalry did to enrich them personally.
(Palmer is not a great materialist, except when it comes to
airplanes. He's an accomplished pilot and has been flying himself
around the country for 40 years now, always in the latest and
fastest planes he can buy, as is all well chronicled in the book.)
Palmer describes his warm friendship with Gary Player, the great
South African golfer, winner of all four major golf championships,
something Palmer himself failed to achieve. But Palmer's favorite
golfer gets most of a chapter, the title of which is taken from the
man's initials: D.D.E. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Palmer played
dozens of rounds together, often at Augusta National, where
Eisenhower was a member and Palmer an honorary member, having won
the Masters there four times (1958, 1960, 1962 and 1964). His
father-and-son relationship with Eisenhower is another byproduct of
Palmer's golf talent and warm personality. One of the things that
make the subject of ``A Golfer's Life'' so likable is his gratitude
for what golf has brought him.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, he has been managed brilliantly by Mark McCormack,
the founder of International Management Group, who had the
foresight never to link Palmer's business deals to his on-course
successes; this extended Palmer's earning power immeasurably. But
in the most significant ways, Palmer was not managed at all. On the
course and off it he was just himself -- simple, courteous, manly
-- and that was enough to endear him to millions of people, men and
women. Palmer probably wouldn't have such an impact in professional
golf were he coming up today. For one thing, greens have become
exceedingly fast, and he describes himself as a poor fast-green
putter. But more significant, a young golfer today with Palmer's
talents would become overprogrammed -- by his parents, by his swing
coach, by his psychologist, by the golf industry. Everybody would
impose his own ideas on him. Caddies would give him too much
information. Reporters would be too interested in the minutiae of
his life. Today in golf, it's hard for an emerging star to breathe.
That was less true in Palmer's day.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer has led a rich and singular life and has captured
it in a wonderful book.

<P>
   The intricate plot of Robert Goddard's CAUGHT IN THE LIGHT
(Holt, $26) begins on a snowy winter morning in Vienna, where an
English photographer falls madly in love with a mystery woman who
steps in front of his camera. Their affair is recounted with
breathless romanticism (``The imminence of passion -- of heat and
flesh and broken taboos -- hung almost tangibly in the air''), and
the photographer, Ian Jarrett, plays into the mood when he deserts
his wife and daughter to run off with the woman he knows as Marian
Esguard. The story shifts into dramatic suspense when Marian
disappears and Ian discovers her ``true'' identity, as well as her
belief that she is the incarnation of the ``real'' Marian Esguard,
a pioneer photographer who vanished in 1820, along with her
revolutionary inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Words like ``truth'' and ``reality'' lose their meaning in this
dense and dazzling work, as further plot manipulations force past,
present and paranoid fantasy to share the same time frame. Although
the baroque turns can be confusing, the mystery eventually
clarifies itself for Ian when he realizes that ``the only thing
separating us from the past, or the past from us, is time,'' and
that a photograph (``a snapshot of time as well as people and
places'') is the only way to capture it. For his insight, Ian pays
a staggering cost that almost seems worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those paragons of virility who never age (or lose their
hair or forget where they put the car keys) in long-running
detective series, K. C. Constantine's working-stiff hero, Mario
Balzic, seems as real as the rest of us -- or at least as real as
his endearingly imperfect neighbors in the battered steel town of
Rocksburg, Pa. This retired police chief wears his humanity all too
uneasily in BLOOD MUD (Mysterious Press/
</P>
<P>
   Warner, $23) when he reacts to a heart attack (a ``coronary
event,'' his whippersnapper cardiologist calls it) by withdrawing
from life. ``All I know is, I'm scared of dyin','' he confesses to
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that draws Balzic out of the house is the private
job he promised to do for a lawyer friend, investigating an
insurance claim in a gun shop burglary. The oddball characters
mixed up in this caper are enough to get anyone's heart pumping
again, and Balzic is soon exchanging meaningful words with lowlifes
like Fat Artie Chianese, that ``two-bit Mussolini'' who runs the
local Mafia out of his deli, and his no-luck nephew (``Put him in
charge of a two-car funeral, he'd send one of 'em to the wrong
cemetery''). A master of primitive forms of tribal communication,
Constantine excels at the casual obscenity, the morose barroom
lament, the windy phone conversation and those illiterate arias,
heard all over Rocksburg, of men who have lost everything but their
anger.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Anne Perry's strong-minded Victorian heroines should
appreciate their passionate defense of an article of masculine
ideology -- the value of a man's good name -- in BEDFORD SQUARE
(Ballantine, $24.95). Through a campaign of ``whisper, suspicion
and innuendo,'' someone is slandering men of high position in 1891
London society, and it is up to Thomas Pitt, commander of the Bow
Street police station, to scotch these poisonous rumors of
dishonorable behavior before reputations are destroyed and lives
ruined. Through his discreet investigations, the sympathetic Pitt
exposes the subtle cruelty of the anonymous letters that bring
disgrace to one man and death to another. But it is his wife,
Charlotte, and her octogenarian aunt, the indomitable Lady
Vespasia, who extend compassion to the victims and provide the
moral indignation to make a political cause of their persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Perry is generous with colorful period details about daily life
as it was lived at the end of the century, when the comfortable
classes were talking on the telephone, wearing smaller bustles and
investing in African diamond mines. She is even more remarkable at
shaping historical events -- like the Tranby Croft gambling
scandal, which blackened reputations -- into a piece of fiction
that offers both a satisfactory mystery to solve and a grave social
injustice to get all worked up about.
</P>
<P>
   With her mixed-race parentage and California upbringing, Rei
Shimura brings a fresh perspective to the Japanese culture (and
occasional crimes) she encounters in Sujata Massey's lively
mysteries. In THE FLOWER MASTER (HarperCollins, $24), the young
antiques dealer is living in Tokyo and doing her best to soak up
her Asian heritage without compromising her Western values. In
deference to her aunt, Rei enrolls in a flower-arranging class at a
venerable ikebana school where the rivalries are fierce. After ``a
Wild West showdown'' over esthetics, a master teacher is stabbed to
death with gardening shears, and Rei's aunt comes under suspicion.
Massey doesn't hesitate to ply the conventions of the genre
(there's a romance for Rei, along with an unlikely attempt on her
life and more coincidences than you could shake a cherry blossom
branch at), but they adapt gracefully to the foreign setting. And
they never upstage the local customs, which Rei observes closely
and interprets with the quick wit of a dutiful but independent
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Johansen didn't have to pile it on so thick, trying to win
sympathy for the offbeat and immensely likable hero of his debut
mystery, THE ANSWER MAN (Bantam, $23.95). Barely employed and
crushed by debt (his disabled brother's medical bills are pure
overkill), an honest Atlanta polygraph examiner named Ken Parker
pockets $50,000 for teaching a white-collar embezzler how to beat
the machine. For all his cynicism about his profession (``The
polygraph works only if you believe it does''), he figures that ``a
few tricks, some special exercises and a lot of practice could do
the job.'' Parker makes such fascinating work of these lessons that
the punishment he has to take for his criminal indiscretion seems a
bit excessive. But the characters on his case are too well drawn to
behave predictably, and Parker is so interesting he can survive all
the sadistic turns of the hard-boiled plot.

   Why should only the lit-crit people be entitled to transgress
Thoreau's injunction (I adapt): Mistrust all writing that requires
new words. Why should they have all the fun (lots less fun for the
reader)? Exclusive to the present purpose, then: ``Greatwriting''
-- a kind of writing ostensibly done to achieve a great book but
preponderantly done to be a great writer. As for the books,
intention generally swamps result. Literary triumphs are commonly
built along the line of Napoleon's battle advice: ``On s'engage et
puis on voit'' (``Jump in and then figure'').
</P>
<P>
   James Thackara's midcentury moral and historical melodrama,
``The Book of Kings,'' amounts to an advanced case of Greatwriting,
with swaths of very good writing and quite a bit that is dreadful.
It is the product of 20 years' labor, agonizingly reported last
December in a New Yorker article that records the travails of the
author and his serially exhausted editors and agents. In the manner
of Scott failing to win the South Pole race, the travails seem to
account for much of the buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Thackara has constructed an all-inclusive panorama of World War
II in Europe and the decade that led up to it. He uses four
outsized characters: two Germans, one French-Algerian and one
American. The American is scanted; conceivably this is one of the
reasons that the 1,100 manuscript pages of December have shrunk now
to 773.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, the four keep an exhausting number of the
appointments required by historical fiction. Such appointments,
with their obligatory stops and starts, tend to give the genre a
relation to fiction, plain, that military music has to music,
plain. There is nothing plain about ``Kings,'' and though some of
its most brilliant passages describe battles, it would be
constrictive to label it military. Unless one is thinking of an
army of the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   Thackara, an American living in London, intends an epic
incorporating spiritual and historical lessons into the grand sweep
of its multiple stories. The parallel with ``War and Peace'' is
inescapable (Thackara, too, writes 50 years after the events) and
awkward. Tolstoy's lesson was war's reality versus its illusion, in
history and in particular human lives. Thackara's is an apocalyptic
question posed near the end of the book, when Nazism is about to
crumble: ``When at last the crippled lion lay dead, would Europe
still be there . . . or was that lion Europe?''
</P>
<P>
   Grandiloquent and taken out of context; unfortunately the
context is equally grandiloquent. Tolstoy gets to the lofty
questions by means of his unfailingly human details; Thackara's
lofty and far less original questions manipulate the details. It is
not so much that his main characters are larger than life as that
life is so often eclipsed in the effort to get them to display
largeness. Think of the figures scrabbling under the inflatable
effigies at the Macy's Parade.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 1930's, four young men share an
apartment on the Rue de Fleurus in Paris. Except for one pair,
there is no particular reason for the sharing other than grand
design: From a fixed center the ``Fleurusians'' will radiate to
four compass points of history. It is one of the author's
innumerable instances of assigning his characters rather than
letting them assign themselves. Essence bops freely about in
``Kings'' and existence manages on what it can. It is the property
of fable more than fiction. Albert Camus -- one Fleurusian is
closely based on him -- made his fable-novels (``The Stranger,''
``The Fall'') short. A 700-page fable is a 10-pound hummingbird.
</P>
<P>
   The four, all huge (Thackara deals in large denominations; the
reader hungers for exact change):
</P>
<P>
   David Von Sunda, a Prussian aristocrat from a family tracing its
lineage back to Arminius -- the Von Sundas own his belt buckle --
zigzags between patriotic honor and decent conscience. He flees to
Mexico to evade Nazi recruitment, returns via the trans-Siberian
express (where his wife gives birth assisted by an anti-Stalinist
Soviet doctor who is a close friend of Marshal Zhukov) and serves
under the tank genius Heinz Guderian on the soon-to-open Russian
front. Failing to recruit his commander for an anti-Hitler plot,
David deserts, is sent to a concentration camp, escapes and then,
dialectic drama collapsing into postwar aimlessness, finds nothing
better to do than amass a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Godard, a German philosophy student, achieves unworldly
eminence (he is ``a famous young philosopher'' and nephew of ``one
of Europe's most renowned thinkers'') by parsing Hegel and ignoring
what is around him. Then, like Faust, he is tempted carnally and
spiritually: enslaved by a Cruella- like Nazi opera singer and
hired by Goebbels for intellectual polish. Johannes is sucked
hellishly down and dies -- a switch from Faust to Faust's inventor
-- calling for more light.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Lothaire (the Camus character) is the son of an
impoverished pied- noir mother and a vanished Algerian father. A
Sorbonne scholarship plucks him out of Algiers and places him under
the mentorship of Marcel Dore (``France's one living master'').
Justin founds a brilliantly combative journal, writes a thunderous
book, fights in the Resistance and wins the ``Hague'' (i.e., Nobel)
Prize. He's Godard's opposite, the intellectual engaged and
uncompromised, deploring his Parisian glory and cherishing his
links to Algeria and its freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Penn, the fourth room-mate, does very little in these
curtailed pages other than inherit a great American arms fortune
and get mashed by a German tank during the Ardennes breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   There are women, as well, and Thackara works to raise them to
the mythical heights of his Fleurusians. Helne, Justin's lifelong
love but David's wife, is fitted out to be a steadily evolving
moral force. Luz (``Europe's most famous actress''), destined for
David and married to Justin, is conceived as a rainbow of feminine
fire and weakness. Though they're treated at length, only
occasionally is either more than a blur of words swathed in yards
of fictional gauze.
</P>
<P>
   The literary qualities that Thackara seems to set most store by
-- large visions and the life of the emotions -- are just those
that he handles least well, and that attract his most confused and
ill-tuned prose. By contrast, what he manages best is what his male
characters do, and what they say while they're doing it.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least a dozen extended set scenes in ``Kings,'' all
elaborately worked and burnished. Some of the burnishing goes to
episodes that misfire or droop in their suggestion of other authors
who have done them better: an Algerian fisherman's fight with a
giant tuna (Hemingway), the concentration camp (Primo Levi, Art
Spiegelman and a dozen others), Justin's childhood (the anguished
radiance of Camus's Algerian memoirs).
</P>
<P>
   Other episodes show brilliantly. There is the simple poetry of a
schooner unfurling sail and setting out; and the force of young
energy joined to young ignorance when David discovers a wrecked
plane on the family estate and spends the summer rebuilding and
then flying it. There is his brutal trek through the Russian winter
after he deserts. There is the painfully hyperreal, absolutely
authentic scene in which Justin, then unknown, tries to get his
manuscript past the receptionist of a Paris publisher.
</P>
<P>
   There are two brilliantly contrasted episodes: General Guderian
launching his panzer attack across the French border and the French
Army falling back in disarray. History has pondered this event as
thoroughly as Napoleon's advance and retreat in Russia. Here
though, in his mastery and marshaling of detail and dynamics,
Thackara makes his closest approach to the surging wave -- though
not the reflective undertow -- of Tolstoy's war chapters. More
quietly, but perhaps with greater artistry, there is Justin and his
fellow Resistance fighters blowing up a train. Thackara sets it
from the point of view of an angler fishing in a nearby pond: a
haiku that captures a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Kings,'' it is mostly a landslide -- woolly thoughts,
shards of history and junky sentences -- that submerges haiku,
historical reflection, moral passion, struggling characters and
quite a bit of assorted good writing. It has been suggested that
Thackara, like Thomas Wolfe, simply needed a Maxwell Perkins to
bring a novel out of cartons of manuscript. It is not fair to
assume that there is no Perkins at Overlook Press just because
cartons have been turned into fewer cartons. What I don't believe
even a Perkins would find in Thackara is a central Wolfean passion
to bring a vision to light. It seems more a case of a protracted
struggle to assemble a vision as a way of moving into the light.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the sad search for answers to explain the
Columbine High School massacre, we are already focusing on a
particular villain _ the dubious mental and moral values of our
national culture.
</P>
<P>
   Aha, but which culture? Whose?
</P>
<P>
   The politicians are free to pick competing scapegoats here.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made an eloquent plea at a White House
gathering Tuesday for a change in the hunting and sport-shooting
culture, which he thinks has ``gotten confused about its
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said the National Rifle Association has persuaded
people that ``every reasonable restriction is just the camel's nose
in the tent and pretty soon they'll come after my shotgun and I'll
miss the next duck hunting season.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that ``cultures are hard to change'' but added,
``It's not just a culture of violence that has to change; it's the
culture of hunting and sport shooting that has to stop financing
efforts to frighten their members ...''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert had a very different take on the problem. They called for a
national conference on youth and culture that would examine ``video
games, drugs in school, Hollywood, prayer in schools, parental
involvement and local control of schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Obvious elements of the religious right's familiar political
agenda appear on that list although it is hard to see what local
control of the schools has to do with anything. And Lott and
Hastert conspicuously did not mention the ridiculously easy access
youngsters have to guns. Guns? What guns?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., however, agreed with the president.
``It isn't our American culture that is wrong,'' he said. ``What's
wrong is our nation's love affair with guns ... This is about the
distorted interpretation of the Constitution that convinces
otherwise rational citizens it is their inalienable right to be
armed to the teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and John McCain, R-Ariz., came
at it from yet another angle. They proposed a White House summit to
pressure media executives to cut back violent depictions of what
Lieberman called ``the culture of carnage.'' The summit, they
insisted, would be long on gentle persuasion and short on
censorship threats. Mostly, however, it sounds like public
relations grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, this is shaping up as a political free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   Too many guns. Not enough religion. Parental indifference. Lax
school standards. Immoral movie makers. Unrestricted television.
Missing family values. This is what we can expect to hear
repeatedly during next year's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But will anything actually change in our society, let alone
improve? We don't go for revolutions, as former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich discovered. But we can, and do, evolve.
</P>
<P>
   It is unrealistic to expect some new legislative surge for
religious conservatism. It is silly to argue that mandatory praying
every day in school would have prevented the murderous impulses of
the two crazed student killers in Littleton, Colo. And we are weary
of those exaggerated efforts to link abortion to every sign of bad
conduct in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is demanding punishment for parents who cannot control their
children likely to get very far. Such demands are too prone to
unfair family second-guessing and too difficult to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Passing gun control legislation would be an obvious and logical
step. But Lott has given the NRA two weeks to gear up opposition
before President proposed restrictions will be debated in the
Senate. The emotional reaction now fueling calls for gun control
may well have expired by then.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposals would mandate background checks on people
who make purchases at gun shows, raise the legal age for handgun
possession from 18 to 21 years, ban the import of high-capacity
ammunition clips, require child safety locks and limit sales of
guns to one per person per month. All of this seems like common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   But the president conceded it might mean ``a hassle'' for some
people. He compared the inconvenience with that of airline metal
detector security checks. They are a nuisance but can also prevent
terrorist attacks. ``It's worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
however, reflected the view of many Republicans when he scoffed,
``We got this pious statement (from Clinton) ... that it's all the
fault of the parents and it's all the fault of people who
manufacture guns. Look, there's plenty of fault to go around
here.'' With too many targets, nothing may happen.
</P>
<P>
   It is a shame that Clinton's unscripted performance discussing
the Colorado killings got little public attention. It was brilliant
_ the president at his most persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a measure of how badly the Monica Lewinsky business
has undercut his authority that in some news accounts a remark by
First Lady Hillary Clinton got prominent play. She said during her
brief talk on the cultural causes of gun violence that ``part of
growing up is learning how to control one's impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are of the school that Clinton still behaves like a
juvenile, you couldn't resist a hoot at that.

 &UR; COMPLAINT DEPT.
</P>
<P>
   By David Finkle
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA WALTERS has a lot to answer for. And even if we leave
her aside for the moment, we urgently need answers from a society
that coughs up -- as a cat does a fur ball -- a Barbara Walters
interview as its chief validation of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Cheever certainly thinks so. His new novel, ``Famous
After Death,'' starts out with its incarcerated hero, Noel
Hammersmith, getting the make-over for television cameras that
Monica Lewinsky more recently underwent. Hammersmith is of interest
to ratings-hungry network executives because he's been imprisoned
for setting off a series of bombs in public places -- Grand Central
Terminal, for one. What motivated his crimes was uncontrolled pique
at the ``shoddy workmanship'' of so many of our modern consumer
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Hammersmith's story is relayed through entries in his journal
and through letters he sends to family and friends -- and to the
merchants who have grievously disappointed him. The book is also
interlaced with elucidating comments by unnamed editors preparing a
full-scale Hammersmith expose, ``The Compleat Wordsworth Bomber.''
</P>
<P>
   What Hammersmith vouchsafes to Walters on the air, by the way,
does differ from what he amusingly confides to his journal during
the months between Feb. 9, 1984, and Dec. 22, 1987. There he
describes his workdays at Acropolis Inc. -- the best little
publishing house in America'' -- where he oversees lucrative,
though brainless, diet books. He also explains how, in his
editorial capacity, he has met a suspicious, Wordsworth-spouting
fellow calling himself Che Guevara, who arrives with an idea for a
book about terrorists. Additionally, the journal covers
leisure-time exploits with Wilson Peters, a high-powered career
woman pregnant by another man, and outings with a misogynistic
running buddy named Giff.
</P>
<P>
   Hammersmith's journals are contradicted, however, by the
above-mentioned editors, who maintain that this devious character
made up the homicidal Guevara. The editors further disparage
Hammersmith's claim that he's become the fall guy for Guevara in an
elaborate scheme cooked up by the police to deny Guevara his bid
for notoriety (and therefore decrease sound-bite time for the
Know-Nothings, a political group he represents).
</P>
<P>
   Talk about elaborate schemes. Nothing in Cheever's novel is more
elaborate than the design for it -- the lengths to which he's gone
to illustrate how a population-wide hunger to be famous has shocked
all the compos out of the national mentis. Reading ``Famous After
Death'' is like viewing those demonstrations in which a few
thousand dominoes are arranged in complex patterns and then the
outermost is tipped, setting in motion for 30 seconds something
visually and psychologically exhilarating. Afterward, the domino
whiz explains that it took 24 hours to put all the pieces in place.
</P>
<P>
   CHEEVER'S teasing the possibilities of Guevara is akin to
tickling the reader with a feather. He's given himself the
opportunity to send up contemporary mentalities -- especially those
of unsure urban males (Hammersmith and Giff) and increasingly
impatient urban females (the less well-portrayed Wilson and
Hammersmith's sister, Kat). Hammersmith, incidentally, seems an
extension of the slightly larcenous Arthur Prentice in Cheever's
first novel, ``The Plagiarist.''
</P>
<P>
   The sly author also makes many literate and playful jokes,
frequently at the expense of the publishing business.
Industry-savvy readers will recognize the unnamed aggressive
literary agent as Andrew Wylie. As a matter of nonfact, about one
in five gags is laugh-out-loud funny, and only one in ten misses
the mark. Not a bad ratio.
</P>
<P>
   To extend the domino theory: for the entertainment to succeed,
the pieces have to be correctly aligned. Because of the numerous
elements Cheever has marshaled, his first figurative dominoes seem
somewhat out of kilter, but once they start clicking, they end in a
burst of grace, humor and mad revelation.

 &UR; TALES OUT OF ITALY
</P>
<P>
   By Robert Grudin
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While many contemporary poems and stories seem to strain for
novelty and sophistication, the essay is a short form that imposes
no such ambitious requirements. Readers of essays ask only for an
interesting subject, approached in a manner that engages our
attention -- which may be why, paradoxically, the results can be so
pleasingly inventive and urbane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adultery: And Other Diversions,'' Tim Parks's outstanding new
collection, is an elegant demonstration of the freedom and power of
the essay form. In writing about this book, Parks has modestly
renounced any claim to originality of ideas; instead, citing
Schopenhauer, he has resolved to investigate the connection between
``ideas, which have been fixed by mere words, and the real
knowledge we have acquired through perception.'' Thus he sets out
to examine the relationship between moral constructs and the actual
experience of life.
</P>
<P>
   In exploring the difference between what people think and what
they do, Parks frequently slides into storytelling. And what could
be more natural for this accomplished translator, memoirist and
novelist, whose most recent work of fiction, ``Europa,'' was a
finalist for the Booker Prize? Again and again in these 13 essays,
a passage of storytelling provides an entry into a wide-ranging
meditation on actions and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The title essay is a perfect example of this technique. Here
Parks speaks to us as the confidant of Alistair, the central figure
in the story that is about to unfold. Alistair, who teaches at an
Italian university, is having an extramarital affair with Chiara, a
33-year-old Italian widow. Over beer after games of squash, he
enthusiastically confides the graphic details of their
relationship. (``No erotic stone was left unturned,'' Parks
reports. ``I had to listen to it all.'')
</P>
<P>
   These emotional outpourings, as well as Alistair's anxious
reports on the travails of his marriage, are the means by which
Parks undertakes a careful analysis of the psychological dimensions
of adultery. Alistair finds married life stale and unexciting. He
meets Chiara at professional conferences all over Europe; their sex
is cathartic and obsessive. Alistair exults in his own mischief; he
romanticizes Chiara as a soul mate and asks her to live with him.
When she refuses and later reveals that she has been having affairs
with other men, Alistair falls apart. The much-glorified adventure
becomes a mess and then a trap.
</P>
<P>
   What is illuminated here? As he charts the history of Alistair's
affair (and the corollary history of Alistair's divorce), Parks
uncovers a reality that subtly contradicts his own book title. For
Alistair, adultery is not a ``diversion'' at all. Rather, it is a
compulsive mission, an unconscious attempt to repeat the very cycle
of events that created his marriage -- and then made it fail.
Though this insight into male eros is by no means original (as
Parks admits), I've never seen it so tellingly expressed.
</P>
<P>
   The other essays in this collection are less emotionally
arresting than ``Adultery'' and more broadly allusive. Parks
entitles each with a seemingly simple word (``Fidelity,''
``Glory,'' ``Maturity,'' ``Destiny'' and so on), which he then
subjects to a shifting array of perspectives. For example,
``Europe'' (which draws from the same material as his recent novel)
opens as follows: ``In the spring of 1993 I joined a coach trip
from Verona to Strasbourg to present a petition to the European
Parliament. My colleagues, fellow language teachers at the
university, felt they were being discriminated against by the
Italian authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of university students, mainly young Italian women,
come along on the trip, partly to support their professors, partly
to enjoy a cheap holiday -- and partly in hopes of having a fling.
By introducing this sexual element, Parks sets up an ironic paradox
that will dominate the essay, evoking the idea of a unified
European justice and juxtaposing against it the human factors -- in
this case sexual and illicit -- that make social unity and justice
so difficult to achive.
</P>
<P>
   Without disrupting his narration, Parks manages to enlarge on
the unity-disunity issue by making references to modern cinema,
Horace's carpe diem, Plato's myth of civic unity, European exchange
rates, 18th-century French history, a female student who complains
of not having achieved equilibrio interiore, even a popular song
called ``You're a Myth for Me.'' These and other adroitly deployed
details add richness to a provocative meditation in which political
unity and disunity cease to be verbal constructs and are fully
realized as human phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   Parks's essays are almost all set in northern Italy, where he
has lived and worked for some time. In this collection, as in ``An
Italian Education'' and ``Italian Neighbors,'' his books about
settling down in an adopted country, the scenes from the society
around him are amusingly drawn, as are the vignettes from his
family life. But even more interesting is the way in which Parks
presents himself as both narrator and supporting character. A
passage here, a hint there, gradually build a picture of this man
as son, father, husband, writer and teacher -- as an individual who
must, like the rest of us, navigate his way through a world of
change, challenge and temptation. His extended self-portrait is
decorous but honest. This word ``honest'' is no small tribute.
Though it is so often said to be simple, honesty is a notoriously
difficult quality for a writer to sustain. To write honestly is not
to avoid showy language but rather to be always aware of language's
power to teach or to deceive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rancour,'' the penultimate essay, is a brilliant example of
Parks's acerbic self-knowledge. Here he not only admits but
dramatizes his own professional bitterness, thrashing with a
figurative walking stick (courtesy of Samuel Beckett) at writers he
has idolized and envied. But in a characteristic flash of
revelation, he goes on to show the essential importance of anger
and jealousy in the creative process. Moving as usual from
abstraction to experience, he locates the spark of creative
activity in ``the seductive, luminous, coercive, shadowy, genial
and rancorous mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Art, he argues, ``rearranges our mental space, imposes a vision.
. . . With the best art one suffers a sense of inevitability --
which is exactly the experience of the seduced at the moment they
succumb.'' If that is the case, then ``Adultery: And Other
Diversions'' must rank among the most artful of seductions.

 &UR; MORE MELANCHOLY DANES
</P>
<P>
   By Brooks Hansen
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Near the beginning of Ella Leffland's new novel, ``Breath and
Shadows,'' Grethe Rosted is listening to her husband, Holger, read
a poem about spring when her mind wanders: ``How many hairs are
lost in a lifetime, falling to shoulder or lap and brushed to the
floor -- perhaps thousands, yet they are nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of what we lose in a lifetime, and what traces we
leave behind, lies at the heart of this exquisite and moving family
saga. Spanning two centuries, ``Breath and Shadows'' tells the
stories of three generations of a moneyed Danish clan, the Rosteds,
focusing in particular on three vividly drawn characters: Thorkild,
an ill-tempered dwarf ``of extraordinary dimensions in every
direction except upward,'' who is mourning the death of his son,
killed fighting for Napoleon in Germany; Grethe, Thorkild's
great-granddaughter, who some 70 years later is living in a grand
house on the Danish coast with a devoted husband and two healthy
sons; and finally Paula, Grethe's granddaughter, a native of
Illinois who in the 1970's has forsaken marriage, wealth and a
nagging daughter to lead a life of near seclusion in the Swiss
Jura, sculpturing in sandstone.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs are not the only points of view. By chapter, Leffland
leaps from generation to generation; by paragraph she hops from eye
to eye. We see from the perspective of Thorkild's pitiless sister,
Bodil; Paula's brother, Philip; and Grethe's infuriatingly spiteful
and envious maid. We even occasionally enter the mind of Olaf, a
battle-scarred cat who slips in and out of the Rosteds' kitchen
window every night and who shares a strange intimacy with Grethe,
``the biggest moving, breathing thing he had ever let near him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Olaf, Leffland goes where she likes, licensed by indelible
characterization and descriptions that are both crisp and sensual.
Grethe's morning bed is a ``wildly tumbled map of ardor.'' Later,
lying on a carpet of moss with Olaf, she looks up into the ``high
green trees, lit in a thousand places by small sunbursts.''
Leffland does more than paint with words; she is a guide as well,
leading us at carefully paced interludes from one setting to the
next, prompting the questions: What has changed between here and
there? What has been brushed aside, and what remains?
</P>
<P>
   Her pace is more deliberate at the outset. Nearly half the book
is spent steeping us in the lives and histories of her three main
characters. Thorkild's existence is a ludicrous bustle of
endurance, ``waddling and wheezing and spluttering'' against the
lashing northern winds. He has known companionship only briefly --
his wife died in childbirth -- and requited love only once, from
his son, who is gone. The surviving world is to him the final
insult heaped on a life of scorn, discomfort and gawking stares.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Grethe's world appears as a kind of idyll. She and
her husband (who is also her cousin) are deeply, physically in
love, and well enough provided for that they can pursue their
creative impulses without a care. Grethe translates Zola; Holger is
a painter. They take the children bathing in the sea daily; at
night they hold bohemian soirees. But the sweeter their life seems,
the more chilling are the surreal fissures of terror that begin to
trouble Grethe's mind, images of blood gushing though the soil and
surrounding her in a dark red marshland; of the moon crumbling and
all beings everywhere vanishing ``like shot arrows from the face of
the earth.'' There is one figment in particular that has been
haunting her, an anguished cry that only she can hear, coming from
the framed silhouette that hangs on the drawing room wall. It is of
her grandfather, who died long ago fighting for Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   Of Leffland's three principal characters, Paula is the farthest
removed from the world, and for that reason the least compelling.
Hers is a life of chosen solitude. Her days consist of soup and
bread, hiking in the hills, chiseling at her workbench and
otherwise fending off her grown-up daughter's attempts to make her
come home. (``Why do I have to write a letter that will take days
to get there, why can't you get a phone?'') Paula is not tempted,
and yet her work with the sandstone, which may sound the novel's
one blatant note, indicates a yearning for an ``innermost grain''
she cannot find.
</P>
<P>
   It is her brother Philip, surprisingly, who points the way. He
is a successful businessman in Chicago. He travels where and when
he likes, often in the company of an obligingly ``athletic'' young
woman from his office, but he is not happy. A brief visit to his
sister's grimy mountain garret makes plain a midlife crisis: he has
failed his adolescent ideals. At length he prevails on Paula to go
to Denmark with him to learn more about their natural father, whom
they never knew but who is familiar to us as Grethe's younger son.
</P>
<P>
   Thorkild, meanwhile, has undertaken a search of his own. Unable
to assuage his grief, he sets off for the battlefield near Leipzig
where his son was killed, clutching the boy's last letter the whole
way. Despite careful preparation, the journey does not go as
planned. He soon finds himself lost on the German back roads, and
endures a treatment it would be wrong to disclose, but which
represents one of the novel's most inspired, sad and comical peaks,
and which more than justifies his subsequent descent from rage into
madness.
</P>
<P>
   Grethe also has begun to lose her battle with the voices in her
head, and suffers a nervous breakdown, recounted with startling
lucidity. It is only to Olaf the cat, whom Grethe imagines visiting
the genteel sanitarium where she has been admitted, that she
confides the true nature of her despair, that she has failed to
``bring God's Kingdom to earth,'' and that if one ``cannot end all
suffering, then one must at least end one's own begetting.''
</P>
<P>
   As tragic as Grethe's story is, and Thorkild's as well, ``Breath
and Shadows'' attains a surprisingly peaceful quality in the end.
By braiding the stories as she has, Leffland gives the reader a
perspective her characters lack, to observe the strains that
survive the generations, and bind them: Money, madness, aimless
compassion. Not all are so obviously inherited -- there is the
golden color of the sun to which the Rosteds' pagan forebears once
prayed, which reappears in a simple bowl that catches Thorkild's
eye, which becomes a thimble on Grethe's thumb, is woven into the
leaves and roses of a small rug for her boys, which eventually
finds its way to the floor of Grethe's studio, to be covered in
sandstone dust, washed and covered again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breath and Shadows'' is laced with such threads, twisting in
and out for our attention, and though none yields a fixed meaning,
together they seem to answer the concerns of the novel's three
solitary protagonists. Their lives may be but breath and shadows,
but not all their traces are lost.

   Men, Women, and Drag.

 &UR; TOOTSIES
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Kimmel
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A colleague recently returned home to find his 10-year-old
daughter and 6-year-old son playing dress-up in front of their
mother's closet. ``It's all right, Dad,'' his son reassured him.
``I'm not a cross-dresser.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly drag is chic; masculinity and femininity are no longer
fixed by anatomy. They have become fashion accessories, which is
one reason to welcome Holly Brubach's ``Girlfriend.'' A former
style editor of The New York Times Magazine, Brubach is well
positioned to explore a world where, she says, ``art, performance
and fashion converge.'' Unlike academic theorists, for whom the
only Jean-Paul is Sartre, not Gaultier, Brubach revels in the
playful passion for glamour and style shared by female
impersonators.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by the photographer Michael James O'Brien, Brubach
takes the grand tour of the drag world, and from Rio de Janeiro and
Bangkok to Berlin and Paris she describes her growing love affair
with drag queens. O'Brien's soft-focus and occasionally slightly
blurry images conceal facial and bodily flaws; the men seem shy,
vulnerable, curious about the camera even as they flaunt themselves
before it. The result strives to be an affectionate coffee-table
book. But, as with drag itself, the content is more serious than
the form.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its overt playfulness, drag elicits strong, visceral
responses. And despite her breezy journalistic style, Brubach
deftly negotiates a middle path between two politicized poles. To
some feminists, drag is a kind of blackface of sexual roles, in
which the powerful (men) appropriate the idiom of the powerless
(women) in order to express a range of otherwise unacceptable
emotions. Why do drag queens exaggerate the most traditionally
feminine traits? Some forms of feminism may have repudiated
traditional femininity; drag seems to worship it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drag queens just as surely offer a
protofeminist critique of masculinity. To be a man means living in
an emotional straitjacket so tight that the only way to express
oneself, to let in a little glamour, may be to do it as a woman.
Remember Dustin Hoffman's admission in ``Tootsie'' that he just
needs to learn to do it without the dress? Is putting on a wig the
only way a man can let his hair down?
</P>
<P>
   All the female impersonators Brubach interviewed are homosexuals
who understand that traditional masculinity repudiates all things
feminine. Perhaps drag's power comes from the simultaneous
appropriation of the feminine and abdication of the masculine by
those who are, at least biologically, entitled to its privilege. In
one wonderfully rendered vignette, Brubach tags along as the drag
queens of Fire Island's Cherry Grove invade the hypermasculine but
equally gay muscle beach of the Pines. That moment reveals how both
femininity and masculinity can be caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   This theme is amplified in the book's most surprising chapter,
in which Brubach enrolls in a workshop for ``drag kings'' and
learns to dress and act like a man. The parallel, she finds, is
inexact. Femininity already is a form of drag, ``predicated on
artifice,'' able to be acquired by any and all. Brubach fondly
recalls Gloria Steinem's appreciation of drag: ``Women have been
female impersonators for some time.'' A man in drag ``may in fact
uphold the ideology of femininity,'' Brubach argues, but a woman in
drag will ``undermine the ideology of masculinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Brubach plays this tension for all it's worth, and it's worth
quite a bit. But she explores only this one, albeit fascinating,
group of men who dress like women. Absent are the frat party female
impersonators, heterosexual cross-dressers and transgendered people
who seek to make their appearance consistent with their
self-perception. This narrowed focus flattens the text. Brubach
maps diversity only by traveling to different countries, and plays
down the similarities she finds -- the world over, drag queens
imitate the same 1950's Hollywood movie stars, sashay to the same
disco songs and share the same secrets for tucking tummies and
removing unsightly body and facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Brubach seems to learn more from her own efforts at
crossing sexual boundaries than from all her drag queens put
together. Though she disavows feminist orthodoxies, her conclusion
restates one of feminism's core insights: ``Masculinity, no less
than femininity, is an undertaking, and those who are unsuccessful
in their efforts -- all the failed men -- are branded women.'' Or,
as the rock singer Patti Smith once put it, ``Being any gender is a
drag.''

 &UR; THE PIZZA CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
   BY NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nicola Zappetti was one of the first American conquerors to
arrive after Japan's surrender at the end of World War II, and he
showed his true colors immediately. Then a 22-year-old Marine
sergeant in charge of seizing an airstrip, he instead posted his
men in a geisha house and paid for the women's services with
confiscated yen.
</P>
<P>
   Zappetti was not the kind of fellow who did things by the rules.
His ``flexibility'' led him to become an American tycoon in Tokyo,
most famous for his pizza restaurants but deeply mixed up in just
about anything that was spicy or unethical. From gambling to
smuggling to diamond theft, Zappetti had a varied career, although
by the time he died in 1992 he was a frail and embittered old man
who railed at everything Japanese, even telling American men
visiting his restaurants to be sure not to marry their Japanese
dates.
</P>
<P>
   In most books, history is made of sterner stuff, and so
conventional accounts of modern Japan, filled with prime ministers
and such, are important and earnest and dull. ``Tokyo Underworld''
is the opposite: not particularly consequential, but a fun book
about a wretched character. Robert Whiting, an American writer
living in Tokyo and the author of ``You Gotta Have Wa,'' tries to
add context in order to illuminate Japanese-American relations as a
whole, but fundamentally this is a yarn rather than a tome.
</P>
<P>
   The yarn focuses on Zappetti but also incorporates the stories
of various Japanese gangsters and lowlife types, illuminating what
to me has always seemed one of the central paradoxes of modern
Japan: random muggings are almost nonexistent, but
institutionalized robbery is routine -- through such shady
practices as bid-rigging by construction companies that pay off
politicians. Japan has the most honest used car salesmen in the
world along with some of the most crooked politicians, and
Zappetti's story explores that conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   One of 11 children of a carpenter from Italy, Zappetti was
raised in the Italian ghetto of East Harlem. Several family members
were in the Mafia, and the next-door neighbor was a professional
hit man. Zappetti might have grown up to be a low-level Mafia
enforcer if not for opportunities created by the end of World War
II and the rise of Japan. Americans tend to have sweet thoughts of
the Occupation as an era when friendly G.I.'s had a hand
outstretched with candy for Japanese children, but there was plenty
of larceny going on with the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the soldiers stationed in Japan each month remitted to
the United States a sum that exceeded their total payroll. When the
Bank of Japan entrusted the United States Army with 800,000 carats
of diamonds, the diamonds simply vanished. When the Tokyo police
force handed over its guns to the Americans, the entire armory
somehow disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, this was an ideal moment for a man like Zappetti. He
retired from the Marine Corps and became a black marketeer,
diverting truckloads of beer intended for American troops and
selling it to Japanese gangsters. Zappetti then diversified into
bad checks, stolen spaghetti, smuggled lighter flints, rigged slot
machines and similar ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Zappetti sometimes got into trouble, as when he supplied a gun
for a famous diamond robbery in the Imperial Hotel in 1956.
Arrested and interrogated, he was finally released on payment of an
$800 fine, but the episode forced him into new business directions.
So he opened up a pizza restaurant, which became an enormous hit
among foreigners desperate for a good pizza. Visiting Americans
from John Wayne to Frank Sinatra dropped by, and Emperor Akihito
(then the crown prince) courted Empress Michiko there.
</P>
<P>
   Whiting, who interviewed Zappetti at length before his death,
tells us that his subject lost most of his money and property over
the years through divorces and lawsuits and idiotic ventures. In
the early 1990's, he was planning to hire some killers to knock off
everybody who had ever crossed him -- he got a bid for the contract
killings from one gang, based on a group rate -- but before he
could work things out, he suffered a heart attack and died. His
legacy today is the Nicola's restaurant chain in Japan (now owned
by a Japanese company) and the thickest file that the Japanese
police ever collected on an American.

 THE HIDDEN WORDSWORTH

 &UR; STRANGE FITS OF PASSION
</P>
<P>
   BY HERMIONE LEE
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Erotic, passionate, young, adventurous, turned on by city life,
politically active, a man of mystery -- wait, isn't this Byron? No,
this is the ``hidden'' younger Wordsworth, exhaustively decoded by
his dedicated biographer-sleuth-critic Kenneth R. Johnston. This is
a Wordsworth we have never quite seen before -- difficult,
conflicted, struggling to create the triumph of the writing self
out of the failures and confusions of the first half of his life.
It is a problematic Wordsworth for the 21st century, and a far cry
from the serene, nature-loving, celebratory -- and boring? -- sage
of Grasmere.
</P>
<P>
   I came to ``The Hidden Words worth'' prejudiced against its
subject, fresh from the second volume of Richard Holmes's biography
of Coleridge, in which Wordsworth appears as mean, cold and smug,
an ungenerous, pompous critic of his once dear friend. Faced with
more than 900 pages that only got him up to the age of 36 and the
publication in 1807 of his ``Poems in Two Volumes,'' I felt I would
need a great deal of convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this didn't strike me as a book for the general
reader, in spite of its strategic scatterings of cuddly relevant
phrases (Wordsworth's poem ``An Evening Walk'' is like an ``amateur
video,'' his walk through France toward the Alps is ``on-road
conditioning,'' the reassuring end of a fragment written at
Chepstow Castle is the equivalent of ``Don't worry, be happy'').
But Johnston's staggering industriousness did draw me in, though he
did not make me like Wordsworth any more than before: his egotism,
irritability, dislike of criticism and shortcomings in friendship
are not evaded.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, chairman of the English department at Indiana
University, takes the Holmesian model of following in his subject's
footsteps as far as it can go. When you see him casting about at
the top of the Simplon Pass to work out exactly where and when
Wordsworth had lunch and lost his way on Aug. 17, 1790 (``a matter
of some critical importance'') or crossing military territory on
Salisbury Plain and finding a tank turret heart-stoppingly swiveled
toward him or trying, ``with great difficulty,'' to follow
Wordsworth's precise route to Tintern Abbey on what is now a busy
roadway, you have to be thankful for his sake that Wordsworth did
not fall off a mountain or drown in a lake.
</P>
<P>
   His perseverance is matched by his audaciousness. What
Wordsworth needs, he says, is not more facts but more speculation.
His ``rule of thumb'' has been ``when there's a choice of
possibilities, investigate the riskier one.'' (Compare an admirable
predecessor, Stephen Gill, who often argues in his 1989 biography
``William Wordsworth: A Life,'' ``Caution seems best when we know
so little.'') But Johnson's risk-taking is never careless; it is
the fruit of long-term concentration, answering to what Coleridge,
Wordsworth's best commentator, said of ``Descriptive Sketches'':
``It demanded a greater closeness of attention than poetry (at all
events, than descriptive poetry) has a right to claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston never lets us see Wordsworth in splendid isolation but
always in the thick of his times. So the childhood is shaped not
only by the early deaths of his parents but by the ``violations of
honor'' involved in his father's job as the agent who looked after
the Cumberland estate of the much-loathed Sir James Lowther. All
through the book, we are made keenly aware of Wordsworth's uneasy
financial situation, the pressure on him from disapproving
relatives to get a conventional job and his paradoxical need of
security and early resistance to it.
</P>
<P>
   His school days at Hawkshead are set in a working landscape of
slate quarrying and timbering, peopled by ``miners, loggers,
charcoal burners, saddlers, joiners, peddlers,'' discharged
veterans, vagrants and social outcasts -- the people who became the
subjects of Wordsworth's great poems of suffering humanity. Here
and in his accounts of the West Country and of Wordsworth's return
to Grasmere in 1799, Johnston admirably upends any idealizing
sentimental version of picturesque rural England.
</P>
<P>
   Wordsworth's much-debated failure to excel -- or to publish any
prize poems -- at Cambridge is embedded in all you could ever want
to know about the late 18th-century examination system there,
explaining why he rejected ``not the exams per se, but the
personally humiliating subservience to a course of social
advancement of which they were the prime instruments.'' He was not
going to become, as his relatives would have liked, a learned
parson.
</P>
<P>
   The great adventure of his youth, his love affair in France in
1792 with Annette Vallon, who bore his child, and his deep, brief
friendship with the revolutionary hero Michel Beaupuy -- the two
experiences that radicalized him in ``love and politics
simultaneously'' -- are vividly connected to the historical drama
of the French Revolution. And the account of his life in London in
the early 1790's, moving into the circle of radical intellectual
publishers and polemicists like William Godwin and Thomas Holcroft,
shows him as a fascinated and involved observer of London life,
actively engaged in political debate and a contributor to the
radical weekly The Philanthropist, in which Johnston finds many
parallels between essays on ``the wages of the poor'' or ``the
freedom of the press'' and Wordworth's ``known writings'' of the
time. This is a more politically active young Wordsworth than his
later cover-ups of his past have led other biographers to credit.
</P>
<P>
   The contradictions and obscurities in his youthful politics are
startlingly underlined by Johnston's later contention that in the
years of his political retrenchment -- the years of a general
disillusionment with republicanism for many former radicals,
following the Terror, the war with France, the rise of Napoleon and
the clampdown in England on ``treasonable'' speech aWordsworth
could have been recruited as a spy. On his travels to Germany in
1798 he may have been involved in the Foreign Office's clandestine
efforts to control the plots of ``desperate Royalists'' to
overthrow the French Government. This theory is based on a newly
discovered entry in the account book of the Duke of Portland, the
Home Secretary, in charge of domestic security and espionage, of a
payment of nearly
</P>
<P>
   100 to a ``Mr. Wordsworth'' in 1799; on a provable link between
Wordsworth and ``powerful persons in the Foreign and the Home
Office''; on an unexplained gap of two months in the record of
Wordsworth's German tour; on evidence of Wordsworth's eagerness to
get out from under his Jacobin associations; and on Johnston's
growing belief that for the freedom and empowerment of the poet, it
was permissible to draw on funds from the state. So, paradoxically,
we discover at once a Wordsworth more adventurous and more
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's other audacious decoding of a ``hidden'' Wordsworth
concerns his sex life. Previous biographers have assumed, for lack
of evidence, that Wordsworth had no sexual encounters before
Annette (when he was 21) and none between leaving her pregnant in
1792 and marrying Mary Hutchinson in 1802. Johnston deduces an
altogether more erotically charged life story. The amount of
promiscuity in Cambridge, and ``a careful reading of scattered
evidence in 'The Prelude,' ``suggest that as a student Wordsworth
at least knew about ``dissolute'' women. There may have been a
``sexual initiation'' at Lake District dances in his first
vacation. And a night on Lake Como on his tour of 1790,
inexplicably spent apart from his traveling companion, may have
involved an encounter of some kind with a ``dark-eyed maid.''
Johnston's reading of the relationship with Annette as one of
``deep passion'' makes him believe that Wordsworth made a rash,
secret journey to France in search of her in September 1793, at the
height of the Terror. (Johnston loves to build a ``wild surmise''
on lack of evidence.) In the years after Wordsworth's abandonment
</P>
<P>
   of (or unwilling separation from?) Annette, his intimate
relationship with Dorothy is seen as hovering on the edge of incest
(initiated by her, resisted by him) mediated through a third
person: ``To the degree that they could -- or could not -- love
each other directly, they did so through their shared passion for
Coleridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Johnston is often scathing about oversimplistic
psychobiography, his treatment of Wordsworth and Dorothy does come
close to it, as when, remarking on their curious habit of lying
down next to each other outdoors, pretending to be in their graves,
he explains it as ``a form of therapy for subduing their strong
erotic attraction to each other.'' But most of his arguments come
from avid deconstructions of the poetry. Wordsworth, he argues, was
a poet who may have refashioned his past but drew very literally --
more than we realize'' -- on his own experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston looks very closely for his clues. So, making the case
for a sexual encounter at a Lake District dance, he notes that (in
the 1805 ``Prelude'') Wordsworth uses the word ``glossy'' for the
``badge of manliness and freedom'' he got from the dances and
sports of his youth. This word, ``suggestive of fresh, glowing,
postcoital skin,'' ``could certainly suggest sexual initiation,''
since he also uses the word ``gloss'' about actresses in London
playhouses -- and his description of the sunrise after the dance
echoes Milton's sensual account of Adam's first sight of Eve.
(Whenever Wordsworth echoes Milton, Johnston finds an erotic
reference.) Or the unprinted revisions to his accounts of dancing
girls in ``Descriptive Sketches'' (``dewy lips,'' ``soft amorous
wishes'') suggest a narrator filled with ``pulsating voyeuristic
lust'' and ``glowering desire so strong that it hurts,'' which
confirms the supposition about the lost night on Lake Como.
Sometimes these interpretations look like overinterpretations.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a great pity, though, if the book's sensational
claims to new readings of Wordsworth's secret life were to
overshadow its most thoughtful and impressive aspect. This is its
account of a young man's self-transformation into a poet. Johnston
calls Wordsworth's poetic career a ``triumph of failure.'' It is
littered with collaborations that went wrong, with lifelong
processes of uncompleted revisions, with unfinished fragments,
postponed publications, promised works never achieved. Yet these
failures, and the confusions and contradictions of Wordsworth's
young life, fed into the complex, subtle power of his great works.
The readings here of ``Tintern Abbey,'' ``Lyrical Ballads,'' ``The
Prelude,'' the sonnets and many lesser known works show
Wordsworth's search to understand the ``moral responsibility'' of
the poet, his lifelong argument between history and the individual
consciousness, political reformism and the celebration of nature,
and, crucially, his struggle between the poet's observation of the
``solitary anguish'' of humanity and his refusal to be merely
heartless, forlorn or egotistical. Rightly, Johnston applies
Wordsworth's lines on Burns to him: ``Deep in the general heart of
men
/
</P>
<P>
   His power survives.''

 &UR; HISTORY AS A COCKFIGHT
</P>
<P>
   By Patrick Mrkee
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If magical realism can be said to have a birthplace, it is,
appropriately, the island of Hispaniola. In late 1943 the great
Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier visited Haiti and toured what had
once been the kingdom of Henri Christophe. (Christophe, a traitor
to the revolutionary hero Toussaint L'Ouverture, declared himself
King Henri I after Haitian independence in 1804.) Walking through
the remains of Christophe's brutal reign -- through ``the poetic
ruins of Sans-Souci and the massive citadel of La Ferrire,
impressively intact despite lightning bolts and earthquakes'' --
Carpentier realized what set the New World apart from the Old. With
every step, he wrote in the influential prologue to his novel of
Haiti, ``The Kingdom of This World,'' ``I found lo real
maravillo,'' the early concept for magical realism, and found that
``the Americas are far from having used up their wealth of
mythologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely six years earlier Carpentier might have encountered the
less magical side of reality in Hispaniola. In 1937 Gen. Rafael
Trujillo, the Dominican dictator, ordered the killing of thousands
of Haitian immigrants and laborers in the border region, along the
aptly named Massacre River. In what later was called El Corte, the
Harvest, Dominican soldiers used machetes and bayonets to slaughter
the Haitians, many of whom had lived all their lives in the
Dominican Republic. Trujillo blamed the Haitians for the massacre,
but agreed to pay restitution to the Haitian Government, an amount,
the journalist and historian Eduardo Galeano once noted, that came
to $29 for every officially recognized death.
</P>
<P>
   The 1937 massacre is a central moment in Hispaniola's history,
and is vividly recounted in Michele Wucker's ``Why the Cocks Fight:
Dominicans, Haitians, and the Struggle for Hispaniola,'' a complex
exploration of the cultural divide between Haiti and the Dominican
Republic. Wucker, a journalist who lived for years in the Dominican
Republic and reported on the 1991 coup in Haiti, weaves together
five centuries of tragic conflict with a subtle picture of the
island today.
</P>
<P>
   The history is impossibly rich, and all too often desperately
violent -- from the conquest of the Taino Indians to the colonial
skirmishes between the French and Spanish for possession of the
island; from the United States occupation of Haiti in 1915 to its
invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965; from the island's sugar
cane fields to the streets of Washington Heights in New York City.
And throughout this panoramic history Wucker inserts lively
portraits of Haitians and Dominicans struggling in contemporary
Hispaniola and abroad: Haitian cane cutters on Dominican
plantations, displaced peasants on the outskirts of Santo Domingo
and immigrants and exiles in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A major theme is the role of racism throughout the island's
history. Haiti, whose independence was born of a slave rebellion
and inspired by Enlightenment notions of human rights, came to be
dominated by a light-skinned elite. A series of Dominican leaders,
especially Trujillo, who sympathized with Nazi race ideology and
wore face powder to lighten his skin, demonized Haitians and
dark-skinned Dominicans. As Wucker notes, Dominican strongmen like
Joaquin Balaguer resorted time and again to the scapegoating of
Haitians. Even in recent years they have used thinly disguised
coded language to accuse populist leaders in the Dominican Republic
of being Haitian.
</P>
<P>
   Migration is the other major theme of the book. Wucker describes
in sharp detail the reality of Haitian sugar cane cutters,
collectively called braceros in the Dominican Republic, working in
virtually slave-labor conditions. She interviews a cutter who has
lived on a plantation for almost his entire life, toiling 70-hour
weeks for pennies an hour. For nearly a century the Dominican
Government has literally purchased thousands of workers each year
from the Haitian Government through annual contracts. The workers
have few or no rights, and their children no legal status; they are
trapped in a sort of no man's land. At the same time, they are
subject to the vagaries of the world sugar market and United States
sugar policy. As Wucker writes, ``the braceros are caught in the
logic of a time long ago, of the days of slave merchants and
colonial plantations.''
</P>
<P>
   Migration also plays a decisive role beyond the island. The
million Haitian immigrants in Miami and New York were a major
influence in forcing a flip-flopping Clinton Administration to
restore Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in 1994. And the one in
eight Dominicans who live in the United States, the vast majority
of them in New York City, feel nostalgia for their homeland as
their children become more identified with North American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Wucker finds in the cockfight a microcosm for the two sides of
Hispaniola: the strongman leaders, like the Duvaliers and Balaguer,
staging bloody fights in the arena, while the players on the
sidelines -- the armed forces, the bourgeoisie, the United States
-- wager on the outcome. But she moves beyond this simple metaphor
to explore the role of the traditional cockfight in both national
cultures, using as a basis for comparison Clifford Geertz's studies
of Balinese cockfights. Indeed, she even enlists St. Augustine, who
was entranced by a cockfight he happened upon, and wrote of the
deformity of a bloodied, defeated rooster that ``by that very
deformity was the more perfect beauty of the contest in evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's closing scene is, fittingly, during carnival on the
outskirts of the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, where Haitian
immigrants and peasant migrants reside. In the neighborhood of
Palave, whose name derives from the French Palais Bel, or beautiful
palace, Haitians dance to the sounds of a bamboo trumpet called a
vaksin. Merengue mixed with hip-hop blasts from a car stereo, and a
Dominican youth from New York break dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``During carnival, the festival that flaunts limits and rules,''
Wucker writes, ``real conflicts disappear as Dominicans and
Haitians celebrate their differences and their common roots.'' It
is a glimpse of the future, a New World moment when magic and the
real intertwine and Hispaniola's history unfolds in a more hopeful
way.

 &UR; A GOOD MAN MAD
</P>
<P>
   BY PATRICK MCGRATH
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Stewart O'Nan is a writer who likes to dig deep into the
quotidian soil where evil germinates, and who designs his
narratives so as to bring that evil to a full and ghastly
flowering. In other words, he earns his horror. He painstakingly
establishes the conditions in which ordinary individuals are tested
beyond their strength and then, trapped in webs of circumstance and
wrong thinking, turn their rage upon those they imagine to be the
authors of their misery -- or upon themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This design is most apparent in O'Nan's first novel, the solid,
measured ``Snow Angels,'' in which an inadequate and shaky man,
having embraced religion for the spiritual ballast he so
desperately needs, veers into madness after the death of his
daughter. In ``The Names of the Dead,'' O'Nan's impressive Vietnam
novel, it is the trauma of war that plants the destructive seed as
the author intercuts the vividly realized experiences of a young
medic in Vietnam with the same man's later attempts, back home in
upstate New York, to live with memories that threaten to overwhelm
him.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of O'Nan's fifth novel, ``A Prayer for the Dying,''
is similarly haunted, this time by memories of the Civil War. His
name is Jacob Hansen, and he functions as sheriff, preacher and
undertaker in the small Wisconsin town of Friendship. Jacob is a
man who worries constantly at the terrible knowledge of his past,
of the desperate things he had to do to survive that most grisly of
conflicts. As the novel opens, he must also contend with what seem
to be the punitive gestures of an angry God: the twin evils of
plague (in the form of a diphtheria outbreak) and fire.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is this: The brush fires that threaten Friendship in
its long hot summer arouse in its residents the natural desire to
flee. Yet the quarantine imposed by Jacob to halt the spread of the
disease constrains them to stay right where they are. Jacob's
situation is an impossible one. Despite his deep religious beliefs
and his quiet grasp of the logistics of the crisis, he is not equal
to the stresses that are imposed on him.
</P>
<P>
   O'Nan has employed a surprising but ultimately successful
narrative technique for Jacob's story: it is told throughout in the
second-person singular and the present tense. Thus Jacob's
references to himself as ``you'' have a self-distancing effect; it
is as if he doesn't fully occupy his own being and observes himself
from some other place. He is both in his own experience and outside
of it. This is a fine perspective for a narrator who will be forced
to move from the orderly, predictable contentment of his life in a
placid 19th-century farm town to confront the appalling prospect of
chaos and destruction as the people around him sicken and die and
the brush fires advance ever closer.
</P>
<P>
   The character of this strange man -- loving father and husband,
conscientious sheriff and pastor, indefatigable builder of expertly
made coffins -- is established by means of oblique strokes. Jacob
communicates much by what he leaves unsaid, frequently brooding
about his idea of duty and his relationship with God and only
seldom letting us glimpse the darker images that skulk about in the
shadows of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   O'Nan is a writer who in his past work has sometimes told us too
much about his characters, so the brevity and allusiveness that he
employs in the creation of Jacob Hansen come as a bracing
development. Jacob is skewed at a deep level, and our understanding
of just how skewed he is emerges so gradually, and so elliptically,
that the full impact is felt not in the direct telling but in our
sudden lurching grasp of just what this man has done -- and what he
is capable of doing -- as his world turns upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The horror, then, flares to life in the reader's mind rather
than on the page, just as it does in the work of a writer like M.
R. James, whose Edwardian ghost stories create hugely creepy
effects from the most minute phenomena. In all his books, O'Nan has
displayed an interest in the horrific, but he indulged it with the
most zest in a fast, dark novel called ``The Speed Queen.'' That
book was fashioned as the death-row memoir of a young woman whose
involvement in a botched robbery spiraled into an
amphetamine-fueled killing spree. The narrator of ``The Speed
Queen'' has sold her story to Stephen King, and she talks to him by
means of a tape recorder while awaiting the verdict on her final
appeal for a stay of execution. It is not the most elegant of
framing devices, nor is the spectacle of drug-driven bloody mayhem
especially edifying. Of more interest is the tone of the narrator,
her blandness, her moral vacuity, her lately acquired religiosity,
all the cheery banality of her stunted consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of a mind out of sync with the moral implications of
its own experience similarly permeates ``A Prayer for the Dying,''
but with a nuanced complexity that is altogether absent from ``The
Speed Queen.'' As the crisis faced by the township ratchets to ever
higher degrees of peril, so Jacob, somehow spared the sickness that
is rapidly carrying off his friends and neighbors, finds himself
thrust into the center of events.
</P>
<P>
   As he wrestles with not one but two destructive forces of
nature, the novel seems at times to expand to grand allegorical
dimensions, and the reader glimpses in poor Jacob an Everyman
confronted by powers he cannot control, powers that will surely
destroy him. He is also an Everyman in his attempts, in the midst
of so much unwarranted suffering, to fall back on a few flimsy
precepts about the nature of God and his own guilt-riddled soul as
he tries to determine the meaning of the disaster. It is hardly
surprising, then, that Jacob should lose his sanity, for Everyman
cannot really cope with sheer, blind, random meaninglessness.
</P>
<P>
   The manifestations of its narrator's madness are what lend this
short novel its Gothic originality and power. Jacob is a
God-fearing preacher, a good family man and an upholder of the law,
but by the end of the book there seems to be no moral taboo he has
not violated. He has not, however, committed his transgressions
with some great Nietzschean howl of defiance or even with the dumb
amorality of the death-row narrator of ``The Speed Queen.'' Rather,
he has sinned with the worried, puzzled, impotent earnestness of a
good man to whom bad things are happening on an appallingly large
scale.
</P>
<P>
   But how do we know that Jacob is good? Because he loves his wife
and daughter and would do anything to protect them -- and, indeed,
all the townspeople -- from the encroaching evil. Once the
swiftness and deadliness of the diphtheria epidemic have been
established, it is enough for us to hear a woman cough to know that
she is doomed. When that woman is Jacob's beloved wife, Marta, and
their child is already mortally ill, we can almost hear the struts
of Jacob's being bend and crack. Although he himself does not
comment on that cough, we recognize his silence as the mark of his
denial. He will sustain that denial almost to the end, refusing to
believe that his wife has died and maintaining their domestic
routines as if she were still alive. It is in such situations, as
Edgar Allan Poe well knew, when the distinction between a living
woman and a dead one breaks down, that great sins may be committed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jacob goes about his work as conscientiously as he
knows how. He buries the dead and burns their houses. He preaches
to the survivors and maintains the quarantine. The flames of his
guilt about what he did in the war are fanned by what he can only
regard as biblical punishments imposed on the town by an irascible
Deity. At some level, he believes that the calamity is all his
fault.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a moment of grotesque surreality when a traveling
circus, complete with an elephant, attempts to pass through the
area and Jacob turns it back at the town line. At another point,
when the fires have almost reached Friendship, a flock of swallows
drops from the sky. ``They come down around you, their soft bodies
pelting your back. They cover the road, dead yet perfect. When you
bend to touch one, its feathers are hot, its eye boiled white.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Prayer for the Dying'' is that rare thing, a horror story
that achieves its effects by taking a narrowly circumscribed area
of human experience and expanding it to probe much larger
questions. By splicing together the themes of individual guilt,
belief in a merciful God and the destructive power of an apparently
malignant Nature, Stewart O'Nan has produced a fine, terse novel
about the circumstantial nature of evil and the terrible fragility
of man.

 &UR; MR. NOT-QUITE-RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   By Lucinda Rosenfeld
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like I was fetishizing his otherness,'' a friend
of mine sighed on breaking up with her boyfriend, a southern
California car detailer who specialized in lightning bolts. Alas,
it's not easy being a member of the cultural elite -- as Sara
Davidson makes all too clear in her fifth book, a fictionalized
memoir about her love affair with an uneducated cowboy artisan.
Whether a fictionalized memoir ought to be read as a memoir or as a
work of fiction invites a separate discussion. But the story goes
as follows: Davidson, a Berkeley-educated, Mercedes station
wagon-driving divorced mother of two, learns of a cowboy poetry
festival from a wrangler-consultant on the set of the television
western she writes for (``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman''). On a whim
inspired in equal parts by journalism and libido, she and a writer
friend pack their bags for Elko, Nev., where -- among the aging
cowboys performing ``Tumbling Tumbleweed'' -- a hunk selling
handcrafted rawhide bridles uses Davidson's press badge as a point
of conversational departure (``New York Times. . . . What's
that?''). Davidson dismisses the guy as an ``insolent yokel'' --
until a love poem arrives in her mailbox a week later, leaving her
shuddering on several counts, not just the poem's raw emotionalism
but the poet's poor spelling skills. As Davidson's friend comments,
``The only thing standing between you and this man is spell
check!''
</P>
<P>
   But an unexpectedly intense relationship develops between
Davidson and the so-called ``Zack.'' On the positive side, he plays
into a lifetime of erotic fantasies having to do with chaps (``The
rough leather directs the eye up the legs to the place where the
leather stops, just below the groin''). On the negative side, the
new boyfriend's never heard of Anne Frank. If that wasn't bad
enough, on their weekends together, the well-compensated Davidson
is forced to foot the bill for everything from his airplane tickets
to their seaside hotel rooms. After he relocates to Los Angeles to
be with her, Davidson even agrees to pay the bulk of the rent on
Zack's Topanga Canyon cottage. Can love transcend educational and
economic disparity? This is the question Davidson poses and
attempts to answer in the affirmative. (At publication time, she
and the Marlboro man were still a match.)
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Davidson never seems entirely convinced. ``He's fed and
groomed me, laughed and played with me, taken me riding and to
states of ecstasy and I'm complaining that he uses wrong words?''
But she continues to complain -- albeit couching her harshest
criticisms in the mouths of her bratty children (he smells; he's a
hick) and her snobbish talent agent ex-husband (he shouldn't have
given their 11-year-old son butane and a lighter to play with).
Meanwhile, for all her feminist posturing about societal
intolerance of powerful women who take up with less powerful men,
Davidson is only too eager to prove that her and Zack's primary
bond has always been a physical one. Indeed, you can almost hear
the kids shrieking ``Eeeeewww'' -- never mind this reviewer --
every time Davidson launches into another description of the
apparently time-defying bouts of lovemaking. Is it any wonder the
never-not-in-the-mood Zack comes across as some kind of stud for
hire -- all the while uttering made-
</P>
<P>
   for-TV lines like ``All I want to do is ride horses, braid
things and make love to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Davidson has a supposedly revelatory moment during which
she realizes that the whole time she's been writing ``Dr. Quinn''
(in which Jane Seymour plays a doctor from Boston married to a
sexually potent mountain man), she's actually been writing her own
story. The news came as no surprise to this reader, who found
herself doing the casting (Meryl Streep and Robert Redford?) from
page 1.

</P>
<P>
   Howard M. Sachar plunges into ``Israel and Europe,'' the latest
of his many books about Israel and the Jews, with minimal fanfare.
A few acknowledgments, and we're smack in medias res: ``On Feb. 14,
1947, Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin informed the House of Commons
that he was referring the fate of Britain's embroiled Palestine
mandate to the United Nations.'' The ensuing account of Britain's
decision after World War II to unburden itself of its expensive and
unruly Palestinian dependency clips along at the same bustling
pace, with events, facts, judgment and analysis flowing as from a
finely engineered assembly plant. There are few pauses as Sachar
guides us through the enormously complex and ambivalent
relationship between European nations and the Jewish state, an
association built on both shared culture and antagonism, on common
values and the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   That pace and that richness of material are the strength and the
weakness of this study. It comes as no surprise that Sachar is
thoroughly familiar with his subject. A professor of history at
George Washington University, he has written 13 earlier books on
Jewish and Middle Eastern history, including comprehensive works
like ``The Course of Modern Jewish History.'' Indeed, this latest
study -- which Sachar somewhat enigmatically subtitles ``An
Appraisal in History'' -- amounts to fitting a few more pieces into
the grand jigsaw puzzle to which he has dedicated his scholarly
career.
</P>
<P>
   And critical pieces they are. Today, when Israel's paramount
security ties are to the United States, it is possible to forget
how intimately the Jewish state's history is bound to Europe --
that its founding fathers and first leaders were Europeans, that
the first waves of settlers were refugees from the Holocaust, that
the newborn state was armed and supported in its vulnerable early
years not by the United States, which in those days sought to stem
the flow of arms to Israel, but by France. Zionism, Sachar notes in
his acknowledgments, ``from its inception was the Jews' ideological
response specifically to European romantic nationalism, their
political response to European anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of that response is richly chronicled by Sachar.
Focusing largely on Britain, France, West Germany, the Vatican and
Russia, he explains the interplay of prejudices, guilt, domestic
politics and cold war rivalries that shaped ever-shifting relations
between the Europeans and the little state on the eastern
Mediterranean. There is Germany, which perceives support of Israel
as ``a moral obligation of the German people, a commitment that
transcended all issues of conventional statecraft.'' There is
Britain, torn between traditional sympathies for the Arabs and the
reality of a gutsy Jewish state. There is the Soviet Union, locked
in a permanent contest for influence and power with the United
States, trying to use weapons and its sizable Jewish minority as
levers. There is France, careering from all-out support of the
Israelis to imperious opposition as its own fortunes shift. There
are the many other Europeans -- the Spaniards, the Vatican, the
East Europeans -- all guided, to varying degrees, by public opinion
and political need. And of course there is Israel itself, torn
between distrust of the Europeans and an elemental pursuit of arms
and trade, attracting admiration and support through raw courage
and spectacular victories, then creating resentment through its
treatment of Palestinian Arabs and their occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
   In his finest passages, Sachar displays a true professor's
talent for the cogent explanation of a complicated concept. Here,
for example, is his analysis of the ambivalent reaction of the
Europeans to the assassinations of suspected terrorists by Israeli
agents operating on European soil in the 1970's: ``In the prewar
era, their rightist elements had stigmatized Jews as a retrograde
people, from whom nothing good could be expected. But with the
postwar revelations of the Holocaust, followed by the rise of
Israel, and the Jewish state's underdog military victories over the
Arab armies, Europe tended to embrace a maximalist view of the
Israelis as 'new' Jews, paragons of all that was gallant, decent,
honorable and moral in the human condition. Belatedly and
subliminally, Europe in effect was imposing on Israel a categorical
imperative that its own peoples earlier had forfeited.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Sachar makes no secret of his profound
admiration for Israel, and his pride in the renaissance of the
Jewish homeland. This is a book in which Israel is hero. It is the
``little nation'' bravely staving off its foes, and European
leaders are divided according to their attitudes toward it -- they
are either a ``friend of the Jews'' or subject to ``blatant
pro-Arab partisanship.'' In a few instances, Sachar allows himself
a brief burst of angry sarcasm at European hypocrisy, as when the
Europeans assail Israel over the invasion of Lebanon in 1982: ``It
was the Jews, perennial victims of European persecution and
claimants on the European conscience, who were inflicting havoc on
others.'' In internal Israeli politics, Sachar also leaves little
doubt as to his own liberal and secularist leanings, or to his
regret at the current impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process. Yet he places some of the highest blame for it not on
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but on ``the irresolution of
Washington's Middle East diplomacy'' under President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sachar does not allow his love of Israel to cloud his
judgment. He offsets his feelings with ample objective evidence,
and is scrupulously fair in explaining the full range of factors
shaping European attitudes toward Israel. In fact, I would have
dearly preferred more argument, more passion, more drama. For too
many of its 398 pages, the text reads like a catalogue of
developments, events and diplomatic maneuvers, all presented in
roughly the same tone. To use Sachar's own subtitle, there is too
much history and not enough appraisal. There are ample dates and
facts, countless diplomatic confrontations, but too few
personalities, too little of the intellectual debate in Europe or
Israel about each other, too little of the inherent drama in the
interplay of peoples with so much baggage in their common
histories.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one longs for more because there is so much. What Sachar
achieves in collating the history of European-Israeli relations and
in keeping it clear, compelling and accessible is a remarkable
feat. It is a critical background for any appreciation of the
Jewish state.

 &UR; THERE'LL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING OR OTHER
</P>
<P>
   By Alexander Stille
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   IN ``Anglomania'' Ian Buruma presents the history of an idea --
the idea of Britain -- which has loomed so large and meant so many
different things in the European imagination in recent centuries.
To some, Britain is a land of freedom and tolerance, of Magna
Carta, parliamentary democracy and refuge to political dissidents
from Voltaire to Salman Rushdie; to others, it is a place of
genteel tradition, stable institutions, aristocratic privilege,
capitalism, industrial revolution and empire. There is the England
of Karl Marx and the England of Queen Victoria, which, of course,
overlapped. Buruma's meditation is prompted by the process of
European unification, which represents the extension of many
British ideals -- stable democratic institutions and free trade --
and yet, also, potentially the end of British uniqueness.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Anglomania is of more than academic interest for
Buruma. His great-grandparents were Continental European Jews who
left behind the closed, anti-Semitic world of Bismarck's Germany
and settled happily in England. Buruma himself grew up in the
Netherlands, but has chosen to reside in England after many years
living in and writing about Asia. Thus for Buruma, the question of
England is also a question of personal identity. His own and his
family's story is artfully woven through the various tales of
Anglomania, making this both a memoir and a work of intellectual
history.
</P>
<P>
   Buruma's history begins with the 18th century and Voltaire, who
left France for England after spending time in the Bastille for his
anticlerical and freethinking views and went on to write his
``Letters Concerning the English Nation,'' which Buruma calls a
``bible of Anglomania.'' For Voltaire, England represented a model
for the rest of Europe -- combining freedom of speech, religious
tolerance, the rational thinking of John Locke and Isaac Newton and
political moderation. The essence of British freedom for Voltaire
was the stock exchange: a ``place more venerable than many courts
of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the
benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Mahometan and the Christian
transact together as tho' they all profess'd the same religion, and
give the name of Infidel to none but bankrupts.'' Yet while
admiring British political institutions, Voltaire regarded British
culture as crude and vulgar, preferring the formal elegance of
Corneille to the raw power of Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the very English qualities that Voltaire rejected were
ones that Goethe and the German writers of the late 18th and early
19th century embraced. The world of Shakespeare's plays was, in
Goethe's words, ``a huge, animated fair,'' and Buruma describes how
Germany adopted Shakespeare as virtually its national poet, the
great Saxon bard unshackled by the Aristotelian rules of classical
theater, writing with extraordinary power about the human
condition. For the Germans, searching for national unity through
language and culture, Shakespeare was, as Buruma puts it, ``the
Nordic genius Germans had been waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the larger themes that emerge in Buruma's book is the
tension between the Voltairean ``universalist'' version of
Anglomania and a ``nativist'' form of Anglomania, which tended to
see England as a kind of fortress island, set apart from the
Continent, a holdout of Celtic and Saxon culture, a place where
people drive on the ``wrong'' side of the road, with customs and
traditions that resist the rationalizing tendencies of Continental
politics.
</P>
<P>
   After the French Revolution, which offered a radical,
egalitarian form of democracy, Britain's appeal shifted. For many
Europeans, England became both the land of liberty and the bastion
of tradition, the one country whose ancien regime consistently
survived the upheavals and revolutions that were rocking the
monarchies of Europe. Perhaps the strongest single chapter of
``Anglomania'' is ``Graveyard of the Revolution,'' which describes
the lives and attitudes of the many political exiles who settled in
England during the 19th century: the Italians Giuseppe Mazzini and
Giuseppe Garibaldi, Germany's Karl Marx, the Hungarian Lajos
Kossuth and the Russian Aleksandr Herzen. Ironically, even as
London crawled with communists, anarchists and utopian socialists,
England remained impervious to revolution. Buruma writes: ``All
radicals in exile wondered why this should be: how had Britain
managed to achieve its peculiar equilibrium, based on a combination
of social stability and inequality, of freedom and dull conformity,
tolerance and provincial smugness, civility and greed? . . . In
Britain, as Marx concluded, even the workers were bourgeois.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's respect for tradition guaranteed liberty (for
bomb-throwing anarchists as well as for ordinary citizens) but also
blunted the force of revolutionary theories. The country's
voracious capitalism kept England open to new ideas but made it shy
away from ones that would disrupt the economic order. Gradually,
thinkers began to perceive a clear link, rather than a
contradiction, between British freedom and stability. As Herzen,
perhaps Buruma's favorite exile, observed, ``The only countries in
Europe that are tranquil are those in which personal liberty and
freedom of speech are the least restricted.''
</P>
<P>
   The book does not strive to be comprehensive. In a pleasantly
unsystematic fashion, Buruma follows his own interests through
various odd manifestations of Anglomania. There is a chapter on the
German landscape designer Prince Hermann von Pckler-Muskau, who
attempted to transplant the English garden to Germany; a chapter on
Nikolaus Pevsner, the German Jewish art historian who composed the
monumental 50-volume catalogue of English architecture, ``The
Buildings of England,'' and tried to define ``the Englishness of
English Art.'' There is a curious chapter about the Baron de
Coubertin, a Frenchman who invented the modern Olympic games as a
way of trying to universalize the muscular Christianity and
gentlemanly spirit that he perceived in English public schools.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the chapter entitled ``The Anglomane Who Hated
England,'' Buruma discusses Kaiser Wilhelm's love-hate relationship
with Britain, which led him to want to emulate, surpass and
eventually destroy it. After Germany's defeat in World War I and
the Kaiser's abdication, England and ``the world Jewish
conspiracy'' became synonymous in the former monarch's mind,
anticipating and contributing to the culture of Hitler's Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, all these reflections about Europe's conflicting
ideas of England have considerable personal meaning for Buruma. His
own German Jewish ancestors loved Wagner and German culture but
were fiercely patriotic British citizens who volunteered for every
war. They played down but did not deny their Jewishness: in
conversation, his grandparents preferred to use code words rather
than pronounce the word ``Jewish,'' but they took in and helped
save a dozen German Jewish children during World War II. They
endured Britain's milder forms of snobbish anti-Semitism and were
eternally grateful for the security their adopted country gave them
and others from a far worse fate. They loved their country as only
exiles can.
</P>
<P>
   The preoccupation with Anglomania at a time in which the British
Empire is a distant memory for most people in the world seems
itself to be an anachronistic symptom of British provincialism -- a
contradiction Buruma is aware of. ``Anglomania'' ends with a
chapter on European union. More of a Voltairean universalist than a
Germanic nativist, Buruma is highly critical of the jingoistic
rhetoric in Britain's resistance to integration into the European
Union. He finds many of the calls to preserve British freedoms
decidedly anti-libertarian. He seems to feel that England, in order
to remain true to itself, must become somewhat less itself.
</P>
<P>
   And yet I wonder if Buruma is being unfair about British fears
of integration. He compares the British system of common law and
the Continental system of code-based, written law to the
differences between the English garden, with its wild thickets and
brambles, and the clear, rational perspectives of the French formal
garden. The Continental system lent itself to ambitious attempts to
reorganize society but also left less resistant countries open to
the totalitarian programs of ambitious dictators. No such program
is likely to emanate from Brussels. But is nothing really lost if
shopkeepers from Glasgow to Athens are required to keep the same
hours and the British are forced to drive on the ``right'' side of
the road?

   The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle.

 &UR; SHERLOCK HOLMES'S MAKER
</P>
<P>
   By David Walton
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   NOT long before his death in 1930, at the age of 71, Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle -- a writer from a family of successful artists and
illustrators -- struggled to his desk and drew a sketch, a copy of
which today hangs in London's Sherlock Holmes pub. It shows a
moth-eaten workhorse pulling a baggage cart loaded with crates,
each labeled with an aspect of Doyle's life and work: ``Historical
Novels,'' ``Poems,'' ``Tales,'' ``Psychic Research,'' ``The Great
War,'' ``500 Lectures.'' Heaviest, of course, is the one marked
``Sherlock Holmes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conan Doyle lived long enough to realize that Sherlock Holmes
would, in Watson's phrase, 'eclipse and predominate' the rest of
his work,'' Daniel Stashower writes in ``Teller of Tales,'' his
excellent biography of the man who created Sherlock Holmes -- and
who would like to have been remembered for a great deal more. The
millstone of Doyle's reputation is not any discrepancy between the
Holmes stories and Doyle's other writings, but a more glaring
discrepancy between the cold logic of Holmes and the beguiled
enthusiasms of his creator for what Stashower calls ``fairies,
ghosts and that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most biographers minimize the spiritualist crusade that consumed
the last 10 years of Doyle's life, attributing it to grief over the
death of his son and other close relatives in the war. Stashower,
by contrast, takes that issue, which Doyle considered his life's
great work, as his starting point. He begins in July 1930, with
6,000 people crowding into London's Royal Albert Hall to attend a
lecture by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle -- who has died five days
earlier. Only one chair is empty, the one with the author's name on
it. A medium rises claiming to see him in that chair, in evening
dress, and she carries a message to the waiting ear of Lady Doyle.
Stashower reports the reactions of crowd and reporters -- the
mixture of reverence, incredulity and ridicule that had become
associated in his final years with the writer whom many saw as
``the St. Paul of spiritualism'' and many more as ``a sad and
deluded old man who had squandered his greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Stashower looks back to the University of Edinburgh Medical
School in the late 1870's, the lecture hall of Dr. Joseph Bell,
master of observation and deduction. Bell dips a finger into a foul
liquid and puts his finger into his mouth, and instructs his
students to do the same -- then points out that while he placed his
index finger into the awful brew, it was his middle finger that
found its way to his mouth. He meets a patient he has never seen
before, and correctly states that she has crossed from Burntisland,
walked up Inverleith Row, has a second child in addition to the one
with her, and works in a linoleum factory. In the third row, young
Doyle, not yet 20, listens and takes note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a life which, for variety and romance, could, I
think, hardly be exceeded,'' this most prototypical of Victorians
once wrote, and Stashower shows the truth of that claim in a packed
but unhurried narrative that covers Doyle's medical career; his
expeditions as ship's surgeon to the Arctic and West Africa; his
service in the Boer War (which helped usher in an era of military
reforms); his defenses of George Edalji and Oscar Slater, two men
wrongly imprisoned; his unpopular support of the Irish-born
diplomat Roger Casement, hanged for treason in 1916; his six-volume
history of World War I (which accepted uncritically the
headquarters version of every engagement); his early and growing
belief in spiritualism and the power of mediums. He was, Stashower
writes, ``a man of strong convictions, some of them absurd, all of
them deeply felt.'' He was an accomplished boxer, was one of the
first in Britain to receive a speeding ticket and, if you can
believe, made skiing popular in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the draw remains how Doyle conceived and developed
Sherlock Holmes, a story that Stashower, though he claims to be no
``Sherlockian,'' clearly revels in. (Stashower is the author of two
mysteries, ``The Adventure of the Ectoplasmic Man,'' which brings
together Holmes and Harry Houdini, and ``Elephants in the
Distance,'' based on the stage magician's trick of catching a
bullet with the teeth; he has himself been a performing magician.)
It may not be precisely true that Doyle was ``the man who hated
Sherlock Holmes.'' But it is interesting how persistently he tried
to shake Holmes from his back. At the end of 1891, less than six
months after the Holmes stories started running in The Strand,
Doyle's mother had to talk him out of killing Holmes (she came up
with a better, though temporary, plot solution). In 1893, two
English clergymen he met on vacation in Switzerland suggested he
drop Holmes down a crevasse -- after failing to persuade Doyle he
would be ``rather rough on an old friend'' to end Holmes's career.
At The Strand, which had grown wealthy publishing the Holmes
stories and whose editors had pleaded for the detective's life,
20,000 subscriptions were canceled when Holmes went over the
Reichenbach Falls in the December 1893 issue. In London mourning
bands were seen. Doyle went happily back to work on meticulously
researching historical romances like ``The White Company'' and
``Sir Nigel,'' which he considered his ``high-water mark in
literature'' and which one reviewer hailed as ``the year's best
boy's book.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional challenge awaits any biographer of Arthur Conan
Doyle, in that he is invariably the best teller of his own history,
even the best commentator on his own shortcomings. He would repeat
for the rest of his life an anecdote from his first American
lecture tour, in 1894. A cabby, dropping him off, asked for a
ticket to that night's lecture instead of a fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``How on earth did you recognize me?'' Doyle asked.
</P>
<P>
   The cabman replied: ``If you will excuse me, your coat lapels
are badly twisted downward, where they have been grasped by the
pertinacious New York reporters. Your hair has the Quakerish cut of
a Philadelphia barber, and your hat, battered at the brim in front,
shows where you have tightly grasped it, in the struggle to stand
your ground at a Chicago literary luncheon. Your right shoe has a
large block of Buffalo mud just under the instep; the odor of a
Utica cigar hangs about your clothing. . . . And, of course, the
labels on your case give a full account of your recent travels --
just below the brass plaque reading 'Conan Doyle.' ''

 &UR; LORD OF THE DROSOPHILAE
</P>
<P>
   By Lewis Wolpert
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN he was a teen-ager Seymour Benzer's favorite book was
``Arrowsmith,'' by Sinclair Lewis. This is one of the very few
novels in which a scientist is the hero rather than a villain; in
fact, it portrays a research scientist as both imaginative and
noble. Even then, in his family's basement, which he had turned
into a laboratory, Benzer was looking at flies through a microscope
given to him for his bar mitzvah. It was almost as if he had the
genes for being a scientist; no one else in his family had ever
gone beyond 12th grade. He was to become one of the founders of
molecular biology and one of the world's leading geneticists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time, Love, Memory,'' by Jonathan Weiner, is the story of
Benzer's career, especially his work on genes and behavior, as well
a glimpse at the history of genetics itself and how it became
molecular. It is also a wonderful description of biologists at work
together, with cameos of many of the leaders. Inevitably it is a
little technical in parts.
</P>
<P>
   Benzer has many gifts beyond cleverness. He has that special
imagination and view of the world that makes a great scientist.
Part of that skill is to choose the right problem and not to be put
off by side issues. One of his favorite aphorisms is from the
physicist Richard Feynman, on how to deal with certain difficult
problems: ``We ignore them, temporarily.'' He also likes to work in
the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Benzer began as a physicist, but then a friend gave him a copy
of ``What Is Life?,'' by the famous physicist Erwin SchrRated
PG-13dinger. This led him to take a course in the genetics of
viruses that infect bacteria and he was instantly converted to
biology, specifically to genetics.
</P>
<P>
   The modern theory of the gene comes from Thomas Hunt Morgan's
study of the fruit fly Drosophila a hundred years ago. Most fruit
flies have red eyes but occasionally some appear with white ones.
Morgan identified the gene that caused the fly's eye to become
white as being on a particular chromosome -- and so began what
would very much later become the Human Genome Project, the
molecular characterization of all our genes and where they are.
Shortly after Benzer entered biology, James D. Watson and Francis
Crick discovered the double helix of DNA, and what was needed was
to connect their studies with the classical maps of the genes
started by Morgan. That Benzer did brilliantly, focusing in great
detail on a single region of virus DNA; he discovered the fine
structure of the gene and how it could change by mutations. He
discovered mistakes in a gene -- deletions and insertions, rather
like the typos we all come across.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 Benzer began thinking and reading about the inheritance
of behavior. Genes were to be his foundation stones. He spent some
time in the laboratory of Roger Sperry, famous for his work on the
split brain and for discovering how neurons find their way from the
eye to the right location in the brain during its development. To
study the kind of animal instincts that most biologists investigate
in the wild, Benzer gathered fruit flies. When he put flies in a
test tube and aimed one end at a light he found that some raced
toward it but others did not. Was there a genetic basis for the
difference in their behavior? Following in the footsteps of his
colleague Edward Lewis, whose work on the genetics of fly
development earned him a Nobel Prize, Benzer created fly mutants by
treating them with chemical agents and then studied their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He established a fly lab to which many students came. They, like
Benzer, were adventurous and, like Arrowsmith, contemptuous of a
careerist path in science. They made tremendous progress and
ignored criticism that flies could tell nothing about animal, let
alone human, behavior. It was from this work that a gene
controlling the flies' sense of time was discovered. Flies have a
daily rhythm. But Benzer and his students found flies that woke up
late and others that were insomniacs. They had discovered a clock
gene. This same gene also turned out to control the rhythm of their
love songs. By isolating and cloning the DNA of the gene they could
inject it into another fly species and so convert its song to that
of the flies from which they had obtained the DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Then they discovered a gene that they called ``fruitless.'' Its
mutant form caused male flies to ignore females and form long
chains of similar males winding around their test tube hour after
hour. They found that flies could learn to avoid an electric shock
and located genes that improved a fly's memory. All this required
devotion, hard work, imagination, great technical skills and
patience. But these alone do not lead to success; after all, the
physicist and biologist Max Delbrck, a Nobel laureate, spent years
trying to understand how a fungus tilts toward the light but made
little progress. The fly has many virtues.
</P>
<P>
   There was then, and there still is, some hostility to the idea
that genes control our behavior. Such views fluctuate in bizarre
ways: there was opposition in the 1970's to intelligence being
controlled by genes, but now, with the advent of cloning, many
proclaim that a cloned individual will be identical in every
respect to the original person. This is a total reversal of opinion
rarely commented on. Flies seemed remote, so Benzer's lab was
largely protected from controversy; he did not get the opprobrium
poured -- in one case physically -- on E. O. Wilson when he
published ``Sociobiology.'' Whether or not there are genes that
predispose one to certain behaviors -- being gay, for instance --
is neither good nor bad. Reliable science is value free. Ethical
issues only arise when theory is applied in a way that affects
someone's life.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, after Benzer's 77th birthday, his lab discovered a fly
that lives much longer than usual and called it methuselah. It
seems a fitting present for a scientist who still works late into
the night and loves the smell of fly food. Of course, there is
still a long way to go in understanding how genes control our lives
but his contribution is enormous. And one should remember that
evolution is rather lazy; once it finds clever ways to make animals
function it uses them again and again. We are similar to flies in
many ways, and understanding their behavior will help us understand
our own. ``Time, Love, Memory'' is a lovely book about a lovely
scientist.

 A DANGEROUS FRIEND

 &UR; THE QUIET AMERICAN
</P>
<P>
   BY JAMES MCMANUS
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Why were we in Vietnam? Dwight Eisenhower argued that unless we
provided aid and military advisers to Saigon, one country after
another would topple like dominoes before the Communist juggernaut.
By assembling the best and brightest minds to bolster the South
Vietnamese, John Kennedy hoped to demonstrate the resolve of the
United States to stick by its allies. Lyndon Johnson escalated our
military presence, insisting it was necessary to offset support
from the North. And Richard Nixon eventually brought our troops
home, bombing Hanoi to gain leverage while negotiating to achieve
``peace with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The assessments of artists and writers have tended to be
different from those of the politicians. And so, in Ward Just's
12th novel, Americans go to Vietnam for a host of paradoxical
reasons. Set in 1965, ``A Dangerous Friend'' focuses on the
civilians who volunteered to administer aid programs, distribute
medicine, build schools and hospitals -- to take Vietnam, as one of
them puts it, ``from the Middle Ages to the 20th century in five
years.'' Among them is Sydney Parade, who wants to participate in
the history of his time, or at least be ``someone who could be said
to have done more good than harm.'' But to do so he has to abandon
his wife, Karla, who equates the American effort in Southeast Asia
with Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia, her parents' homeland.
Since Karla also believes that ``anyone who had anything to do with
this war in any capacity was as guilty as if he had put the barrel
of a gun in a child's face and pulled the trigger,'' their marriage
essentially ends on the day Sydney accepts his new assignment.
</P>
<P>
   As his central character retraces the route his Western
predecessors took, stopping in Paris on the way to Saigon, Just
begins to establish a convincing allegorical dimension to the
novel. We learned from the French, he seems to suggest -- and, then
again, we didn't. To young political scientists like Sydney, the
success of the Vietcong defies military and political logic: ``We
had so much and they had so little; our 19-year-olds were supported
by an arsenal beyond the imagination of the guerrillas facing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney and his colleagues at the Llewellyn Group (``a benevolent
arm of the Government wholly separate from the Pentagon'') believe
in ``the perfectibility of societies, even primitive societies with
scant experience of democratic government.'' Yet some of the
group's senior members approach their work with deep cynicism.
Worse, their director, Dicky Rostok, wants information on the enemy
for reasons that seem personal as well as strategic. More than
money or weaponry, information is power, and Rostok intends to
acquire it by any means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Just's unnamed narrator insists that in describing Sydney
Parade's experiences he is not telling a war story, and indeed ``A
Dangerous Friend'' contains little violence. Menace is conveyed
through glimpses of Vietcong guerrillas moving at night on black
bicycles, of an American officer alone in a Vietnamese village, of
blood on the sleeve of a suit. Battle scenes are described
obliquely through rumors and field reports discussed around
conference tables, their effects hinted at on slips of paper passed
anonymously in exclusive Saigon restaurants. Just has a veteran war
reporter's eye for the telling detail -- light from phosphorus
flares ``so fierce you could see it with closed eyelids'' -- and a
reporter's skepticism about his Government's stated objectives.
Though his prose occasionally betrays a reporter's fact-laden
unwieldiness and a weakness for cliches, he succeeds in evoking the
dense, tactile weave of life in country circa 1965. When the
narrator salutes Joseph Conrad and Graham Greene as models, the
connection does not seem farfetched.
</P>
<P>
   THE plot turns on the fate of a captured American captain who is
also the nephew of a Congressman. The captain was last seen in the
Xuan Loc sector near Plantation Louvet, which is managed by a
Frenchman named Claude Armand and his American-born wife, Dede. The
Armands are living a premodern idyll in an ``ambiance reminiscent
of Winnetka, if Winnetka were tropical.'' They have little sympathy
for the Americans and want desperately to remain neutral, but the
Llewellyn Group has other plans. Having spent weeks failing to
locate the plantation, Sydney finally manages to meet Dede Armand
under circumstances of such gruesome serendipity that readers may
find this key passage difficult to swallow. Yet once Sydney gains
the Armands' wary cooperation, the novel becomes a kind of Faustian
negotiation in which a sincere but provisional friendship leads to
shattering acts of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   As in his previous novels (the National Book Award finalist
``Echo House'' foremost among them), Just imposes a severe
metaphorical order on the world, and on Americans' increasingly
critical place in it. In ``A Dangerous Friend,'' the intricate
network of imagery allows the reader to see the tragedy of Vietnam
in ways that throw into high relief the conflicted array of
Vietnamese, French and American interests. The most graphic
metaphors include a torture victim and the stillborn Vietnamese
children of French and American parents. More subtle is the Panama
hat that comes to represent not only the country's climate but the
customs and dreams of the Vietnamese, as filtered through the lives
of a Vietnamese woman and her American husband, a member of the
Llewellyn Group who, in the view of his colleagues, ``had lived in
Vietnam for too long and had lost perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Dangerous Friend'' persuasively suggests that Americans like
Sydney Parade were in Vietnam for reasons both misguided and
honorable. As the novel's plot proceeds, Sydney can only watch
helplessly as his efforts to do ``more good than harm'' spin out of
his control. He fails not only because of his adversaries' tenacity
but because he has been trying to foster American values in a
country so different from his own. As Just's narrator remarks, with
no little irony, Sydney was ``searching in a dark room for a black
hat that wasn't there.''

 &UR; NOTHIN' LEFT TO LOSE
</P>
<P>
   BY KIM FRANCE
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   FROM the time she was a teen-ager until the accidental heroin
overdose that killed her in 1970 at the age of 27, Janis Joplin
delighted in flouting expectations of conventional female behavior.
As a high-school girl in Port Arthur, Tex., she routinely sneaked
over the Louisiana border with a group of male friends to drink and
dance in divey blues bars. During her brief tenure as a student at
the University of Texas, she differed so much from the rest of the
student body that the mere fact of her was enough to merit a
profile in the student newspaper. (``She Dares to Be Different!''
read the headline. ``She goes barefooted when she feels like it,
wears Levi's to class because they're more comfortable and carries
her Autoharp with her everywhere she goes so that in case she gets
the urge to break out into song it will be handy.'')
</P>
<P>
   Once she became famous, Joplin cursed like a truck driver, did
not believe in wearing undergarments, was rarely seen without her
bottle of Southern Comfort and delighted in playing the role of
sexual predator. On stage, as Alice Echols writes in ``Scars of
Sweet Paradise,'' she stood in sharp contrast to folksy peers like
Joan Baez and Judy Collins. By all accounts, Joplin behaved as no
white woman had ever before behaved on stage -- a sexed-up
powerhouse who stalked the stage as if she owned it, reducing male
rock critics to comically blubbering buffoons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sexual barrier Joplin remains most remembered for
breaking is that of rock-and-roll crash-and-burn: it was she who
proved that a female rocker could self-destruct as quickly and
decisively as any man. The more prurient details of Joplin's life
have already attracted a number of biographers, and in her
introduction, Echols, the author of ``Daring to Be Bad,'' a history
of radical feminism, lays claim to a more high-minded goal. ``Scars
of Sweet Paradise'' is not another steamy romp, but an attempt to
use Joplin's life to examine the 1960's -- an era, she writes, that
remains ``mired in myth, reduced to a set of cliches that seem to
function as a defense against true remembering.'' To this end,
Echols employs the details of Joplin's life as a sort of outline
with which to examine a number of larger phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   Janis Lyn Joplin was born in 1943 in Port Arthur, the kind of
Texas town that regards its xenophobia as an advantage. By
adolescence she was an ungainly girl with a bad case of acne. She
fell so short of the local ideal of the button-nosed cheerleader
that she seems to have defined herself in opposition to it. After
reading an article about beatniks in Time, she started dressing in
lots of black and became, Echols writes, ``a beatnik girl -- the
only one in all of Port Arthur.'' At school, she was considered
unladylike and opinionated, and received the reputation -- possibly
unearned -- of class slut. Echols does an interesting job of
reconstructing Joplin's quest to find like-minded friends, first in
Port Arthur and later in Austin, New York, San Francisco and Los
Angeles. One gets a sense of what a struggle it was, in the early
60's, to deviate from ``straight'' culture.
</P>
<P>
   As Echols follows Joplin's story, she gives corresponding
cultural background. Joplin's time in Austin, during which she
frequented the seminal blues bar Threadgill's and participated in
hootenannies, provides Echols with an opportunity to cover the rise
in popularity of American folk music; Joplin's early years in San
Francisco are used to explore Haight-Ashbury; the chapter on Joplin
and her band's career-making performance at the Monterey
International Pop Festival in 1967 delves into the growing business
of rock-and-roll. And so on. But while Echols casts an admirably
cold eye on places and events that have become hopelessly and
mistakenly romanticized, these digressions feel jumpy and never
fully integrate themselves into the book. Furthermore, the music
industry of the 60's is not a topic that wants for coverage. Echols
treads into territory covered far more definitively by books like
``The Mansion on the Hill'' (1997), by Fred Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Echols conducted more than 150 interviews for the book, in many
cases talking to friends and associates who were at first reluctant
to tell the story again. No doubt Echols won them over by stressing
the book's sociological focus. But it is this very aspect that
limits ``Scars of Sweet Paradise.'' Well researched though it might
be, the book has about it the air of a topic handled one too many
times; the quotations feel picked over, and Joplin's life never
leaps off the page. In addition, Echols has a maddening habit of
using quotations when a simple paraphrase will do. For instance:
``Austin with its lush rolling hills 'seemed like Nirvana,' a
'little center of enlightenment' amid the 'vast primitive wasteland
of Texas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Joplin's life was simply too sloppy and unwieldy for
such a methodically conceived project. Deeply convinced of her own
unattractiveness, frequently lonely and unimaginably needy, Joplin
was a person who lived all over the page. It is impossible to read
about her and not crave more anecdotes and personal details of such
a wanton, tragic life.

CITY REMAINS IN SHADOW OF '89 SCHOOL SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC DRUDIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ When Stockton dedicated its Children's Museum
to the victims of a 1989 schoolyard massacre, speaker after speaker
repeated the same hope: ``This will be the last school shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   But 10 years and several campus killings later, Stockton has
instead become a study in survivors and a community that cannot put
the deaths of five children in the past. The reminders are
everywhere, especially in the headlines and newscasts following
shootings like the one last week in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, 1989, a 26-year-old man dressed in army fatigues
sprayed 107 rounds of ammunition from an AK-47 over the playground
at Stockton's Cleveland Elementary School, killing five and
wounding 29. The man, Patrick Purdy, had once been a student there.
He killed himself before police officers could arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Stockton successfully transformed the
community's anger and grief into improvements in school security
and a museum dedicated to the joy of children. Administrators and
faculty members spoke out against school violence, lobbying
politicians _ including the Senate regarding the Brady Bill _ for
stringent gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Busher, the school principal then and now, spoke at
length last year with members of the National Education Association
after a school shooting in Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communities that weather a tragedy need to know there's a
light at the end of the tunnel,'' Busher said. ``One of the ways to
make sense of it is to make good out of evil, and that's what we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Busher returned from Sacramento, where she met with
Gov. Gray Davis and lobbied the California Legislature for a ban on
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Security has been a top concern as well. The district has since
pieced together an extensive safety and communications network at
its 43 schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took many years to heal, but each year we continue to
recognize what happened,'' said Deputy Superintendent George
Ridler. ``Since 1989, the emphasis has been on safety. It is our
top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools have intercoms in each classroom. Visitors are required
to check in at the office to get an identification card.
</P>
<P>
   There are mandatory monthly emergency drills to prepare for
fires, earthquakes, campus trespassers or other scenarios. Police
officers are assigned to each of the district's middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cleveland second-grade teacher Janet Geng, who was shot
during the 1989 attack, said Littleton could learn lessons in
healing from Stockton. She found solace in completing the Stockton
Children's Museum, now one of the largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want children to smile again,'' Geng said. ``Their faces
were of anguish, and people tried to think of things that made them
smile again. This is what comes out of the hurt and the death.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is not a memorial to the shootings, but a ``living
place that ensures laughter still can come from children,'' Geng
said. ``Their innocence was lost that day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Museum symbolizes how the community came together
after the shooting, Geng said. Businesses donated thousands of
dollars to help, and the city rented a building _ at the nominal
cost of $1 per year _ to house the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't just be a fleeting moment; it can't be just hugs and
then forgetting about it,`` Geng said. ``We thought Cleveland would
accomplish something, and hopefully, something will finally come
out of this. We need to have more people talking about it. A
tragedy like this needs a purpose.''

TEAM PONTIAC ON THE MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jaw set and eyes flashing, John Andretti strode through the
Talladega Superspeedway garage last Sunday until he got to where
Tony Stewart had just parked his Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped and glared at Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it say on the front of this car?'' Andretti asked
angrily.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart just looked at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better remember that,'' Andretti said as he stalked off,
referring to the block letters across the car's nose that spelled
out Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti was upset because late in Talladega's DieHard 500,
after running a solid second to eventual winner Dale Earnhardt, he
fell back to ninth when Stewart got in line behind some Fords to
sweep into fifth place, leaving Andretti alone on the bottom of the
track.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Andretti's frustration was an indication of how far
``Team Pontiac,'' as some like to call it, has come in just a year.
</P>
<P>
   While Andretti might have argued the ``team'' concept with you
in Alabama on Sunday, no one can argue that while Chevy and Ford
continue to command the spotlight, Pontiac may be quietly stealing
the show.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, Pontiac made a huge leap forward in the early part
of the season when compared with 1998, and Andretti and Stewart are
two big reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   In the race before Talladega, at Martinsville, Va., Andretti
came from a lap down to win, taking the lead for good just three
laps from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven races, Pontiacs have won once and finished in
the top 12 a whopping 24 times. That's only one less than GM rival
Chevy, which has 25 top 12s, and three times as many as Pontiac had
in the same seven races a year ago, when it recorded just eight
top-12 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has put 35 cars in the top 12 during this time, but
Pontiac's improvement is especially noteworthy when you consider
that in any given race, Ford will regularly field around 20 cars
and Chevy about 15 while Pontiac maybe has eight.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, Andretti and Stewart and their two teams have
pumped new life into Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, who drives for Richard Petty, has one win and four top
10s so far, which compares with no wins and 10 top 10s last season.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Kyle Petty, who had two top 10s during all of 1998,
already has three this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a rookie, has joined Joe Gibbs, who has the top Pontiac
on the circuit with Bobby Labonte in it.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte is on a pace similar to last year, when he had two wins
and 18 top 10s. So far, he hasn't won, but he has six top 10s.
</P>
<P>
   And Stewart has already recorded three top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning on his car, Stewart defended his moves late in Sunday's
race, when he left Andretti to fend for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many guys getting a run that I just wanted to
put myself in the best position I could,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that can change in five seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while near the end, Stewart and Labonte ran together, but
Stewart said the two teammates hadn't made a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just going to go with whatever scenario was best for
each of us,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Andretti's upset. He just asked what kind of car I
drive,'' Stewart added.
</P>
<P>
   But if Andretti, who quickly left the garage area, was
frustrated, Robbie Loomis, general manager of the two-car Petty
team and Andretti's crew chief, took it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't complain,'' Loomis said Sunday. ``It's like I told
John, we had our week last week, and you can't have it your way
every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony did what he thought he had to do to get the best finish
he could. I think John would have done the same thing,'' Loomis
commented.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a big change for Pontiac. Last year, with the
exception of Labonte, they were struggling just to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's going to get very hot when you're racing for 25th.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, they've got some cars that can actually compete,
and now they argue about why they didn't win.

 &HT;    STUDY SAYS GOP PLAN WOULD ERASE SOCIAL SECURITY'S FINANCIAL WOES
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Social Security Administration said Thursday a
House Republican proposal to create individual investment accounts
would eventually eliminate the program's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis by Stephen C. Ross, Social Security's deputy chief
actuary, also said that under the GOP plan, the 12.4 percent
payroll tax that finances the program could be reduced by 2.5
percentage points in 2050 and another percentage point in 2060.
</P>
<P>
   It predicted that the investment accounts would produce a 5.3
percent rate of return, compared to the roughly 2 percent rate
Social Security now receives on special Treasury bonds. The
Archer-Shaw plan would allow Social Security to remain solvent for
at least the 75-year period used to judge the program's financial
health, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis is ``really good news,'' said House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is the chief architect
of the proposal along with Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., chairman
of the Social Security subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the actuaries gave us a Good Housekeeping seal of
approval,'' Archer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer-Shaw plan would use about $874 billion in projected
federal surpluses over the next 10 years to finance a 2 percent tax
credit for workers. The credit would be invested in privately
selected, government-approved mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The investments would be transferred to the federal government
for distribution when a worker retired. Monthly annuity payments
would be made from the investment account. Retirees would receive
either the Social Security benefit set by law or the monthly
annuity, whichever was higher.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said that despite cautionary comments by GOP leaders in
the House and Senate, he is encouraged about prospects for
congressional action on Social Security reform after speaking this
week with President Clinton and Democratic committee members.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Congress ``will take
a close look at this proposal,'' but warned that it would not pass
without bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, responding to criticism from some Democrats that the
proposal was unworkable and irresponsible, said that ``doing
nothing would end Social Security, and it would put millions of
Americans in poverty. We can't afford to do that. Doing nothing is
irresponsible and unworkable, and anybody in this Congress who
chooses to do nothing shouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Without reform, the program is expected to run out of reserves
by 2034. Clinton's reform plan is to reduce the publicly held
federal debt and credit that reduction to Social Security, which
would extend its ability to pay full benefits until 2055.

   KOSOVO-YUGO-ARMY (Washington) _ By triggering a ``rally around

 &HT;    KOSOVAR ALBANIANS DISGUISED AS SERB MILITARY MAY BE HUMAN
SHIELDS
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0430.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Ethnic Albanian men detained in Kosovo are
being dressed in Serbian Yugoslav military uniforms for work
details and propaganda campaigns, making them candidates for use as
human shields against NATO bombing, refugees crossing into Albania
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It the same time, humanitarian aid workers questioned whether
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) here is manipulating the refugees
for its own purposes, pressing them to stay in this crowded border
area to serve as a source of recruits and possibly even as human
shields against Serbian shelling that has targeted KLA guerrilla
operations in northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the latest stream of refugees from the city of Prizren,
about 15 miles north of the Albanian border, said they left because
Serb forces came to their homes Wednesday night and threatened to
draft the men of their families into the army. The prospect that
these men would be armed and put in fighting units is marginal,
since Kosovar Albanians are enemies fighting for independence from
Serb-controlled Yugoslavia and now are targets of a fierce ethnic
cleansing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks Serb police in Prizren increasingly have
grabbed ethnic Albanian men from their homes, the refugees said,
taking some for manual labor and putting others in anti-NATO
television propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I saw (Kosovar) Albanians digging trenches. There were
two on one side of the road and two more on the other,'' said
Milaim Kryeziu, 28. ``I know them. They were arrested 10 days
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the four young men from Prizren were wearing Yugoslav
army uniforms when he saw them at a town just north of the Albanian
border. Kryeziu was fleeing Kosovo with his family when he passed
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are making them wear uniforms so NATO will think
they are Serb soldiers and will bomb them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees said men taken into custody have appeared on
local Serbian television in Prizren. Some were shown in army
uniforms, saying they had volunteered for service. Others were
placed prominently at televised anti-NATO and anti-American
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   On this side of the border, questions also arose whether KLA
guerrilla fighters are manipulating the Kosovar Albanian refugees
in their own protection plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rumors that the KLA doesn't want the people to move
from here,'' said Staffan DeMistura, a special envoy here for the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). ``They want
to be defended and they want more recruits for their ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMistura, who has been tasked with dispersing the more than
100,000 refugees clogging this northern border region, raised the
issue while meeting with refugee leaders whom he had taken to view
alternative living sites earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials had hoped the leadership group would report
favorably and recommend that the resistant refugees agree to leave
this area, which is considered dangerously close to military action
and also is bending to physical and social strains.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the eight refugees at the meeting Thursday responded
to DeMistura, and he said he hadn't heard such rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, have said in interviews that the popular and
respected KLA has made it clear it has a stake in keeping the
refugees up here.
</P>
<P>
   They did not suggest the refugees are viewed as protection
against Serb assaults on KLA bases that litter the area --
including a large barracks located in the center of this city close
to refugee camps. But they did say the refugees are an important
pool for new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for us young men, when there is a general (KLA)
mobilization, we have to join them. That's why not only I but
others want to stay here closer to the border,'' said Reza Abozaj,
24, one of the refugee leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He said that KLA fighters he has talked with have urged him to
resist the plan to disperse refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Two others of the leaders also cited discussions with KLA
members as influencing their decisions not to recommend that the
refugees depart for new locations.
</P>
<P>
   All eight refugees at the Thursday meeting told DeMistura that
they have not been convinced the people living in their tent camps
should pick up their meager possessions and large families and head
out to the selected site of Peshkopi, about an eight-hour drive
south.
</P>
<P>
   Of the original group of 10, the only two members who expressed
positive views of relocating to Peshkopi both were absent from the
meeting. One was described as having left the camps, and the other
was said to be helping sick relatives.

UPSTART BANDS SING PRAISES OF NEW INTERNET MUSIC FORMAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GLENN RUBENSTEIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ From garage trios to headlining divas,
modern-day musicians have jumped onto the cyberspace bandwagon en
masse, using the popular digital compression format ``MP3'' to
record and market their music to a global audience via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, bands have been capitalizing on the
technology. And not far behind are mainstream artists who are
attracted to the grass-roots method of disseminating their work as
well as the low overhead and high royalties available on-line.
</P>
<P>
   It was announced Tuesday that Alanis Morissette, the
multiplatinum Grammy award winner, would embark on a
five-and-a-half-week tour across the United States this August,
sponsored by the retail chain Best Buy and by an emerging
powerhouse in the Internet music world: MP3.com, a San Diego-based
Web site/music label that began offering free MP3 files for
download by a variety of unknown acts in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential here is enormous. We've got to seize the
opportunity,'' said Michael Robertson, chairman, chief executive
and founder of MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   The recent success has not gone unnoticed by the increasingly
worried music establishment.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the Recording Industry Association of
America has targeted the popular audio compression format MP3,
claiming the technology helps listeners pirate music, thus
depriving bands of the money they would make from album sales.
</P>
<P>
   Legal action has been brought against San Jose-based Diamond
Multimedia, manufacturer of the portable MP3 player The Rio, and
countless Internet Web sites that host MP3 files for download.
</P>
<P>
   Short for MPEG 1-Audio Layer 3, MP3 is a compression scheme that
allows CD-quality music to be compressed to a size small enough to
download on even the slowest modems while retaining superior sound
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of MP3 files can fit on one hard drive. With the use of
MP3 player software, they can easily be cued up, played in order or
shuffled through _ turning even mid-level PCs into a high tech
jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   The format has gained enormous popularity on the Internet due to
its small size and high availability. It also has drawn both fans
and critics because of the number of illegal MP3 files that are out
there (illegal meaning that they are pirated MP3s compressed from
popular artists' CDs).
</P>
<P>
   While the casual music listener might not even know what MP3 is
yet, some bands in the San Francisco area, for example, are using
the format as a powerful marketing tool by creating MP3 files that
can be heard by a potential Internet audience of millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to promote yourself,'' said Brett Holt, drummer and
manager for the San Jose-based punk band Boy Kicks Girl, ``and MP3
files are an excellent way to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-piece group, which has played more than 100 shows
since 1997, is one of the many bands on MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Since the site was launched in 1998, it has become a virtual
clearinghouse for bands looking to work outside the music industry
and use the Internet. It boasts more than 21 million song downloads
since the site began and more than 200,000 visitors a day. (It also
recently announced $11 million in funding from the New York venture
capital firm Silicon Alley).
</P>
<P>
   ``''Your mission is to reach as many potential fans as possible.
Once you have them, you have got to let them know what you're up
to,'' Holt said, citing the band's Web site at www.bkg.com and its
e-mail list, which he speculates has more than 1,200 names.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is our best resource. It gives us the ability to
extend our reach beyond the Bay area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering space for downloadable MP3 files,
MP3.com recently began offering bands the ability to sell CDs
on-line. Bands sign up for the program at no cost, select which
songs they want on their CD, and within 24 hours, it is available
for sale on the site.
</P>
<P>
   When a visitor clicks to buy the CD for a price set by the
artist _ $4.99 to $9.99 _ MP3.com decodes the MP3 files, burns them
to a disc, adds a label and mails the package to the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com gets 50 percent of the deal. The other 50 percent goes
straight to the artist, as opposed to most major or independent
label deals, where artists are lucky to take home 10 percent from
their CD sales.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's not always a consumer stampede. Since the
program began, Boy Kicks Girl speculates it has sold about 30 discs
on-line, in contrast to the 100 a month it sells at live shows.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 bands have songs on MP3.com, which says that it
is adding more every day.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, some artists have expressed frustration over the
sheer number of MP3 files on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's probably a lot of great music on MP3.com that
no one has the time to find,'' said Owen Otto, guitar player for
Little Tin Frog, a Petaluma, Calif.-based alternative rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beautiful thing about the Internet in general is that it
allows anyone the opportunity to publish their work for anyone else
in the world to experience,'' Otto said. ``The problem is that
there's tons of stuff out there that is total garbage, so it's a
lot more work to sort through.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO, which hopes to get permission from
Bulgaria to use its airspace for bombing attacks against
Yugoslavia, expressed regrets Thursday that an air-to-ground
missile had gone through the roof of a house Wednesday night on the
outskirts of Bulgaria's capital, Sofia.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time an allied missile had strayed into
Bulgaria, according to allied officers. None of the errant
missiles, including the latest, has killed anybody.
</P>
<P>
   The latest missile was fired by an allied plane Wednesday night
after a Yugoslav anti-aircraft missile radar system locked onto the
jet. The missile kept flying 40 miles east after the radar was
turned off and landed without exploding on a two-story house in the
suburb of Gorna Banya, an allied spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov visited the area to inspect
the damage and kept his representative in Brussels on the telephone
to the alliance most of Wednesday night to find out what had
happened, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes also carried out the heaviest attacks of the
war Wednesday and Thursday on Montenegro, a part of Yugoslavia
whose elected government is opposed to President Slobodan Milosevic
and his war against the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo.
Montenegro's population of 600,000 includes a sizable minority of
Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said NATO had had ``no choice'' but to
attack Yugoslav military planes that were using the airport at
Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, and posed a threat to allied
soldiers based not far away in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The AGM-88 Harm missile that landed on a house near Sofia is
fitted on a variety of allied planes from various countries, seeks
out radar signals after being launched but is essentially unguided
if it cannot find any. The warhead automatically disables itself
when the missile nears the end of its range, up to 50 miles, allied
officers said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In operations yesterday, a NATO aircraft was illuminated by a
Serbian surface-to-air missile radar and fired a missile,'' Shea
said. ``After the radar was turned off, the missile strayed and
landed in Bulgaria.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thankfully, there were no casualties,'' he said. ``We regret
any damage.'' He added that the alliance would try to clarify what
happened and to minimize the chances of its happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria is also a leading applicant for membership in the
alliance. But there is powerful opposition in the Bulgarian
Parliament, which is expected to vote soon on whether to give
permission to NATO to fly over Bulgaria in the course of air
operations against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Bulgaria on Thursday said the Bulgarian army had
detected an unidentified plane in violation of the country's
airspace about 30 miles north of Sofia shortly before the missile
landed Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second mistake the allies have had to acknowledge
this week. Wednesday, the allied command acknowledged that at least
one laser-guided bomb had missed its intended target and gone off
in a neighborhood of civilian houses in southern Serbia on Tuesday
afternoon. Serbian officials said at least 20 people had been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Serbian military targets in Kosovo and beyond
continued into a 37th day Thursday, command spokesmen said, after
pounding the airfield at Podgorica overnight with almost 30
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The allies had previously avoided striking targets in
Montenegro, except for Yugoslav anti-aircraft defenses there,
because its government under President Milo Djukanovic has
distanced itself from Yugoslavia's war against the ethnic Albanian
civilian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we would have preferred not to have attacked sites in
Montenegro, Podgorica airfield is becoming an important operating
location for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia air force,'' said
Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani, the allied military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aircraft driven from their main bases by NATO attacks are
using the airfield as a dispersal base,'' he said. Only a few dozen
miles away from the nearly 10,000 allied troops in Albania,
aircraft based at Podgorica could also pose a significant threat to
those soldiers, Marani said. ``Thus we see our attack as prudent
self-defense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were precision surgical strikes that were highly
sensitive to avoiding damage to civilian infrastructure such as the
runway and the civilian terminal,'' he said. The strikes were aimed
at military hangars, fuel tanks, air defense radars and
single-engine Yugoslav-made Super Galeb aircraft parked on runway
aprons or in protected shelters, Marani said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said some military planes had been destroyed in the
attacks. Serbian news media had reported bombing Wednesday night
near the main Montenegrin port, Bar, but Marani said allied planes
had not made any attacks on port sites. NATO's top military
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said earlier this week that oil
deliveries by ship were being made around the clock at Bar.
</P>
<P>
   The allied military authorities are working on a plan to let
NATO naval ships inspect vessels headed for Bar and possibly divert
them if they were carrying oil, but alliance ambassadors would have
to approve the plan first. France, among other allies, has
reservations about the legality of an oil blockade without a U.N.
Security Council resolution authorizing one.

RUSSIAN PEACE INITIATIVE FOR KOSOVO MAKES LITTLE PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A Russian-led peace initiative for Kosovo appeared to
make little headway Thursday, with Moscow and the West divided over
the composition of any international force in Kosovo and the
Yugoslav government in defiant mood.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's Balkan envoy, held talks in Bonn
with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and declared afterward,
``There's progress, but no breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the progress was hard to discern. Schroeder reiterated
NATO's position that any international force in Kosovo in the event
of a settlement would have to have NATO at its core, but
Chernomyrdin said Russia favored a force under a U.N. mandate that
would consist substantially of Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of any international force in Kosovo has been highly
sensitive ever since peace negotiations on Kosovo intensified
earlier this year. Serbia has a visceral objection to the notion of
NATO troops on its most sacred soil, and its rejection of such a
deployment was a prime reason why peace talks failed and NATO's
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Thursday that, even after a five-week NATO
bombardment, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's position had
not shifted. His brother, Borislav Milosevic, who is Yugoslavia's
ambassador to Moscow, said that only ``a civilian mission under a
United Nations flag'' and ``a big role for Russia'' would be
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Vojislav Seselj, an influential nationalist leader in Serbia,
also said that only a civilian force would be acceptable in Kosovo
_ a demand that NATO is certain to reject. It was Serbia's refusal
to allow Austro-Hungarian police onto its soil in 1914 to
investigate the murder of the Habsburg crown prince that
precipitated World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Brussels, Belgium, after visits this week to Moscow
and Berlin, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said he had
explained to the Russians that NATO had to be central to any
international force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Of the force, he said, ``That means NATO _ it does not mean just
NATO _ but it certainly means NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   It therefore appears that Chernomyrdin will face great
difficulties in his planned visit to Belgrade later this week. In
essence, he will have to persuade Milosevic not only to begin
withdrawing the estimated 40,000 troops he has in Kosovo, but also
to accept that they will be replaced in part by the very forces
that have been bombarding his country.
</P>
<P>
   The only concession he might be able to offer the Serbian leader
is a Russian presence in that force and the passage of a U.N.
Security Council resolution authorizing its deployment.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has demanded that Milosevic withdraw his troops from
Kosovo, allow several hundred thousand ethnic Albanian refugees to
return to the homes from which they have been hounded, and permit
the deployment of a military force with NATO at its core. For now,
the future political status of Kosovo has been set aside as an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said these aims were ``unchanged, unchanging and will
not change.'' Until there is evidence they will be satisfied, the
bombing will continue and intensify.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has said that NATO might ``pause'' in its
bombardment if Serbia began a ``demonstrable and verifiable''
withdrawal of the forces that have been burning ethnic Albanian
homes and villages. But there was no sign Thursday that Milosevic
is ready to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday how Russia would respond if Milosevic
proved completely unyielding. The Western allies are eager to
secure Russia's support for a Security Council resolution on Kosovo
that would back at least the bulk of NATO's objectives in the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   Such a resolution would increase Milosevic's isolation _ another
Western aim. For if Milosevic will not yield, the only apparent
route to a NATO victory _ short of a full-scale land invasion _ is
through his overthrow by dissident Serbian forces convinced that he
is leading his country to ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, however, the opposition to Milosevic has appeared
scattered, ineffective or acutely vulnerable, despite large doses
of NATO rhetoric aimed at undermining the current Serbian
leadership.

RAYTHEON SUIT DISCLOSES DEFECTS IN MAVERICK MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. said it will spend several million dollars to fix
defects in Maverick air-to-ground missiles made for the Air Force
and other armed services.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington, Mass. defense contractor made the disclosure in a
lawsuit against its supplier, Helix Technology Corp. of Mansfield,
Mass., alleging the company provided faulty parts for the missile's
guidance system.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Helix said the company rejects the charges and said
Raytheon's own inspectors had initially approved the parts in
question while they were being produced, from 1991 to 1994.
Military officials said the problems would not affect stocks of
missiles being used by NATO forces in airstrikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Raytheon's suit, filed in Middlesex (Mass.)
Superior Court last summer, the faulty parts cause the missiles to
fail ``at an alarming rate.'' According to the suit, 44 percent of
Mavericks tested in 1997 were found to have problems in their
`cryoengine,'' a $2,100 part used to cool the missile's infrared
guidance system.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation found that defective seals within the parts
allowed helium within the cryoengines to leak and damage other
detectors nearby. The failures apparently were caused by cotton
fibers and metal slivers ``introduced into the cryoengines during
the manufacturing process,'' the lawsuit states.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon is seeking to recover costs of investigation and
repairs from Helix, and to have the award tripled. In a cover sheet
accompanying the suit, Raytheon states that it will spend ``several
million dollars investigating and repairing the defects.''
</P>
<P>
   Helix has moved to have the case dismissed because an applicable
statute of limitations has expired. Helix's lawyer in the case,
Craig Stewart, a partner in the law firm of Palmer &AMP; Dodge, said a
hearing in the case is scheduled for May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon has not previously disclosed the suit in its SEC
filings. The suit was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

   Bill Clinton became the Democrats' presidential nominee in 1992
in large measure because his party's varsity players chose to stay
off the field. Certain that George Bush was unbeatable, Mario
Cuomo, Sam Nunn, Dick Gephardt, and Jesse Jackson gave the race a
pass. The result was that a second-string governor from a
third-tier state crushed the invincible Bush in what turned out to
be the most comprehensive defeat of a sitting president since
William Howard Taft.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think Democrats would have learned.
</P>
<P>
   This time around it was Vice President Al Gore who was deemed
too formidable to challenge, at least for the Democratic
nomination. Senators Bob Kerrey and John Kerry gave it some thought
and decided not to take a chance; so, once again, did Gephardt and
Jackson. Only Bill Bradley, the ex-senator from New Jersey who
barely held his seat the last time he ran for office (in 1990),
opted to go after Gore.

   Poor, earnest, dreamy Bradley, the pundits said. Nice guy. But
face it: Gore's got the party sewn up.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was last month's conventional wisdom. This month the
U-word is suddenly in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The script for a possible upset is becoming clear,'' wrote
David Broder, dean of the nation's political reporters, in The
Washington Post on Sunday. Far from having the nomination in his
pocket, ``the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary look
increasingly hazardous for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, Bradley has been endorsed by three
Democrats as renowned _ and as different _ as Paul Volcker, the
sage former Federal Reserve chairman; Paul Wellstone, the
paleoliberal Minnesota senator; and Ed Koch, the hyperopinionated
New Yorker who served three terms as the Big Apple's irrepressible
mayor. And at least one certified superstar has put his money on
the challenger: Michael Jordan and his wife have written $1,000
checks to the Bradley campaign. (On the required form, Jordan
listed his occupation as ``retired.'')
</P>
<P>
   Polls that had Bradley down among the asterisks last year now
suggest that he is a player to reckon with. According to Gallup, 34
percent of Democrats say they would support Bradley for the
nomination today, up from 8 percent in May 1998. Gore, at 54
percent, is essentially unchanged from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has a problem, and its initials are B.C. Two
hours after the president was impeached in January, Gore declared
emphatically that Bill Clinton ``will be regarded in the history
books as one of our greatest presidents.'' That isn't how most
Americans feel. The electorate that twice held Clinton to less than
50 percent of the vote will be glad to see him go. In 1988, a great
swath of the public would gladly have reelected Ronald Reagan to a
third term; unable to do that, they did the next best thing and
elevated his second-in-command.
</P>
<P>
   But rare is the voter who pines for a third Clinton term. In a
Pew Research poll this month, Americans overwhelmingly agreed with
the statement, ``I am tired of all the problems associated with the
Clinton administration.'' The sentiment cuts across party lines: 83
percent of Republicans, 77 percent of Independents, and 64 percent
of Democrats share it. For Gore, those numbers are disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Other data in the Pew survey drive home the point. Respondents
were asked for a one-word description of Gore. In September 1996,
32 percent had something positive to say; now, only 19 percent do.
The share of those whose characterization is negative or mocking,
by contrast, has climbed to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, that Gore will surge once the primary
and caucus season gets underway. There is a respectable history of
front-runners stumbling early on only to pick themselves up and win
the nomination _ or the election _ in a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another history, just as respectable, of candidates
who once soared over the field beginning to lose altitude as the
nation learns more and more about them. Michael Dukakis was 17
points ahead of Bush in the spring of 1988. When voters began to
focus on Dukakis's record _ the ``Massachusetts Miracle'' that
melted, the furloughs for first-degree murderers _ the race turned.
By November, a 17-point lead had become a 40-state rout.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been vice president for more than six years, but many
of us are only just beginning to get a fix on him. How many voters
know, for instance, that Gore advocates a ``strategic goal'' of
completely eliminating automobiles? Or that he compares people who
disagree with his environmental views to those who appeased Hitler
in the 1930s?
</P>
<P>
   Expect to hear much more about ``Earth in the Balance,'' Gore's
1992 bestseller. Dan Quayle carries around a copy so he can read
aloud passages like this one:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pacific yew can be cut down and processed to produce . . .
taxol, which offers some promise of curing certain forms of lung,
breast, and ovarian cancer in patients who would otherwise quickly
die. It seems an easy choice _ sacrifice the tree for a human life
_ until one learns that three trees must be destroyed for each
patient treated.''
</P>
<P>
   A would-be president who can't decide whether it is more
important to save trees or human beings: Meet the real Al Gore. The
GOP is betting that the more you learn about him, the less you'll
want to put him in the White House. Bill Bradley is betting the
same thing.

COVANCE TO BUY BAY STATE DRUG-DEVELOPMENT RIVAL PAREXEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parexel International Corp., the nation's third-largest
drug-testing and development company, says it has agreed to be
acquired by rival Covance Inc. in New Jersey for $827 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will catapult Parexel and Covance into the No. 1 spot
in the burgeoning business of developing and testing experimental
drugs for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The new
company, to be named Covance Parexel Inc., will be based in
Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trim staff, as is the case with many corporate
mergers, Covance and Parexel said they will hire an additional
3,000 workers in the first 12 months after the deal is completed.
Parexel, of Waltham, Mass., employs about 4,300 full- and part-time
workers, about 900 of whom are in the Boston area. Covance, which
has 7,300 full-time employees, has minimal presence in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to grow, not cut back, in Boston,'' said Josef von
Rickenbach, Parexel's chief executive, who said he will remain in
the Boston area as the merged company's president and co-chairman
with Christopher Kuebler, chief executive of Covance and
CEO-designate of the merged company. ``Boston is a very important
location to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected
to be completed in September.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street punished Covance's stock on the New York Stock
Exchange Thursday, pushing it down 5 3/16 to 22 5/16, while Parexel
shares rose 3 15/16 to 23 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rouse, research analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York,
said the Covance stock slide is due to worries that the deal would
depress the company's 1999 earnings. Rouse, however, believes the
stock will recover once Wall Street is reassured that Covance's
earnings will be minimally affected. Kuebler said the deal will
supress the combined company's profits by about 4 percent in 1999,
but will have no effect in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rouse said the deal was borne out of market demand for larger,
more sophisticated companies that can handle the full spectrum of
drug development, from clinical trials to consulting to marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what their clients have been asking for,'' Rouse said.
``And that is giving rise to the consolidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1982, Parexel was a pioneer in the relatively young
drug-testing industry, which has grown by leaps and bounds as big
drug companies increasingly outsource their drug development
functions. Parexel revenue grew from $58.6 million in 1995 to
$285.4 million last year. Covance, the second-largest drug
development company which tested such drugs as Viagra and
Herceptin, has $732 million in annual sales. When combined, the
companies will overtake Quintiles Transnational Corp. as the
industry leader.
</P>
<P>
   Parexel's CEO, von Rickenbach, estimates that drug makers spend
more than $40 billion a year to develop drugs. Up to $7 billion of
that is outsourced to his and other companies. Parexel's industry
of outsourced drug development is growing at a rate of 20 percent a
year or more, according to Rouse of Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Parexel also announced quarterly financial results Thursday,
posting a net income of $5.7 million on $90 million in revenue in
its third fiscal quarter ended March 31. In 1998, Parexel lost $2.4
million on revenue of $73.1 million.

 &HT;    Violent films are not guilty in blame gameBy Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ This just in: Movie
<TEXT>
violence sells.
<P>
   Millions upon millions of people across the nation have bought
tickets for the perversely peculiar adrenaline rush provided by gun
'n' blood fests like ``True Lies,'' ``Natural Born Killers,''
``Reservoir Dogs,'' ``Pulp Fiction'' and, for some inexplicable
reason, ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions upon millions of people. Yet only a tiny handful of
these people have gone on to kill or cause mayhem, leading some
people to invoke the titles of violent movies that may have
inspired the carnage. One of the teens in the Columbine High School
massacre in Littleton, Colo., was rumored to be a fan of the recent
neo-Nazi skinhead drama ``American History X.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course he was. It appears he and his partner were
neo-Nazis who lionized Adolf Hitler. Did the movie, a late 1998
release, arouse their interest in Hitler? I doubt it. That would
transpose the equation of symptom and disease. The boys admired
``American History X'' because they were burgeoning neo-Nazis, not
the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Do people randomly maim and murder because they think the
killing couple in Oliver Stone's ``Natural Born Killers'' are role
models to be aped, as has been alleged in two recent court cases?
No, they murder because they are murderers, predisposed
psychopaths. Of course they're going to be drawn to an exciting
movie about their ilk. To suggest that ``Natural Born Killers'' is
to blame is flatly irresponsible. Fortunately, both cases _ one in
Louisiana, one in Georgia _ were dismissed, although the Louisiana
case has been appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're making the artist responsible for the violent criminal
actions of unknown, disturbed audience members,'' says James
Hemphill, a lawyer at the Austin law firm of George &AMP; Donaldson,
which represented the film's distributor, Warner Bros., in both
cases. The studio was accused of inciting violence by releasing
``Natural Born Killers.''
</P>
<P>
   I agree with Hemphill's assessment. And I think blaming the
artist is dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If films are so powerfully influential, as parents and pundits
claim, we should be happy these horrific incidents don't happen
more often. Even one murder is a heavy burden for society to bear,
but I just don't think we have an epidemic here. Movies may
glamorize violence (in my mind they do), but they don't kill;
idiots do.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for ``cleaning up'' pop art by somehow making it less
violent and more morally nourishing hark back to the defunct Hays
Code that, from 1930 to 1966, regulated content in Hollywood films.
One rule, for example, demanded that gangster movies punish their
criminal anti-heroes before the end credits. Now we have the
ratings system, G through NC-17, which parents may want to take
more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Hollywood should make more socially redemptive films
is not only an unreasonably subjective request, but an
anti-capitalist, semi-fascist one. It's like saying McDonald's
should sell tofu burgers on organic whole wheat buns. Nice idea
but...
</P>
<P>
   I submit that art _ and movies are art _ does not need morals.
Art by its very nature is amoral. It is beholden to no one but its
makers. Morals or spiritual uplift are not requisites to attain the
singular transcendence art can furnish. Art is exempt and
blameless. Its sole duty is to illuminate areas of life, including
those shadow areas we'd rather not confront. The moment it becomes
prescriptive, the line between art and propaganda blurs.
</P>
<P>
   Art is often coarse and uncomfortable, devoid of answers and
hopelessly entangled in ambiguity. Some of its best tools are its
most challenging and, to many, its most difficult to countenance:
satire, irony, detached realism, allegory. (Several critics hailed
``Natural Born Killers'' expressly for its wildly sophisticated use
of irony and satire.)
</P>
<P>
   So let's get the equation right. A film might indeed be the prod
that pushes a troubled individual off the precipice into
destruction. So might someone neglecting to use their turn signal
on Interstate 35. In fact, the latter is statistically more apt to
happen. Should we blame the cars?

 &HT;    Chemistry? Not in this formula
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the press notes for the emaciated thriller
``Entrapment,'' co-star Catherine Zeta-Jones compares her on-screen
chemistry with Sean Connery to that of Hepburn and Tracy and Bogart
and Bacall. I'm pretty sure this is slander.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, Zeta-Jones is cursed by her beauty. Dark and
panther-sleek, she's so conventionally perfect, so preternaturally
unblemished, she's bland. She certainly cannot act. She likes to
purse her lips a lot and squint her eyes to make ``looks.'' In a
self-conscious, Calista Flockhart-y way, she thinks she's the
cutest thing since Smurfs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Connery, the most famous actor who whistles when he
talks. When he chooses to, Connery has charisma to burn. Somewhere
along the way to ``Entrapment'' he must have started a small
inferno. He's interesting to look at, but so are X-rays. Connery is
a living cultural artifact, whose appeal lies in everything he's
done before what you're watching him in now.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Entrapment'' is a chemistry-free zone. It's also an
imagination-, humor- and passion-free zone. At its best, the
movie's a tiresome pastiche of innumerable action-romances. Usually
Jean-Claude Van Damme is drafted for routine dross like this. At
least he's fun to make fun of.
</P>
<P>
   Connery plays the ``world's greatest art thief,'' Mac, who has
just purloined a Rembrandt with incredible style. He's pursued by
Zeta-Jones' American insurance investigator, Gin, whose company
stands to lose $24 million if the painting is not recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan when she finds Mac is to pose as a fellow art thief and
enlist the master ripper-offer to nab a priceless Chinese mask _ to
catch him red-handed. He bites, and just like that they are
partners in crime.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly if inadvertently, the movie depicts Gin as a rather
loathsome person. This is a problem when it comes to audience
empathy. Oh, let's just say it: She's a slut. As Mac coaches her in
the ways of high-tech larceny, Gin repeatedly offers herself to
him. Connery, ever the cool cucumber, declines. She's stung. She
pouts. I think it's this whisper of tension Zeta-Jones mistakes for
``chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, there's no pressing need for Gin to seduce Mac. He's
already in, he's accepted her proposition; they're a team. Sex,
apparently, is just a bonus prize.
</P>
<P>
   The twist is that Gin, staid insurance investigator, likes being
a criminal. She and Mac are smashing at it. With balletic grace and
arsenals of gizmos, they steal their quarry, which later includes
the brain-numbing figure of $8 billion from a Malaysian bank. In
the plot's single clever conceit, the money can only be accessed 30
seconds before the millennium _ at precisely 11:59:30 p.m. this New
Year's Eve _ right as the bank has shut down systems to test them
for the Y2K bug. By now the film has choked and passed out on its
royal implausibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The film was written by veteran scripter Ron Bass (``Rain Man,''
``My Best Friend's Wedding'') and Austinite William Broyles, who
co-wrote ``Apollo 13.'' It's amazing such talent cooked up such
rubbish. Beyond tired, the film is shoddy, riddled with dumb lapses
in logic, weak character development and witless banter. An absence
of subplots and any intriguing side characters (Ving Rhames is
wasted) makes this one thin package. Jon Amiel's visionless
direction helps nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the charming scamp, Connery is OK here, though he
brings little to the role except that twinkle in his gimlet blues _
a twinkle that probably has its own agent. Like Harrison Ford,
Connery's often confused for a good actor. He's a marvelous
presence who can mold a faded Scottish burr into a musical purr. At
68, the actor's biggest feat here is that he plays a 60-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the lithe Zeta-Jones, who was admirable in last
summer's ``The Mask of Zorro,'' can't break out of her enamelled
pulchritude.
</P>
<P>
   Chemistry? Try the local pharmacy. Better yet, try a video shop
and rent ``Adam's Rib'' or ``The Big Sleep.''

 &HT;    `Idle Hands' can't hold savvy viewers
 &HT;    By Alison Macor
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The latest teen comedy ``Idle Hands'' includes
gory horror for extra spice, but uninspired writing, brain-dead
characters (this is before they get the ax) and agonizingly slow
pacing stop this movie dead in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Idle Hands'' opens promisingly. An eerily abstract credit
sequence plays out against a thumping soundtrack. Fade to a
suburban neighborhood, where the camera tracks through a sprawling,
Prairie-style house and comes to rest in an upstairs bedroom. A
woman (Connie Ray) and her husband (Fred Willard) are turning in
for the night. They turn out the lights, crawl under the covers and
get the shock of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned thrills are the best part of ``Idle Hands.''
The movie is spring-loaded with minor terrors that keep us
pleasantly off-balance. It's the filler, however, that turns ``Idle
Hands'' into another trendy, dumb teen movie. Characters like Anton
(Devon Sawa) and his friends Mick (Seth Green) and Pnub (Elden
Henson) stumble around spewing mind-numbing chatter at one another.
They're not dumb because they're stoked on pot (although in the
long run this doesn't help). They sound dumb because they're
written that way by screenwriters Terri Hughes and Ron Milbauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Idle Hands'' centers on a neighborhood that's being stalked by
a killer. While the rest of the town is either grieving for
mutilated victims or watching over their shoulders, Anton is
blissfully unaware of the mayhem. We're not told much else, except
that a woman named Debbie (Vivica A. Fox) is tracking suspects in a
parallel story shoddily intercut with the main narrative. Debbie is
constructed as the Final Girl character, who in the slasher
tradition is the triumphant if traumatized survivor. This character
saves the genre for feminism, but in the case of ``Idle Hands,''
female empowerment requires a push-up bra.
</P>
<P>
   Anton's apathy supposedly is at the heart of his involvement in
the murders, but the explanation (uh, the moral?) is so poorly
delivered that it might as well have been left out of the script
entirely. His ``idle'' hands, which he's been using only to
manipulate the remote, roll his joints and so on, make him the
perfect host for a satanic force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Idle Hands'' uses its characters as pawns in a larger,
somewhat random game that involves winking at the conventions of
both the teen comedy and the horror film in all its contemporary
permutations (think Wes Craven, ``Tales From the Crypt,'' etc.).
Even the movie's stylish poster is reminiscent of the graphic
design made popular by German Expressionism. We're encouraged to
recognize these references and laugh at the stupidity of the
characters and their dilemmas, but the plot also demands that we
identify with Anton and his friends in order to care what happens
by the end of the story. But we don't, in part because they don't
deserve our interest.
</P>
<P>
   As movie audiences grow more sophisticated, they become more
difficult to impress. Contemporary horror movies like ``Scream''
are so successful because they combine the most basic chills (the
killer's in the house) with a reflexivity (a nod to the genre's
history) that acknowledges viewers' media savvy. ``Idle Hands''
adopts this equation and succeeds only part of the time because its
cast isn't balanced by a character worth rooting for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Idle Hands'' is for the 13-year-old boy in us. How in touch
you are with this part of your psyche determines how much you'll
enjoy this movie.

RAYTHEON SUIT DISCLOSES DEFECTS IN MAVERICK MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. said it will spend several million dollars to fix
defects in Maverick air-to-ground missiles made for the Air Force
and other armed services.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington, Mass. defense contractor made the disclosure in a
lawsuit against its supplier, Helix Technology Corp. of Mansfield,
Mass., alleging the company provided faulty parts for the missile's
guidance system.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Helix said the company rejects the charges and said
Raytheon's own inspectors had initially approved the parts in
question while they were being produced, from 1991 to 1994.
Military officials said the problems would not affect stocks of
missiles being used by NATO forces in airstrikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Raytheon's suit, filed in Middlesex (Mass.)
Superior Court last summer, the faulty parts cause the missiles to
fail ``at an alarming rate.'' According to the suit, 44 percent of
Mavericks tested in 1997 were found to have problems in their
`cryoengine,'' a $2,100 part used to cool the missile's infrared
guidance system.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation found that defective seals within the parts
allowed helium within the cryoengines to leak and damage other
detectors nearby. The failures apparently were caused by cotton
fibers and metal slivers ``introduced into the cryoengines during
the manufacturing process,'' the lawsuit states.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon is seeking to recover costs of investigation and
repairs from Helix, and to have the award tripled. In a cover sheet
accompanying the suit, Raytheon states that it will spend ``several
million dollars investigating and repairing the defects.''
</P>
<P>
   Helix has moved to have the case dismissed because an applicable
statute of limitations has expired. Helix's lawyer in the case,
Craig Stewart, a partner in the law firm of Palmer &AMP; Dodge, said a
hearing in the case is scheduled for May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon has not previously disclosed the suit in its SEC
filings. The suit was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

PALESTINIANS WON'T DECLARE STATEHOOD ON MAY 4 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian leaders decided Thursday against
declaring statehood next Tuesday, retreating from a pledge that the
Israelis saw as a threat, defusing a volatile situation.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, the
Palestinian Central Council ended a three-day meeting in Gaza City
by abandoning the idea of pronouncing the West Bank and Gaza Strip
a Palestinian state on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the Oslo peace accord, May 4 was a target
date by which final peace negotiations between Israelis and
Palestinians were to have been completed, but they have barely
begun.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting over the fate of the state will resume in June,
after the Israeli elections, which will be held on May 17 with a
runoff expected on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   That way, if the right-wing government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is re-elected and the peace effort remains
frozen, the Palestinians can reconsider the option of making a
unilateral declaration of statehood, some said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to give ourselves an open-ended session because we
don't want to let any decision serve Netanyahu and the Israeli
groups that are fighting peace,'' Abdallah Frangi, a council member
and Palestine Liberation Organization representative to Germany,
told The Associated Press in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders said they were uneasy that Netanyahu would
trumpet the postponement as a victory for his tough posture toward
them. And indeed he did, even before their meeting ended, both in
statements to the press and in hastily prepared political
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat backed down and that's a good thing,'' Netanyahu said
on Wednesday. ``They delayed it until after the election because
they know that as long as I am prime minister of Israel, a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital will not be
established.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat convened the Gaza meeting to allow some outlet for the
impatience many in the PLO feel with the slow road to independence.
He also wanted a broad consensus for his temperate, pragmatic
decision after raising his people's hopes in a series of fiery
speeches over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, some Palestinian leaders would prefer to abandon the
American-brokered peace effort, by which their sovereignty or
statehood is to be determined through negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Americans promised early this week to help him
push for a final negotiated deal within a year, Arafat urged the
Palestinian leadership to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the trappings of statehood _ from an airport to a
country area code _ that the Palestinians have recently acquired.
And he reportedly told them that it was a sensitive moment, when
the Palestinians, having accomplished much, should not risk losing
what they have gained by ``making mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on a whirlwind diplomatic tour, Arafat and his
advisers made it clear that they had gained international support
for independence _ goodwill and backing that the Palestinians will
need in negotiating the thorny issues involved in final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat told the council members that the Americans, many
Europeans and some Arab leaders had asked them not to make a
unilateral declaration of statehood next week so as not to rupture
the peace negotiation process or to provoke retaliation by the
Israelis. In the event of a declaration, Israel had threatened a
harsh reaction, including possibly annexing parts of the West Bank.

 &HT;    Examine adult males' exploitative role in teen pregnancy
 &HT;    EDS: Corrects grammatical errors in 5th, 9th and 10th grafs.
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole have stated that
rape would be one of few factors considered in granting an abortion
if they could amend the U.S. Constitution. Life-or-death medical
necessity would be another.
</P>
<P>
   How to write a constitutional amendment or statute to reflect
that: Medical necessity _ on one doctor's word? On decree of a
medical congress?
</P>
<P>
   Rape is even more problematic. The next time Bush or Dole
broaches the subject, someone ask, ``Does that include statutory
rape?''
</P>
<P>
   If the latter is the case, the candidates would allow a lot of
legal abortions and, presumably, be prosecuting more rape trials
than one can imagine. For by definition in most states, a vast
number of teen pregnancies, maybe the majority, are the result of
statutory rape.
</P>
<P>
   A nasty little matter too commonly downplayed: Most teen moms
are impregnated by adult males. Roughly half of the babies born to
mothers age 15 to 17 have fathers older than 20. Though the girls'
participation is consensual and irresponsible, they are the true
embodiment of girls getting swept off their feet.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Planned Parenthood seminar called ``Unequal Partners''
addressed this, focusing particularly on ways to get teen girls to
foresee the potential problems of being squired by older males.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want government to make tricky personal judgment
calls, this is one of the most compelling puzzles: Sometimes
there's a fine line between romance and rape.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 study by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy
found that more than 80 percent of teen girls engaging in
intercourse for the first time did so with older males, that 45
percent involved an age gap of two to four years, that 17 percent
had a gap of up to five years, and that 11.8 percent involved a
male five or more years older.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the phrase ``children having children'' is only
half right in so many cases. The fathers have left their childhood
behind. They've also left a teen's childhood in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The starkest reality is what happen when the girl gets pregnant.
That special someone, so responsible and mature _ he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   The girls are far from blameless. But Lynn Phillips, whose study
for Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey is used in
``Unequal Partners,'' points out the ominous impressions that draw
some girls into these straits.
</P>
<P>
   Older males are seen by teen girls not only as more wealthy and
mobile _ that car, that apartment _ but also as ``more likely than
teens to be monogamous.'' The girl presumes Mr. Dream-Boat's wild
oats have already been sown.
</P>
<P>
   However, reported Phillips, the adult men she studied in these
situations ``were no more likely to take responsibility for
pregnancy and child rearing than were adolescent partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips also found young girls taking less care to use birth
control with older males who looked more like the marrying type
than teens, or at least more like the type to stand by them if they
got pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   This dynamic must be front and center in the discussion of teen
sexuality, the fact that a young girl being romanced by a mature
candidate for the altar may only become a notch on his bedpost.
</P>
<P>
   Should these adults be prosecuted for rape? California has taken
a more aggressive stance in so doing. But the extent of the problem
is such that one exploitative seed-sower unto himself is but a
grain of sand on a long, long beach.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is laying out the facts and getting girls to think
about ways to spare themselves life-altering pregnancies or the
abortion dilemma. Meanwhile, candidates: Rape or romance? Are you
ready for government to make the call?

NATO EMBARRASSED BY ERRANT MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>

 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ On the same day Bulgaria's government tentatively
authorized NATO to use its airspace in its war against Yugoslavia,
NATO acknowledged Thursday that one of its missiles went awry and
hit a house in a suburb of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in the accident, but its timing could hardly
have been worse for NATO, coming days before a vote Monday by
Bulgaria's Parliament on whether to allow the use of its airspace.
</P>
<P>
   NATO considers the cooperation of Bulgaria against its fellow
Slavs in Serbia to be crucial in persuading Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that he is becoming isolated in his war with the
West.
</P>
<P>
   The accident also continued an embarrassing pattern of NATO
missiles missing their targets. On Tuesday, a missile which NATO
said was aimed at a Yugoslav Army barracks went off course and hit
homes in the Serb town of Surdulica, killing 20 civilians,
including children.
</P>
<P>
   But while NATO said Tuesday's missile that killed civilians was
only off by a few hundred yards, the missile that hit the Gorna
Banja suburb of Sofia landed some 30 miles inside Bulgarian
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgarian Interior Minister Bogomil Bonev told reporters in
Sofia that his country would sue NATO for compensation, but said
the accident would not shake the government's resolve to ask its
Parliament on Monday to give NATO a 70- to 90-mile air corridor
along Bulgaria's western border with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   On three previous occasions, NATO missiles have strayed into
unpopulated border areas in Bulgaria, but caused no damage to
people or property. Bonev called Wednesday night's accident, in
which the roof and second floor of a house were destroyed, ``the
most drastic violation of our airspace so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking here, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the accident
occurred when a NATO fighter's defense system indicated that it had
been ``locked on'' to by a Serb antiaircraft missile system. Shea
said the NATO pilot fired a HARM, or High-speed Anti-Radiation,
missile in self defense, but that the missile went astray when the
ground radar system which it had targeted suddenly was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Shea nor a senior NATO officer, Brigadier General
Giuseppe Marani, could explain why the ground radar system was shut
off, nor how future accidents could be avoided. But in an
interview, Shea rejected suggestions that the Serbs had purposely
used the radar system to draw fire from a NATO plane knowing that
once it turned off the radar, the NATO missile would continue into
Bulgaria. Shea said HARM missiles have a range of about 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that while accidents are regrettable, they
are unavoidable in combat situations. Without specifying how many
accidents there have been so far, Shea and other officials said
that only a fraction of 4,500 bomb and missile attacks launched in
the 37 days of Operation Allied Force have ended in mistakes, such
as the 70 to 80 refugees killed when mistaken for a Serb military
convoy three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the missile that landed in Bulgaria was a mistake, NATO
purposely bombed Montenegro. NATO officials said that almost 30
missile strikes hit Podgorica airfield in Montenegro because
Yugoslav warplanes there could attack NATO forces in neighboring
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is the smaller of the two republics which with Serbia
forms what is left of Yugoslavia. Its pro-Western government has
blamed Milosevic for provoking the war, and it fears that Milosevic
may launch a coup against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulgarians, meanwhile, are torn between their desire to join
NATO and the European Union and their instinctive sympathy with
fellow Orthodox Christian Slavs in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov visited the area where the
missile hit and demanded an explanation. However, the Bulgarians
want more than assurances from NATO that it will look into the
accident. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova said NATO
should give his government sophisticated radar equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgarians are especially worried about NATO missiles hitting
the Kosloduy nuclear power plant, which sits on the Danube River in
the north of the country, less than 100 miles from the Serbian
border.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgarian officials say that the air corridor they want
Parliament to approve would exclude Sofia and the area around the
power plant.

RUSSIA REVELS IN ROLE AS BALKANS PEACE INTERMEDIARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Not many days ago, Russia seemed headed toward
international isolation over its opposition to NATO airstrikes in
Yugoslavia, with nothing but its huge nuclear arsenal to make the
West pay it any mind.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Suddenly, the Kremlin is the center of efforts to
solve the Kosovo crisis. The Russian capital has become an
obligatory stop on the peacemaking tour, as Western leaders and
international mediators hope Moscow can use its close ties to
Belgrade to work out an agreement on Kosovo and end the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Reveling in its new role, Russia Thursday stepped up its
diplomatic efforts _ but at the same time reminded everyone of the
nuclear option.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had ``concrete proposals'' to end the war, Russia's
Balkan envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin set off on a whirlwind mission to
Bonn, Rome and Belgrade after holding talks with United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Boris N. Yeltsin sandwiched diplomacy
around an unusually secretive meeting of Russia's Security Council,
which discussed upgrading the country's nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin's initiative has a key pre-condition _ a halt
to the NATO airstrikes _ that gives it little chance for a
breakthrough. NATO has insisted it will not halt its attacks until
Yugoslav forces pull out of Kosovo and are replaced by a
peacekeeping force that includes troops from the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   After talks with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Bonn,
Chernomyrdin told Russian Public Television that ``we are very
close.'' Schroeder was more circumspect, saying that ``there is
movement'' towards a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But the gestalt of the meeting was entirely different from the
cold confrontation of a meeting just two weeks ago. Chernomyrdin
also had a 30-minute phone chat with Vice President Al Gore,
Russian news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
   Western countries have been encouraging Russia to act as a
go-between with Yugoslavia, and Moscow has welcomed the chance to
play a prominent role. NATO leaders say involving Russia adds to
the pressure on Belgrade and steers the alliance away from
confrontation with Moscow, but Russian analysts interpret the new
interest in Russia as a sign that NATO is looking for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week ago Russia was completely alone, and now everyone is
here,'' commented Alexander Goltz, who writes on military and
political affairs for Itogi magazine. ``Russia is the last hope for
the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no sign that NATO or Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic will make the necessary concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's brother Borislav, Belgrade's ambassador to Moscow,
repeated Yugoslavia's insistence that a peacekeeping force for
Kosovo be under UN command and include contingents from Russia and
countries that oppose the airstrikes, such as India, Belarus,
Cyprus, Algeria, and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some signs of progress in Moscow, where the
foreign ministers of two NATO members met with Annan and with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who has been the mouthpiece
for Russia's displeasure and its harshest warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In an oddly upbeat press conference with a smiling Ivanov,
Canada's Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy and Greece's George
Papandreou emphasized the need for UN backing for any settlement to
the crisis. This addressed one of Moscow's chief criticisms of the
aistrikes, which NATO undertook without a UN mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin repeated that point before meeting with Annan and later
South African President Nelson Mandela, who hinted that he might
help mediate the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are very high now not only for the Balkans and
Europe but for the whole world,'' a tired-looking Yeltsin said.
``Either international law and order will be restored or the world
will be ruled by the lawlessnes and unchecked force of one side.''
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast with the flurry of diplomatic initiatives,
Yeltsin also met with his advisory Security Council and vowed to
develop not only new strategic nuclear weapons, but also new
tactical weapons that can be fitted on artillery shells and
torpedoes. This was such an unexpected initiative _ Russia's 10,000
tactical warheads, most dating back to the mid-1970s, are stocked
away in military storage sites _ that military analysts here
immediately dismissed it as a bluff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be mad to seriously be considering that,''
commented one expert, who requested anonymity. ``It's just not
possible or feasible. No one has been developing tactical weapons
in Russia for years. This is for show.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the meeting was certainly full of theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The session was so secret even the head of the Strategic Rocket
Forces was asked to leave the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here, including the president, risks his head if
something leaks from here,'' Yeltsin growled.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Security Council Secretary Vladimir Putin denied
that the meeting was in any way linked to Yugoslavia. But Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev has said previously that Moscow would have
to reshape its military doctrine and review its nuclear and
conventional forces to respond to what Russia regards as NATO's
increasingly threatening stance.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who will retire as president in June, indicated that
he, too, was willing to get involved in efforts to find peace in
Kosovo. Following a telephone conversation with Annan, he told
reporters in Moscow that he would play whatever role the UN
secretary general asked of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend (Mandela) is also against the unipolar world in
which one state dictates its will to the rest of the world,''
Yeltsin told reporters. ``We are against attempts to ensure
security for some at the expense of others.''

SHOOTINGS SYMPTOM OF AMERICAN `DISEASE,' CANADIANS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The news from Taber, Alberta was undeniably shocking:
a 14-year-old dropout, armed with a .22 caliber rifle, strode into
W. R. Myers High School and allegedly shot down two former
classmates, killing one and seriously wounding the other.
</P>
<P>
   To many Canadians, the Wednesday afternoon gunfire that
shattered the tranquility of the prairie town that bills itself
``Corn Capital of Canada'' seemed not just a horrific and
inexplicable crime, but a symptom of proximity to the United States
-- as if violence was a virus borne north by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   CBC newscaster Alison Smith, anchoring the national network's
late night news, personified that notion in the opening words of
her report: ``A uniquely American tragedy has visited Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been the refrain ever since, not only from news
analysts but from the stunned townspeople at the center of a
tragedy still unfurling as Taber mourns the death of Jason Lang,
17. The other victim, Shane Christmas, also 17, remains in serious
condition with a stomach wound.
</P>
<P>
   Their alleged assailant, described as a ninth grader who'd
stopped attending classes at the school, was charged Thursday with
first-degree murder and attempted murder. But many seemed to
believe that the real culprit was the violence that pervades
American culture, from main streets to movie screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting like America, where nowhere is safe,'' said Jim
Cannady, father of a student at the high school. ``That's the sad
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   For as long as there has been a United States, Canadians have
been appalled by it. There is nothing more constant in Canadian
history than fear that this country might slide into some sort of
American abyss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back a hundred years, and you'll hear the same theme _
Canada is in danger of becoming more violent, more unruly, like the
Americans,'' said Anthony N. Doob, professor of criminology at the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we live next door to this huge and powerful nation,
it's the obvious place to blame,'' he said. ``Of course, lighting
can strike anywhere. Every time there's a violent crime in Canada
doesn't mean were becoming `just like' the US. It means we have
crime, like any society. But making that US connection tends to be
the way Canadians try to make sense of the senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings in Taber appeared at least in part a copycat crime
of last week's massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo. That rampage, which received huge media attention north of
the border, was seen by many anguished Canadians as a portent for
their own society.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the United States is, we are on the way to becoming,''
wrote columnist Anne Giardini in the National Post, a Toronto-based
newspaper. ``We watch their bullet-riddled television and their
blood-spattered movies.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all the fear and trepidation, Canada remains a far
more peaceful and civil society than the United States, with a
violent crime rate barely a quarter that of its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying at W.R. Myers High School marked the first killing
at a Canadian high school in at least two decades, and _ unlike the
shootings in Colorado _ appeared the crazed act of an alienated
loner, not a sinister plot. The 14-year-old suspect earlier this
year stopped attending classes because of ``personality problems,''
according to townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian police are forbidden by law from releasing the names of
minors accused of crime. The boy was described as tempermental,
unpopular and the butt of teasing from classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Garbed in a blue three-quarter-length parka, possibly in
imitation of the ``black trenchcoat'' killers in Colorado, he
entered a classroom just after lunch hour, briefly pointed a rifle
at a female teacher while shouting ``this is no joke,'' then strode
out to a hallway and fired four bullets into Lang and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether he chose the victims or shot them at
random. Lang and Christmas were described as best friends. Both
were 11th graders, athletic and popular with other students at the
school, which has an enrollment of 440.
</P>
<P>
   ``May God have mercy on this broken society and all the hurting
people in it,'' said Rev. Dale Lang, father of the dead boy and
pastor at St. Theodore's Anglican Church. ``We grieve for our son,
for this community, and for a 14-year-old boy who killed so
senselessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Canada was in grief, as flags were flown at half-staff
and experts on everything from child psychology to gun control
sought to explain the tragedy. Time and again, US violence _ both
real violence and that portrayed in movies and on television _ was
cited as a threat to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians know we're tied into the United States in a lot of
ways, and are convinced American social diseases could cross the
border,'' said Conrad Winn of the Toronto polling firm COMPAS Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's tradition of fairly stringent gun control dates to the
late 1800s, when the Mounties would confiscate the six-shooters of
American rowdies seeking to enter Western settlements. Last year, a
new law was passed that tightened regulations further, making
private possession of handguns illegal in nearly all cases, and
strictly licensing rifles and shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there 7 million guns in private hands in Canada, which
has a population of 30 million. That compares to more than 230
million firearms owned by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun ownership here is a privilege, not a right,'' said
Chantale Breton, a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Gun Control.
``We aren't the country next door, we haven't reached that point,
but Canadians can't be complacent.''

NEW TRIALS SHOW CANCER-SHRINKING DRUGS' POWER, RESEARCHER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It is still only animal research, but four new
tumor-starving drugs _ including the highly touted endostatin and
angiostatin _ have shrunk harder-to-treat and more human-like
cancers than any they have been tested against to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another step closer to the situation'' for humans,
said Dr. Judah Folkman, the Harvard and Children's Hospital
scientist and a pioneer in the discovery of compounds called
angiogenesis inhibitors that can choke off tumors' critical blood
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``this is also the first demonstration that
these compounds may be valuable in cancer prevention'' as well as
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A paper of which Folkman is an author in the current issue of
the journal Science reports that the drugs showed they could
prevent premalignant cells from escalating to cancer. They also
limited the growth of small but mature cancer cells, and shrank
large, terminal tumors by up to 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can probably do even better with different `cocktails' of
angiogenesis inhibitors,'' said Douglas Hanahan, a biochemist at
the University of California in San Francisco and lead author on
the paper. ``The major question is whether this translates into
human cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis inhibitors do not attack tumors directly. Instead,
they target the network of tiny blood vessels that tumors need to
grow and spread to other parts of the body. The inhibitors block or
destroy this vascular life-support system, starving the tumor of
oxygen and nutrients and halting the cancer's growth.
</P>
<P>
   A key advantage of angiogenesis-blocking drugs is their much
lower toxicity than conventional cancer drugs that attack tumor
cells but also unavoidably kill normal cells.
</P>
<P>
   The Science report describes experiments carried out by Hanahan,
Folkman, and others in which four angiogenesis inhibitors were
given to mice that had been made highly cancer-prone by adding a
cancer-causing oncogene to their genetic blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   The added oncogene goaded normal pancreatic cells into
uncontrolled growth, going through a number of stages leading to
tumors that grew until they eventually killed the mice.
</P>
<P>
   This is much more like the development of human cancer than the
mouse ``models'' of cancer usually used to test new drugs. In these
models, scientists inject cells from existing mouse tumors under
the skin of other mice. These transplanted cells form easy-to-see
lumps that become growing tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't die of lumps injected under the skin,'' noted
Hanahan, a longtime collaborator with Folkman. The tumors caused by
the oncogene, he said, are ``a very tough model to treat, even
harder than a human cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiments are the first in which researchers gave
angiogenesis inhibitors at three distinct stages in the development
of cancer, to find out whether they were equally effective in
early, middle and late stages of the disease. In past experiments
the drugs were given only after the animals had developed large,
mature tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the drugs, endostatin and angiostatin, are awaiting their
first tests in human patients. The National Cancer Institute in
collaboration with EntreMed, Inc., a Maryland biotech company that
has licensed the drugs from Children's Hospital, is preparing for
initial safety tests of endostatin in humans later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Two centers have been selected for the initial tests. They are
the University of Wisconsin in Madison and the M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The other two inhibitors tested in the mice were AGM-1470 and
BB-94, angiogenesis inhibitors less potent than endostatin and
angiostatin. They are already in early human testing.
</P>
<P>
   In the prevention part of the study, BB-94 and a combination of
angiostatin and endostatin prevented 50 to 60 percent of abnormal,
precancerous cells from going on to outright cancer. The inhibitors
did this, the scientists believe, by shutting down the ``angiogenic
switch'' _ the sending of signals by tumor cells to nearby blood
vessels that results in the formation of new, tiny vessels to
supply the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   All four inhibitors, when given to 10-week-old mice that had
small tumors, shut down angiogenesis and reduced tumor growth by 60
to 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in a test of their ability to shrink advanced tumors,
AGM-1470 and a combination of angiostatin and endostatin reduced
the tumors by up to 71 percent and extended the animals' life by
two weeks or more.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the inhibitors worked differently at different
stages of the cancer. For instance, endostatin alone strongly
prevented precancers cells from becoming malignant, but was less
effective in the advanced tumors.
</P>
<P>
   This finding was a surprise. One result may be that various
angiogenesis inhibitors will be ``fine-tuned'' to attack cancer at
different stages in its development, Hanahan said.

SHIFTS IN MARS' CRUST SIMILAR TO EARTH'S, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is being hailed as potentially the most important
discovery in decades about Earth's sister planet Mars, scientists
have found that the red planet probably experienced a process
similar to ``plate tectonics'' on Earth, with large sections of the
planet's crust spreading apart over time.
</P>
<P>
   No other world besides Earth itself has shown evidence of this
process, which some scientists say may have been essential for the
development and evolution of life on this planet. Even on Earth,
the existence of this process involving the movement of huge
``plates'' of the planet's crust was only discovered about three
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's spectacular,'' said planetary scientist Bruce
Jakosky of the University of Colorado, who was not involved in the
new discovery. ``I can't overstate how important a result this
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery is important for several reasons, scientists said.
First, the environment around the ridges where tectonic plates form
on Earth are now thought to be one of the likeliest places for the
origins of life here, and thus the existence of such environments
on Mars raises the likelihood that life may have begun there as
well. In addition, the process could drastically revise scientists'
understanding of the whole evolution of the Martian surface, and in
the process provide new clues about what could happen to Earth in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings came from instruments aboard the Mars Global
Surveyor spacecraft, which has been orbiting Mars since Sept. 1997.
In an extraordinarily lucky break, the data that produced the new
findings might never have been obtained if not for changes in the
spacecraft's orbit that were made as a result of damage to one of
its solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mind-blowing, really,'' said Jack Connerney of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space
Flight Center, who led one of two teams publishing the new findings
in the current issue of the journal Science. ``We had no idea we'd
see anything of this magnitude.'' Another team led by Mario Acuna
published an accompanying paper on the new findings.
</P>
<P>
   What the spacecraft revealed was a series of parallel stripes of
strongly magnetized regions in the planet's crust, some of them
extending for more than 1,200 miles across the surface. The bands
alternated in their north and south magnetic orientation, just as
bands of new crust that form beneath Earth's oceans do.
</P>
<P>
   It was the discovery of just such a pattern of alternate
magnetic strips on Earth's seafloor that provided the first
convincing evidence for the theory of plate tectonics on Earth in
the 1960s, and led to a revolution in geologists' understanding of
this planet.
</P>
<P>
   The magnetic strips on Earth occur along mid-ocean ridges where
the molten rock deep below, called magma, welled up through cracks
in the thin crust. As it cooled and solidified, crystals within the
rock lined up with the Earth's magnetic field. Since Earth's
magnetic field reverses itself unpredictably a few times every
million years, as new crust forms it records the alternating
sequence of the planet's magnetism like strips on a magnetic tape.
</P>
<P>
   The magnetized strips on Mars are broader and more intense than
those on Earth, which may imply that Mars once had a stronger
magnetic field than Earth, though it appears to have none at all at
present, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists expressed caution about this interpretation of
the new Mars findings, saying that there are significant
differences from the signs of plate tectonics found on Earth. Vicki
Hansen, a geologist at Sountern Methodist University in Dallas,
said that it may be premature to describe this as a process of
plate tectonics, because the dynamics of the Martian surface may
prove to be very different from those on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But she agreed that the findings provide exciting new evidence
about Martian geology, and imply that there is ``certainly
something in terms of recycling of the crust'' on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Sleep, a planetary scientist at Stanford University, said
the new results fit in very well with a theory he published five
years ago, suggesting that Mars had indeed experienced a form of
plate tectonics. Sleep said in an interview Thursday that with more
detailed data from Mars, it should be possible to prove the
existence and extent of tectonics there conclusively.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed, tectonics on Mars ``shows that early Mars was even
more Earth-like than we thought it was. All the biological
conditions that existed on Earth'' at the time when life originated
here ``would have existed on Mars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Mars once had life, he said, ``it raises the probability that
it's still inhabited, because once microorganisms get onto
something, they're very hard to get rid of.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of these strips on Mars is ``arguably the biggest
discovery about Mars in many, many years,'' said Stephen Maran, an
astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center and spokesman for the
American Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mars is smaller and therefore evolves faster, seeing
what happened there may be like observing a scale model of Earth in
order to learn about our own future, Maran said.

AMENDMENT BANNING FLAG BURNING MOVES CLOSER TO VICTORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Proponents of a constitutional amendment to ban
flag burning appear closer to victory this year because of changes
in the Senate where the measure has been buried in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the amendment 11-7
Thursday, paving the way for possible full Senate consideration
before Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment, which requires a two-thirds vote
in both chambers, has easily passed the House in past years but
fell three votes short in the Senate the last time it was
considered in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But last November's elections have brought in several new
senators who may tip the balance in favor of the flag-burning
measure, proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year it looks like the amendment is on the fast track to
consideration and passage,'' said Steve Thomas, a spokesman for the
American Legion, which has lobbied for the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas noted that two Republican senators elected in November,
Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois and George Voinovich of Ohio, are
committed to voting for the amendment. They replaced two Democrats
who had opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has indicated that
he would like to have a vote on the measure before Memorial Day. If
it passes both chambers the amendment would still require
ratification by three-fourths of the states before being added to
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers predict the Senate vote could be close and may be
determined by two Democrats from North Dakota, Kent Conrad and
Byron Dorgan who had voted against the amendment before but now are
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the debate over flag burning has aroused
considerable passion on both sides. Proponents have pointed to the
flag as symbol of the nation's dearest values.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, meanwhile, say the amendment violates the right to
freedom of speech. They have argued that cases of flag burning have
been highly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have appealed to patriotism and brought in American
heroes to make their case.
</P>
<P>
   This week, former Ohio Sen. John Glenn, the astronaut who last
year became the oldest American to go up in space, returned to the
Senate to argue against the flag-burning amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, a Democrat, told the Judiciary Committee that ``it would
be a hollow victory to protect the symbol of our country while
chipping away at the freedom it represents.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. John McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam,
argued for the flag-burning ban and cited the case of a fellow POW
to make his point.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, R-Ariz., related how the prisoner, Mike Christian, was
severely beaten for hiding an American flag, stitched in his shirt,
and pulling it out daily for a secret recitation of the Pledge of
Allegiance. After the beating and destruction of the flag,
Christian stitched another one, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``American blood has been shed all over the world for the
American flag ... and I believe it deserves respect,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican senator, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, said that ban
on flag burning could even stem the cultural ills that led to the
high school shootings in the Denver suburb of Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our cultural problems today, and yes, Littleton,
Colo., fits in that'' are the result of ``lack of respect for
things bigger than ourselves,'' said Hagel. The flag, he said ``is
a symbol in itself of our values.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen.
Patrick Leahy responded that flag burning is not a major problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic is not in danger. There is no crisis of state,
much less a crisis that demands the first-ever cutback on American
civil liberties,'' said the Vermont lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said that the Congressional Research Service had uncovered
only 43 flag incidents in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far more people have testified about flag burning over the
last 10 years than have actually burned a flag,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-word amendment would authorize Congress to prohibit the
physical desecration of the flag, but does not spell out how the
states or federal government would carry out such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   The push to amend the Constitution was prompted by a 1989
Supreme Court decision striking down a flag-burning conviction in
Texas. In that case, Houston resident Gregory Lee Johnson, a member
of the Revolutionary Youth Brigade, was sentenced to year in jail
and fined $2,000 for burning a flag in downtown Dallas during the
1984 Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority in the 5-4 case, Justice William
Brennan wrote, ``we do not consecrate the flag by punishing its
desecration, for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this
cherished emblem represents.''

N.H. LAWMAKERS RELUCTANTLY OK EDUCATION TAX BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Even as one supporter called it ``manure,'' New
Hampshire Thursday finally enacted a measure to fund its public
schools, almost a full month after a court-ordered deadline.
</P>
<P>
   After bringing the state to the brink of fiscal chaos, the New
Hampshire Legislature adopted an $825 million patchwork of taxes
Thursday, which Gov. Jeanne Shaheen immediately signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute action averts a crisis at town halls throughout
the state, allowing local governments to collect taxes, keeping
schools open for business and preventing mass layoffs of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, amid the relief in the capital, there was the strong
sense that the law, the product of many months of bitter debate in
a state where taxes are anathema, was at best a temporary fix.
Virtually every lawmaker found something to hate about it. The
taxes themselves will certainly bring public protest, especially in
the property rich towns that will be hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most immediate threat, though, was the risk that
education advocates will challenge the bill in court. They argue
that $825 million in new money for schools is not enough to provide
an adequate education for all students, and that the money will not
be distributed fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Connair, chairman of the Claremont Lawsuit Coalition, which
initiated the original suit against the state, said a new court
challenge is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is lacking in Concord are things called spine and courage
and leadership - in the House, the Senate and the governor's
chair,'' said Connair.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaheen, who has alienated many Democrats with her refusal
to end the crisis by agreeing to an income tax, greeted the
House-Senate compromise with praise and a call for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all came to this issue from different perspectives and with
different ideas about how best to solve the problem,'' she said.
``We have all been called upon to reach past our differences and
find common ground. With this school funding plan, we together
recognize our responsibility to ensure that every child in New
Hampshire has an excellent education.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Legislature must return to the school funding
issue because of a gaping hole in its plan. While lawmakers used
property taxes, business taxes and other revenue streams to fund
the plan, revenues still fell at least $42 million short. All
agreed that they would have to return to find another way to come
up with the rest of the money.
</P>
<P>
   This state's drama over schools and taxes began 10 years ago
when Connair and the people of Claremont, Allenstown, Franklin,
Lisbon, and Pittsfield went to court to demand relief and protest
what they said were oppressive property tax rates that barely
raised enough cash to properly educate their children.
</P>
<P>
   After years of legal and political wrangling, the state Supreme
Court finally issued an ultimatum: find a new way to fund schools
by April 1. After that date, it would be unconstitutional to
collect the local property taxes that keep the schools going. With
no solution, the schools would close at the end of this academic
year.
</P>
<P>
   For a state whose identity is built in part on the absence of a
broad-based state tax, the choice could not have been more
difficult. Lawmakers were faced with the possibility of breaking
with two centuries of tradition and instituting an income tax or
cobbling together the money some other way. How best to move past
the crisis, and what the solution will mean for the future, have
been the state's all-consuming questions this year.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the pro-income tax forces were dealt a lethal blow as
Shaheen stood by her pledge to never approve an income tax. That
meant lawmakers had to duke it out over other methods of raising
money. Left on the cutting room floor after weeks of negotiations
were state-sponsored video gaming and an entertainment tax on movie
tickets, ski lift tickets and fitness club memberships.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, lawmakers held their noses Thursday and approved the
plan, even as they complained the compromise, with its statewide
property tax, business taxes and cigarette tax increase, was
fraught with problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad bill, but I'm going to vote for it,'' said
Senator Mark D. Fernald, a Democrat from Sharon, in a comment
typical of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Debora B. Pignatelli, the Nashua Democrat, compared the
conference report to manure, saying she has never seen sludge tied
up in such a pretty package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give my very reluctant support to this,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was willing to go along in order to get along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not that desperate at this time,'' said Senator
Edward M. Gordon, a Republican from Bristol, after listening to his
colleagues complain and then promise to vote yes.
</P>
<P>
   And Senator Burton J. Cohen, the Newcastle Democrat, said he was
pleased that the measure would temporarily end the state's crisis.
But he said it is unfair to take away money from some towns in
order to help other towns, and he said the package would not
provide any property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portsmouth is not a wealthy town, yet it is becoming a donor
town,'' Cohen said. ``I don't like going down that path.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the conference report by 16 to 8, then sent
it to the House, which approved it 204 to 154.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers spent the day complaining, their action brought
relief to officials in the towns and cities around the state who
had been left hanging for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they had to go forward, they had no choice,'' said
Rhona Charbonneau, a Hillsborough County Commissioner and Hudson
Selectmen who came to the State House to watch the debate. ``It's
getting late.''
</P>
<P>
   Charbonneau said she had hoped the counties could have received
some of the national tobacco settlement money, which is instead
being used for funding the schools. But she said it was more
important to make sure that teachers don't receive pink lay-off
slips.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Charbonneau was not celebrating. ``Claremont may not be
happy,'' she said, ``and they could sue us once again.''

UNITARIANS, BOY SCOUTS RESOLVE HOMOSEXUALITY DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of sometimes difficult negotiations, the Unitarian
Universalist Association, a liberal denomination with deep roots in
New England, and the Boy Scouts of America have resolved a dispute
over their opposing views of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The church deleted a statement on homosexuality that the Boy
Scouts disagreed with from a denominational publication.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy erupted last May when the Boy Scouts ordered the
Boston-based Unitarian Universalist Association to stop giving out
religious awards to scouts who are Unitarians because the church
promotes gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts was particularly angered by a manual widely
disseminated by the Unitarians called ``Religion in Life'' that
accused national leaders of the Boy Scouts of homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts considers homosexuality immoral and forbids gays
from joining the organization, a position that has been roundly
criticized by human rights groups and several religious
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   To resolve the dispute and allow scouts who are Unitarians to
receive the religious award, Unitarian officials agreed to remove
all language in the manual referring to the Boy Scouts stance on
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   But, unwilling to compromise the denomination's beliefs, church
officials will include a separate statement when it distributes the
manual, making clear that Unitarians strongly disagree with the Boy
Scouts views on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scouts leaders said they were pleased with the church's
willingness to revise its manual.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Deimler, a Boy Scouts official, in a letter to the
Unitarian Universalist Association, said the Boy Scouts of America
``now reauthorizes the awarding of the Religion in Life emblem.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious award emblems are given out by many denominations to
Boy Scouts who are members of their faiths. While these emblems are
not the well-known merit badges scouts earn for mastering specific
tasks, they can still be worn on scout uniforms as badges of honor.
Hundreds of Unitarian religious awards to Boy Scouts are given out
every year, church officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Religious Boy Scouts awards have been given out for decades by
several denominations, including the Roman Catholic Church,
Protestant and Jewish congregations and Muslim groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts exclusion of gays from its organization has
caused clashes with liberal religious congregations because in many
communities Scout troops are headquartered in churches, temples and
mosques.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter mailed this week to Unitarians, John A. Buehrens,
president of the 250,000-member denomination, said he was happy
with the resolution but did not temper his criticism of the Boy
Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still not clear to me that the Boy Scouts of America can
be redirected from patterns that in the long run will be
institutionally self-destructive,'' Buehrens wrote. ``I am very
pleased, however, that we have been able to resolve any implication
that they wish to practice an added discrimination toward Unitarian
Universalists simply because we support the belief that it is not
homosexuality but homophobia which is the sin.''

US WAGE INCREASES SLOW IN FIRST QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American workers' wages during the first quarter rose at their
slowest pace since the US Labor Department began keeping track of
them 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh evidence of low inflation means there is little
pressure on the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates in the near
future, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new data may be an aberration, economists were
surprised by such weakness in the government's index of wage and
benefit costs for employers at a time when unemployment is at its
lowest since Richard M. Nixon was president. The jobless rate was
4.2 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, low unemployment puts workers' skills in greater
demand, giving employees more leverage to negotiate pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what is puzzling all of us,'' said Suzanne Rizzo, an
economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The employment-cost index _ a broad measure of wage, salary and
benefit costs for employers _ edged up 0.4 percent from January
through March. That is less than half the quarterly increases over
the past two years, which ranged from 0.7 to 1.0 percent each
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, during strong periods of economic growth, ``wage
pressures, particularly with the tight labor market, will tend to
increase,'' explained Walter Marshall, senior economist for the
department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. ``That has not actually
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, economists said, there is good reason wages haven't
risen: workers' buying power has not been eroded by inflation, so
pressure to raise wages hasn't been as strong as might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer price index rose less than 2 percent over the past
year, as competition from low-cost, imported goods makes it
difficult for US producers to raise their prices.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the employment cost index rose 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wages were among several pieces of new data released Thursday by
the federal government that indicate economic expansion, well into
its eighth year, is in fine form.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported new single-family home sales
rose 2.1 percent in March, reversing a 2 percent decline in April.
And initial claims for jobless benefits fell a larger-than-expected
20,000 last week, after declining by 5,000 in the prior week.
</P>
<P>
   A breakdown of the government's report on employment costs
showed wages and salaries increased 0.5 percent in the first
quarter. The cost of benefits rose 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wages and salaries have been doing well,'' said Ezra
Greenberg, a senior US economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI of
Lexington, Mass. He said yearly wages and salaries, adjusted for
inflation, are at a record $29,570 average per worker and have been
setting records since mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story about why compensation costs haven't increased,'' he
said, ``has a lot to do with benefit costs staying in line and also
a lot of competition that is not allowing'' companies to pass price
increases to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The wage index's low level was also driven by declines in three
industries: wholesale trade, financial services and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefit to consumers and workers of low inflation may be
running its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are ahead,'' said Rizzo. And with employers struggling
to fill many positions, getting a job is much easier these days.
``Workers are in a seller's market.''
</P>
<P>
   But she noted that inflation has crept up. After bottoming out
in 1998 at 1.4 percent annually, it is now running at about 1.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   As rising prices for oil and gas work their way into the costs
of goods, inflation is expected to exceed 2 percent by the end of
this year, Rizzo said.

 &HT;    HOUSE VOTES ON WAR LEAVE BOTH SIDES DISSATISFIED
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the day after the House of Representatives
deadlocked on the air war in the Balkans, all sides were attempting
to make the best of the muddled outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Clinton administration pledged Thursday that the
213-213 vote on the air war would not effect their determination in
conducting the bombing campaign, now in its fifth week.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders blamed Republicans for stirring up opposition
to the president and charged that the GOP with failing to support
U.S. forces making daily bombing runs over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pointed to the 26 Democrats who voted against the
air war. And in yet one more mixed signal, the Republican-led House
Appropriations Committee approved $12.9 billion in emergency
funding, twice as much as the president sought, for the air war
that the House on Wednesday had refused to support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this was a clear message in any way, shape, or
form,'' said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, brushing off
the series of votes that included a requirement that President
Clinton obtain authorization from Congress before using ground
troops against Yugoslavia. In another vote, the House refused to
order him to bring U.S. forces home.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the public supports the campaign -- although he
added he knew of no White House polls on the subject -- Lockhart
said, ``We're going to continue to persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin poked fun at the
lawmakers to-ing and fro-ing. ``As far as I can tell, they chose
not to put themselves in first gear, not to put themselves in
second gear, nor would they agree on putting themselves in
reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin added that with the House ``idling in neutral with such a
</P>
<P>
   muddled message'' that he was ``confident'' that Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic would take no comfort from it.
</P>
<P>
   Only Defense Secretary William Cohen expressed some concern,
calling the lack of full support from the House
``counterproductive'' as he was reaffirming that the war would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the failure to back the air war surprised even
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who had voted to support it. He
blamed the president's failure to explain his position to Congress,
a theme the speaker has frequently voiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it behooves the president to come to the Congress and
lay out what his plan is, why we are there, and what his plan is,
and what our end game on this thing is,'' he said Thursday,
pointing to doubts within both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders turned the blame on Republicans, charging
that some sought to embarrass the president for political reasons.
House Minority leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri blamed
``right-wing extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a sharp response from House Majority Whip Tom
Delay, R-Texas, a passionate foe of the air war. Delay denied he
had attempted to make partisan gains from the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Delay pointed to the Democrats who voted against the air war.
``I am disappointed that Mr. Gephardt, as a leader of his party,
would call into question the motives of any member of the House,
particularly in the face of such a serious international crisis,''
Delay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be able to influence Republican votes from time to time,
but
</P>
<P>
   unfortunately I do not have the power to produce 26 Democrat
'No' votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those voting ``No'' were some lawmakers who have been
staunch Clinton backers, but who are raising questions about the
military operations in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, explained his vote by saying he
wanted to send a message that ``no president should entangle us in
offensive, non-emergency military operations abroad without prior
approval by the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., who also voted against the air
war, joined two Democratic colleagues in a ``teach-in'' for a
diplomatic solution. ``Our bombing campaign has only resulted in
the displacement of millions of Kosovars and the destruction of
some buildings, but no peace,'' she said Thursday on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats reacted bitterly to the upset votes in the
House. Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., complained that the House was
abandoning the troops. But then, noting that Congress was planning
to pass funding for the Balkan air war that the House has just
repudiated, McDermott said he felt as if he were in Alice's
``Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is getting curiouser and curiouser,'' he said.

BRUINS COUNTING ON YOUNG LEGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Experience or young legs?
</P>
<P>
   Youthful exuberance or veteran wisdom?
</P>
<P>
   It has come down to three games between the Bruins and Carolina
Hurricanes. What will win out? The Hurricanes have players who have
been around _ Ray Sheppard, Kevin Dineen, Paul Coffey, Glen Wesley,
Gary Roberts, Martin Gelinas.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have the youngbloods of the NHL _ Joe Thornton,
Sergei Samsonov, Anson Carter, Jason Allison, Kyle McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   It appears young legs could be the difference in Game 7, and if
that's the case, Boston will have the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Bruins noticed it midway through the third period of
Wednesday's Game 4 on Steve Heinze's goal that gave Boston a 3-1
lead. Thornton won his battle behind the net, Carter then outdueled
center Jeff O'Neill and fired the puck to Heinze, who skated
between two Hurricanes and made a perfect shot into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't see it in the first two games but I think you're
seeing it now, the young legs are starting to come through,'' said
Carter, who sensed the Hurricanes were a little tired late in Game
4. ``When the third period comes around, we're catching our second
wind a little bit. We're trying to take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter and other Bruins believe that, with rare exception, they
have shined the most in the third period. That was certainly true
in the last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because of the mental toughness in this room and also
the tough practices we have,'' said Carter. ``I think we're one of
the best-conditioned teams in the National Hockey League, if not
the best. That's why we play so well in the third period, because
our practices are so tough. Once the games come, it's a breeze, to
tell you the truth, because nothing is like getting skated by
(assistant coaches Jacques Laperriere and Bob Francis).''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are also doing a better job of winning the one-on-one
battles along the boards, an aspect they have lacked at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those parts have been missing sometimes in this series, the
little plays behind the net, the battles in the corners, but we are
starting to wear them down as the series goes on,'' said Carter.
``It showed in those plays behind the net. In Game 1, it was a
little bit tougher to generate scoring chances because they were
playing intense hockey. They were on top of their game and well
rested. As the series goes on, all the crashing and banging they're
doing and we're doing, I think it's taking its toll a little bit on
their hockey club.''
</P>
<P>
   As this series progresses, it's going to come down to which team
can best utilize its most substantial assets. In the case of
Carolina, it's the craftiness and opportunistic nature of players
such as Sheppard. For Boston, it's a matter of having more in the
tank at the end of the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think it'd be the other way around, legs would win Game
1 and experience would win Game 7,'' said Carter. ``During last
year's playoffs, we learned that as the series wore on, the Caps
wore down. They got a couple of lucky breaks in the end and that's
what beat us. We're going to wear teams down. We're going to keep
coming at you, no matter who we're playing against or who's in the
lineup, whether it's Heinzey coming off the bench or Landon Wilson,
who came up from Providence and did a great job for us. Or Mattias
Timander. We're going to keep coming at you.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carter and Allison arrived in Boston, they went from a team
that was fighting for a playoff spot (Washington) to a team that
had long been eliminated from playoff contention. As tense and
difficult as that was, Carter said he learned just how badly he
didn't want to go through it again. Last season, he went through a
different experience when he played in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I'd heard talk about playoffs but you don't really
know until you live it and experience it,'' he said. ``Now we have
the experience to fall back on. I've been through this before, you
know what to expect and when game time comes around, it's time to
execute.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dressing room, there was a palpable difference between
the atmosphere after Game 3, when you could cut the tension and
uncertainty with a knife, and Game 4, where it was still very
business-like but much more lighthearted and confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought this series was going to be a short series,
by any stretch of the imagination,'' said Carter. ``You go down,
2-1, and people start panicking, asking what's wrong with the
Bruins? I think the guys in this locker room know that it was going
to be a long series. But psychologically we're in better spirits
than we were a couple of days ago being down in the series.
(Wednesday's) game breathed a lot of life into our organization and
our team as well. I think we came out and beat them pretty
convincingly. We knew we could score goals against these guys and
there are chinks in their armor. We think we might have put a few
questions in their mind also. We have a lot of character in this
room. We don't panic and it starts at the top (with coach Pat
Burns).''
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 is Friday night in Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Youth or experience? We'll soon know.

that some sought to embarrass the president for political reasons.
House Minority leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri blamed
``right-wing extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a sharp response from House Majority Whip Tom
Delay, R-Texas, a passionate foe of the air war. Delay denied he
had attempted to make partisan gains from the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Delay pointed to the Democrats who voted against the air war.
``I am disappointed that Mr. Gephardt, as a leader of his party,
would call into question the motives of any member of the House,
particularly in the face of such a serious international crisis,''
Delay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be able to influence Republican votes from time to time,
but
</P>
<P>
   unfortunately I do not have the power to produce 26 Democrat
'No' votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those voting ``No'' were some lawmakers who have been
staunch Clinton backers, but who are raising questions about the
military operations in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, explained his vote by saying he
wanted to send a message that ``no president should entangle us in
offensive, non-emergency military operations abroad without prior
approval by the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., who also voted against the air
war, joined two Democratic colleagues in a ``teach-in'' for a
diplomatic solution. ``Our bombing campaign has only resulted in
the displacement of millions of Kosovars and the destruction of
some buildings, but no peace,'' she said Thursday on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats reacted bitterly to the upset votes in the
House. Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., complained that the House was
abandoning the troops. But then, noting that Congress was planning
to pass funding for the Balkan air war that the House has just
repudiated, McDermott said he felt as if he were in Alice's
``Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is getting curiouser and curiouser,'' he said.

PLAYOFFS ARE A WHOLE NEW HOCKEY GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- You want to know what's great about the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to like, but one thing is that you never know
where the intrigue will come from. Suppose, for example, someone
had said to you _ and by you I mean Mr. Casual, not the sort of
person who irons his Neely jersey before heading to the game _ that
the burning question entering Game 5 of this Bruins-Hurricane
series would be, ``Will Landon Wilson be able to play?'' Your first
reaction, I am sure, would be, ``Who the (naughty word) is Landon
Wilson?''
</P>
<P>
   Landon Wilson is a 24-year-old 200-pound right winger whose time
may have come. Either that, or he is the winner of the 1999 Steve
Kuberski Award. Bear with me. Somewhat forgotten now, but very much
the topic du jour in a 1972 Celtics series with the Atlanta Hawks,
was a startling performance by the then-24-year-old, 6-foot-8 inch
forward, who picked that series to play the best basketball he had
ever played, or ever would play.
</P>
<P>
   No one on the Atlanta side spent much time worrying about Steve
Kuberski before that first-round series began. He had averaged 6
points a game during the regular season. So what was he doing
getting 15 points and 13 rebounds in 21 minutes in Game 1, or 19
points in Game 3, or 20 points and 10 rebounds in Game 5, or 22
points in 21 minutes of the series-clinching Game 6?
</P>
<P>
   It remains a mystery to this day.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as it was over, Steve Kuberski went right back to being
Steve Kuberski. He was no factor in the following series against
the Knicks and the most points he averaged during the remainder of
his eight-year NBA career was 5.4 in 1975-76.
</P>
<P>
   But for a little more than a week in 1972 he was Bailey Howell.
Now the question before the Bruins is this: Do we have, in Landon
Wilson, a bruising, effective, rock-'em, sock-'em winger we can
count on to neutralize the likes of Keith Primeau for, oh, the next
10 years, or do we have someone who has been hit with a classic
case of Playoff Mania, and who will go back to being a skating
Steve Kuberski as soon as this series with Carolina is over?
</P>
<P>
   The future is the future, however. For Landon Wilson did not get
out of Tuesday night's Game 4 of this very even confrontation with
the expatriate Hartford Whalers unscathed. Just when he was
developing a true cult following in the aftermath of both a
ferocious open-ice hit on the menacing Mr. Primeau and a key goal,
he was sent to the bench in great pain, having sustained a hit to
his left shoulder, coutesy of one Steven Halko, and will be
sidelined for at least the rest of the series. It is safe to say
that Landon Wilson will be missed, and isn't that interesting to
say about a guy who spent most of the season in Providence and who
didn't join the big club to stay until March 4? In a
tight-checking, close-cornered series he has given the Bruins their
most prominent physical presence. ``He's been matching their hits
with his size,'' says goalie Byron Dafoe. Wilson is playing the way
his backers have always thought he would, or, at least, could. If
the Bruins gone on to lose this series, his absence would be cited
as a determining factor. It's all so very playoffy.
</P>
<P>
   And let me assure you that it is the playoffs. There is even
life in the Fleet, and how about that?
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burns, a noted hard marker, has gone on record as being very
impressed with the crowd support of late, and the players certainly
agree. ``They were phenomenal tonight,'' Dafoe was saying after
Game 4. ``I'm glad we gave them a reason to be good. This was my
first win here in the playoffs. But it was really nice for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was beaten by a nice Martin Gelinas-Ray Sheppard open- ice
collaboration less than five minutes into the game, but that was it
for the evening. ``I always like to think I'm intense when I'm out
there,'' he explained, ``but my intensity level went up a notch out
there. I was following the play at the other end very closely. I
just felt that after I let that one in, that would be it. When the
playoffs come, you just have to be physically and mentally prepared
for the whole 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is happier to be watching playoff hockey than Harry
Sinden. ``I love the playoffs because they're fair,'' he maintains.
``You don't have travel discrepancies. You don't have situations
where you're secure in a playoff spot and the other team is
fighting for its life. Everything is equal. So it often comes down
to superior coaching. Good coaching is very important in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling in the parenthesis here, Harry was clearly trying to lay
a little praise on his coach, who has been dealt a hand that is
heavy on youth. Burns had 12 players 25 or younger among the 18
non-goalies he threw out there against the Hurricanes, and some of
his kids came up very big indeed. It was a nice blend, in fact,
with guys like Don Sweeney and Steve Heinze teaming up with the
likes of Jason Allison, Joe Thornton, and Anson Carter to produce
goals. Throw in the crowd-pleasing empty-netter by veteran Rob
DiMaio, and it turned out to be a very pleasant evening for the
Black and Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's the playoffs, all right, which is why you can't avoid
hearing things like, ``It's a three-game series now,'' or ``it
doesn't matter where the games are played,'' and assorted hockey
chestnuts. There is talk about the Bruins now having the momentum
(which will disappear as soon as Carolina gets up, 1-0, Friday
night) and, of course, there will be talk about the need for the
goaltenders to come up big.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs it's not just about the stars, but about the
star-crossed. From a guy lucky to be in the lineup for Game 1,
Landon Wilson has gone to being a major factor whose absence will
be a key part of the dialogue. We shouldn't be surprised. The
playoffs always come with a new script.

   ELIMINATE: FILMMAKERS-SCHOOLS, CALIGULA-FILM and
HUGH-GRANT-FILMS.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE stories &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   METROPOLITAN-OPERA (subslug) (New York) _ There is no other
company like it, and yet the Metropolitan Opera may end up a model
for the future. In the season just closed and the one to come, the
Met continues a practice of self-sufficiency and free enterprise
that is largely unfamiliar to the international opera world. But
now we see the free-spending ways of government-subsidized opera
houses being strenuously curbed. Indeed, the adventurous, the
innovative and sometimes the reckless are no longer automatically
underwritten by generous European ministries of culture. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MASTERPIECES-VIDEO (Undated) _ ``Making Masterpieces'' video
takes you into the conservation lab of the National Gallery in
London and shows you how artists achieve their special effects. By
Deborah Solomon. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FLOCKHART-FILM (Los Angeles) _ There were those in the team of
British hair and makeup experts hired to give her the fairy-tale
makeover for Michael Hoffman's adaptation of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' who expected nothing good from Calista Flockhart. And they
told her so. Cast as the lovesick Helena, the television star was
going to pop over from America and proceed to be finicky, imperious
and exasperatingly unaware of just how horribly she was mangling
the Bard's words. Hoffman's version of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' which opens May 14, is contemporary in spirit while being
conscientious about theme, text and Elizabethan diction. By Margy
Rochlin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   STAR-WARS-FILM (subslug) (Hollywood) _ Surveying the
summer-movie landscape, Universal studios had at first intended to
open its high-profile romance ``Notting Hill,'' starring Julia
Roberts and Hugh Grant, a month after the release, on May 19, of
George Lucas's ``Star Wars: Episode One _ The Phantom Menace,'' one
of the most anticipated films in years. But then Universal
executives sat down, took a second look and decided on a more
innovative, if riskier, plan: move ``Notting Hill,'' which is about
a Hollywood star and a British bookshop owner who fall in love,
right into the eye of the storm. Now, it will open only one week
after the new ``Star Wars,'' when frenzy over the science-fiction
film is likely to be at a peak. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-SELL (Undated) _ How quaint to recall the days when
doubting a movie's honesty meant wondering whether its hero was
standing on a box. Now there are more important things to question:
whether the box is virtual or real, and whether it contains
anything that the film might want to sell. With the growing
prevalence of the many-tentacled corporate concept known as
vertical integration, we've seen ever more ingenious ways to
undermine what appears on screen. Would-be hits on the summer
horizon offer an invitation to visit the Web site, buy the toys,
wear the T-shirt, hear the soundtrack and play the video game. Oh,
if there's time left over, see the movie too. By Janet Maslin.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILMS-TOYS (Undated) _ The products that spin off from films
serve the same function in our pop cosmogony as religious relics
did in medieval times: They're little bits of the immaterial (too
often literally, alas) made material. That may sound specious: The
toe-joint of a saint is not the same as a Klingon-English
dictionary. On the other hand, have you ever been to a ``Star
Trek'' convention?. By Ty Burr. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN-POWERS-II-FILM (Undated) _ When ``Austin Powers,
International Man of Mystery'' became a surprise hit back in May
1997, the executives at Time Warner did more than just congratulate
the folks at their subsidiary, New Line Cinema. They got to work.
For them, the spoof, starring Mike Myers as a foppish secret agent
cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out in the present,
had more than just laughs and an obvious sequel going for it
(``Austin Powers II: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' opens on June 11).
With its goofy characters, accessible irony and catch phrases like
``Shag-a-delic, baby,'' it provided an opportunity to demonstrate
the raison d'etre of the modern entertainment conglomerate:
``synergy.'' By Nancy Hass. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DEEP-BLUE-SEA-FILM (Hollywood) _ For ``Deep Blue Sea,'' the film
director Renny Harlin has assembled more than 300 tracks of
recorded sounds, so that an essentially noiseless sea creature can
chew through metal and flesh _ and, with any luck, the summer box
office after the film's July 30 release _ in deafening Dolby
digital. By Bruce Newman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SEQUELS (Undated) _ The days of the sequel are numbered. Or
rather, Roman numeraled. ``Lethal Weapon,'' the Mel Gibson vehicle
that went from zero to IV in 11 years, will have no '99 model.
Rocky Balboa's five-bout film career ended in 1990, after a savage
critical beating that left him, and moviegoers, with collateral
brain damage. Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose most famous film line
is, ``I'll be back,'' won't be: The Terminator's term limit was
two. Thank goodness, because the sequel and prequel have become
cinematic Nyquil, putting audiences to sleep with their metronomic
monotony. By Franz Lidz and Steve Rushin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EURO-SUMMER-FILMS (Paris) _ The wedding lasted from late one
August afternoon through daybreak. At a long table beneath the
shady trees in Normandy, three generations toasted the newlyweds
with homemade Calvados and unlabeled champagne from the in-laws'
vineyards. The table was artfully strewn with fruit and flowers.
Chickens plucked the meadow grass; children feasted on peaches
nearly burst with sweetness. I danced with a queue of expectant boy
cousins under the 3 a.m. stars. Somewhere in the midst of all that,
I stole away inside myself and thought: I feel like I'm in a movie.
For in my New England childhood, long before it was possible to
make such romantic pilgrimages in person, European cinema had
taught me how to dream of a European summer. By Kristin Hohenadel.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENT-FILMS (Undated) _ Production of independent films in
the United States is at an all-time high (about 1,000 starts a
year), and there is an expanding market for them on television,
with the success of cable networks like the Independent Film
Channel, and on the ever-burgeoning festival circuit. But within
the entertainment business, the consensus suddenly seems to be
that, documentaries aside, powerful, innovative independent films
are thin, and that it has been a while since anything has measured
up to the likes of ``Stranger Than Paradise,'' ``She's Gotta Have
It,'' ``Blood Simple,'' ``Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' ``Reservoir
Dogs'' or ``Safe,'' to name some of the high points of the
movement. By Graham Fuller. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JASPERSE-DANCE (Undated) _ If Albert Camus had made dances
instead of writing fiction, they might have looked like the work of
the choreographer John Jasperse. The final image of Jasperse's
``Waving to You From Here,'' which was performed at Dance Theater
Workshop in Manhattan two years ago, still haunts with its
depiction of despair. Jasperse's new work, ``Madison as I Imagine
It,'' a 55-minute abstract dance for four people _ Miguel
Guitierrez, Parker Lutz, Juliette Mapp (who is from Madison, Wis.)
and Jasperse _ with music by Hahn Rowe, received its world premiere
two weeks ago at the Spring Dance Festival in Utrecht, the
Netherlands. Beginning Thursday, the John Jasperse Company will
present it in eight performances at Dance Theater Workshop in
Manhattan, through May 16. By William Harris. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PICKER-MUSIC (Undated) _ It was a signal moment in the rebirth
of tonality. When the curtain rose on Tobias Picker's first opera,
``Emmeline,'' in 1996, the orchestra conjured an atmosphere of grim
foreboding, circling endlessly around a single, brooding chord. As
if to emphasize his immersion in the dark realm of B flat minor,
Picker, 45, prefaced the score with a device long scorned by
modernists: a key signature. Picker's embrace of tonality, though
particularly unambiguous, is hardly unique. Today, it seems, every
composer is eager to be portrayed as a lapsed modernist, newly
liberated from the shackles of Serialism. On Friday evening, the
Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York offers the
premiere of Picker's Cello Suite, performed by the cellist Lynn
Harrell and the pianist Anne-Marie McDermott at Alice Tully Hall.

</P>
<P>
   REVUELTAS-MUSIC (Undated) _ In the calendar of saints, the last
day of the year belongs to St. Sylvester, and it was on that day in
the last year of the 1800s that the Mexican composer Silvestre
Revueltas was born. Now, several months before his centenary, Sony
Classical has released an exhilarating Revueltas album, with
Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its
New Music Group, and other new releases round out the picture. By
Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JUNKYARD-SCULPTOR (New York) _ Ms. Nancy Rubins, 46, a sculptor
who creates monumental works out of oversize junkyard debris is in
the Rolodex of certain suppliers of airplane parts. They call her
when something special comes in, like a dismembered fuselage, a
severed wing or a battered engine. For her show that opened
Saturday at the Paul Kasmin Gallery, Ms. Rubins has created an
extravagant aluminum-and-stainless-steel sculpture out of a few
thousand pounds of colorful airplane parts, as well as 600 pounds
of wire. By Elizabeth Hayt. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MATRIX-FILM-ARCH (Undated) _ Despite fortune cookie dialogue and
a dubious Nietschean subtext, ``The Matrix'' is a film that
deserves to be a classic. It will certainly become one for those
who value the power of sci-fi movies to crystallize moments of
urban sensibility. ``Metropolis,'' ``Alphaville,'' ``The Tenth
Victim'' and ``Blade Runner'' are also classics of this genre. By
Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SCULPTURE-FURNITURE (New York) _ The Public Art Fund, a
nonprofit organization that supports projects around New York, is
backing an independent curator Amy Wolf's, ``Comfort Zone:
Furniture by Artists,'' an engaging exhibition of sculpture that is
also furniture. The show remains on view at PaineWebber building
through June 25. The exhibit includes pieces designed by 36 artists
over the last 60 years. By Paula Dietz. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TOP-40-RADIO (Los Angeles) _ ``American Top 40 With Casey
Kasem'' has been on the air, under slightly different titles but
with virtually the same format, for nearly 29 years. Currently, the
four-hour-long show, heard in most markets on Saturday or Sunday
morning, is broadcast on more than 350 stations nationwide and
heard at any one point in his show by an audience that averages
approximately 1.1 million listeners over age 12. By Andy Meisler.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the gunshots rang out during fifth period at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo., on April 20, students there were
busy with the everyday life of American teen-agers. Now, after a
massacre that took 15 lives, including those of the two classmates
who were the gunmen, they wonder where they and their school go on
from here.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, the mass shooting again raised questions
about teen-agers and the often violent popular culture they are
immersed in. What did the assault by the students, Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold, say about growing up today, about the pressures of
high school, about the fragility of teen-age identity? Did it say
anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to find answers, The New York Times invited eight
Columbine students, four young women and four young men, ranging
from freshman to senior, athletes to debate-team members, to talk
about the violence in their school and how it has changed the way
they look at the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their nearly two-hour discussion touched on cliques, guns, race,
music, video games and fashion _ and the terrible nightmares that
now keep them from sleeping. The main themes have been distilled
from a long transcript for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Tell us about the trench coat mafia.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. Last year the trench coat mafia consisted of 15 to 20
people. They were a group of kids who maybe played Magic, that card
game, and went out and smoked together. That's all it was. And,
yes, they happened to wear black trench coats. They called
themselves the trench coat mafia.
</P>
<P>
   It fell apart because half those people graduated last year. You
hear all this talk, about the trench coat mafia, whatever _ Dylan
and Eric weren't even a part of that, first off. I just want
everybody to know the trench coat mafia is just another name, just
another way to place blame. Because those people who were in the
trench coat mafia or whatever, aren't even part of it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   That picture in the yearbook, I don't know a single person in
that picture who still considers themselves a part of the trench
coat mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We've heard a lot about social cliques in Columbine. How
powerful are they?
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. I don't think the cliques were really that intense. Lots
and lots of people knew people from both groups. A lot of people
are from both sides of the gun. I mean, they were friends with the
trench coat mafia and then they were friends with the, you know,
the jocks or whatever you want to call them.
</P>
<P>
   JENI. I don't think it was really cliques. It's more like groups
of friends. I was talking a couple months back with the class
president, Heather, and we were saying how much it's changed since
eighth grade, where you had the distinct groups. Once you're a
senior, you know, everyone is just _ we thought everyone was
friends.
</P>
<P>
   I guess we weren't, but _ It was more like groups of friends,
not, you know, we don't talk to them and we're going to raise our
noses at them.
</P>
<P>
   NICK. I think our school is such a great place. If you played a
sport, or whatever you did, it was such a great place to go. And I
don't think we should be remembered for what happened that day, but
for how great we were. I want my brother to go to school there,
wrestle there, and graduate from Columbine. It's just such a great
school that it can't end in such a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do sports affect social groupings?
</P>
<P>
   NICK. It wasn't like just the jocks hung out with the jocks, to
me. I hung out with everybody. And I wasn't mean to people who
didn't play a sport. I didn't think any less of somebody who
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did some athletes?
</P>
<P>
   NICK. Yeah, there were some.
</P>
<P>
   JENI. It was a lot worse last year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In what ways?
</P>
<P>
   JENI. Just with big jocks picking on little jocks, or big jocks
picking on, you know, skaters. I thought they were a lot more
vicious last year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would they do?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. Just their attitudes. I think their attitudes were just
full of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who are you talking about? What groups?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. Football players, mostly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Nick, you're a wrestler. What's it like to be an athlete at
Columbine?
</P>
<P>
   NICK. On the day before a meet, we wear our warm-ups, and we
wear them with pride. It just feels so good to walk around knowing
that you're wearing a warm-up that says Columbine Rebels. It's just
the impact of being a part of the school in whatever you do. It's a
great thing.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I think you've got maybe a little more respect if you
played sports, or people look at you differently.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do people treat athletes?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. You don't ever get bad looks or anything.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. I think the other reason that they're sometimes treated
with more respect is because there's a whole lot of school spirit
at Columbine. People really stand up for their teams, and the
athletes are the ones that actually perform the tasks and, you
know, give the school some of its pride. They're the ones that
people are cheering for at football games, or at meets. They're the
ones that give the school a sense of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. I'm on the Columbine Forensics Teach, Speech and Debate.
We have some people who play football on our team, some people who
are cheerleaders. But we have a problem with the athletes
sometimes. At the prom assembly, when our national qualifiers went
up and our state champion went up, there was booing. And I looked
over and they were wearing football shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It's really sad that that happens because I respect people who
wrestle and play football, because I could never even do that. I am
not that athletic, and I have total respect for people like that
because they've made this great accomplishment. And it's so sad
that academics are so low on our ranking, because it's something
else to be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I mean, we had three national qualifiers and a state champion
come out of our school for forensics this year. That's never been
before.
</P>
<P>
   There needs to be school spirit for everything because there are
more competitions than sports. There's debate, speech, there's
business. Our school spirit needs to be more universal.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I just had a question that I've been thinking about.
What are considered jocks? Because there is so many sports in our
school.
</P>
<P>
   NICK. I think every time I hear somebody call somebody a jock, I
think it's the same as them calling me, like, an (expletive) or
something like that. Because every time somebody calls somebody a
jock it's in that kind of tone. You know, it's like, hey jock.
</P>
<P>
   MEG. Jock is a kind of slang down term, like some people will
call other people freaks because their hair is different. That's
probably what caused all this, just silly name calling.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where did Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fit in?
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. Dylan Klebold was one of my best friends. And when I hung
out with him, there was just something that happened. I mean,
whether they were wearing jeans and a T-shirt, or whether they were
wearing their black trench coats, people would give them looks.
Just like, ``You don't belong here, would you leave?''
</P>
<P>
   Let's block out last week when I say this _ they hadn't done
anything physically wrong to people. I mean, they dressed
different. So? They wore black. So what? It's just, they were hated
and so they felt they hated back. They hated back.
</P>
<P>
   MEG. They'd call them freaks, weirdos, faggots. It was just
stupid name calling, acting like little children. It's like my
cousins come home, they're only 2 and 3, and they come home and
start calling me names, calling each other names like butt-head and
all these other things. They probably couldn't handle it.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. People called them fags. People thought they were gay.
And that's not right. I mean, even if they were _ and which,
they're not _ it's not right to say that.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. When they call them fag, I think it's a slang term for,
like, loser. I don't think they really meant that. They were like
nerds.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. I believe these guys could have been taunted pretty
easily, because there are many different people in our school that
do this. But I want to speak not as a jock or an athlete, but for
them, in saying that these are not the only type of people who
should be targeted. It's just natural at any high school that
you're going to have different cliques and people who share
different interests.
</P>
<P>
   I can see how these guys could have easily caught a lot of, not
always physical abuse, but just verbal _ you know, someone
happening to walk by in the hall and saying, ``Hey buddy, nice
lipstick,'' just small things that I think really built up over
time. But it wasn't just one group or person in particular.
</P>
<P>
   MEG. I have a friend, he doesn't dress like everybody else. He
wears heavy metal band T-shirts, black shorts no matter what the
weather, and a black hat, and he has long hair. And friends who
normally just come up to me and talk to me and are so nice to me _
when I'm around him, they give me looks. And people come up to me
after I talk to him, they're like, ``How can you talk to him? How
can you even acknowledge his presence?' I'm like, ``It's simple,
he's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the same with Eric and Dylan. I knew both of them. I
went bowling with them occasionally. And they were extremely nice.
They never showed any signs that they'd like to go off and hurt
people.
</P>
<P>
   NICK. I don't think there's a lot of stereotyping. If I saw Eric
walk by, I'd ignore him, I wouldn't go talk to him, because what
would we talk about? We have no interests that are the same. I
don't think he wants to go in the wrestling room and practice
wrestling with me.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I was just thinking. Everyone says we stereotype them.
But I think they stereotype themselves, too. Because I had both in
class with me, and they would not talk to anyone. They would just _
they acted like they had no sirit at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Adults have a lot of concern about violent computer games and
music with violent or macabre lyrics. Is this a large part of
teen-age life today?
</P>
<P>
   MEG. I've played the game Doom that they're saying Dylan and
Eric constantly played. And I don't think it was that game. I'd go
to school and there were people that would so royally piss me off,
and I'd just go home and I'd sit on that game for hours, just
taking out my stress on it. And the next day I'd be perfectly fine.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way I get rid of my stress, instead of going out and
really killing people. It saves a lot of time. I know this sounds
weird, but some violent games are a therapy for kids.
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA. I think that works for some people. But for someone who
gets teased and ridiculed and gets angry every day at people and
then actually has things going through their mind like that _ I
think Marilyn Manson and games like that do influence them. I think
it builds up even more.
</P>
<P>
   And they wore black. I'm not saying that's bad, or stupid, I'm
just saying that it is a very depressing color that they wore every
day. And that sort of reflects on their attitudes toward things,
wearing black every day, or listening to Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the appeal of Marilyn Manson?
</P>
<P>
   NICK. Insane. Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA. Insanity, yeah. Craziness.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. OK, they listened to Marilyn Manson, but not like some
people. They listened to him every once in a while. I don't know
the appeal of him because I've never heard an entire song. They
listened to Nine Inch Nails. They listened to Rammstein.
</P>
<P>
   They listened to Rammstein and Nine Inch Nails and KMFDM because
of the beats. Because Dylan wanted to be a drummer. He didn't even
know what they were saying in Rammstein. He doesn't speak German.
He just liked the beat of the song. KMFDM is just as horrid, all
the messages are bad, but I like them because of the electric
guitar. I think that their songs sound kind of cool.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And Nine Inch Nails are some completely creepy songs, but the
beats. The same with Dr. Octagon, D.J. Spookie, all those techno
bands. They've got these beats to them.
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA. They may have listened to them for the beats, but after
someone listens to that crap over and over and over for the beats,
they do hear the lyrics and it is in their subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do the guys here think?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I have most of those CDs that they're talking about. It
doesn't bother me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do you like them?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I don't really agree with the words that they're saying.
But when I'm listening to it, I can turn it up real loud and get
out aggression while I'm, like, driving. And, I like the beats,
like you said. The beats are cool. But it's not making me psycho
listening.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD. Everybody takes it differently, and you can make it
into things that it's not. Like people blame music and video games
and all these outside influences as scapegoats. And all the people
on, like, ``Dateline'' that are doing this, they're like 50 years
old. They don't know that stuff. They don't know what we're talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. Violence has become so easy to accept for children of
this day and age that I don't think seeing someone die on a video
game or seeing people murdered on TV plays much of a role at all.
We've become so senseless to it that I don't think it really
affects anything. So by trying to edit video games, or trying to
correct songs, or prevent certain movies from coming out, I don't
think that's going to change the youth of America or how they
perceive life or violence in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do young people view guns?
</P>
<P>
   MEG. I am utterly afraid of guns. When I heard somebody had a
gun, I was fine, but then I had to jump over the pit fence and I
couldn't make it. My arms just went totally wobbly. And then I
found out he was shooting people. I broke down into tears, a mass
of tears. I couldn't find my best friend. And this was all over
guns. I just really hate them.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I have all my guns in my room in a case. I have bullets
and everything in my room.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How many guns do you have?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. How many? Probably six or seven. I could run around and
start shooting people easily. But it's morals. You just know right
from wrong. My parents have trained me with guns and everything and
my sister.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does anyone else have guns in the house?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. We have guns at our house. A lot of times it's owned by
the parents for protection. But I have a lot of friends who, like
Dustin said, have literally an arsenal of shotguns and high-powered
rifles at their house. But he's right, it is about morals and when
they are used. About having self-control.
</P>
<P>
   Q. All of these shootings have occurred at overwhelmingly white
middle-class schools. What do you make of that?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. Nothing in particular. Columbine is definitely white. I
would say of the around 2,000 kids, there are at most 200 black
kids. I'm not sure if I'm right on that.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL COMMENTS. Not that many. I think there's 20. I think
there's like 6.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. That's why I'm saying I'm not positive. But there was a
lot of speculation when it first went off that it was actually
black students that came into the school and that were shooting
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Right immediately after everyone had run out of the building and
were saying, ``What the heck are we running from?'' people were
saying, ``I don't know, I just saw some black guy in a trench coat
shooting people.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why people were making the assumption that they
were black. But, otherwise at Columbine there is generally not much
prejudice or racism, aside from prejudice against different groups
and classes.
</P>
<P>
   MEG. I am black/white mixed. And when the media is coming up
with this thing that Dylan and Eric were racist, they weren't. They
were my friends. They were very nice to me, both of them. I don't
get this whole racial thing that people are coming up with.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. Dylan and Eric did use racial slurs. Because,
unfortunately, it's becoming common. And what I have heard is they
did call Isaiah an N before they shot him. I don't think it meant
that they were racist. I think that they were just using the word
that they _ unfortunately it's true that it has bearing from the
movies and TV _ that they had learned is OK.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the Nazi stuff?
</P>
<P>
   MEG. That is the biggest load of (expletive) I've ever heard in
my entire life. OK? They never wore swastikas around their arm.
Never. Not in this entire year that I've known them. I've known
them all year. No.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. I saw some kids in the hallway, one kid who had a
swastika on his arm, and I told Dylan, and he got upset. He was
like, what's their problem? They're not Nazis. They didn't worship
Nazis. Some kid said, ``Oh I saw them reading a book on Nazis.''
They read books on Nazis because, guess what they were learning
about in World History? They were learning about the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. Everyone said that they saluted to Hitler after a strike
in bowling and stuff. That wasn't true. If they got a strike, they
would just sit down.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The police said Eric's diary was full of Nazi references.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. If Dylan and Eric were like neo-Nazis or whatever, then
they kept it secret. They didn't proclaim it. And I don't think
Dylan was. Like I said, I didn't know Eric very well, and from my
experience, maybe he was. Maybe that was what he wrote in his
diary. But that was private. And that's why it's in his diary,
because it was private.
</P>
<P>
   NICK. I don't think that it was a big racial thing. I mean, you
see who they shot at.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is this going to happen in another high school?
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA. I think that it could happen anywhere. But I think it
will happen more. Because, you know, these guys had the courage to
do it and so I think there will be followers who will try it, too,
or copycats or whatever. And I am like Rich, I am scared to death
to go to school. And I don't _ I don't know if I'll ever be able to
go back to Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do the rest of you think about going back?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. I feel that I'm obligated to go back. I can see for
other people who actually had to witness others die, it's
understandable that that's probably way too traumatic for them to
go back, to walk through the halls or anything. I can understand
that. But I feel like if they were to split up Columbine, or build
a new school, then Dylan and Eric would have essentially
accomplished their task in breaking up the school and, you know,
breaking up the community.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's going to be tough the first week, or even month, to
walk through the halls without remembering what went on. But I
think that this school is strong enough and that it's going to be
10 times as good if kids actually stick together and just fight it
out.
</P>
<P>
   NICK. I agree. I want my brother to go back. And I want the
students to go back and still compete in whatever they're doing.
Because if we don't, then it's going to make me feel like they won.
But, it's much greater than that. There's so much love in that
school.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How are you all doing?
</P>
<P>
   MEG. I was in a drawing class. I saw my friend Lance. He was
shot. My teacher would constantly tell him to sit down, sit down,
Lance. He was always standing up, walking around talking to
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night I got maybe an hour of sleep, but I had a
dream. I was walking into my drawing class and there was Lance. It
was just me, Lance and the teacher. And the teacher tells him, ``Go
sit down, Lance.'' And he goes over to his desk, sits down, and
blows up. And then I see Dylan and Eric laughing.
</P>
<P>
   I have never had a worse dream. It's been recurring for the past
week. And I just can't get rid of it. Because I've known Lance
since middle school. And I've also known Dylan and Eric all year.
I'm literally torn between them. Because I want to go see Lance,
but I want to go see Eric and Dylan. But I can't go see Eric and
Dylan. And I can't go see Lance. So I don't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is anyone else having nightmares?
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA. I haven't had nightmares, but I've hardly been able to
sleep in my room. It's in the basement. And I haven't been able to
sleep down there. I've had to sleep on the couch in the living room
because I can't go down there at night.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I usually just hang out with my friends. We stay up
until we pretty much pass out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you do that before?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. No, that's how I do it now. We just hang out with our
friends until we pretty much cannot stay awake any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Because?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I just don't feel like sleeping and getting nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anything else you want to say?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. As many times as I've heard it from parents, or
counselors, or whoever else, I've never realized as strong as I
have now that material possessions really don't mean anything to me
anymore. That really the most important thing that you can have in
the world is family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD. I'm just proud to see the community pull together this
spiritually. If we could just stay that way, this will never happen
again. We just need to see that people are people.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. I have one more thing to add. Just three simple words,
and we've heard it a lot and it's true. We are Columbine!
</P>
<P>
   NICK. We will always be Columbine!
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. Columbine forever!

   ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ Despite declining unemployment and a
shortage of workers in some industries, wage and benefit increases
slowed markedly in the first three months of the year, the
government reported Thursday. The employment cost index, the
government's measure for tracking changes in compensation costs,
rose 0.4 percent in the first quarter, the smallest increase on
record. The small rise was about half of what economists had
expected and is the strongest sign yet that inflationary pressures
remain muted. By Richard W. Stevenson. With graphic.

WALL STREET PASSES YEAR 2000 TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street firms and exchanges completed extensive
mock trading of stocks, bonds and other securities simulating the
end of December and the start of next year with almost no
interruptions from Year 2000 computer problems, according to a
summary of the results released Thursday by the Securities Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The tests measured nearly 260,000 steps in thousands of
transactions, with the 400 participating firms encountering
slightly more than 50 failures to handle Year 2000 dates correctly,
the trade group said. The glitches were fixed quickly enough for
the trades they affected to be completed on schedule, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the results were in line with progress reports the
group had been issuing since the tests began. The test was the
biggest scheduled by the $300 billion industry, which has widely
been viewed as a leader in addressing Year 2000 concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials emphasized that many more limited tests
remain on the agenda, starting Saturday with a test of Wall
Street's links with market data suppliers like Reuters and
Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also continues to worry about the potential impact
of problems in foreign markets and about contingency plans to deal
with unexpected problems at home or abroad.

ISRAELI POLICE SAID TO URGE INDICTMENT OF SHARON FOR BRIBERY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli radio and television reported Thursday night
that police have recommended to the state attorney that Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon be indicted on charges of fraud, bribery and
witness-tampering.
</P>
<P>
   But the police would not comment, and the status of the case was
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's lawyer denied the report, saying police had merely
completed their investigation and turned a case file over to the
state attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not implying he is clear,'' the lawyer, Jacob Weinroth,
said in an interview. ``And I'm not telling you it was a positive
summation. But the police did not make a recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon has been under investigation on suspicion of having
bribed a businessman to give false testimony on his behalf in a
1997 libel trial.
</P>
<P>
   The report of an indictment recommendation comes two-and-a-half
weeks before the May 17 general election. Sharon, a powerful player
through decades of Israeli politics, is a key ally in Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bid for re-election. The possibility
of an indictment would at the least burden the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, called it a ``nonscandal''
and said the foreign minister was urging the state attorney's
office to expedite the case. ``Minister Sharon insists that the
state attorney complete its inquiry in his case prior to the
election and has directed his lawyers to act immediately to achieve
that,'' Gissin said.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed bribe was a trip to Russia with Sharon, then
Netanyahu's infrastructure minister, right before the businessman
testified at the libel trial. During the trip, the businessman,
Avigdor Ben-Gal, supposedly explored a natural gas deal, according
to an Israeli business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel radio reported that the police had recommended that
Ben-Gal be indicted too.
</P>
<P>
   The trial stemmed from a libel suit brought by Sharon against
the newspaper Haaretz. Sharon had accused the paper of printing
false allegations about his conduct as defense minister during the
1982 invasion of Lebanon. He lost the suit, but is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations were in an opinion column on the op-ed page. The
writer, Uzi Benziman, asserted that Sharon had willfully deceived
the prime minister at the time, Menachem Begin, about his plans for
the invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story, Sharon led Begin to believe that he was
planning a limited incursion into Lebanon. The deeper advance
during the invasion, Sharon later said, was a later decision in
response to military realities.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those who testified at the trial said Sharon had
intended all along to send Israeli troops deep into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the invasion, Ben-Gal, a commander during the
Lebanon war, said in a lecture at an Israeli university that the
government had been kept in the dark about the army's plan for a
deep invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But during the trial, after the trip to Russia, Ben-Gal
apologized to Sharon and said the interpretation he had presented
at the university was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Weinroth, Sharon's lawyer, said it was not until Sharon and
Ben-Gal were already in Russia that the newspaper's lawyers moved
to call Ben-Gal to the witness stand. He said Sharon's lawyer in
the libel suit had resisted bringing Ben-Gal to the stand.

 &HT;    NATO AIR STRIKES AND BUILD-UP CONTINUES, AS DIPLOMACYBUILDS
MOMENTUM

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. and allied pilots took advantage of clearing
weather Thursday night to conduct some of the heaviest strikes yet
in NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, as the Pentagon said it would
send 10 additional B-52 heavy bombers to join the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have some time to go yet,'' on the air strikes,
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombing escalated, so did diplomacy, with U.S., Russian
and European officials all citing measured progress in difficult
negotiations aimed at formulating a plan for bringing peace -- and
armed peacekeepers -- to the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now getting down to the footnotes,'' in talks among
NATO members and Russia, said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
``The issues of principle are beginning to be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in another reminder of the perils of prolonged conflict, a
NATO aircraft flung the combat equivalent of a wild pitch, firing
off an anti-radar missile that missed its mark not by a mile but by
many, tearing through the rooftop of a home in an upscale suburb of
the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, 30 miles east of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The missile, which did not explode, caused no injuries but came
at a delicate moment: NATO has been awaiting permission from
Bulgaria's parliament to fly strike missions through Bulgarian
airspace. The errant missile prompted a formal apology from NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulgaria knows full well that this is a mishap,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea. ``I'm confident that we can put this behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   After hitting 28 targets late Wednesday and early Thursday, NATO
pilots geared up to fly some 670 sorties -- nearly half of which
were potential strike missions -- Thursday night and early Friday,
as heavy cloud cover lifted to give Balkan bombers their first
clear skies in more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   To add to NATO's ability to strike around the clock at an
expanding array of targets, Cohen said the additional B-52 heavy
bombers would be accompanied by two fresh E-3 AWACS -- jumbo jets
stuffed with equipment that allows them to monitor aircraft over a
wide area -- and an EC-130 airborne combat command center. The
planes will be used to help coordinate NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The additions are part of some 300 additional warplanes and
support craft requested by the NATO commander, U.S. Army Gen.
Wesley Clark. The Pentagon announced on Monday that it would send
30 refueling tankers as part of that package, and Cohen said
Thursday that additional portions of Clark's request would be
processed soon.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he spoke with Clark on Thursday and, among other
things, received an update on the readiness of 22 Apache attack
helicopters that arrived earlier this week in Albania. One crashed
on Monday during training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He indicated they've got some more training to do,'' before
the Apaches can fly missions inside Kosovo, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   During the same briefing, Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said NATO commanders were nowhere near
finished reassessing the requirements of sending a ground force
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably take another week or two at least,'' Shelton
said.
</P>
<P>
   If those plans were developed and approved, Shelton said, ``I
would not take any of the options off the table in terms of the
troops that would be available as a U.S. contribution to a NATO-led
force.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO estimated last fall that it would take a heavily armed
force of some 75,000 troops to successfully invade Kosovo -- an
option the alliance rejected. Last week, NATO leaders decided to
update that assessment to reflect changing conditions on the
ground. The alliance has made clear that it intends to carry on
with the air campaign, and not try to fight its way into Kosovo,
for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO military power is a great hammer,'' Shelton said, ``but
it is not the only tool in our foreign-policy toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to apply diplomatic leverage, Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott wound up two days of meetings with Russian officials
Thursday and flew to London to confer with his British counterpart,
Cook.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan met on
the conflict with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   And Yeltsin's special envoy to the Balkans, former prime
minister Victor Chernomyrdin, conferred on the matter with
officials in Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to speak about a breakthrough in the Yugoslav
settlement,'' Chernomyrdin told reporters after a meeting with
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, ``but there is a certain
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a close partner to Yugoslavia, has opposed NATO air
strikes since they began on March 24 to try to coerce Serb leader
Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, into accepting a
NATO-backed plan for political autonomy for the majority ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has rejected that plan -- which calls for a NATO-led
peacekeeping force of some 28,000 troops to, in effect, occupy
Kosovo for an indefinite period of time. Milosevic has said that,
instead, he would accept unarmed U.N. monitors, an option the
United States and its allies contend is insufficient to protect
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   NATO contends that Serb troops and police have executed more
than 4,000 Kosovar Albanians and run an estimated 1.5 million more
from their homes in a province-wide rampage over the past six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic regime appeared to reject a NATO-led peacekeeping
force in public comments on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``An international presence in Serbia's Kosovo province is not a
problem,'' the spokesman of Milosevic's Socialist Party, Ivica
Dacic, told reporters in Belgrade. ``But only a civilian and
unarmed mission under U.N. auspices, with Russia's participation,
would be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dacic, ``Those who are bombing Yugoslavia today cannot be a
part of any peace mission.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, though, State Department spokesman James Rubin
said ``there is increasing understanding on the Russian part,'' of
the U.S. insistence on an armed peacekeeping force with NATO at its
core.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say they agreed with it yet,'' said Rubin. ``But the
idea of the composition of a force is now being discussed more
intensively than it was before.''

NATIONAL GUN GROUP ON THE DEFENSIVE, FOR ONCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ To herald its annual convention here this weekend, the
National Rifle Association plastered this city with billboards of
its rifle-bearing president, actor Charlton Heston, and the almost
biblical injunction: ``Join me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a rollicking revival meeting, coming on
the heels of an expected triumph over Colorado gun-control
measures. Instead, that hoped-for victory has evaporated and the
billboards have vanished. The NRA will meet Saturday with nothing
to celebrate, unwelcome guests in a city angry about gun violence
and griefstricken by the Columbine High School massacre, just 10
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The rare defensive crouch by the normally aggressive NRA is the
clearest of many signs that momentum has shifted, for the moment at
least, in the debate on gun control. Already, several states have
sprung into action, moving to tighten access to guns or backing
away from the gun-rights' agenda. Now, the question for advocates
on both sides is whether the Columbine shootings, for all the
horror they caused, for all the questions they raised, will be
remembered as marking a seismic shift in the debate or a mere
hiccup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something different about this event, whether it was
just the scope of it, the firepower that these kids had, or the
fact that we all watched it on television,'' said Kristen Rand,
director of federal policy for the Violence Policy Center, a
gun-control organization in Washington. ``The focus on gun control
seems to be more immediate and more lasting than in previous school
shootings and other deadly gun events.''
</P>
<P>
   Also raising the volume, she said, are reports at least one of
the guns used in the murders was purchased at a gun show, where
weapon sales involving unlicensed dealers and private buyers can
occur outside regulatory safeguards, Rand said. A top priority
among gun control advocates is to use the Columbine killings as
Exhibit A in closing that loophole.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of gun-owners' rights said they expect the
anti-gun fervor to quickly fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine is obviously an enormously beneficial short-term
tactical advantage to the gun ban groups,'' said David Kopel of the
Independence Institute, a conservative think tank in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the brevity of that advantage is underscored by the fact
that President Clinton politicized this tragedy even while funerals
are still going on,'' he added. ``The fact that he couldn't wait a
week until the children were buried indicates what a very small
window of opportunity this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopel said he believes it will soon dawn on Americans that, as
tragic as the shooting was, making new laws would not change a
thing. Gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had already broken
something on the order of 20 existing laws, he said, ``and to think
they wouldn't have perpetrated the crime if they had to break one
more law is ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, the deaths of 12 students and one teacher,
serious injuries to a dozen other students, as well as the suicides
of Harris and Klebold, have sent a shiver of reaction through state
legislatures. Some have taken quick action on stalled gun-control
bills and others have quietly pulled back measures favored by
gun-rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   On the federal level, the Littleton shootings have refocused the
Clinton administration. The president last week offered a
milti-pronged gun reform package _ including a three-day waiting
period, a crackdown on gun shows, and a measure to place blame on
adults whose guns are used by children. However, its fate is
uncertain in the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments are also lining up to join the list of cities
that have followed in the path of anti-tobacco activists by suing
gun makers and dealers for the damage caused by firearms. Detroit
this week became the seventh city to file suit, and at least a
half-dozen others, including Boston, are considering legal action
as well. Colorado Gov. Bill Owens added his voice to the chorus,
saying he would veto a bill that would have barred local entities
from suing gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Another telling indicator of the public mood is the reaction
seen by Richard Feinberg, who runs an Internet gun-dealing site
from his Norton, Mass., home. He said sales have skyrocketed,
yielding his best week in memory. Feinberg said he sold roughly 40
guns, most of them paramilitary-style weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid the gun-control types are going to take
their gun rights away from them because of what happened, so
they're rushing to buy them now,'' Feinberg said. Another factor,
he said, was ongoing fear among some that the end of the millennium
could be a time of social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are frightened of our government, I guess because our
government doesn't trust them,'' Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the biggest surge of gun-control sentiment has
been in Colorado, a state usually viewed as being squarely in line
with the gun-owning tradition of the West.
</P>
<P>
   First, lawmakers here withdrew a bill to eliminate most local
gun regulations, notably Denver's ban on assault weapons. The NRA
had expected that bill to be passed in time for its convention, so
manufacturers and dealers could display the hottest new forms of
firepower. Now, with the law still on the books and the fear that
any gun show would be a public relations disaster, the NRA weapons
exhibition has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Equally damaging to Second Amendment activists, the shootings
derailed an expected victory for the NRA's ``right-to-carry''
agenda, legislation that would have allowed licensed Colorado gun
owners to carry concealed weapons. The expected passage of that law
had been seen by the NRA as a chance to rebound from its
disappointment two weeks ago in Missouri, where $3.7 million in NRA
spending was not enough to convince voters to lift that state's
concealed weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, the Colorado governor, had supported lifting the
concealed weapons ban, but the bill was pulled from consideration
after the shootings. Few here expect it to be reconsidered anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happened over the last year or so, with all the
school shootings, not just Columbine, the American people have
grown angry,'' said Joe Sudbay, director of state legislation at
Washington-based Handgun Control Inc. ``I don't think they'll be
silent anymore, and I think they'll start demanding that
legislators respond to them and not the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states have, in fact, responded to the shootings by quick
legislative action. One day after the carnage, Arizona's governor
vetoed a bill that would have prevented localities from filing gun
suits; a similar bill in Florida that had been expected to pass was
pulled off state House calendar, though it is moving ahead in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the legislature killed a bill that would have closed
the gun show loophole, but Republican Gov. George W. Bush later
said Congress should do so on a national basis.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki moved to toughen penalties for gun
crimes, and Illinois Gov. George Ryan backed a move to require
parents to store guns with trigger locks or in locked cabinets to
prevent access by children.
</P>
<P>
   But not all states are moving in the same direction. One day
after the shootings, the Nevada Assembly voted to take away local
governments' right to sue gun makers. And, with the gun lobby
retaining deep-rooted ties to key state legislators, there is a
strong likelihood at least some of the tabled measures will be
revisited when the furor dies down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't change anything long-term,'' said Michael Yacino,
executive director of the Gun Owners Action League, based in
Northborough, Mass. ``People will realize that we need to focus our
attention on criminal behavior, and as we saw by what happened out
there in Colorado, if we were to blame just guns, then we'd also
blame propane tanks and matches and other things these killers
created.''
</P>
<P>
   On the federal level, Clinton's package includes calls for
background checks on all gun sales, including those at gun shows;
raising the legal age for handgun possession from 18 to 21 in most
cases; and holding adults responsible when children use their
firearms to cause injury or death, in cases when the adults
knowingly or recklessly allowed the child access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can pass it all if the American people want it badly
enough,'' Clinton said when announcing the package. ``And we don't
need to go through another Littleton for the American people to
want it badly enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But several Republican leaders in Congress quickly characterized
the proposals as a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction that
would not solve the problem. They urged a focus on the media and
broader cultural issues, as well as a broad look at the causes of
teen violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control activists also noted pessimistically that not even
the fatal shootings of two US Capitol police officers last summer
was seen by Republican leaders as a clarion call for greater gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   NRA officials said they will have no comment about the anti-gun
surge until Saturday's meeting. In a letter to the reported 2.8
million members, Heston and another NRA leader said the group
wanted to show sympathy and respect to community. ``Our spirits
must endure this terrible suffering together, and so must the
freedoms that bring us together,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Mayor Wellington Webb had asked the NRA to cancel its
convention altogether, even offering to reimburse the group for any
losses. NRA officials declined, saying they are required to hold an
annual members' meeting by the New York state law under which the
group is organized.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scaling back the convention from three days to
one, the NRA scrapped a planned reception for US Rep. J. C. Watts
of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House and a
sometime spokesman for the NRA. Saturday's session will feature
just two scheduled speakers, Heston and NRA executive vice
president Wayne LaPierre.
</P>
<P>
   The convention had been expected to attract 22,000 NRA members
and pour $18 million in the local economy. City and tourism
officials said they had no idea how many would show up. An anti-gun
rally outside the convention promises to win nearly as much
publicity, and possibly as much support, as the NRA meeting itself.
</P>
<P>
   As for the NRA conventioneers who do find their way to Denver,
in the place of billboards with Heston, they will find public
service ads touting the American Red Cross.

   VALPARAISO, Chile _ This gritty port of steep cliffs and
shantytowns was the domain of the left until Gen. Augusto Pinochet
smashed the unions representing the dockworkers, metalworkers,
railroad workers and printers in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, with the former dictator in custody in London for
possible extradition to Spain to face charges of crimes against
humanity, the left was back in Valparaiso with songs, banners and
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Lagos, 61, the presidential candidate of the same
Socialist Party that brought Salvador Allende Gossens to power
nearly 30 years ago, toured the markets and union halls with a
former Communist Party congressman by his side. Lagos is well ahead
in the polls and expects to win a primary vote on May 30 by a
comfortable margin, and the reception he received was mostly
exuberant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were occasional signs that the polarization of the
last three decades endures.
</P>
<P>
   As Lagos and the former congressman, Luis Guastavino, campaigned
down Avenida Uruguay, a middle-aged woman greeted them with a
stolid look that bordered on anger.
</P>
<P>
   She rolled up her sleeve to show the two politicians the scars
left from a torturer's lighted cigarette on her arm. Lagos put his
arms around her and gave her a gentle kiss on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, as Lagos questioned street vendors on how
sales of their used books and trinkets were going, a well-dressed
woman entering her parked sports utility vehicle screamed at the
Socialist candidate accusingly, ``Tell the truth!'' _ a phrase
commonly used by right-wingers in Latin America when confronting
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos took the words as a challenge from a proponent of the
free-market policies instituted under the Pinochet dictatorship.
And as the vendors listened intently, he said in a modulated voice,
``There are different ways of fighting poverty, but my way of
fighting poverty is more sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos' language is occasionally reminiscent of Allende's earlier
socialist experiment, when workers and peasants were encouraged to
take over factories and the properties of the rich. At an
auditorium packed with 700 students at the Catholic University of
Valparaiso, he promised to start an expansive scholarship program
so the poor could go to college. ``I will discriminate in favor of
the poor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a copper smelting plant outside Valparaiso, he spoke of the
need for unemployment insurance and better health care for the
underprivileged. ``The market serves for many things like
investment and products, but markets don't make a society,'' he
said. ``People do.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Lagos called for social justice, he let people know
that he is a new kind of socialist, one who understands that Chile
must compete in international markets.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he wants to push forward a privatization of parts
of the copper industry, and at the smelting plant he went so far as
to applaud the ``maturity'' of the union for allowing the state
company to cut employment from 1,500 workers to 1,050 workers since
1990 to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new era,'' Lagos said in an interview as he
complimented much of what more than two decades of privatizations
and free market policies have brought to Chile. ``In the last 10
years we have doubled our gross national product as the annual
inflation rate decreased from 20 to 4 percent. It's been fabulous,
but we've also learned there has been no trickle down.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he is confident he will have good relations with
Washington, despite the role the Nixon administration played in
encouraging the Chilean military to overthrow Allende. ``Chileans
need to know their history and that our relations with the United
States have had their ups and downs,'' he said. ``But they must
also understand that the world has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   A gardener and rock climber in his spare time, Lagos still
displays an academic temperament from his days as chancellor at the
University of Chile. He had been picked to be Allende's ambassador
to the Soviet Union just before the 1973 Pinochet coup. He then
became a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina,
and was briefly jailed in Chile for his political activities in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Since a civilian coalition government led by the Christian
Democratic Party and his Socialist Party took power in 1990, Lagos
served as education minister and public works minister, positions
he used to tour the country and display pragmatism. As education
minister he took funds previously budgeted for the universities and
put them into primary education, but he also expanded aid to church
schools and granted military academies the right to issue master's
degrees to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   As public works minister, he worked hard with the military to
complete one of Pinochet's pet projects, a highway through Chile's
frigid and watery Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego regions.
</P>
<P>
   He says he will be able to coexist with the military as
president if he wins the May primary against Andres Zaldivar, the
Christian Democratic president of the Senate, and the Christian
Democratic-Socialist coalition goes on to defeat at least one
right-wing candidate in December.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he would not diverge much from President Eduardo
Frei's efforts to bring Pinochet back to Chile, a position that has
brought him under sharp criticism from Gladys Marin, the Communist
Party presidential candidate, and even some members of his own
party.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he made it clear that he would work to limit the
enduring political power of the military by seeking to overturn a
law that gives the armed forces 10 percent of the revenues
generated by the state copper company and amend the constitution,
which gives the military four seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But while his relationship with the military and how he will
deal with the Pinochet case are constant sources of discussion
among Chilean political commentators, the subjects almost never
come up on the campaign trail. Recent polls indicate that
Pinochet's legal predicament has had a very limited impact on voter
sentiment toward the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Never once did the names Pinochet or Allende come up in either
Lagos' speeches or in questions posed to him by voters during the
entire day of campaigning in Valparaiso, which was not only the
center of so much political ferment during the Allende years but
also Pinochet's birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinochet,'' Lagos said in the interview, ``is the past.''

BRAZILIAN LEGISLATORS PROBE CENTRAL BANK AND ITS FORMER PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazilian lawmakers pressed forward Thursday
with an inquiry into allegations of inside information leaks at the
country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers called Francisco Lopes, a Harvard-educated economist
and former central bank president who is at the center of the
inquiry, to testify before a panel of senators for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes is accused of engineering, perhaps illegally, a bailout of
two banks caught off guard by the central bank's decision to
devalue the currency in January. He is also suspected of receiving
payment in an offshore account for services at a consulting firm he
once owned while employed as a central bank director in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   These accusations have not been substantiated. But Lopes has
refused twice before to testify and was detained by the police
briefly earlier this week for his defiance. It was not clear
Thursday whether he would agree to testify this time.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the uncertainty over Lopes, Brazil's financial markets
are beginning to shrug off the effects of the inquiry, a sign that
it is losing momentum. Less preoccupied with the potential for new
allegations to emerge, the country's currency, the real,
strengthened Thursday to a four-month high of 1.65 to the dollar,
before weakening slightly. Wednesday, the central bank made another
in a series of interest rate cuts because of growing confidence in
the economy. And in recent days Brazilian banks have successfully
sold bonds abroad to foreign investors for the first time since
Russia's economic meltdown last summer suppressed demand for
emerging-market debt securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us it appears this investigation is nearing the end,''
said Carlos Castanho, the managing director of Credit Suisse First
Boston Garantia, an investment bank that is one of the largest
traders of Brazilian bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation may still hurt the credibility of President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration, and Finance Minister
Pedro Malan may be called to testify. Malan may be criticized for
his role in the affair because, in Brazil, the president of the
central bank is subordinate to the finance minister. Another
high-ranking official, Budget Minister Pedro Parente, could also be
called to testify since he was deputy finance minister in
mid-January when Lopes bailed out the two institutions, Banco Marka
and Banco Fonte Cindam.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely that the scandal will spread to other members
of the government's elite bureaucracy. The current central bank
president, Arminio Fraga, whose work has been praised by investors,
is considered largely untouchable because at the time of the events
in question he was managing a hedge fund in New York for
multibillionaire investor George Soros.

TOP JUDGE IN TURKEY COMES OUT FOR FREE SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turkey's highest-ranking judge, speaking in
terms rarely if ever used by a senior official here, has surprised
the country by sharply condemning restrictions on freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, urged Parliament to repeal a
series of laws and constitutional provisions. The judge also called
for lifting the ban on teaching the Kurdish language, which he said
violated international agreements. The authorities say the ban is
necessary to check the rise of Kurdish nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments and human rights groups have often urged
Turkey to ease its curbs on free expression, and many Turks appear
to support such changes. But powerful military commanders and
civilian politicians fear that allowing greater freedom of speech
would lead to the spread of separatism, fundamentalism and other
movements that they consider highly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech this week, Sezer, who is president of the
Constitutional Court, the highest judicial body in Turkey, asserted
that ``people in democratic societies cannot live without human
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking to an audience of lawyers and government
employees gathered to celebrate the court's 37th anniversary. Many
of them applauded vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although everyone knows that freedom of thought is vital to
democracy, we have not been able to overcome obstacles that keep us
from establishing it,'' Sezer said. ``Allowing people to hold
opinions is not enough. They must be able to speak freely. The
freedom to express one's thoughts is the basis on which all other
freedoms are built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey should change its constitution and laws to harmonize
itself with universal standards,'' he continued. ``Restrictions on
freedom of speech should be lifted, and our legal codes should be
cleansed. The territory of freedom should be enlarged.''
</P>
<P>
   Sezer, who was appointed to his post last year, called for
changes in laws that he said limited the freedom of political
parties, labor unions and the press. He also urged relaxation of
``anti-terror'' laws, which punish statements deemed to encourage
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is often difficult to tell what behavior is criminal and
what is not,'' he said. ``Laws are blurry and open to
interpretation. As a result, they are applied irregularly, and
justice is more difficult to achieve. We need to eliminate these
problems by legislative action and make our legal framework more
concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Sezer's speech synthesized many of the complaints that Turkish
intellectuals have been making for years, and the fact that it came
from such a high place has provoked considerable, and sometimes
amazed, discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a surprise,'' said Nadire Mater, a leading
campaigner for press freedom. ``I completely agree with what he
said. He spoke very clearly and directly. I wish everyone in the
establishment thought the same way, but I'm afraid that's not true.
Maybe now, other people who are responsible for these things will
try to understand and listen.''
</P>
<P>
   But one influential columnist, Oktay Eksi, said he doubted the
reforms Sezer called for would be approved, since in the recent
election campaign ``none of the political parties made any
substantial commitment to freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's Constitution, which was written during the period of
military rule in the early 1980s, forbids ``thoughts or opinions
that run counter to Turkish national interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Other laws ban books or articles that ``threaten the internal or
external security of the state,'' undermine ``the national and
spiritual values of society'' or question ``the historical and
moral values of Turkishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders have conceded from time to time that the
country's human rights record is unsatisfactory. At the beginning
of 1998, Mesut Yilmaz, who was then prime minister, pledged that
improving human rights conditions would be his highest priority for
the year. He proposed only modest reforms to Parliament, however,
and even they were not passed.
</P>
<P>
   This year Parliament considered repealing a law banning speech
that ``incites people to enmity and hatred by pointing to class,
racial, confessional or religious differences.'' The debate ended
when military commanders warned that repeal would hinder their
ability to fight religious fundamentalism.

GOP ACCUSED OF UNDERMINING CLINTON'S KOSOVO POLICY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democratic leaders accused Republicans on
Thursday of trying to undermine President Clinton's Kosovo policy
as the Senate canceled consideration of a measure calling for the
use of ground troops if necessary to end the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee canceled a hearing on a
bipartisan measure offered by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joe
Biden, D-Del., that would give Clinton the authority to use
``whatever means necessary,'' including a ground invasion of
Kosovo, to end the campaign as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The measure had been scheduled for debate on the Senate floor as
early as Monday. But a vote on the McCain-Biden bill seemed less
certain after the House voted Wednesday to deny support for the
36-day-old allied air campaign and to require the president to seek
congressional approval before mounting a ground offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than hold a straight up or down vote on the McCain-Biden
measure, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., indicated he
wanted to bring up the measure requiring congressional approval for
ground forces as an alternative to the bipartisan bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the McCain-Biden bill gives Clinton too much freedom
in deciding how to use U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Republican aides said Lott would likely allow a
vote on McCain-Biden next week if he is assured that the Democrats
will not try to block consideration of the House-passed measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.,
accused the Republicans of ``playing politics'' with the lives of
U.S. personnel involved in the NATO operation by pressuring GOP
lawmakers to vote against a resolution of support for the allied
air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That resolution, offered by the Democratic leadership, was
defeated Wednesday on a vote of 213-213 even though it had the
support of House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was headed for passage, despite opposition from
26 Democrats, when Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., switched her vote at
the last minute from ``yes'' to ``no,'' according to the
Congressional Record.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and his deputy leader, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich.,
charged that House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, engaged in
political arm-twisting to get Bono and other Republicans to vote
against the resolution, even after Hastert assured Democrats
members would not be pressured.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing condemnation of DeLay's tactics, Gephardt and
Bonior all but declared Hastert a pawn of DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Hastert as ``a nice, good man,'' they nonetheless
suggested that he is incapable of reining in DeLay and other GOP
members, even on important matters ``where the House needs to speak
with one united voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was a low point in American foreign policy and the
history of this institution,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the House vote sent ``at best a muddled message, and at
worst a negative message'' to the world about the U.S. commitment
to the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's office issued a statement calling the claims of
arm-twisting ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay blamed the measure's failure on Democratic opposition and
``yet another in a series of Kosovo blunders.''
</P>
<P>
   Delay spokesman Michael Scanlon, however, acknowledged that his
boss did talk with Bono and other members while the vote was in
progress. ``He told her that he thought she ought to vote no,''
Scanlon said. But he added that DeLay ``didn't pressure her or
anyone else'' to change their votes.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan bickering between DeLay and the Democratic leaders
is just one example of the deep divisions in Congress over the
Kosovo conflict, which is threatening to upset the lawmakers' work
on other legislative matters.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have also been strained by Republican efforts to beef
up Clinton's $6.05 billion emergency spending request to finance
the U.S. portion of the NATO operation for the rest of the fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee approved a $12.9 billion
spending package Thursday that more than doubled the president's
request and included items that the administration considers
``unrelated'' to the Kosovo conflict, such as a shooting range for
military personnel in Germany and various construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is marking up a separate bill of its own, but
Republicans may be increasingly sensitive to charges they are
trying to load it up with ``pork barrel'' projects and may produce
a smaller spending measure.
</P>
<P>
   One Senate aide said the final bill the Senate Appropriations
Committee produces ``will probably be more in the neighborhood of
$7 billion.'' Both House and Senate leaders hope to have the
emergency package wrapped up in a final bill by next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said he still believes that Congress can produce a bill
that meets the military's needs for the Kosovo operation without
turning it into a ``wish list'' for defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to better assess the president's request and to see
first-hand how the NATO campaign is progressing, House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, will lead a congressional delegation of
19 members to the Balkans over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to talk to some of our troops there,'' Armey told Texas
reporters Thursday, adding that the delegation will also have a
chance ``to talk to refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared to have my heart broken in some of those
conversations, but I think it's the sort of thing we need to do,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey disputed Gephardt's claims that Republicans are playing
politics with the Kosovo crisis. He said the House votes Wednesday
were simply a matter of trying to make a larger point to the
president that he should consult with Congress before committing
U.S. forces to military action and not seek ``our validation or
repudiation'' later.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's delegation will travel to Ramstein Air Base in Germany,
and then to Albania and Macedonia before returning home late Sunday
through Aviano Air Base in Italy and NATO headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another 10-member congressional delegation
headed by Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., will be going to Vienna to meet
with members of the Russian Duma to discuss ways of resolving the
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be engaging Russia on Kosovo,'' Weldon said.

CROWDED HONG KONG FEARS INSTABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Hong Kong is Earth's most crowded place, a territory
one-third the size of Rhode Island, with seven times the
population. And it may soon have to open its borders to 25 percent
more people, an influx that could put an unbearable strain on this
prosperous but jam-packed city.
</P>
<P>
   Locals were up in arms Thursday over a government announcement
that more than 1.6 million people _ nearly one-fourth of Hong
Kong's population of 6.8 million _ will be allowed to move here
from mainland China over the next 10 to 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine a place more congested than this, where
everyday life demands elbowing through packed subways and
overflowing sidewalks amid forests of towering housing projects.
The World Bank this week ranked Hong Kong the world's most densely
populated area, with 6,375 people per square kilometer _ compared
with 29 people per square kilometer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hong Kong has always been a city of immigrants. Successive
waves of mainland refugees from the 1949 Communist Revolution,
1950s famines, and the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and '70s
built Hong Kong from a relative outpost into a global
manufacturing, trading, and financial capital. Today it boasts one
of the highest per-capita incomes in the world _ higher than its
former colonial master, Great Britain _ and the second-largest
monetary reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's greatest challenge since it returned to Chinese rule
in 1997 may not be the threat of losing its political freedoms, but
the difficulty of maintaining its prosperity and quality of life
while accommodating a new flood of migrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visualize a future where every inch of space is crowded with
people,'' said Fiona Szeto, 24, a public relations executive.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that the real problem is not the sheer number of
prospective arrivals, but that the government does not have a plan
for accommodating them. After all, Hong Kong was barely inhabited
when colonizers arrived in 1851; half of today's residents are
migrants from China, and the other half are descendants of earlier
immigrants. And although much of Hong Kong is park land or zoned to
forbid building, only 16 percent of it has been developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio talk shows and certain people are making too big a deal
of this,'' said Leo Chung, 25, a financial analyst. ``A lot of us
think Hong Kong is a refugee city, built by people who sneaked
across the border. We can afford to accommodate these new people.
And it's not just an economic issue, it's a legal issue and a moral
issue. These are children of Hong Kong people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's post-colonial constitution, the Basic Law, grants
any child of a permanent resident the right to live here. A January
appeals court ruling held that even illegitimate children and
children born before their parents acquired Hong Kong residency
have that right.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a huge waiting list of prospective immigrants from
China, it is common for families to wait 20 years or longer to be
reunited. Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal ruled three months ago
that that was unfair, and that all eligible children must be
allowed to emigrate within a ``reasonable period.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling angered local authorities and mainland officials who
fear too many migrants could ruin a city that Beijing wants to
maintain as a showcase of free enterprise and a funnel for
investments to flow into communist China.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate that more than 1.6 million are eligible migrants is
based on a government survey of 10,000 local households. The survey
estimates there are 692,000 mainland children of current Hong Kong
residents, and another 983,000 children of people who will become
residents within seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers questioned the figure Thursday, noting that
it far exceeds previous estimates. After both the 1991 and 1996
census, the government said there were about 320,000 children of
Hong Kong residents living in China.
</P>
<P>
   Many social workers and liberal politicians said the government
is trying to whip up panic so that people demand that the court
overturn its ruling or that China limit residency rights. Legal
scholars warn that overturning a court ruling would violate
judicial independence, and that amending the constitution is a
slippery slope; residency rights could be cut today, political
freedoms could be curtailed tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no avoiding the fact that if the government's new
estimates are true, a crush of migrants will create tremendous
challenges. Already, 150 Chinese migrants enter Hong Kong each day,
and 44 children enter the school system. There is a six-year wait
for public housing, even with 50,000 new units being built a year,
and the government estimates the number of people on waiting lists
would triple with the new migrants.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at 6.2 percent, the territory may not have
jobs for the expected migrants. Seventy percent of the eligible
children have been waiting so long to come here that they are now
adults, and about half of them have a high school education or
less. Fewer than 10 percent are professionals, according to Regina
Ip, the secretary for security.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Sau-lan, a legislator, said the government was
``irresponsible to present the problem without any solutions.'' Ho
said schools with a Hong Kong curriculum could be built over the
border in nearby Shenzhen; some 200,000 domestic worker jobs held
mostly by Filipino women could be phased out to make way for
Chinese maids, and housing could be built on Lantau Island, which
is five times the size of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Hong Kong offers greater freedoms and human rights
than China, she said, it will remain a magnet for mainland
immigrants. ``At the end of the day, Hong Kong is just a city; we
can't absorb all of China. The answer lies in the democratization
of the mainland. Right now we have one country with two systems. We
need one country with one good system.''

 &HT;    AFC reports mixed earnings
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AFC Enterprises on Thursday reported a loss of
$592,000 in the first quarter, compared to net income of $73,000
for the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta restaurant company blamed higher interest expenses,
depreciation and amortization related to its 1998 acquisitions of
Cinnabon International and Seattle Coffee Co.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the company bought 66 Hardee's restaurants last year and
converted them to Popeyes Chicken &AMP; Biscuits stores.
</P>
<P>
   Operating income rose 24 percent to $19.1 million for the
quarter, compared to $15.4 million for the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   AFC is not publicly held, but reports its earnings because it
has public debt.
</P>
<P>
   Systemwide sales at AFC's more than 3,200 restaurants, bakeries
and cafes grew by 24 percent to $478.2 million, up from $383.6
million for the same quarter in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic comparable store sales, a key barometer of a company's
financial health in the retail and restaurant industries, rose 7.5
percent for Churches and 1.8 percent for Popeyes.
</P>
<P>
   International comparable sales fell by 2.4 percent during the
first quarter for all of AFC's operations, primarily because of
continued weaknesses in Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   Overall international sales _ which includes new stores _ grew
by 16.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think in the second quarter we will continue to see solid
same-store sales growth and strong double-digit sales growth,''
said Chief Financial Officer Gerald Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company expects to open 90 new stores in the second
quarter, and has commitments signed for another 200.

 &HT;    Coke chief: Suit wrong but serious
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. Chairman M. Douglas Ivester told all of
the company's U.S. employees that while the racial discrimination
suit against the beverage giant has ``significant errors of fact,''
he is taking it ``very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent time this week meeting with senior
African-American associates of the company to get their insights
and opinions on the circumstances that have led to this serious
litigation,'' Ivester said in an e-mail late Wednesday to nearly
10,000 U.S. employees. ``As has always been the case, their views
are critically important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Ivester's second e-mail on the issue since last week, when
four current and former employees filed a federal suit in Atlanta,
alleging that Coca-Cola discriminates against black employees in
pay, promotions, performance evaluations and terminations. The suit
seeks class-action status so it can represent 1,500 other salaried
African-American employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, let me emphasize what I hope and believe is apparent to
everyone associated with Coca-Cola _ our company has always
endeavored to treat our customers, our consumers, our bottlers and,
perhaps most importantly, our employees with fairness, respect, and
dignity,'' Ivester wrote. ``It is because of that background that
the lawsuit is so troubling to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester said the company does not systematically discriminate
against African-Americans, as te lawsuit alleges, and said the
complaint's factual errors will be addressed when the company files
its legal response.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company has put in place several programs over the
past few years to help identify, train and develop employees ``who
can lead this business forward in the years ahead. A key component
of these efforts is the development of African-American associates.
It is the responsibility of every manager of the company, beginning
with me, to assure that these initiatives take root in our
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lawsuit alleges that contrary initiatives have taken
root through a ``companywide pattern and practice'' of
discrimination. It says that blacks at corporate headquarters are
concentrated in lower pay grades and management positions than
whites and make considerably less money with fewer opportunities
for advancement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by employees Motisola Malikha Abdallah,
Gregory Allen Clark and Linda Ingram, and former employee Kimberly
Gray Orton.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorney, Cyrus Mehri, said he had no comment on
Ivester's e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola also had no comment except to say the e-mail speaks
for itself, spokesman Robert Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester said he will continue to send out e-mails on the subject
to all U.S. employees as information warrants.

 &HT;    Citizens Trust parent joins publicly traded elite
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole and Susan Harte
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Citizens Bancshares Corp., the parent company of
Citizens Trust Bank CTB Mortgage Services, has joined an exclusive
club of formerly black-owned financial institutions that have gone
public.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old Atlanta-based bank said Thursday it began
trading its stock over the counter last Thursday at $7 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares closed Thursday at $7.62 1/2, up 62 1/2 cents. The ticker
symbol is CZBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new beginning for us,'' Willard ``Chuck'' Lewis,
chief operating officer, said Thursday. ``Now, we're ready to let
everybody know we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   As if no one knew before. Some of the most celebrated names in
Atlanta's minority business community have been connected to
Citizens Trust Co., which opened on ``Sweet Auburn'' Avenue in
1919.
</P>
<P>
   It was founded with $500,000 in stock by five businessmen led by
Herman E. Perry, owner of the Standard Life Insurance Co., and its
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bank was born on the eve of the most severe
depression in American history, it survived the 1920s and 1930s
when other financial institutions failed. During the presidency of
L.D. Milton, the company financed the Morris Brown subdivision and
built housing in Mozeley Park, Bankhead and on Hightower Road. It
completed its own 12-story office building.
</P>
<P>
   When Milton retired in 1971, Charles M. Reynolds became
president. He spearheaded the creation of a holding company,
Citizens Bancshares Corp., as parent of the bank. At that point,
the company had $32 million in assets. The year also saw the
purchase of a mortgage brokerage and servicing company.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Funderburg, another executive credited with making the bank
increasingly profitable, became president in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to revitalize neighborhoods and he oversaw the opening
of branches and the installation of automatic teller machines. As
he led the bank into the technological age, it was named 1985 Bank
of the Year by Black Enterprise Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He retired at age 68 in 1993 and was succeeded by William Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Gibbs abruptly resigned just as Citizens Trust
was about to become the fifth-largest black-owned bank in the
nation by merging with First Southern Bancshares of Lithonia.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Young moved from president of First Southern Bancshares
to head the merged company. He said at the time his goal was assets
of $1 billion within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Assets are about $207 million. The company still calls its Sweet
Auburn location home.
</P>
<P>
   When it chose a market maker, it went to J.C. Bradford, the
market maker for more than 60 community banks in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the bank went public to enhance the value of
shareholders' stock. He said the company has about 1,343
shareholders, most of whom owned stock before the company went
public.
</P>
<P>
   About 2.2 million shares are outstanding. About 32 percent of
the stock is held by board members and officers.
</P>
<P>
   Those include automobile dealer Gregory Baranco, former chairman
of the board of directors of First Southern and current vice
chairman of the merged companies; and Herman J. Russell, who is
chairman. Lewis said taking the company public ``was not intended
to raise any additional capital at this point'' but ``when there is
a business proposition or deal in the future, we will strongly
consider issuing additional shares.''
</P>
<P>
   The offering ``is microscopic, but it's a move in the right
direction and we're going to see more and more black banks going
public within the next two years,'' said William Cunningham, owner
of Creative Investment Research, a Washington, D.C.-based
investment research firm.
</P>
<P>
   While he praised the move, Cunningham said it raises some
interesting questions about ownership. ``It's not entirely a
minority if you're public, but that's not a big concern because for
the most part the management is still minority and most of the
stock _ 51 percent _ will stay in minority hands. That's a risk
worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Several black banks are publicly traded, including Carver
Bancorp Inc., the holding company for Carver Federal Savings Bank
in New York; Broadway Federal Bank in Los Angeles; and Independence
Federal Savings Bank of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Carver, which began trading on the American Stock
Exchange in October 1994, had 1998 assets of $437.5 million and is
ranked as the top black bank by Black Enterprise Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unusual, particularly for a black bank,'' said William
D. Bradford, dean of the business school at the University of
Washington in Seattle and an expert on black banks. ``Black banks
have not grown in assets as fast as the rest of the banking
industry and there has been a lot of turnover, so the long-term
viability of black banks is still in question even though there
will be some _ like Citizens Trust _ which will survive and
prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said a community bank could have several reasons to
enter the public market: it is one way to establish a value for its
stock and it enables shareholders to to buy and sell their stock
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, going public is a way for a company to raise
funds. ``If Citizens is ever bought out or merged, this would be a
means of identifying the value of the stock and make it easier to
negotiate with other institutions about what the price should be,''
Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Baunita Greer, an analyst with Cromwell, Miller &AMP; Greer in New
York, expects to see more black-owned banks and companies go
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're realizing that they will have to go to the capital
markets for expansion capital,'' she said. ``This is a very crucial
period.''

 &HT;    S&AMP;P sounds a warning, lowers Southern's outlook
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Standard &AMP; Poor's corporate credit rating service
sounded a warning Thursday about ``higher business risks'' inherent
in a move by Southern Co. into global power markets and unregulated
U.S. energy businesses.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P affirmed A and A-1 credit ratings unchanged for the
Atlanta-based utility holding company and its Southeastern U.S.
subsidiaries, but revised its outlook to negative from stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook revision reflects a recognition that Southern Co.
is increasingly challenged to maintain financial performance
measures commensurate with the higher business risk arising from
the company's continued expansion into competitive, asset-based
energy businesses,'' S&AMP;P said. The service also cited Southern's
plans to repurchase up to 50 million shares of common stock over
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Southern spokeswoman Janni Benson said S&AMP;P is ``still very
comfortable with our financial position'' but that the company must
``demonstrate to them that the strategies we have in place will pay
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew S. Levi, utilities analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston, said the revision was in keeping with trends in an industry
moving toward a more risky environment with deregulation and more
competition. Southern stock closed unchanged at $26.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is currently reviewing
Southern's request for permission to expand its unregulated
holdings. The company is authorized to invest up to 100 percent of
its retained earnings and has $3.5 billion, or 89 percent of
retained earnings, invested.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign for a Prosperous Georgia, an Atlanta-based nonprofit
consumer group, has contested Southern's application for a waiver
that would raise the company's limit to 175 percent of retained
earnings, or $4 billion, on grounds of potential harm to consumers
or investors. Southern countered that the group's arguments are
based on ``baseless legal arguments and speculative allegations.

busy with the everyday life of American teen-agers. Now, after a
massacre that took 15 lives, including those of the two classmates
who were the gunmen, they wonder where they and their school go on
from here.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, the mass shooting again raised questions
about teen-agers and the often violent popular culture they are
immersed in. What did the assault by the students, Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold, say about growing up today, about the pressures of
high school, about the fragility of teen-age identity? Did it say
anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to find answers, The New York Times invited eight
Columbine students, four young women and four young men, ranging
from freshman to senior, athletes to debate-team members, to talk
about the violence in their school and how it has changed the way
they look at the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their nearly two-hour discussion touched on cliques, guns, race,
music, video games and fashion _ and the terrible nightmares that
now keep them from sleeping. The main themes have been distilled
from a long transcript for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Tell us about the trench coat mafia.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. Last year the trench coat mafia consisted of 15 to 20
people. They were a group of kids who maybe played Magic, that card
game, and went out and smoked together. That's all it was. And,
yes, they happened to wear black trench coats. They called
themselves the trench coat mafia.
</P>
<P>
   It fell apart because half those people graduated last year. You
hear all this talk, about the trench coat mafia, whatever _ Dylan
and Eric weren't even a part of that, first off. I just want
everybody to know the trench coat mafia is just another name, just
another way to place blame. Because those people who were in the
trench coat mafia or whatever, aren't even part of it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   That picture in the yearbook, I don't know a single person in
that picture who still considers themselves a part of the trench
coat mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We've heard a lot about social cliques in Columbine. How
powerful are they?
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. I don't think the cliques were really that intense. Lots
and lots of people knew people from both groups. A lot of people
are from both sides of the gun. I mean, they were friends with the
trench coat mafia and then they were friends with the, you know,
the jocks or whatever you want to call them.
</P>
<P>
   JENI. I don't think it was really cliques. It's more like groups
of friends. I was talking a couple months back with the class
president, Heather, and we were saying how much it's changed since
eighth grade, where you had the distinct groups. Once you're a
senior, you know, everyone is just _ we thought everyone was
friends.
</P>
<P>
   I guess we weren't, but _ It was more like groups of friends,
not, you know, we don't talk to them and we're going to raise our
noses at them.
</P>
<P>
   NICK. I think our school is such a great place. If you played a
sport, or whatever you did, it was such a great place to go. And I
don't think we should be remembered for what happened that day, but
for how great we were. I want my brother to go to school there,
wrestle there, and graduate from Columbine. It's just such a great
school that it can't end in such a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do sports affect social groupings?
</P>
<P>
   NICK. It wasn't like just the jocks hung out with the jocks, to
me. I hung out with everybody. And I wasn't mean to people who
didn't play a sport. I didn't think any less of somebody who
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did some athletes?
</P>
<P>
   NICK. Yeah, there were some.
</P>
<P>
   JENI. It was a lot worse last year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In what ways?
</P>
<P>
   JENI. Just with big jocks picking on little jocks, or big jocks
picking on, you know, skaters. I thought they were a lot more
vicious last year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would they do?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. Just their attitudes. I think their attitudes were just
full of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who are you talking about? What groups?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. Football players, mostly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Nick, you're a wrestler. What's it like to be an athlete at
Columbine?
</P>
<P>
   NICK. On the day before a meet, we wear our warm-ups, and we
wear them with pride. It just feels so good to walk around knowing
that you're wearing a warm-up that says Columbine Rebels. It's just
the impact of being a part of the school in whatever you do. It's a
great thing.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I think you've got maybe a little more respect if you
played sports, or people look at you differently.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do people treat athletes?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. You don't ever get bad looks or anything.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. I think the other reason that they're sometimes treated
with more respect is because there's a whole lot of school spirit
at Columbine. People really stand up for their teams, and the
athletes are the ones that actually perform the tasks and, you
know, give the school some of its pride. They're the ones that
people are cheering for at football games, or at meets. They're the
ones that give the school a sense of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. I'm on the Columbine Forensics Teach, Speech and Debate.
We have some people who play football on our team, some people who
are cheerleaders. But we have a problem with the athletes
sometimes. At the prom assembly, when our national qualifiers went
up and our state champion went up, there was booing. And I looked
over and they were wearing football shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It's really sad that that happens because I respect people who
wrestle and play football, because I could never even do that. I am
not that athletic, and I have total respect for people like that
because they've made this great accomplishment. And it's so sad
that academics are so low on our ranking, because it's something
else to be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I mean, we had three national qualifiers and a state champion
come out of our school for forensics this year. That's never been
before.
</P>
<P>
   There needs to be school spirit for everything because there are
more competitions than sports. There's debate, speech, there's
business. Our school spirit needs to be more universal.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I just had a question that I've been thinking about.
What are considered jocks? Because there is so many sports in our
school.
</P>
<P>
   NICK. I think every time I hear somebody call somebody a jock, I
think it's the same as them calling me, like, an (expletive) or
something like that. Because every time somebody calls somebody a
jock it's in that kind of tone. You know, it's like, hey jock.
</P>
<P>
   MEG. Jock is a kind of slang down term, like some people will
call other people freaks because their hair is different. That's
probably what caused all this, just silly name calling.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where did Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fit in?
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. Dylan Klebold was one of my best friends. And when I hung
out with him, there was just something that happened. I mean,
whether they were wearing jeans and a T-shirt, or whether they were
wearing their black trench coats, people would give them looks.
Just like, ``You don't belong here, would you leave?''
</P>
<P>
   Let's block out last week when I say this _ they hadn't done
anything physically wrong to people. I mean, they dressed
different. So? They wore black. So what? It's just, they were hated
and so they felt they hated back. They hated back.
</P>
<P>
   MEG. They'd call them freaks, weirdos, faggots. It was just
stupid name calling, acting like little children. It's like my
cousins come home, they're only 2 and 3, and they come home and
start calling me names, calling each other names like butt-head and
all these other things. They probably couldn't handle it.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. People called them fags. People thought they were gay.
And that's not right. I mean, even if they were _ and which,
they're not _ it's not right to say that.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. When they call them fag, I think it's a slang term for,
like, loser. I don't think they really meant that. They were like
nerds.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. I believe these guys could have been taunted pretty
easily, because there are many different people in our school that
do this. But I want to speak not as a jock or an athlete, but for
them, in saying that these are not the only type of people who
should be targeted. It's just natural at any high school that
you're going to have different cliques and people who share
different interests.
</P>
<P>
   I can see how these guys could have easily caught a lot of, not
always physical abuse, but just verbal _ you know, someone
happening to walk by in the hall and saying, ``Hey buddy, nice
lipstick,'' just small things that I think really built up over
time. But it wasn't just one group or person in particular.
</P>
<P>
   MEG. I have a friend, he doesn't dress like everybody else. He
wears heavy metal band T-shirts, black shorts no matter what the
weather, and a black hat, and he has long hair. And friends who
normally just come up to me and talk to me and are so nice to me _
when I'm around him, they give me looks. And people come up to me
after I talk to him, they're like, ``How can you talk to him? How
can you even acknowledge his presence?' I'm like, ``It's simple,
he's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the same with Eric and Dylan. I knew both of them. I
went bowling with them occasionally. And they were extremely nice.
They never showed any signs that they'd like to go off and hurt
people.
</P>
<P>
   NICK. I don't think there's a lot of stereotyping. If I saw Eric
walk by, I'd ignore him, I wouldn't go talk to him, because what
would we talk about? We have no interests that are the same. I
don't think he wants to go in the wrestling room and practice
wrestling with me.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I was just thinking. Everyone says we stereotype them.
But I think they stereotype themselves, too. Because I had both in
class with me, and they would not talk to anyone. They would just _
they acted like they had no spirit at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Adults have a lot of concern about violent computer games and
music with violent or macabre lyrics. Is this a large part of
teen-age life today?
</P>
<P>
   MEG. I've played the game Doom that they're saying Dylan and
Eric constantly played. And I don't think it was that game. I'd go
to school and there were people that would so royally piss me off,
and I'd just go home and I'd sit on that game for hours, just
taking out my stress on it. And the next day I'd be perfectly fine.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way I get rid of my stress, instead of going out and
really killing people. It saves a lot of time. I know this sounds
weird, but some violent games are a therapy for kids.
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA. I think that works for some people. But for someone who
gets teased and ridiculed and gets angry every day at people and
then actually has things going through their mind like that _ I
think Marilyn Manson and games like that do influence them. I think
it builds up even more.
</P>
<P>
   And they wore black. I'm not saying that's bad, or stupid, I'm
just saying that it is a very depressing color that they wore every
day. And that sort of reflects on their attitudes toward things,
wearing black every day, or listening to Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the appeal of Marilyn Manson?
</P>
<P>
   NICK. Insane. Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA. Insanity, yeah. Craziness.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. OK, they listened to Marilyn Manson, but not like some
people. They listened to him every once in a while. I don't know
the appeal of him because I've never heard an entire song. They
listened to Nine Inch Nails. They listened to Rammstein.
</P>
<P>
   They listened to Rammstein and Nine Inch Nails and KMFDM because
of the beats. Because Dylan wanted to be a drummer. He didn't even
know what they were saying in Rammstein. He doesn't speak German.
He just liked the beat of the song. KMFDM is just as horrid, all
the messages are bad, but I like them because of the electric
guitar. I think that their songs sound kind of cool.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And Nine Inch Nails are some completely creepy songs, but the
beats. The same with Dr. Octagon, D.J. Spookie, all those techno
bands. They've got these beats to them.
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA. They may have listened to them for the beats, but after
someone listens to that crap over and over and over for the beats,
they do hear the lyrics and it is in their subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do the guys here think?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I have most of those CDs that they're talking about. It
doesn't bother me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do you like them?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I don't really agree with the words that they're saying.
But when I'm listening to it, I can turn it up real loud and get
out aggression while I'm, like, driving. And, I like the beats,
like you said. The beats are cool. But it's not making me psycho
listening.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD. Everybody takes it differently, and you can make it
into things that it's not. Like people blame music and video games
and all these outside influences as scapegoats. And all the people
on, like, ``Dateline'' that are doing this, they're like 50 years
old. They don't know that stuff. They don't know what we're talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. Violence has become so easy to accept for children of
this day and age that I don't think seeing someone die on a video
game or seeing people murdered on TV plays much of a role at all.
We've become so senseless to it that I don't think it really
affects anything. So by trying to edit video games, or trying to
correct songs, or prevent certain movies from coming out, I don't
think that's going to change the youth of America or how they
perceive life or violence in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do young people view guns?
</P>
<P>
   MEG. I am utterly afraid of guns. When I heard somebody had a
gun, I was fine, but then I had to jump over the pit fence and I
couldn't make it. My arms just went totally wobbly. And then I
found out he was shooting people. I broke down into tears, a mass
of tears. I couldn't find my best friend. And this was all over
guns. I just really hate them.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I have all my guns in my room in a case. I have bullets
and everything in my room.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How many guns do you have?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. How many? Probably six or seven. I could run around and
start shooting people easily. But it's morals. You just know right
from wrong. My parents have trained me with guns and everything and
my sister.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does anyone else have guns in the house?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. We have guns at our house. A lot of times it's owned by
the parents for protection. But I have a lot of friends who, like
Dustin said, have literally an arsenal of shotguns and high-powered
rifles at their house. But he's right, it is about morals and when
they are used. About having self-control.
</P>
<P>
   Q. All of these shootings have occurred at overwhelmingly white
middle-class schools. What do you make of that?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. Nothing in particular. Columbine is definitely white. I
would say of the around 2,000 kids, there are at most 200 black
kids. I'm not sure if I'm right on that.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL COMMENTS. Not that many. I think there's 20. I think
there's like 6.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. That's why I'm saying I'm not positive. But there was a
lot of speculation when it first went off that it was actually
black students that came into the school and that were shooting
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Right immediately after everyone had run out of the building and
were saying, ``What the heck are we running from?'' people were
saying, ``I don't know, I just saw some black guy in a trench coat
shooting people.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why people were making the assumption that they
were black. But, otherwise at Columbine there is generally not much
prejudice or racism, aside from prejudice against different groups
and classes.
</P>
<P>
   MEG. I am black/white mixed. And when the media is coming up
with this thing that Dylan and Eric were racist, they weren't. They
were my friends. They were very nice to me, both of them. I don't
get this whole racial thing that people are coming up with.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. Dylan and Eric did use racial slurs. Because,
unfortunately, it's becoming common. And what I have heard is they
did call Isaiah an N before they shot him. I don't think it meant
that they were racist. I think that they were just using the word
that they _ unfortunately it's true that it has bearing from the
movies and TV _ that they had learned is OK.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the Nazi stuff?
</P>
<P>
   MEG. That is the biggest load of (expletive) I've ever heard in
my entire life. OK? They never wore swastikas around their arm.
Never. Not in this entire year that I've known them. I've known
them all year. No.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. I saw some kids in the hallway, one kid who had a
swastika on his arm, and I told Dylan, and he got upset. He was
like, what's their problem? They're not Nazis. They didn't worship
Nazis. Some kid said, ``Oh I saw them reading a book on Nazis.''
They read books on Nazis because, guess what they were learning
about in World History? They were learning about the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. Everyone said that they saluted to Hitler after a strike
in bowling and stuff. That wasn't true. If they got a strike, they
would just sit down.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The police said Eric's diary was full of Nazi references.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. If Dylan and Eric were like neo-Nazis or whatever, then
they kept it secret. They didn't proclaim it. And I don't think
Dylan was. Like I said, I didn't know Eric very well, and from my
experience, maybe he was. Maybe that was what he wrote in his
diary. But that was private. And that's why it's in his diary,
because it was private.
</P>
<P>
   NICK. I don't think that it was a big racial thing. I mean, you
see who they shot at.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is this going to happen in another high school?
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA. I think that it could happen anywhere. But I think it
will happen more. Because, you know, these guys had the courage to
do it and so I think there will be followers who will try it, too,
or copycats or whatever. And I am like Rich, I am scared to death
to go to school. And I don't _ I don't know if I'll ever be able to
go back to Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do the rest of you think about going back?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. I feel that I'm obligated to go back. I can see for
other people who actually had to witness others die, it's
understandable that that's probably way too traumatic for them to
go back, to walk through the halls or anything. I can understand
that. But I feel like if they were to split up Columbine, or build
a new school, then Dylan and Eric would have essentially
accomplished their task in breaking up the school and, you know,
breaking up the community.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's going to be tough the first week, or even month, to
walk through the halls without remembering what went on. But I
think that this school is strong enough and that it's going to be
10 times as good if kids actually stick together and just fight it
out.
</P>
<P>
   NICK. I agree. I want my brother to go back. And I want the
students to go back and still compete in whatever they're doing.
Because if we don't, then it's going to make me feel like they won.
But, it's much greater than that. There's so much love in that
school.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How are you all doing?
</P>
<P>
   MEG. I was in a drawing class. I saw my friend Lance. He was
shot. My teacher would constantly tell him to sit down, sit down,
Lance. He was always standing up, walking around talking to
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night I got maybe an hour of sleep, but I had a
dream. I was walking into my drawing class and there was Lance. It
was just me, Lance and the teacher. And the teacher tells him, ``Go
sit down, Lance.'' And he goes over to his desk, sits down, and
blows up. And then I see Dylan and Eric laughing.
</P>
<P>
   I have never had a worse dream. It's been recurring for the past
week. And I just can't get rid of it. Because I've known Lance
since middle school. And I've also known Dylan and Eric all year.
I'm literally torn between them. Because I want to go see Lance,
but I want to go see Eric and Dylan. But I can't go see Eric and
Dylan. And I can't go see Lance. So I don't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is anyone else having nightmares?
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA. I haven't had nightmares, but I've hardly been able to
sleep in my room. It's in the basement. And I haven't been able to
sleep down there. I've had to sleep on the couch in the living room
because I can't go down there at night.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I usually just hang out with my friends. We stay up
until we pretty much pass out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you do that before?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. No, that's how I do it now. We just hang out with our
friends until we pretty much cannot stay awake any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Because?
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN. I just don't feel like sleeping and getting nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anything else you want to say?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW. As many times as I've heard it from parents, or
counselors, or whoever else, I've never realized as strong as I
have now that material possessions really don't mean anything to me
anymore. That really the most important thing that you can have in
the world is family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD. I'm just proud to see the community pull together this
spiritually. If we could just stay that way, this will never happen
again. We just need to see that people are people.
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. I have one more thing to add. Just three simple words,
and we've heard it a lot and it's true. We are Columbine!
</P>
<P>
   NICK. We will always be Columbine!
</P>
<P>
   DEVON. Columbine forever!
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A telling magnetic pattern in the ancient surface of Mars
appears to show that the planet in an early epoch churned with
internal heat and other powerful forces, remarkably like the
geology of Earth today, scientists reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of magnetized bands in the oldest Martian crust,
detected by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, was being hailed
by surprised planetary scientists as a major addition to the
growing body of evidence suggesting that Mars and Earth seemed to
start out much alike, then evolved fatefully into very different
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   If the observations are confirmed by further research,
scientists said, this would be one more indication that Mars,
though cold, arid and placid now, was a more active world in its
early history, also possibly a warmer place with liquid water on
the surface and even the beginnings of simple life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really excited about this totally unexpected and
serendipitous discovery,'' Dr. Mario H. Acuna, a leader of the
group reporting the magnetic findings, said on Thursday at a news
conference at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, in particular, were considered the first
strong evidence that the geological phenomenon known as plate
tectonics has existed on another planet besides Earth. Powered by
heat from a planet's molten metal core, so-called tectonic plates
float about like bits of eggshell, colliding, merging and dividing,
causing volcanoes, earthquakes, the creation of new crust and the
shifting of continents.
</P>
<P>
   In reports on the research in Friday's issue of the journal
Science, the scientists said the magnetic stripes imprinted on
parts of Mars like a bar-code were ``reminiscent of similar
magnetic features associated with sea floor spreading and crustal
genesis on Earth.'' Thus, they concluded, the pattern ``may be a
relic of plate tectonics on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of more than 1,000 orbits of Mars over the last
year, the Surveyor spacecraft's magnetometer first picked up traces
of magnetism imprinted in the planet's surface. They seemed random.
Then the striped pattern emerged. It was mainly confined to the
most ancient, heavily cratered highlands in the southern
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Here was direct evidence, the scientists said, that Mars once
had a molten core acting as a dynamo generating magnetic fields.
The stripes were created when molten material called magma bubbled
up to the surface and spread out as fresh crust. As the iron in the
magma cooled and magnetized, each new band of crust solidified in
the direction of the prevailing magnetic field, which flip-flops
several times every million years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a Martian tape recorder, the crust has preserved a fossil
record of the magnetic field directions that prevailed at different
times in the ancient past,'' said Dr. John E.P. Connerney of the
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., one of the
scientists on the discovery teams.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, the field reverses from north to south and back,
leaving stripes of alternating magnetic orientations that are best
preserved on the sea floors. The stripes are symmetrical, running
north-south on either side of mid-ocean ridges where the upwelling
magma surfaces to form new crust. It was the detection of this
pattern on sea floors in the 1960s that established plate tectonics
as a unifying principle of geophysics and one of the century's
major scientific discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   On Mars, the stripes run east-west, are wider and more strongly
magnetized than on Earth and are longer, some extending 1,200
miles. Scientists have yet to find the center where magma reached
the surface. And if the stripes are symmetrical on either side of
such a center, the pattern no longer exists or has eluded
detection.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of craters where meteorite impacts erased the
magnetic traces, scientists said, revealed that plate tectonics, or
whatever the process is, ceased to be an important factor on Mars 4
billion years ago, more than 500 million years after the planet's
formation. The planet was cooling, and its core presumably no
longer functioned as a dynamo. But plate tectonics is still
shaking, shaping and re-arranging Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the journal reports, a research team led by Connerney
wrote, ``The most straightforward interpretation of the magnetic
lineations in the Mars highland crust is that they formed early in
the planet's evolutionary history by plate tectonics and sea floor
spreading, analogous to terrestrial oceanic crust.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerney and other scientists said they were using terminology
developed for plate tectonics on Earth and did not mean to imply
that the findings were necessarily evidence for oceans on early
Mars. But they agreed that, based on what they know of terrestrial
plate tectonics, water seemed to be a necessary ingredient in the
processes.
</P>
<P>
   Observations by other spacecraft of the apparent effects of
water erosion on the Mars surface have already led most scientists
to conclude that liquid water played a role in the planet's early
history.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, scientists had assumed that the Martian surface was
like a single plate, not the several dozen crustal plates that
float on a hot mantle of Earth. Mercury and the Moon are presumably
too small to have such active geology, and Dr. James Head, a
specialist in Venus geology at Brown University, said there is ``no
definitive evidence for plate tectonics'' on Venus.
</P>
<P>
   The magnetic stripes of Mars might not have been discovered if
the Global Surveyor spacecraft's solar-power panel had not
malfunctioned. As a result, the craft had to spend a year slowly
adjusting its orbit around Mars, maneuvers that required it to dip
as low as 60 miles from the surface. At this altitude, the
magnetometer's repeated observations could pick up the surprising
magnetic stripes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the NASA news conference, Dr. Ronald Merrill, a geologist at
the University of Washington at Seattle, said, ``I'm convinced that
Mars had a magnetic field early in its history and it probably
reversed polarity,'' though he stopped short of endorsing the
plate-tectonic interpretation. Merrill said it was ``probably the
best explanation'' for the data, but he expressed concern over how
different the magnetic patterns on Mars are from the sea-floor
spreading seen on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In another article in Science, Merrill was quoted as saying,
``If plate tectonics was operating on Mars, it worked differently
or it was recorded differently by the rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, planetary scientists agreed with Dr. Vicki L.
Hansen, a geologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, who
said, ``It makes us completely rethink Mars geology.''
</P>
<P>
   And it offers a vision of things to come on Earth. As Dr. Hansen
said, Earth will eventually exhaust its internal energy and shut
down its dynamo. With no protective magnetic field, intense
radiation from the Sun will strip away the Earth's atmosphere and
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mars went through at a very young age is what will occur
on the Earth eventually,'' Dr. Hansen said.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T buyout would affect many
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AT&AMP;T is expected to announce today that it is making a
buyout offer to thousands of employees nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The package, intended to shrink the company payroll by
persuading many older workers to leave, was detailed by AT&AMP;T in
Washington, D.C., Thursday night to officials of the Communications
Workers of America, which represents AT&AMP;T's unionized work force.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, AT&AMP;T spokesman Bryant Steele would say only that,
despite rampant rumors, there was no layoff announcement planned
for today. ``We are aware that there has been some speculation
among employees that there would be a downsizing announcement.
There is not one planned. Downsizing is a forced reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has already been through some serious cuts. In 1996, AT&AMP;T
announced plans to slash 40,000 of its roughly 140,000-employee
work force, much of that through divesting itself of units now
known as Lucent and NCR, and the rest through voluntary severance.
Since Michael Armstrong became chief executive in 1997, AT&AMP;T has
continued to shed some jobs while growing in other areas _
especially by acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The spending spree, intended to extend AT&AMP;T's reach into many
forms of communications, has also intensified the need for further
cost-cutting elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has a $70 billion deal to purchase Tele-Communications
Inc., the country's second-largest cable company. AT&AMP;T last week
bid $62.5 billion for MediaOne. Previously, AT&AMP;T paid $11 billion
for Teleport. This week, AT&AMP;T announced a $1.8 billion investment
in Japan Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Before divesting itself of the regional phone companies like
BellSouth, AT&AMP;T had a payroll of more than 300,000.

U.S. TO SELL RADAR SYSTEM TO TAIWAN, OVER BEIJING'S PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States has decided to sell an
early-warning radar system to Taiwan that would allow the Taiwanese
to monitor the launch of Chinese ballistic missiles or manned
bombers, Clinton administration officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale has already drawn protests from Beijing and was opposed
by a group of mid-level administration officials who believed that
it would worsen recent tensions between Washington and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The administration approved the sale at the recommendation of
senior policy-makers from the White House, the State Department and
the Pentagon who believed that China's deployment of large numbers
of short-range missiles along its coastline posed a serious
military threat to Taiwan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department report presented earlier this year to
Congress found that ``Taiwan's most significant vulnerability is
its limited capacity to defend against the growing arsenal of
Chinese ballistic missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The radar system, which could be worth hundreds of millions of
dollars to U.S. defense contractors, would provide Taiwan with
several minutes' warning of the launch of ballistic missiles on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that the administration has finally recognized
that it is appropriate to help the Taiwanese protect themselves,''
said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
International Affairs Committee. ``If China is pointing missiles at
Taiwan, I would expect Taiwan to try to defend itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in April, Gilman threatened to introduce legislation to
permit the sale if the Clinton administration had refused to
approve the radar deal.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that the Chinese had no reason to be
concerned about the sale of the radar ``because they're the ones
putting the missiles along the coastline in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Yu Shuning,
said the embassy had already issued a formal protest to the Clinton
administration over the decision on the radar sale. The deal was
first reported earlier this week by news organizations in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made serious representations with the U.S. side,'' Yu
said. ``We say that any arms sales to Taiwan by any country in the
world constitutes an infringement on Chinese sovereignty, an
interference in our internal affairs.'' Beijing considers Taiwan,
the refuge for the Chinese Nationalists after their defeat by the
Communists in 1949, a breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said opposition to the sale of the
radars to Taiwan was voiced by mid-level officers at the White
House and State Department who said that the deal would needlessly
provoke China at a time when tensions are already high over trade
disagreements and over allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But government critics of the radar deal were overruled by
superiors. A senior administration official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said that top policy-makers at the White House, the
State Department and the Pentagon were all agreed that the sale
should be approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a fairly good meeting of the minds on
this,'' the official said. ``We have told the Taiwanese that we
will meet their legitimate defensive needs. And a passive
early-warning system is clearly a legitimate defensive need.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said there was still no agreement with
Taiwan over exactly what type of radar system would be approved,
which companies would build it, and how much it would cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an agreement in principal,'' the senior official
said. ``There wasn't a decision on a specific system.'' Among the
contractors thought likely to be asked to bid on the contract are
Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Thomson-CSF of France.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's government said in a report in February that it had
determined through intelligence sources that China had deployed
more than 100 ballistic missiles that could be fired across the
Taiwan Strait at the island. The Taiwanese have cited the
intelligence in arguing the need for development of a
missile-defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on the radar system was reached during talks with
senior Taiwan military officers who were in Washington this week on
an annual arms buying tour.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which was passed by
Congress after the United States broke off formal diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and established ties to Beijing, the United
States agreed to provide the island with the weapons that it needed
to defend itself from attack by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan government had no comment Thursday on the radar sale.
A spokesman for the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office in Washington, which serves as de facto embassy for Taiwan
here, said that the Clinton administration had requested that it
not issue any statement on the agreement.

BRITAIN CARVING ITS OWN PATH IN WORLD DIPLOMACY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Once mocked in UN quarters as the ``little
poodle'' of US diplomacy for its slavish obedience to US foreign
policy, Britain, it seems, is shedding its status as America's
junior partner on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   While the personal relationship between British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and President Bill Clinton remains strong, Britain has
demonstrated an increasing determination to go its own way, even if
it means clashing with its trans-Atlantic ally.
</P>
<P>
   And Washington finds itself following as often as leading, as
Britain asserts leadership in global trouble spots, from Kosovo to
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   While Blair has attracted attention for pressing Washington to
deploy ground troops, Britain has struck out on its own in other
areas. Britain paved the way for Washington's first face-to-face
talks with Libya in nearly a decade. And in recent weeks, London
has demonstrated rare independence on its Iraq policy, spearheading
an effort to dismantle the UN Special Commission, the weapons
inspection unit responsible for disarming Baghdad, and to replace
it with a new inspection team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of agreement between the US and Britain
from a strategic standpoint, but tactically the Brits are going
more and more their own way,'' said James Placke, a former US
diplomat who tracks Iraq and Libya for Cambridge Energy Research
Associates. ``Until recently, British people I talked to would
accuse Blair of being a Clinton lapdog. I haven't heard those
comments for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that Britain is filling a vacuum left by an
administration preoccupied with the domestic political agenda and
distracted by a year of political scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the British-American relationship resembles a mature
marriage in which each partner has a unique identity and opinion.
Whatever the case, it remains clear that the vaunted ``special
relationship'' will be tested as the two allies grapple with some
of the most vexing challenges of the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's activist foreign policy team has been received with
ambivalence by the Clinton administration, but its skill has
impressed many in the US foreign policy establishment. Some have
portrayed Blair as a liberal version of Margaret Thatcher, the
conservative British prime minister who urged President George Bush
not to ``go wobbly on me'' on the eve of the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``True leadership comes from the gut. You know what you have to
do and you do it,'' said Allan Gerson, a senior analyst at the
Council on Foreign Relations, who tracks Libya. ``I think Blair has
that; he's been operating from the gut and Clinton has been playing
catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerson and other observers say that London played the lead role
in laying the groundwork for Libya's handover of two suspects in
the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy allowed the administration to gauge public reaction
to the idea of holding a trial in the Netherlands under Scottish
law before officially embracing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a big player and the government needed us to go along
with it,'' said George Williams, the president of the Victims of
Pan AM Flight 103, an association of victims' families that
ultimately backed the trial. ``If not, they wouldn't have been able
to go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   While US officials ultimately followed Britain's lead on Libya,
they have been reluctant to endorse British maneuvering over Iraq
policy. Although Britain's warplanes continue to accompany US
fighters on bombing raids in the no-fly zones of northern and
southern Iraq, London has shown a greater desire than Washington to
reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposition from Washington, Britain and the Netherlands
introduced a proposal into the UN Security Council earlier this
month to create a new weapons inspection unit to replace a UN arms
control unit that was recently tainted by revelations that it was
used as a cover for US spying.
</P>
<P>
   The British proposal, designed to break an impasse in the
15-nation Security Council, would enable Iraq to more easily import
essential humanitarian goods and permit foreign investment in
Iraq's devastated oil infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, so far, has exhibited little interest in
compromising with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials say that Britain's departure from US policy on Iraq
reflects a fundamental clash of interests.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the United States is seeking greater freedom to
use military force against its adversaries, Britain is seeking to
preserve a role for the Security Council, where it is one of five
countries with veto power, in overseeing international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brits came to the conclusion long before the US that
UNSCOM will never go back into Iraq, but they wanted to keep the
ball moving,'' a senior UN official said. ``They realize that their
seat on the Security Council maintains their status in the world as
a major power.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's assertiveness has developed quietly, but steadily,
since Blair came to power in May 1997, after a landslide victory
over the conservatives. With a strong mandate, he has exercised
influence even in the most remote parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Britain has dispatched military trainers to
rebuild a defeated national army in the former British colony of
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the Balkans that Britain is taking its greatest
risks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington last week, on the eve of the NATO anniversary
commemoration, Blair and Clinton held their own summit in which the
British prime minister made a case for deploying ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually accused of subservience to big cousin Bill, Blair had
this time reversed the role,'' The Observer, the London newspaper,
saidthis week. ``By the end, Blair had become the crusading hawk of
the NATO alliance, called by some in Washington last week `the
leader of NATO.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Blairite,'' said Ivo Daalder, the former chief Balkans
specialist at the US National Security Council, now at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are very interested in foreign policy and they
want to do the right thing. They are making the decisions that the
United States is not willing to take,'' Daalder said.
</P>
<P>
   Daalder also recalled that NATO began its hunt for war criminals
in Bosnia shortly after Blair came into power. On July 10, British
SAS commandos made their first arrest of Bosnian war criminals. The
man apprehended was the former police chief of Prijidor, Simo
Drljaca. Then, one of the region's architects of ethnic cleansing,
Milan Kovacevic, was sent to The Hague to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the late summer of 1997, Britain decided at a Cabinet-level
meeting that the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo could be solved only
through military means. Britain urged the United States to threaten
air power and to be prepared to use ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which mirrored the thinking of the Clinton
administration's most hawkish Cabinet member, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, received a chilly response from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to us and we turned them down flat on the ground
troops,'' said Daalder.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the British may have the last word. While the White House
and Pentagon continued to insist that the air war will prevail
alone, President Clinton said last week that he supported NATO's
decision to draw up contingency plans for a ground war.

 &HT;    Documentary best when it slows down
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One wonders, while reelin' in the years of CNN's new
overview of the century, whether the show was edited while R.E.M.'s
``It's the End of the World As We Know It (and I Feel Fine)''
played in the background: ``Leonard Bernstein, Leonid Brezhnev,
Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Billy Joel's more coherent but every bit as whiplashed
``We Didn't Start the Fire'': ``Old Miss, John Glenn, Liston beats
Patterson, Pope Paul, Malcolm X, British politician sex.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about the speed at which the 10-part ``Celebrate the
Century'' clips along. The debut hour Sunday, for example, touches
on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Anne Frank, Gandhi, women's
suffrage, Rasputin, Nelson Mandela, the invention of the crossword
puzzle, the Titanic, the Indianapolis 500, Henry Ford, Picasso,
Freud, motion pictures, Sarajevo, Kitty Hawk and Einstein's theory
of relativity, which stated that the speed of light is a constant,
but not that someday TV shows would be pasted together at that
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Plus there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are several ways to look back on a century, and
they've all been tried lately. ABC's ``The Century'' concentrated
on a handful of emblematic stories and told them with depth and in
detail. CNN's ``The Cold War'' (which was far better than
``Celebrate'') wrung every drop it could from the second half of
the century. The History Channel's ``America's Time,'' which just
concluded, focused on America's dominance, and PBS' ``The People
Century,'' which started last year and resumes in June, is more
thematic.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably more celebrating of any century than anyone
wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrate the Century'' doesn't have the razzle-dazzle of an
MTV video, just the pacing. The first hour, which covers the years
1900-1914, is best when it slows down, which it does twice. The
first time is to present Picasso, Freud and Einstein in context,
and to explain why what they did was both revolutionary and
important. The second time is to explain the hows and whys of the
beginning of World War I, a horribly complex topic presented here
with startling clarity (although history buffs naturally will want
more).
</P>
<P>
   David L. Wolper (``Roots'') produced ``Celebrate'' for CNN. He
uses actor Christopher Plummer to narrate, and hired noted jazz
trumpeter Wynton Marsalis to play thematically related songs in the
bumpers between segments (such as ``Nearer My God to Thee'' before
the Titanic).
</P>
<P>
   But there are choices that will bother documentary purists.
``Celebrate'' mixes Hollywood movie footage of historical events
with real footage. Not that anyone should be ``fooled,'' but it's
disconcerting to see a clip of Ben Kingsley playing Gandhi in the
movie, followed immediately by the real Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrate the Century''
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Sunday on CNN .

 &HT;    Mississippi town finds favor in `Fortune'
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 2,
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLY SPRINGS, Miss. _ On Easter Sunday, the Rev. Milton Winter
of the First Presbyterian Church delivered some bad news and some
good news. Jewel Mae Orcutt was dead, but the Easter play would go
on as scheduled Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation roared with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Winter and his congregation are real, but Jewel Mae Orcutt and
the Easter play are a part of the fictional Holly Springs portrayed
in ``Cookie's Fortune,'' director Robert Altman's latest acclaimed
film playing in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   A drawling, tender story of friendship and family
eccentricities, the movie has a central character not listed in the
credits: The north Mississippi town of Holly Springs (population
7,200). Identified in the beginning of the film as the place where
the story unfolds, it is also where the entire film was shot. And
the depiction of the town is so flattering, residents are happy if
the world thinks the fictional Holly Springs is the real one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's loved it,'' said Vickie Carlton, news editor of
the South Reporter, the local newspaper. ``It was such a positive
portrayal of the town, while a lot of Southern films are not. You
couldn't find a travel book that could make the town look more
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents haven't seen ``Cookie's Fortune''; there's no
movie theater here and the closest place to see it is Memphis, 40
minutes away. But some 1,800 people went to three special
screenings Easter weekend at nearby Rust College. (The movie is
playing at metro Atlanta theaters.)
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hartwell, who works at the Center for the Study of Southern
Culture at the University of Mississippi, went to the premiere and
said it was a refreshing change to see a movie about Mississippi
where race was not the main focus. The movie's writer, Anne Rapp,
is a graduate of the university's Southern studies program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't `Mississippi Burning,''' Hartwell said. ``It makes
Mississippi look eccentric but nice, not eccentric and mean. It's
about race but not in a way that would hurt anybody's feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Holly Springs, in celluloid and in reality, embodies many of the
South's best qualities. Set on a hill, its streets are lined with
restored antebellum mansions and Victorian cottages, its lawns drip
with wisteria and honeysuckle, its cemetery is crammed with Civil
War heroes and 13 Confederate generals. The downtown square is rare
in its authenticity. Most of the storefronts around the grand brick
courthouse still bustle with businesses that haven't yet succumbed
to the call of the strip mall. And people are proud of their town.
One man drew a map for a visitor to his favorite dogwood tree in a
neighbor's yard.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there is still time for lunch with friends at the City
Cafe. People take their time with their errands, lingering on
stools by shopkeepers' counters and telling long stories their
audience has probably heard a time or two before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie made you feel that nobody gets in a hurry to worry
about things,'' said resident Bob Carrington. ``And that's how it
is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Greer, who was having lunch with Carrington at City Cafe,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any deception in the way Holly Springs normally
conducts life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for that thing about the jail. In the movie, the good ol'
boy sheriff is so lax with security that he leaves the jail cell
unlocked with a murder suspect inside. How does he know the suspect
is innocent? Because he's fished with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't happen in this day and time,'' Carrington said
with a laugh. ``We aren't `Mayberry RFD' at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The county jail is locked up tight, with the receptionist
ensconced behind bulletproof glass. It's doubtful the murder
suspect, Willis, played by Charles S. Dutton, would have had access
to his beloved Wild Turkey in a jail that doesn't even allow
visitors to bring prisoners fruit.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the sheriff played by Ned Beatty in the film,
Marshall County Sheriff Kenneth Dickerson doesn't play Scrabble
with inmates. He was unavailable to speak to a reporter on a recent
day because he was out chasing a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little drier,'' said resident Charlie Shaw. ``But he's
the best sheriff we ever had. He enforces the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Exaggerated sleepiness is one of a few liberties Altman and Rapp
took in their portrayal of Holly Springs. The streets all look
deserted in the film, when in fact they are usually pretty busy.
And there's not just one attorney in town: There's about 10 on the
square alone.
</P>
<P>
   And Mississippi's demons, so far removed from ``Cookie's
Fortune,'' sometimes still haunt the real Holly Springs. The Ku
Klux Klan recently threw fliers in residents' yards suggesting
there should be a rally in town.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's eccentrics were not based on real residents, but
everyone agrees Altman could have had his pick if he was looking
for real-life models.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of weirdos here _ that's what I call 'em,''
said John Byrand, who was shooting the breeze inside a hardware
store on the square.
</P>
<P>
   There's Ju Ju, for example. He only comes out at night, and
carries pliers and copper wire and stops people on the street and
makes key chains for them.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a wonder how Altman could depict Holly Springs without
using its most famous eccentric _ Paul MacLeod. He's the creator of
Graceland Too, an antebellum home that MacLeod has spent 44 years
turning into a museum of Elvis Presley collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   MacLeod's obsession has driven him to keep anything and
everything with even the most fragile connection to the King.
Floors, walls and ceilings of the crumbling home are covered in
memorabilia ranging from priceless to worthless.
</P>
<P>
   MacLeod calls his home a shrine to ``the greatest entertainer
and humanitarian that has ever lived.'' His son is named Elvis
Aaron Presley MacLeod, and as a child bore a striking resemblance
to his namesake.
</P>
<P>
   After performing a leg-shaking Elvis dance and singing ``Kiss-uh
me once, kiss-uh me twice'' into a plastic echoing microphone some
college students gave him, MacLeod reflects on his absence from
``Cookie's Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't bother me,'' he said, smoothing down his dyed black,
pomaded hair. ``I've had lots of people wanting to make a movie
about my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cast of ``Cookie's Fortune'' dropped by Graceland
Too when they were in town, he said. He has a picture of actor
Chris O'Donnell when he visited, playing an inflatable Elvis
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks last spring, the fictional and the real Holly
Springs mixed and mingled. More than 20 people moved out of their
homes to let the stars have a place to stay. And the cast went
about town doing normal things, blending into the community like
regular folks. People saw Glenn Close riding her bike, O'Donnell
playing golf, and Julianne Moore pumping gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing to see them in restaurants and in stores,''
said Gwen Henshaw, who works in the county courthouse. ``They were
just like anyone, and we'd just talk to them like they'd been here
all their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, residents are waiting to see if their newfound fame will
change anything. Some people hope it will attract visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent editorial in the South Reporter, editor and
publisher Walter Webb summed up that hope:
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be just the time when Holly Springs is prepared to
take advantage of a good opportunity to become the tourist
destination that has been dreamed about for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Glenn Close, Charles S. Dutton, Liv Tyler and Julianne
Moore. Directed by Robert Altman.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13 for sexually suggestive scenes. At metro theaters. 2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Goes down smooth and easy. The laid-back,
affectionate tone is set early on by Dave Stewart's bluesy score
and by Altman's leisurely, let's-just-look-around approach to Anne
Rapp's script. Once the ostensible plot kicks in, you can sense
that Altman is still more interested in poking around among his
various characters than in getting on with the investigation of the
supposed murder.
</P>

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies

<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro,
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) never becomes the laugh-riot it
could be. It's an offer you could refuse, but the stars (plus Lisa
Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make it worthwhile. (SM)1 hour, 46
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Geniuses''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kathleen Turner,
</P>
<P>
   Peter MacNicol, Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   PG
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner and Peter MacNicol play rival researchers _ she
the breathy villainess, he the bland do-bee _ rushing to crack the
talk code emanating from five brilliant babes. Sly _ the toddler
leader _ has got a secret twin and you've got yourself 94 minutes
chock full of stupid pint-sized tricks from the brain of Bob Clark.
At first, ``Geniuses'' is dumb, and then it just gets dumber. (Bob
Longino) 94 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Glenn Close,
</P>
<P>
   Charles S. Dutton, Liv Tyler
</P>
<P>
   and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (sexually suggestive scenes)
</P>
<P>
   This Southern gothic shaggy-dog story goes down as sweet and
smooth as a double shot of Jack Black. Glenn Close, Julianne Moore,
Charles S. Dutton, Liv Tyler, Chris O'Donnell, Ned Beatty and Lyle
Lovett are among those involved in the unexpected death of a gently
demented Mississippi widow (Patricia Neal.) A mellow Robert Altman
directs this magnolia-scented whimsy with affection and compassion.
(ERG) 2 hours. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar,
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Phillippe and Selma Blair.
</P>
<P>
   R (profanity, sexual situations, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Last decade's ``Dangerous Liaisons'' gets a makeover with Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as a couple of desultorily rich
teens manipulating the romantic lives of everyone around them,
purely for their own amusement and without a whit of concern about
who may be hurt in the process. It's practically guaranteed to be a
runaway hit with the teen audience. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 37
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancemaker''
</P>
<P>
   a documentary
</P>
<P>
   Unrated (contains a glimpse of rear nudity)
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancemaker'' is a documentary purporting to be a portrait of
Paul Taylor. It isn't. We don't learn much about Taylor, but we see
why some call him the country's best choreographer. The troupe's
dysfunctional, surrogate-family structure could be a fascinating
subject; but everyone interviewed (including Taylor and company
members) tiptoe around the man's rep as a loner and his personal
life. (SM) 1 hour, 38 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug's 1st Movie''
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Thomas
</P>
<P>
   McHugh, Fred Newman,
</P>
<P>
   Constance Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   G
</P>
<P>
   Like the Nickelodeon series on which it's based, this movie's
appeal is centered in the carefully nurtured normalcy of its title
character, Doug Funnie, a nice kid coping with some typical preteen
passions. The gently anarchic, pro-environment plot is simply a
framework to dispense the quiet main-street morals and vivid
comic-book colors that make the wholesome Doug a superstar with
children. (Tom Sabulis) 1 hour, 17 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elodie Boucher
</P>
<P>
   and Natacha Regnier.
</P>
<P>
   R (strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   A good film noir _ even a tongue-in-cheek one, like this wants
to be _ has to ground its hairpin plot with real people. No such
luck here. The folks in this movie, about a sex-death-and-insurance
scam, are as slickly remote as the lavish set decor and
cinematography. (SM) 1 hour, 55 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``EDtv''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey
</P>
<P>
   and Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related situations)
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey plays the subject of a 24-hour-a-day
documentary in Ron Howard's new comedy. Yeah, it's too much like
``Truman Show'' for its own good, but the slick packaging and
strong cast (including Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres and Martin
Landau) help it stand on its own. (SM) 2 hours, 3 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Connery
</P>
<P>
   and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (violence and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   A thriller with no thrills. A he/she sexual pas de deux with
little chemistry. Sean Connery plays Max, a dapper thief swiping
priceless works of art and computer chips. A shapely insurance
agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) slinks into the picture and
``Entrapment'' becomes a cat-and-mouse game with lots of twists and
turns. Sadly, it's almost always a bore. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 50
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest''
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``eXistenZ''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh
</P>
<P>
   and Jude Law.
</P>
<P>
   R (violence, sexual themes,
</P>
<P>
   general nastiness)
</P>
<P>
   n the near future, virtual-reality games have become so
mind-blowing that a counter-movement called realists has arisen.
One of their targets is celebrity game inventor Jennifer Jason
Leigh, a.k.a. the ``game-pod goddess.'' Fans of director David
Cronenberg know to expect mutilations, mutations and pitch-black
humor. But whether he's cracking you up or grossing you out, his is
a unique cinematic vision. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A -
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (profanity, sexuality, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Opposites attract as strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his
wedding with free-spirit Sandra Bullock. Like ``My Best Friend's
Wedding,'' it's a savvy blend of romantic-comedy formula and wise
'90s updates. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 41 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Go''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Polley, Scott Wolf,
</P>
<P>
   Katie Holmes, Jay Mohr.
</P>
<P>
   R (drug content, sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence)
</P>
<P>
   A three-part comedy-drama unfolding on a single Christmas Eve,
it has the energetic, late-night delirium of a Chinese fire drill.
You could think of it as a movie built on ``X's.'' We get Xmas,
exhilaration, exhaustion, excitement and the drug called ecstasy,
better known as X. It's a bright, shining package. And though it
turns out to be pretty empty, you can't help admiring how cleverly
it's wrapped. (SM) 1 hour, 42 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``God Said `Ha!'''
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Julia Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A one-woman autobiographical show with ``Saturday Night Live''
alum Julia Sweeney talking about her brother's cancer, her parents
and her own illness. Lacking special effects or sex scenes _ and
with death as its undeniable subtext _ it's definitely a grown-up
film. And it proves laughter is indeed the best medicine. (Jill
Vejnoska) 1 hour, 27 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Hideous Kinky''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Winslet.
</P>
<P>
   R (brief nudity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Kate Winslet stars in this independent film about a single mom
who takes her daughters to 1972 Marrakesh in search of
enlightenment. Set in the waning days of flower power, the movie
portrays a generation whose idealism had its poisonous side.
Winslet gives a wondrously brave performance as a loving but
blinkered mother whose feckless romanticism makes her a benign
menace to her kids. (ERG) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Life''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   R (language, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence bicker for more than 60 years
in this sometimes hilarious and racially poignant prison comedy.
How they landed in a Mississippi correctional facility with life
sentences isn't nearly as important as the knack these talented
performers have for taking turns at generating laughs out of a
throwaway script. (Bob Longino). At metro theaters. 1 hour, 49
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Moran and Jason Flemyng.
</P>
<P>
   R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Smokin'. This whip-smart lark is an English caper comedy
glistening with confidence and a wicked sense of humor. Four
likable, conniving East End lads have a week to settle the debt
they owe a hood named Hatchet Harry. Rookie writer/director Guy
Ritchie piles on the characters, plot twists and violence, but one
thing is clear: everyone involved had a fine time making this
movie. You'll have fun watching it. (ERG) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost &AMP; Found''
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Spade
</P>
<P>
   and Sophie Marceau.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (profanity and gross-out scenes)
</P>
<P>
   There's something about David Spade's new movie ``Lost &AMP; Found''
that's way too much like last summer's over-the-top _ and better _
comedy ``There's Something About Mary.'' Like gross humor that'll
kick your gag reflex into gear. Still, Spade's flick has its
moments _ especially his knockout impersonation of Neil Diamond.
(Bob Longino) 1 hour, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne,
</P>
<P>
   Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure starring Keanu Reeves that should please both comic
book fanatics and mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence
with stunning special effects and action, it's a movie that earns
its explosions, high kicks and cascades of spent bullets. (SM) 2
hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Metroland''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Bale
</P>
<P>
   and Emily Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Not rated (but there is sex, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   This film wonders if settling down is the same as selling out.
In 1977, a 30-ish ad man (Christian Bale) with a wife (Emily
Watson), baby, mortgage, etc. is taunted by his free-wheeling '60s
youth when an old buddy shows up. The movie starts well but seems
to lose energy. Still, the theme is worthy and the performances
good, especially Watson, who does hard-headed sensible as well as
high-strung flaky. (ERG) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Name Is Joe''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Peter Mullan.
</P>
<P>
   R (language, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   some discreet sex and mild violence)
</P>
<P>
   The titular Joe (Peter Mullan) is another of director Ken
Loach's sturdy working-class blokes. A recovering Glasgow
alcoholic, Joe begins a tentative and touching affair with a
good-hearted social worker. But his fragile peace with his past
becomes achingly clear, threatening their relationship. A slight
but affecting film anchored by Mullan's great performance (he won
best actor at Cannes) and Loach's evocative direction. (ERG) 1 hour
and 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Never Been Kissed''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore
</P>
<P>
   and David Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references)
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore is Josie Geller, a mid-20s newspaper copy editor
and former high school dweeb (``Josie Grossie,'' they called her)
who goes back to teenville as an undercover reporter, promptly
relives high school hell and pretty much bumbles her way to
popularity. Everything about her career is implausible. The movie's
jokes are lame, its situations loopy. But Barrymore does make a go
of it. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use,
</P>
<P>
   some thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teenager Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. (SM) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Out-of-Towners''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Goldie Hawn and John Cleese.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13
</P>
<P>
   It's a mess from the start. Henry (Steve Martin) and Nancy Clark
(Goldie Hawn) are a long-married couple from Ohio trying to
redefine their lives now that the children are grown. They land in
New York and high jinks ensue. The only time the film hints at the
madcap success it could be is when John Cleese appears as the
secretly cross-dressing hotel manager. (Drew Jubera) 1 hour, 31
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing Tin''
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bob Thornton,
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   A juiced-up ensemble comedy-drama that loses its bearings
halfway through its flight. John Cusak and Billy Bob Thornton play
rival air traffic controllers who keep 747s from colliding every
few seconds in the super-crowded sky above Manhattan. The talented
supporting cast includes Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth'') and
Angelina Jolie. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   2 hours , 3 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscars, including best picture. Poor, overworked Will
Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish his play ``Romeo and
Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win the hand of
noblewoman Viola
</P>
<P>
   (Gwyneth Paltrow, who received an Oscar for best actress) in
this witty comedy that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot
devices. (SM) 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``SLC Punk!''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Lillard.
</P>
<P>
   R (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   violent anti-social behavior, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   This energetic, amusing but scattered film introduces us to
Stevo's (Matthew Lillard) world of beer blasts, punk bands, acid
trips and run-ins with the rednecks of Salt Lake City, circa 1985.
A picaresque romp, it wants to be a ``Trainspotting''-Lite, an
Americanized howl against conformity that winds up, well,
conforming. (SM) 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``10 Things I Hate About You''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Stiles and
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (sex-related dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   alcohol/drug-related scenes)
</P>
<P>
   What starts out as a terrible teen version of ``The Taming of
the Shrew'' unexpectedly starts to percolate with wit and charm,
thanks largely to its Kate-and-Petruchio stand-ins, Kat (Julia
Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger). The script can't go too far
wrong with Shakespeare's plot. (It's worked for 400 years.)
References to the original verge on precious. But the film also has
a few nutty touches of its own. (SM) 1 hour, 34 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   Not rated
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves''
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.

 &HT;    `Angels' gives meaning to everyday moments
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two women in their early 20s meet in a small French town and
decide to share an apartment. They scrounge for odd jobs; they
flirt with guys, joke and argue. They smoke cigarettes and drink
coffee and share late-night bar talk about getting money, getting
out.
</P>
<P>
   Not a lot happens in ``The Dreamlife of Angels,'' but a lot
happens. Finding the miraculous in the mundane, the feature debut
from director Erick Zonca is the kind of movie that finds grace in
small details, in a glance or the way someone smiles.
</P>
<P>
   We first meet Isa (Elodie Bouchez) trudging along a Lille street
under a mountainous backpack. Short-cropped and playful, she's a
curious imp who peddles handmade greeting cards to strangers,
pretending the money benefits immigrants. Bluffing her way through
a job at a sewing factory, she hooks up with languorous blonde
Marie (Natacha Regnier), who's caretaking the flat of a mother and
daughter; they're in the hospital, comatose after a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately inseparable, Isa and Marie romp through town like
caffeinated teenagers, cruising men and cutting up. At night, they
tag-team a pair of bouncers, trying to sneak into a concert at
their club. They don't get in. But they become pals with the guys,
Fredo and Charly (Jo Prestia and Patrick Mercado).
</P>
<P>
   They also get to know the club's owner, a rich playboy named
Chriss (Gregoire Colin), who takes a proprietary interest in Marie.
She resists him at first. ``I don't get stuck on guys,'' she tells
Isa. ``They get on my nerves.'' But the line reveals itself as a
defensive posture. Marie becomes increasingly involved with the
hot-and-cold Chriss, the sort of guy who promises a weekend trip to
the family beach house, then never calls.
</P>
<P>
   Isa has her own obsession: the girl in the hospital, Sandrine,
whose diary she finds and reads with rapt interest. She even visits
Sandrine, sitting bedside as the girl's eyelids flutter from
endless dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're screwed up and you don't realize it,'' Marie tells Isa
when she hears about this. At times, we're liable to agree with
her. But our ideas about the women change the more we get to know
them. It seems that Marie, with her veiled insouciance and bottled
rage, is the more practical of the two. But perceptions change as
we study the ways the women engage (or don't) with the world, the
ways they shield themselves (or not) from emotion.
</P>
<P>
   And the emotions here are instantly recognizable as the women
try to make what they can of the few joys and possibilities their
daily grind offers. Zonca shoots his film with a documentarian
style that registers every nuance. (One shocking moment is all the
more powerful because of its casual presentation.) ``Dreamlife'' is
a remarkable case of empathy, a bittersweet love letter to the
everyday.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit goes to the actresses, who chart a symbiotic
friendship as deep and volatile as a love match. Isa and Marie grow
from girlish infatuation with each other to the sort of deep
familiarity that breeds contempt. During the filming, the two
shared an apartment; their close contact pays off onscreen in
performances that are luminously real. There's not a false, actory
moment in the whole movie. It's no wonder they shared the best
actress prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival. They deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The
</P>
<P>
   Dreamlife
</P>
<P>
   of Angels''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier. Rated R for strong
sexuality. In French, with subtitles. At Lefont Plaza. 1 hour, 52
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A beautiful character study of two young women
trying to make sense of life in a working-class town.

 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why would somebody make a movie about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Many people react that way upon hearing the story line of Julia
Sweeney's new autobiographical movie: Recently divorced and
thrilled to be living alone, she unexpectedly wound up taking in
her terminally ill brother (who had no health insurance) and their
parents (who came from out of town and just wanted to help). Throw
in a few more salient details _ it's a one-woman show filmed on a
stage and, oh yes, Sweeney herself comes down with cervical cancer
near the end _ and suddenly those same people may decide to rush
off and see ``The Matrix'' again.
</P>
<P>
   Which is unfortunate, because ``God Said `Ha!' '' is enjoyable
for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it's very
funny. There's the family stuff: Her parents move in and soon it's
less Julia's home than it's theirs, a place where pasta is once
again known as ``noodles,'' smoking is verboten and the
thirtysomething divorcee has to sneak around to be with her
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Even the medical stuff: A doctor trying to persuade Sweeney's
brother, Mike, to start taking his medicine via a shunt inserted
directly into his head assures him that all his patients ``love''
their shunts. Thereafter, Julia recalls, Mike regularly lightened
some of their gloomiest moments by shouting out with false
heartiness, ``I love my shunt!''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, ``God Says `Ha!' '' works because it feels
authentic. (If you haven't lost a beloved sibling way too young,
way too painfully, you'll just have to trust us on this one.) But
it never feels like too much: ``Saturday Night Live'' alumna
Sweeney may be a seasoned performer, but one never senses her
taking undue liberties simply for the sake of a good line. Or,
worse, already scheming to plumb her personal life some more for a
``God Said `Ha!' 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking special effects or sex scenes _ and with death as its
undeniable subtext _ ``God Said `Ha!' '' is definitely a grown-up
film. See it, and grow up a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``God Said `Ha!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A one-woman show starring Julia Sweeney. Rated PG-13. At
Cinefest. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Laughter is the best medicine.

 &HT;    Quick Look at New Movies
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ART FILM
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancemaker''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A documentary involving the works of choreographer Paul Taylor.
Unrated, but contains a glimpse of rear nudity. At Toco Hills. 1
hour,
</P>
<P>
   38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Works best as a celebration of dance, rather than a
study of the dancemaker.
</P>
<P>
   A superficial look at a dance genius
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancers'' might be a better title for ``Dancemaker,'' a
documentary purporting to be a portrait of Paul Taylor. It isn't.
We don't get to know much about Taylor _ but we amply see why some
call him the country's best choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Diamond's film kicks off with a fragment of the roiling
dance ``Esplanade.'' It's an exuberant braid of choreographed
couples spinning and tumbling across the floor _ then whirling into
the wings offstage, panting and pouring sweat. It's emblematic of
Taylor's style: sexy, inventive and astonishingly physical in ways
that can quickly turn a company member into an ex- company member.
Throughout the film, we hear the war stories: torn tendons,
strained back muscles.
</P>
<P>
   We also get news of Taylor's mercurial moods, including the time
he fired every single one of his dancers because they wanted to
take time off for the holidays. But how they won him back by
bringing him a Christmas tree. The troupe's dysfunctional,
surrogate-family structure could be a fascinating subject; but
everyone interviewed (including Taylor and current and former
company members) tiptoe around the man's rep as a moody loner and
his veiled personal life.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much of a documentary, but it's a knockout display of
dance.
</P>

<P>
   DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. PG-13. At metro
theaters. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It's you and Sean Connery, trapped in sheer
drudgery.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped _ with no thrills
</P>
<P>
   They don't really make movies like ``Entrapment'' anymore. There
are plenty of reasons for that, and all of them are evident to
anybody trapped in a theater showing this movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' is a thriller with no thrills. A he/she sexual
pas de deux with little chemistry. A star vehicle with a talented
star _ in this case, Sean Connery _ who, sadly, can no longer carry
a movie burdened with a weak script just by being in it.
</P>
<P>
   Connery plays Max, a dapper thief swiping priceless works of art
and computer chips. A shapely insurance agent (Catherine
Zeta-Jones) slinks into the picture and ``Entrapment'' becomes a
cat-and-mouse game with lots of twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost always a bore _ lots of running to escape the
authorities, lots of implausible disappearing acts to illustrate
what a nifty cat burglar Max is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' does have some nice scenery, especially
Scotland's Isle of Mull. But anybody who's seen the movie's preview
has already witnessed it's most stunning visual _ Zeta-Jones'
Spandex-clad posterior rising and falling as she trains to elude a
treasure's protective laser beams. Yes, it's in the movie. Twice.
Once in Spandex and again later as Zeta-Jones performs a heist in a
black leather catsuit.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only part of ``Entrapment'' you'll ever remember.

 &HT;    Prequel launches its own, darker sound
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 2.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's not the ``Star Wars'' you remember.
</P>
<P>
   John Williams' soundtrack for George Lucas' upcoming prequel
``Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' will be in record stores
Tuesday, and the music does indeed veer in new directions far, far
away from the celebratory strains of 1977's original film.
</P>
<P>
   Already playing on radio stations is ``Duel of the Fates,'' the
first single. It's dark, heavy, fast-paced and a definite
head-turner.
</P>
<P>
   But what the heck is it?
</P>
<P>
   Something maybe out of ``The Omen'' or Carl Orff's ``Carmina
Burana'' (used as the main theme for John Boorman's provocative
1981 King Arthur movie ``Excalibur'').
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Williams has introduced choral voices into a
main ``Star Wars'' theme in a pulsating, foreboding rhythm. It
evokes images of, say, medieval knights getting ready to wield
heavy weaponry and bash in somebody's brains.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense. ``Phantom Menace'' is, after all, a dark
installment more akin to ``The Empire Strikes Back'' than ``The
Return of the Jedi.'' More importantly, it's a prequel. Williams'
task was not to move ``Star Wars'' music forward but to clearly
leap back to times long before the familiar Luke, Leia and Chewie
and even before the Clone Wars and other troubles we have inklings
about only through our heroes' whispers.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the choir sings Sanskrit for ``Fates.'' Other
tracks sometimes resemble trumpets blaring the entrance of Roman
legions or feature heavy use of a wooden xylophone _ the latter
apparently to underscore the metal bones of a skeletal droid army
(think ``Jason and the Argonauts'').
</P>
<P>
   As always, Williams' music often suggests other works: new
funnycreature Jar Jar has a tuba and oboe accompaniment that will
sound to some like ``Peter and the Wolf.'' The music involving
Naboo Temple and an audience with new character Boss Nass would fit
nicely into Holst's ``The Planets.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams ties it all together with frequent evocations of more
familiar ``Star Wars'' themes. You repeatedly recognize comforting
snippets of music that instantly recall the final Death Star battle
or Darth Vader's theme.
</P>
<P>
   The latter comes, of course, in the new ``Anakin's Theme.''
Here, Williams has composed a soft homage with strings to the young
Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a. Darth Vader) that at times echoes the
swelling majesty of ``E.T.'' But while the music slowly lifts, it
never reaches the sweet, joyous exultation from that earlier film.
Instead it faintly settles into the foretelling, menacing Vader
theme.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it all not only works, it clearly rings ``Star
Wars.'' And once the film opens May 19, the music of ``Menace''
will more than likely become part of the ``Star Wars'' you'll
always remember.
</P>

 &QL; 
TVDRUGS (Washington) - An 11-year-old girl on ``Cosby'' returns
from a friend's birthday party bombed on spiked punch. A
12-year-old boy on ``Smart Guy'' downs a beer because he's worried
about embarrassing himself in front of his peers if he says no. A
``Wayans Bros.'' character blows an acting audition because he
shows up totally stoned. Something unusual is happening on
television's hottest teen and pre-teen shows. The characters are
getting drunk, they're getting stoned, and they're facing
consequences. If these programs seem different _ more pointed, more
frank _ than their predecessors, there's a good, if not surprising,
reason: the federal government. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in
the ``A'' category.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
ALICECOOPER-MUSIC (Phoenix) - If you're going to do a box set, you
really couldn't do it any better than the guys at Rhino did for
Alice Cooper. This baby, which reached stores last week, has
everything a fan looks for in these things: There are 84 tracks,
licensed from 12 sources. There are 11 unreleased cuts, including
some intriguing demo versions. The liner notes are colorfully
informative, with Sex Pistol John Lydon chipping in a gracefully
written essay. Alice comments on every track, sometimes revealing,
sometimes funny. Even the packaging is pretty righteous. By RANDY
CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PAYNE-MUSIC (Phoenix) - Freda Payne's been singing for as long as
she remembers, but there's one song that's forever identified with
her: The 1970 blockbuster ``Band of Gold,'' a classic slice of pop
soul with an urgent bass line and a silky, purring vocal. ``I never
realized how far-reaching it affected people, but it did,'' says
Payne. ``Band of Gold'' doesn't exactly boast the heaviest of
lyrics. In fact, it's probably the bubbliest song ever to deal with
the subject of impotency. By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the
``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COUNTRY-LIFESTYLE (Phoenix) - When Rhode Island native Jack Joyce
moved to the Phoenix area in 1979, it not only meant a change of
scene, in some ways it meant a change of identity. Within a few
months, he owned his first cowboy boots: a pair of light brown
Justins. ``When I came out here, I just fell in love with Western
wear,'' says Joyce. There's something about the entire Western look
and Western sound that appeals to people who couldn't rope a calf
if their lives depended on it. By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the
``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WARREN-MUSIC (Phoenix) - Perhaps the oddest thing that the Warren
Brothers have ever heard is that some country stations are
``afraid'' to play their music. ``It's music, not a nuclear
weapon,'' says Brett, lead singer of the Florida-based duo. ``What
are they afraid of? That their listeners will love it? If they had
been afraid of playing Shania Twain, think of how many million of
records wouldn't have been sold.'' Like Twain, Brett and his older
brother Brad are pushing Nashville's musical boundaries. By RANDY
CORDOVA. Story moved
</P>
<P>
   in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-VIOLENCE (Phoenix) - Blame guns... don't blame guns. Blame
parents... don't stigmatize embattled parents. Blame Hollywood's
anesthetizing sadism and cartoon violence... don't blame Hollywood.
Blame Howard Stern...don't blame the daft, grotesque deejay.
Scarcely a week has gone by since the Littleton, Colo., massacre,
and the raging first wave of media observation and analysis has
slapped down on the disaster like a tsunami. Story moved in the
`'K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ARK-TV (Phoenix) - As a would-be biblical epic, ``Noah's Ark'' is
all wet. Which is not to say that it's completely vacant of
redeeming qualities. For example, it sent me on a rare trip to its
sacred source text. There, I scoured chapter and verse to find a
reference to pirates. Surprise. None there. But this NBC May sweeps
spectacular has pirates _ bawdy, brawling, eye patch-wearing,
ark-attacking pirates. Lordy. By DAVE WALKER. Story moved in the
``E'' category. &QL;

TV HATH WROUGHT ONE ALL-WET `ARK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As a would-be biblical epic, ``Noah's Ark'' is all
wet.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that it's completely vacant of redeeming
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it sent me _ a certified heathen _ on a rare trip
to its sacred source text. There, I scoured chapter and verse to
find a reference to pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise. None there. Not in relation to Noah, at least. (But I
did learn something: Gomer is a biblical name! He was a son of a
son of the sailor, Noah. How cool is that?)
</P>
<P>
   But this NBC May sweeps spectacular has pirates _ bawdy,
brawling, eye patch-wearing, ark-attacking pirates. Lordy.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has also tweaked the Bible's time line, moving up God's
destruction of the wicked Sodom and Gomorrah to get some decent
special effects into Sunday's opening installment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bible, those spectacular pyrotechnics follow the flood.
</P>
<P>
   The script also makes good buds of Noah and Lot, adds a crusty,
colorful traveling salesman to the tale, and offers dialogue that
wouldn't sound out of place on ``Melrose Place.'' Or in a Monty
Python sendup.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you halfway expect to spot Eric Idle or John Cleese
silly-walking on all that water. ``Noah's Ark'' is frequently that
absurd. When Noah complains about having to build such a big boat,
God says, ``I think big.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, several lesser characters speak with English or
Australian accents. One guy torments Noah with what sounds like a
drunken pub ditty.
</P>
<P>
   Elements of action-adventure have also been added to the Noah
story. In fact, there's enough hand-to-hand combat to fill a month
of ``Xenas.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of synergy, Noah's dashing sons and their lovely
brides-to-be could populate a WB drama. (``Noah Limits?`` ``Ark
Shadows?'') Fortunately, Noah decrees a no-sex rule once the animal
houseboat is a afloat. This keeps the show family-friendly but also
foreshadows a lusty landfall of biblical proportions.
</P>
<P>
   One scene even answers every Sunday schooler's first ark
question. (Noah's sons do the shoveling.)
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, four Academy Award winners signed on to sail aboard
this ship of fools:
</P>
<P>
   Jon Voight (``Coming Home'') plays the title character, a
righteous soul hand-picked by God to headline his Genesis sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Noah walks softly and carries a big staff, and he spends a lot
of time gabbing with God, who remains unseen. (Imagined dialogue
from the NBC casting meeting: ``Get me George Burns! What? Oh.'')
</P>
<P>
   Although he's not one of the Bible's more vivid heroes, this
Noah can summon down God's wrath pretty much at will, much like a
baseball manager signals for a relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   With all the one-way dialogue and tricky special-effects shots,
Voight likely had to deliver most of his lines to a sound stage
``Exit'' sign. Given those constraints, he delivers a capable, if
slightly dazed-by-it-all, performance. I can't imagine anyone else
doing this ridiculous job any better.
</P>
<P>
   As Noah's patient wife, Mary Steenburgen (``Melvin and Howard'')
looks lovely and brings a tenderness to her role. Her performance
is tainted by an incredibly stupid, almost cruel scene near the
end, when Mrs. Noah goes nuts from spending too much time at sea.
It's the low point of a comparatively dignified career, although I
doubt many viewers will stick around to see it.
</P>
<P>
   F. Murray Abraham (``Amadeus'') portrays the chronologically
misplaced Lot as a lovable louse hen-pecked to distraction by his
wife, who is played so unsympathetically by Carol Kane that you'll
cheer the heaven-sent fireball that removes her from the plot. Lot
himself reacts to this horrific development with mild annoyance, as
if the missus had accidentally backed the family chariot over his
morning newspapyrus.
</P>
<P>
   James Coburn (``Affliction''), who obviously took this part long
before adding an Oscar to his bio, plays the traveling salesman.
Before the flood, Coburn's peddler provides mild comic relief.
Later, he actually peddles his floating showroom right up next to
the ark for a gala reunion with Noah's crew. This, too, is a slight
departure from the gospel truth. Or so I'm told.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Halmi Sr., who in recent seasons brought ``Gulliver's
Travels,'' ``The Odyssey'' and ``Merlin'' to the wee screen,
justifies his script's more outrageous liberties with a verbal
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, a lot of things are unsaid in the Bible,'' he said,
when questioned recently by TV critics. ``So it leaves a lot to
imagination, and you're pretty much free to do anything you want
with it if you don't steer the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   The script actually deals with its own imaginative revisionism,
by having Mrs. Noah comment that sloppy historians aren't likely to
place her family at Sodom's big meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Although the special effects aren't as spectacular as expected,
the spliced-together story is perversely entertaining. The critters
are cute, the pirates are ugly, and wanton wickedness drives all
the action. It's sweeps, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Pious, this ``Noah'' is not. But it's not ponderous or
sanctimonious, either, and lots of viewers will likely enjoy it as
an oddball yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who believe that the Bible is more than mere sweeps
fodder likely won't be so forgiving. &QL;

 &HT;    VA LOOKING AT HIGH RATE OF ALS AMONG GULF WAR VETERANS
 &HT;    630&AMP;adds. For release Sunday, May 2.
 &HT;    Eds: The 2nd optional add could run as a separate box.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is trying
to determine why the fatal wasting disease, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, may have stricken more than 40 Persian Gulf war
veterans, a rate experts say is several times higher than the
disease's normal incidence.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Kentucky neurologist confirmed last week that he
had been asked to review more than 40 medical files of VA patients
to determine how many of them were correctly diagnosed as suffering
from ALS, as the disease is sometimes known.
</P>
<P>
   Also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, after the legendary baseball
player who died of it in 1941, ALS destroys motor neurons, the
specialized brain and spinal cord nerve cells that control muscles.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 30,000 Americans have it. Although Gehrig was only
37 when he died, it is almost unknown among people that young.
Experts say it typically appears between ages 50 and 70.
</P>
<P>
   Many spouses and other relatives of Gulf war veterans who have
the disease are convinced that exposure to chemicals, possibly
including low doses of the chemical weapon sarin gas, predisposed
the veterans to developing ALS a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that a drug that might arrest the disease is within
grasp, they watch their loved ones waste away while the government
continues to deny that sufficient evidence exists to link any of a
broad range of mysterious illnesses to service in the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   A number of nongovernment experts who have studied the matter
also have concluded that the evidence does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky neurologist who reviewed VA files, Dr. Edward J.
Kasarskis, declined in a telephone interview to say how many of the
patients whose case files he and other experts have reviewed appear
to have been correctly diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of the files appear to have been miscoded, and
therefore would not represent patients who have ALS.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was applying to the Department of Defense for a
grant to make a wider study of the incidence of ALS among Persian
Gulf war veterans in an effort to ``find out whether or not there
are are more ALS cases that we would expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fran Murphy, the VA official who asked Kasarskis to review
the files, was not available to answer questions about the
suspected cases.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to her office were referred to a VA spokesman, Terry
Jemison(cq), who would say only that the agency was ``not prepared
to release any information about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Donnelly, who with her brother, former Air Force Major
Michael Donnelly, co-authored a book on his experiences in the Gulf
war and subsequent struggle with ALS, said she was told by
Kasarskis and VA officials that there were 49 names on the original
list.
</P>
<P>
   If as many as 40 of the roughly 700,000 U.S. troops to serve in
the 1991 war against Iraq have developed ALS, the rate would be
dramatically above normal, said Dr. Robert Haley, a University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas epidemiologist who has
argued that significant numbers of Gulf war veterans suffer from
unexplained brain and nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be extremely elevated,'' Haley said. ``The incidence
of this disease among people this age is so low that it can't even
be reliably measured.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some estimates suggest that the normal risk that a
person in his or her 30s will get ALS is less that one in 1 million
per year. That would mean only around six cases would be expected
among the 695,000 veterans who served in the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers are so low that they defy statistical meaning,
he said. Haley spent 10 years as an epidemiologist at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta before joining the
Dallas medical center.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered around the country, Gulf war veterans from
the Army, Air Force and Marines struggle to live with the disease
as the relentless destruction of nerve cells saps their muscles.
</P>
<P>
   They tap out computer messages with the few muscles that
continue to function, work out ways to communicate with members of
their families with eye blinks, and ask themselves what caused them
to change from vigorous, energetic individuals to helpless
paralytics.
</P>
<P>
   One was urged by the VA to get his physicians at Emory
University in Atlanta and the University of Alabama, Birmingham, to
change his diagnosis from ALS to ``undiagnosed illness,'' according
to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The VA doctor told us that if we got his diagnosis changed
from ALS, we would qualify for benefits,'' said Lynn Booker of
Monroeville, Ala. ``We didn't even ask. No doctor would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Booker said her husband, Rob, was in the Alabama National
Guard and was called to active duty during the war against Iraq in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in perfect health when he went over there,'' she said.
``Now he is completely paralyzed from the neck down. He can no
longer talk, but he is still able to swallow soft food.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Rob, now 35, is participating in a drug trial at Emory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can still whisper to me, but I can see it is getting worse,
daily,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Emerald Isle, N.C., former Marine Corps Major Randy L. Hebert
has a little motion left in his right knee. He uses it to control a
computer mouse and slowly spell out messages.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert was a combat engineer in the Gulf war, on the front
lines. Like most others, his ALS began insidiously, a weakness in
one hand, muscle twitches, weak legs, a rash and other symptoms. He
was diagnosed at the Naval Medical Center at Bethesda, Md., in
1995. He was retired from the Marines with full disability.
</P>
<P>
   But Rob Booker's symptoms did not appear until after he was no
longer on active duty and his condition is not deemed
``service-connected.''
</P>
<P>
   A special appropriation provides benefits for Gulf war veterans
who develop the ``undiagnosed illnesses'' that have come to be
known as Gulf War Syndrome. But as long as Booker is listed as an
ALS patient, he does not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Because the benefits law provides compensation only to veterans
with undiagnosed illnesses, there is a disincentive for a veteran
to confirm a diagnosis of ALS. Thus, other cases might exist beyond
the 40 being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Lynn Booker said she was told by VA personnel that
her husband's name does not appear on the list, even though he has
been diagnosed with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, ALS paralyzes all muscles, including those that
affect breathing. Many persons with ALS die in their sleep from
respiratory failure. Typically, it is fatal within three to five
years, although there have been notable exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The English physicist and mathematician Stephen Hawking
developed ALS many years ago as a graduate student. He has lived to
propound many leading-edge theories about the origin of the
universe and the development of objects such as ``black holes.''
</P>
<P>
   In their book, ``Falcon's Cry: A Desert Storm Memoir,'' Michael
Donnelly and Denise Donnelly argue that Major Donnelly was exposed
to chemical warfare agents while flying his Air Force F-16 in the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, while jogging at Sheppard(cq) Air Force Base
at Wichita Falls, Texas, he ran through a fog of insecticide being
sprayed for mosquito control. Shortly thereafter, he developed ALS
and is now confined to a wheelchair, unable to talk or move below
his neck other than to punch the keys of a computerized voice
synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe with every fiber of my being that they know exactly
what happened to my brother, and there are individuals in the
Pentagon who are withholding the information for whatever reason
and are letting him die,'' Denise Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   One theory of ALS suggests that a low-dose exposure to
organophosphate chemicals _ such as Sarin gas, malathion pesticide
and others _ may damage nerve cells and predispose them to begin
dying following a second exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say this theory is unproven. There is more evidence to
support another theory, which suggests that exposures that occur in
rapid succession can cause the disease. The body has an enzyme that
neutralizes many organophosphates, said Haley, but the process
often depletes the enzyme supply. A second exposure, if it occurs
before the enzymes are replenished, may cause permanent nerve
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Donnelly said experiments with monkeys showed that
repeated low-dose exposures to organophosphate chemicals will cause
ALS, even when the exposures are widely spaced.
</P>
<P>
   Former Marine Corps Capt. Montana Rickett of Albuquerque, N.M.,
jammed his thumb playing basketball two yeas ago. The sprain
refused to heal.
</P>
<P>
   While in Africa on a month-long church mission, Rickett met a
U.S. doctor who told him he should have the thumb checked. Little
by little, it developed that Rickett had ALS. He had been out of
the Marines for six years and did not qualify for VA benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Former Air Force Staff Sgt. Tom Oliver of Topsail Beach, N.C.,
had sprained an ankle playing softball. It would not heal. While he
was at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi in August 1997, his
ALS was diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, his condition is not as bad as that of some other Gulf
war veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk and I can eat and my left arm is still pretty strong,''
he said in a telephone interview. ``My right hand is pretty much
gone. I have to be helped into my wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: The following optional add could run as a sidebar.)
</P>
<P>
   At his home in North Carolina, Hebert used his knee-operated
computer mouse to respond last week to a reporter's questions about
his experiences in the Persian Gulf and the disease he later
developed. The task took most of a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served as a combat engineer officer with 2nd Combat Engineer
Battalion, 2nd Marine Division,'' he wrote. ``During my time there
I was assistant operations officer, operations officer and, during
the ground combat operations, officer in charge of breaching the
Division's left flank. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my responsibility to create two emergency traffic lanes
through the two minefields to evacuate wounded. I believe my
service led to my current condition. During our breaching
operations a chemical mine exploded in our area. Readings confirmed
positive for nerve agents. I think I received low levels of agents
during my service there.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my battle with the medical board fighting for 100%
disability, two of three officers agreed with me and recommended my
illness was in fact, combat related. All agreed on 100% disability.
After more exposure in October '94 to commercial pesticides; I
believe put me over the limit of what my body could handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our government: too little, too late. Hopefully the truth
will rise above the chaos, deceit, and lies that continue to
prevail in our government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some problems sleeping that started shortly after the
ground war ended, and lasted about 5 months. Also, I was ill with
flu-like symptoms for several days, as were many others in my
battalion during the month of March '91. Had bad headaches that
finally ended in the spring of '94. Other weird problems included
rashes, lumps under the skin, and difficulties with my throat
muscles. October of '94, noticed atrophy in right hand and arm.
Progressed from there. Final diagnosis, October 95. Completely
wheelchair dependent.
</P>
<P>
   ``On future: plan on living to at least 80. Believe a cure will
be found in the next 5 years. God could heal me any time He wants.
I could be running marathons again next month!
</P>
<P>
   ``Semper fi, Randy Hebert''

COMMENTARY: JAPAN'S NUTCRACKER SUITE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the past decade whenever anyone told me Japan was
finally opening its economy and lowering its trade barriers, I
always thought of that story of the prisoners who were in jail
together for so many years that they didn't need to actually tell
each other their jokes anymore.
</P>
<P>
   They would just say ``Joke number 3,'' and everyone would laugh.
In my case, the simple phrase ``Japan is really opening up its
economy this time'' always had a similar laugh-inducing effect.
</P>
<P>
   Well, laugh no more. After visiting Tokyo a few weeks ago, I
left convinced that Japan has indeed begun its third great
modernization _ something Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will be
touting on his visit to the U.S. beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The first modern opening of Japan began when Commodore Perry
broke down the doors and arrived in 1853, triggering the Meiji
restoration. The second was Douglas MacArthur's imposition of
democracy on Japan after World War II, and the third is being
driven now by the invisible hands of globalization: the Internet
and global capital flows are breaking the shell around Japan like a
nutcracker.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest: For the past 50 years Japan was just the most
successful Communist country in history. It was only a matter of
time before the forces that brought down the Berlin wall and the
Soviet Union felled the wall around Japan as well.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to talk to anyone in Tokyo these days without hearing
the ``Nutcracker'' suite in the background. A friend at the
Japanese Foreign Ministry began a conversation like this: ``My son
informed us the other day that he wants to be a fund manager, but
he doesn't want to work for a Japanese bank. He wants to be with an
international bank. The Japanese institutions that young people of
my generation would automatically like to join, like the major
banks, are crumbling. That is new. My wife couldn't understand my
son. So he said to her, ``If you want to understand what I want to
do, watch this film.'' He gave her a video of the movie ``Other
People's Money,'' about a New York financier who takes over a dying
company in New England. ... My wife is still worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Japanese friend who works in executive recruiting
informed me that she always had a hard time recruiting Japanese to
work for U.S. companies because these companies, unlike those in
Japan, practiced ``the three Ks _ Kitsui, the Japanese word for
`very demanding'; Kaiko, Japanese for `firing people' when they did
not perform, and Kyoso, Japanese for `competition.'''
</P>
<P>
   This friend now tells her clients: ``Even if you think you are
signing up for life with a Japanese company today, you could wake
up in the morning and find yourself working for a foreign-owned
company very soon, so you might as well join one now and learn to
adapt to it.''
</P>
<P>
   So I've got good news and bad news and good news. The good news
is that Japan is really changing. The bad news is that the Japanese
government is still using its savings to prop up inefficient
companies. ``The good news, though,'' said a foreign banker in
Tokyo, ``is that the state is now running out of money, and that
guarantees that the free market is going to increasingly decide
where capital and labor should go, and that will bring about the
new Japan. But it will take 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Japanese companies, strapped for cash, are now
seeking foreign partners, and those partners are bringing foreign
business practices. French auto maker Renault just came in and took
a chunk of Nissan, while GE Capital, AIG, Merrill Lynch and
Goldman, Sachs are all buying up cash-starved Japanese businesses
and restructuring them.
</P>
<P>
   While the transformation taking place in Japan today is going to
make it a formidable competitor over time, it will be a wrenching
transition. Sure, Japan's economy was a rigged game in many ways,
but it provided enormous social stability and cohesion. There is
much to admire in Japanese society, and it is not clear what is
going to go and what is going to stay in this transition.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Strom, a Tokyo reporter for The Times, wrote a moving
article the other day about a Japanese manufacturer who stabbed his
brother _ who was also his business partner _ to death after their
once-high-flying welding company went bust. It went bust after the
walls around Japan started to fall and the company had to deal with
more open, global competition. Ironically, their bankrupt company
had specialized in making metal doors.

   A full-page ad for Carlton cigarettes in Tuesday's paper asked
consumers, ``Isn't it time you starting thinking about number one?
Think Carlton. With 1 mg. tar, it's the ultra ultra light.''
</P>
<P>
   The small print advising smokers that ``actual tar and nicotine
deliveries will vary based on how you hold and smoke a cigarette''
sent Personals scurrying to the Brown &AMP; Williamson Web site _ given
in the ad _ to research what the heck it was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The company says a smoker's intake of smoke (and tar) varies
``depending on the size of the puffs, the number of puffs per
cigarette, how long the smoke is held before exhaling, how far the
cigarette is smoked down to the filter overwrap, and possibly the
extent to which the ventilation holes in the filter may be blocked
by the fingers in holding the cigarette or by the lips.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says it certainly doesn't mean ``to suggest to
consumers that the cigarette will deliver any particular amount of
tar under all smoking conditions.'' Furthermore, as though the ad
had been placed by someone else, the company insists that ``it is
also not B&AMP;W's intention to suggest that any individual brand,
regardless of the category descriptor terminology used or tar
yield, is safer than any other.''

don't blame Hollywood. Blame Howard Stern...don't blame the daft,
grotesque deejay.
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely a week has gone by since (begin ital ) it (end ital)
happened, and the raging first wave of media observation and
analysis has slapped down on the Columbine High School disaster
like a tsunami. In this newspaper alone, more than 150 news
articles, opinion columns, letters and editorials have appeared -
reporting, wailing, bemoaning, micro-analyzing, fulminating and
renting our communal vestments over the murderous Littleton, Colo.,
rampage. And what more do we know about what to do? Not much, if
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Succumbing to absolute helplessness, however, is not an option.
If any modern-age horror has provided indisputable evidence that
complacency invites more of the same, it is America's plague of
school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   You can, in fact, blame guns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, then U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona introduced
the Anti-Drug Assault Weapons Limitation Act, which banned the
sale, manufacture and importation of nine types of semiautomatic
assault weapons. One of the weapons that DeConcini's ill-fated
legislation sought to ban was a version of the TEC-9, a major part
of the Littleton killers' arsenal. There is no place in a civil
society for those kinds of guns.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is not only guns. The problem, too, is
de-stigmatizing bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In February, 1998, Phoenix police raided a teenager's bedroom in
upscale Ahwatukee, thus crippling ``the most active`` drug ring at
Mountain Pointe High School. Amid the drug paraphernalia and
killer-rock posters, they found The ``Anarchist's Cookbook,'' a
guide to making explosives and drugs. Citing the fact that he kept
his bedroom door locked, the boy's parents pleaded helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   Hugs are nice. Talk is important. But assertive responsibility
has its place in the parental mix, too. Parents - and their
surrogates in schools - have come to condone behavior that simply
cannot be tolerated. The phrase ``authority figure'' needs to make
a comeback. With a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just parents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Second Lady Tipper Gore initiated a social campaign
against the sense-deadening, profane and violent music so favored
by teens. She nearly was laughed out of Washington, D.C., by a
cynical media, and second-guessed by her own husband, Vice
President Al Gore, who assured Hollywood enterntainment moguls that
they need not fear her campaign of ``censorship.``
</P>
<P>
   There are measures a society can take to impose standards of
decency and civility on itself short of censorship. Complaining
about and refusing to spend money on violent music and movies is a
decent first step.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It's about Howard Stern. It truly is all about Howard Stern.
Stern's disgusting, profane ``jokes`` about events at Columbine
High ought to earn him a one-way ticket off the air.
</P>
<P>
   There is action you can take. It may be inappropriate to cast
blame on one ``cause`` of these horrific murders, but it is just as
wrong to shrug your shoulders and not cast blame at all. &QL;

US DEPLOYS MORE BOMBERS TO THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER GLOBE STAF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, humiliated by the
House's refusal to give official support to the US role in Kosovo,
Thursday also endured the embarrassment of a wayward NATO missile
slamming into Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pentagon officials said there is no end in
sight to the Kosovo conflict, as Serb forces continued their
campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' and the refugee crisis worsened in
the fifth week of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, thrust on the defensive Wednesday night by the
House action, vowed Thursday to forge ahead with the air raids and
deployed 10 additional B-52 bombers to the Balkans. ``If Solobodan
Milosevic or anyone in Belgrade takes this as some sort of
comfort,'' Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said of the
House vote, ``they'll be sorely mistaken. ``The president is
determined to see this through.''
</P>
<P>
   But other administration officials expressed concern about the
aftershocks of the House dissent, particularly in NATO countries
and Yugoslavia. The divisions over US policy emerged as officials
consulted with Russia and other nations in a search for a
diplomatic resolution to the military showdown in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen denounced the House's
repudiation of the air campaign as a ``counterproductive'' act that
``conflicts with the strong solidarity expressed by all of the NATO
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   There were these other developments as the NATO campaign entered
its sixth week:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) Bombing continued around the clock, as NATO warplanes
engaged in the largest number of attack flights in one day since
the campaign started: 296. An additional 374 NATO sorties were
classified as support or reconnaissance missions.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a top Air Force general said the Pentagon is
trying to rush supplies of air-launched cruise missiles and special
bombs dropped by B-2 bombers to avoid crucial shortages of both
munitions.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin,
met with leaders in Germany and Italy and claimed to have achieved
some progress in his quest for a peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin also spoke by phone with Vice President Al Gore.
And Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright conferred with Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. But US officials cited no significant
progress in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) Yugoslavia sued the United States and 10 NATO allies in
the International Court of Justice, calling the airstrikes a breach
of international law. State Department spokesman James Rubin
characterized the court filing as ``frivolous and absurd.'' The
court said it will begin hearing the case May 10.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) Nearly 5,200 ethnic Albanians fled from Serb forces in
Kosovo and poured into neighboring Macedonia, where refugees camps
have grown so overcrowded that a spokeswoman for the United Nations
High Commission on Refugees declared: ``We are on the brink of a
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 155,000 Kosvars have fled to Macedonia, while
448,000 have found refuge in neighboring countries, primarily
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO officials were busy explaining how a NATO
missile veered 30 miles east of Yugoslavia and struck a suburb of
the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. The missile ripped the roof off a
private residence but caused no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said a jet fired the missile ``in
self-defense in response to the threat from a surface-to-air
missile'' in Yugoslavia. He said the NATO missile ``strayed from
its target and unintentionally landed in Bulgaria.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Reverend Jackson arrived in Belgrade to the sound
of air sirens and distant explosions. Accompanied by a delegation
of US religious leaders, Jackson drove to Yugoslavia from
neighboring Croatia, despite White House warnings that his safety
could not be guaranteed and his mission could be used by Milosevic
for anti-NATO propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson hoped to meet Friday with three American captive
soldiers and Saturday with Milosevic. He will ask Milosevic to
release the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience has been whenever captured soldiers are
released, it at least creates a window for dialogue,'' said
Jackson, who in 1984 secured the release of a Navy jet pilot from
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Wednesday's House action Thursday inspired the
hottest rhetoric since Clinton's impeachment trial. In a deadlocked
vote, 213-213, the House refused to support the NATO air campaign.
A second measure, which would bar Clinton from sending ground
troops into Kosovo without congressional approval, passed, 249-180.
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt, denounced the
opposition to airstrikes as ``a low moment in American foreign
policy and the history of this institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas,
cited the vote as evidence that Republicans are consumed by hurting
Clinton. ``I saw a repeat of the impeachment vote,'' she said.
``The undermining of a president.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, who supported the White House
in the two votes, said the outcome indicated that Clinton has
failed to adequately ``explain the goals, the costs and the
long-term strategy of why we are there.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll released Thursday showed that 38 percent believe
Clinton has a clear policy in Kosovo, while 54 percent believe he
is simply reacting to events.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fallout from the House votes, the Appropriations
Committee Thursday approved a $12.9 billion emergency package to
pay for the US role in Kosovo, more than double the amount Clinton
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats tried to reduce the figure by $1 billion,
arguing it was hypocritical for Republicans to double Clinton's
request the day after rebuking his policy. But they were defeated,
35-20.
</P>
<P>
   The spending package covers Clinton's request for $6 billion to
fund the US role in the NATO campaign through September. It also
would pay for other Pentagon needs and provide $1.7 billion for US
farmers and victims of recent natural disasters in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to debate the measure next week.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, several Republicans pushed for a vote on the
House measure that would require Clinton to obtain congressional
approval before he deploys ground troops in Kosovo. Majority Leader
Trent Lott expressed interest in forcing a vote on the measure, but
he had to make a final decision.

   A full-page ad for Carlton cigarettes in Tuesday's paper asked
consumers, ``Isn't it time you starting thinking about number one?
Think Carlton. With 1 mg. tar, it's the ultra ultra light.''
</P>
<P>
   The small print advising smokers that ``actual tar and nicotine
deliveries will vary based on how you hold and smoke a cigarette''
sent Personals scurrying to the Brown &AMP; Williamson Web site _ given
in the ad _ to research what the heck it was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The company says a smoker's intake of smoke (and tar) varies
``depending on the size of the puffs, the number of puffs per
cigarette, how long the smoke is held before exhaling, how far the
cigarette is smoked down to the filter overwrap, and possibly the
extent to which the ventilation holes in the filter may be blocked
by the fingers in holding the cigarette or by the lips.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says it certainly doesn't mean ``to suggest to
consumers that the cigarette will deliver any particular amount of
tar under all smoking conditions.'' Furthermore, as though the ad
had been placed by someone else, the company insists that ``it is
also not B&AMP;W's intention to suggest that any individual brand,
regardless of the category descriptor terminology used or tar
yield, is safer than any other.''

<P>
   KAKRA, India _ The farmer rode his shiny blue bicycle to the
village blacksmith's hut Tuesday to get his wheat thresher
repaired. But as the two men sat on a string cot in the withering
110-degree heat, with a haze of flies periodically rising from a
pile of sugar-cane fodder to engulf them, the talk turned to
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer, a Brahmin named Brij Nandan Tyagi who owns six acres
of land, was upset that the government led by the Hindu nationalist
Atal Behari Vajpayee _ also a Brahmin _ had been toppled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a blind supporter of Atal Behari,'' said Tyagi, 52, who
was dressed in a dingy white dhoti. ``Even if he is bad, I'll close
my eyes and stamp his name.''
</P>
<P>
   The blacksmith, Shamshuddin, a poor Muslim who owns little more
than the two water buffalo who live in his hut with him, heartily
disagreed. Prime Minister Vajpayee and his Bharatiya Janata Party
got exactly what they deserved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shamshuddin, who would give only his first name, supports a
family of six on $80 a month, and he has not forgiven the
government for the sharp rise in the prices of cooking oil and
vegetables late last year, which forced him to go into debt to the
grocer. Not long before, he had voted for Vajpayee's party on the
advice of a local doctor he counts as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we'll vote for Congress,'' he said. ``All the poor
people will vote for Congress this time.''
</P>
<P>
   While pundits and politicians in the capital try to calculate
who will be blamed for the collapse of one government and the
failure to form another, the people in this village of 4,000 just
an hour's drive away ask fundamental questions as they ponder whom
to support in the balloting, the third general election in India in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these are political games,'' said Amrish Tyagi, who like
most Brahmins in this village in Uttar Pradesh uses the Tyagi caste
name as his surname. ``You never know who's playing what.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters here are less concerned with convoluted attempts to parse
who double-crossed whom in the whitewashed colonial bungalows of
New Delhi's political elite, and more interested in who can
deliver, among other things, stability, lower prices and programs
to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions that the people of Uttar Pradesh make could shape
who governs India. In the Parliament that was dissolved after the
collapse of Vajpayee's government, the two largest parties _
Bharatiya Janata, with about a third of the members, and Congress,
with a quarter _ are vying for primacy. The forces of power in New
Delhi are so precariously balanced that the former government lost
a confidence vote by one vote, 270 to 269.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalists now draw about a third of their members
of Parliament from this one state _ the most populous in India,
with 140 million people and a sixth of all the seats in Parliament.
If it were a nation, Uttar Pradesh would be the seventh or eighth
most populous in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party has made Uttar Pradesh and neighboring Bihar
its top election year priorities. ``Unless we revive there, we have
no future,'' said Sharad Pawar, a veteran politician from Bombay
who leads the Congress Party in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the first four decades after India gained
independence in 1947, Uttar Pradesh was the bulwark of the Congress
Party. It was home to three Congress Party prime ministers from the
Nehru-Gandhi dynasty (Jawaharlal Nehru; his daughter, Indira, and
her son Rajiv). It may yet produce a fourth _ Rajiv's widow, Sonia
Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past decade, Uttar Pradesh has seen the near
elimination of Congress as a political force, mirroring and
magnifying its fall from power at the national level. Congress,
which once routinely won most of the parliamentary seats in the
state, came up with zero in the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   The party disappeared in Uttar Pradesh because its traditional
coalition was decimated. Upper-caste Brahmins moved to Bharatiya
Janata, drawn by its vision of a resurgent, politicized Hinduism.
Dalits, from the castes formerly called untouchable, shifted to
their own caste-based political party. And Muslims, alienated by
the national Congress government's failure to protect the mosque at
Ayodhya from destruction in 1992 at the hands of Hindu fanatics,
deserted Congress in droves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a place as populous, complex and varied as Uttar Pradesh, no
single village can predict the broader trends. But the thoughts of
the people in Kakra do suggest that the Congress Party has a chance
to make some gains.
</P>
<P>
   The single most pressing issue on the minds of many voters here
is one that many analysts in Delhi thought had faded: inflation.
Though the prices of onions, cauliflowers, potatoes and other
staples have fallen back to normal levels, people have not
forgotten the hardships they endured when prices were sky high in
the fall and early winter.
</P>
<P>
   Rakesh Kumar and Raj Kumar, factory workers from a caste of
leather workers that was once treated as untouchable, chatted at a
snack shop in the Dalit neighborhood of Kakra. The two men, who are
not related, bemoaned the high prices. Rakesh Kumar earns $80 a
month and Raj Kumar makes $60 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are poor and the poor are hurt most by the price rises,''
said Rakesh Kumar, 30. ``This government did nothing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In past years, both men have supported the leader of the Bahujan
Samaj Party, Mayawati, herself a Dalit, whose power is drawn from
the fifth of Uttar Pradesh's population that is Dalit. But they are
reconsidering. Mayawati, who like many lower-caste women goes by
one name, has not been able to win enough power at the national
level to protect them from high prices or to materially improve
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tested all the parties and the period under Congress was
better for the poor people,'' said Raj Kumar, sweat streaming down
his cheeks. ``Nobody came to your house with food on a plate, but
at least they talked about the welfare of the poor and prices were
held in check.''
</P>
<P>
   But broad national issues like management of the economy and the
desire for political stability are only one layer of the voters'
political decision making. In Uttar Pradesh, where the middle and
upper castes have risen to positions of power in the past decade,
caste and patronage, often yoked together, are a potent force at
all levels of society.
</P>
<P>
   Like most men in this village, somnolent in the searing midday
heat, Kalu Ram Tyagi, 50, lazed in the shade on a cot in his
undershirt.
</P>
<P>
   A Brahmin and a wealthy farmer by local standards, Tyagi talked
about his admiration for Vajpayee. But Tyagi will not vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he will support the Samajwadi (Socialist) Party, because
the local state assemblyman, a fellow Brahmin, was elected under
that party's banner. And it is this local politician and caste
leader whom Tyagi credits with bringing brick lanes, a post office
and a health dispensary to Karka.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are with our caste leader,'' he said. ``Where ever he goes,
we will follow.''

BLACK VICTIM OF SCHOOL GUNMEN LAID TO REST 
</HEADLINE>

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ In a thoroughly modern tribute to a young man
named for a Biblical prophet, Isaiah Shoels was buried Thursday
amid hymns from popular recording artist and calls for racial
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Singled out by his killers because he was black, Shoels was
recalled as a Columbine High School senior whose determination on
the football field made up for his five-foot, five-inch frame.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Duane Williams urged Thursday's crowd of several thousand
mourners to put aside religious and racial differences. But the
minister seemed to be addressing his remarks as much to the
audience as to troubled youths like Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
who chronicled a yearlong plan to kill athletes and minorities _
classmates who looked and acted nothing like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you look, the clothes you wear, the color of your
skin,'' Williams shouted, elicting thousands of ``Amens.'' ``That
wall must come down! It's time to see Jesus!''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's three-hour service at the Heritage Christian Center,
with a Baptist choir and the popular black singing group Silk,
contrasted with Sunday's outdoor vigil that was attended by Vice
President Al Gore and criticized by some religious leaders for
having been as white as the snow that falls on the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Metro Denver Ministerial Alliance, a largely black
group, has publicly complained that Sunday's event represented a
narrow view of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Shoels, the only black victim of the April 20 shooting rampage,
was hailed as a victim of a ``new-age'' hate crime, a millennium
martyr, the face of the phenomenon of schoolyard killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left us a message,'' said Vicki Buckley, ``He left us a
message about new-age hate crimes that are no different from a man
being dragged to his death behind the back of a pickup truck in
Jasper'' _ a reference to the killing of James Byrd last year in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   More simply, Shoels's grandfather reminded people that the color
of blood is always red no matter how dark the color of the skin
that shields it.
</P>
<P>
   While Shoels's burial was the last for the 12 students and one
teacher killed by Harris and Klebold, the mourning in Littleton was
unabated Thursday. Searching for something they cannot fully
explain, thousands keep returning to Columbine High School at all
hours of the day and night.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine to the shooting victims now resembles a tiny village,
with canvas tents originally set up to protect mourners from snow
and rain now serving as meeting spots for people who want to strum
guitars, pray, or sit for hours.
</P>
<P>
   While makeshift memorials have sprouted up across the country,
marking tradegies at roadsides or city parks, the one that keeps
growing in Littleton will be preserved by historians who say it can
provide valuable lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The Clement Park memorial site next to the school inspires
silence, with visitors hushing their voices as they tour nearly
four acres of artwork, passages from the Scriptures, and photo
collages showing smiling children taking their first steps or
waving goodbye as they leave for their first class trip abroad.
Now, historians say the same process that followed the Oklahoma
City bombing, an effort to preserve the momentos left by mourners,
will begin here.
</P>
<P>
   Truckloads of flowers will eventually be discarded, but many are
already being crushed into potpourri for mourning families.
Beginning May 10, the Bibles, stuffed animals, baseball hats,
candles, and varsity letter jackets will be taken from the site and
stored at a large warehouse, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 100 years, someone is going to look this tragedy, and they
are going to look at our mourning process,'' said Edith Hylton,
manager of community services.
</P>
<P>
   The written words and artwork, ranging from the sophisticated
sketchings of local artists to the simple thoughts of Colordo
kindergarden students, are among the priorities for the team of
local historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pieces that got to me were the posterboards filled with
pictures of Dave Sanders' players,'' said Hylton, referring to the
girls' softball team coached by the slain teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chest just tightens up every time I look at those team
pictures,'' Hylton said. ``We're leaving a legacy that shows this
community cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they are focusing on how Harris and Klebold
assembled a small arsenal of weapons, and Thursday confirmed that
the semiautomatic handgun used in the killing was sold within the
last 18 months at a Denver area gun shop.
</P>
<P>
   A man who worked at a pizza shop with Harris and Klebold may
have acted as a broker, putting the boys in touch with the seller,
investigators said. They say the co-worker has hired an attorney
and has agreed to speak with them.
</P>
<P>
   The seller of the handgun is also represented by an attorney,
and authorities said the dealer had stepped forward to negotitate
the terms of an arrest and possible plea arrangement. In Colorado,
it is illegal for a licensed gun dealer to sell a handgun to anyone
under age 21.
</P>
<P>
   The three long guns used in the attack were purchased by
Klebold's 18-year-old girlfriend, Robyn Anderson, police have said.
It is not illegal for an 18-year-old like Harris to possess a
hunting rifle or shotgun in the state, and police have said
Anderson is not a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County officials Thursday said arrests do not appear
imminent, but they remain convinced that the pair had help placing
explosives around the school and carrying the heavy weaponry used
in the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said a special toxicology test would be needed to
confirm reports that Harris had been taking the antidepressant drug
Luvox. Earlier this week, the coroner's office said no drugs or
alcohol were found in the bodies of any of the 15 who died. But a
special test is needed to detect a prescription drug like Luvox.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's use of the drug played a role in his rejection by the
Marine Corps just five days before the shooting. His parents had
told the Marines about their son's medical history, which Harris
had repeatedly denied to recruiters.

BOMBINGS HAVE BOOSTED YUGOSLAV ARMY'S MORALE, DESPITE NATO'S
INTENTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NATO bombing that was intended to cripple and
demoralize Slobodan Milosevic's military machine has instead
invigorated the Yugoslav army and has helped him heal his
long-poisoned relationship with the officers corps, according to
American and NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   These senior military and intelligence officials said that more
than five weeks of bombing has rallied the Yugoslav army to the
defense of its country, sharply increased the willingness of
recruits to serve in the military and given senior army officers a
mission that they finally feel is legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Milosevic and the army's senior
officers had been soured by a decade of distrust and purges,
delayed pay checks and prosecutions for treason. The bombing has
finally provided those officers and the Yugoslav leader with a
common enemy: NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `rally-round-the flag' effect in Serbia has been
profound,'' said a government official who has been studying the
Balkans for a decade and attributes the change in army morale to
the NATO bombing. ``It is not Slobo's war, it is the army defending
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite public assertions that the bombing is going well,
intelligence reports provide a far less sanguine assessment of
NATO's war in the Balkans. Long-time observers of Yugoslavia in the
U.S. government said in a series of interviews that the Yugoslav
army in Kosovo has escaped crippling materiel damage and
significant casualties by dispersing its units well before bombs
began to demolish their bases, barracks and fuel depots.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's campaign has also had the unwanted consequence of helping
to restore the Yugoslav army to the respected position it enjoyed
before the violent collapse of the Yugoslav federation began in
1991. Then, the army was the primary glue holding Tito's
multinational union together. As such, it was systematically
weakened and humiliated by Milosevic to suit his nationalist ends _
until NATO's bombing changed his defense needs.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has had only ``a marginal effect'' in diminishing
the capacity of Yugoslav forces to force ethnic Albanians out of
Kosovo or carry out attacks against insurgents from the Kosovo
Liberation Army, one of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, insisted in
Brussels, Belgium, this week that the bombing had hobbled Yugoslav
air defenses and was wearing away the resources of Milosevic's
armed forces. But Clark also acknowledged that despite the bombing,
``you might actually find out that he's strengthened his forces in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials in Washington went considerably farther this
week. They characterized as ``greatly exaggerated'' claims by
Western leaders and NATO commanders that the bombing has damaged
the morale of the Yugoslav army and hampered Milosevic's ability to
conscript troops.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Serbia, since the bombing began, the army's image in the
eyes of the Serb people seems to have soared, mostly noticeably in
the capital, Belgrade. There, where many residents had lost respect
for the military because of its failures in unpopular ethnic
conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia, the army is now regarded as the
defender of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslav males did not want to get sucked into the fights in
Croatia or Bosnia,'' said a U.S. military official who has long
experience in the region. ``But indications are that young men are
responding to the draft now and in significantly higher numbers
than in the past. After five weeks of bombing in Kosovo, they are
saying to themselves, `Gosh, we are still standing.' It is easy to
march to the drum if you don't think you are going to get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon commanders maintain that the air war is slowly
but steadily taking the Yugoslav military apart. They say the Air
Force has been disabled and essentially grounded, especially after
recent strikes against aircraft discovered at an airfield in
Montenegro. They concede that Yugoslavia's army is holding up
relatively well so far, but vow that the intensifying campaign will
grind away its forces and their morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not feeling it yet to the full extent, they will in
time,'' said a senior U.S. military officer. ``These are hearty
people. They're used to a certain amount of suffering. You're not
going to crush their morale in 30 days. They're going to have feel
some real pain before they collapse.''

 WASHINGTON: they collapse.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A key to the army's success so far is that its commanders knew
they would have to absorb punishment and, the experts said, they
prepared well for it.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO's air war began on March 24, the Yugoslav army had
already built up its forces in and around Kosovo. It relied on a
large number of reservists and conscripts to fill out a force of
about 40,000, including 24,000 army and 16,000 military police.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's initial barrages focused almost exclusively on
Yugoslavia's air defenses. By the time NATO turned to army targets,
including barracks, staging areas and headquarters, they had been
emptied. NATO and the Pentagon now believe that five weeks of
bombing have caused total casualties that number only ``in the
hundreds,'' as one official put it.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clark asked for and received approval to intensify
the strikes at the end of March, the army and police units had
routed the Albanians from most of Kosovo's villages and towns. Then
they hunkered down. Some have dug into defensive positions along
Kosovo's borders with Albania and Macedonia, but most have
dispersed, moving in relatively small units that are much harder
for NATO's high-flying warplanes to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hiding their vehicles whenever they can, staying under
cover, staying relatively immobile _ number one to cover themselves
from air strikes and number two to conserve fuel,'' a senior
defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Pentagon estimated that NATO attacks had
destroyed 10 percent to 20 percent of the 300 tanks the Yugoslav
army has in Kosovo. To put it another way, that leaves 80 percent
to 90 percent still intact in the province, by the Pentagon's own
count.
</P>
<P>
   While officials say the attacks have limited Yugoslavia's
ability to mount effective military operations, the army does not
have to mount offenses at this point, having having completed its
campaign in Kosovo. It simply has to hold on to the defensive
positions it has on the ground. It could do that indefinitely,
officials said, as long as its soldiers remain motivated despite
the destruction of fixed targets like headquarters and barracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a while before you have any wear and tear on the
foot soldier,'' said one senior U.S. military officer. ``It's hard
to do that with air power alone. That's the lesson of Vietnam. We
pounded Vietnam and we never did stop the supplies along the Ho Chi
Minh trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's armed forces, while badly overmatched, have
effectively used churches, schools and hospitals to shield troops
and equipment against strikes by pilots under orders to avoid
killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken their strengths and applied them against our
weaknesses,'' said a former western military attache to Belgrade.
``They know our loathing to lose pilots, and they've used their air
defenses in a way that exploits that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Intelligence reports indicate that the army is still able to get
fuel to its forces, although there are widespread shortages and
rationing for civilians. While the destruction of railways and
bridges has made transport of fuel much more difficult, two senior
defense officials said the army was still shipping gasoline in
small convoys of six-axle trucks, bypassing destroyed routes or
building makeshift river crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to improvise and endure underscores how NATO's war
has revitalized the army's officer corps.
</P>
<P>
   Many officers have long grumbled about and, in some cases,
flatly opposed the wars that Milosevic pursued in Croatia and in
Bosnia. In the course of those conflicts in the early 1990s, he
shifted resources from the army, which historically has seen its
mission as one of protecting the nation from outside aggression, to
the more loyal and more pliable Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers are now significantly better paid and have
better housing than army officers. These changes caused enormous
morale problems among an officer corps that plucked its recruits
from villages, trained them in guerrilla warfare and largely
insulated them from the country's chronic economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also purged scores of senior army officers to find
generals willing to command troops that work with police in savage
attacks on civilians. Mid-level officers in the army have long
questioned the professionalism of these Milosevic loyalists, while
quietly voicing doubts to Western military officers about the
future of the army itself.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. government experts on the region said this week that
the bombing of Yugoslavia has silenced the grumbling and erased the
doubts, at least for now, while handing the army a mission that
officers perceive as both legal and just.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either by dumb luck or a stroke of genius, Milosevic has given
the army a direction,'' said the U.S. military official who spent
time in the region. ``Militaries respond well to crises. When you
talk to senior Yugoslav army officers, they always speak of the
constitution. They will talk about defending their borders against
external threats and defending the country against internal
enemies. It is not much of a stretch for the army to take the
situation on the ground in Kosovo and feel they are doing the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly as result of this, the army appears to have moved to the
dominant command position in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NATO campaign has put the Yugoslav army in first place in
the institutional command for the first time this decade,'' said
James Gow, a specialist on the Yugoslav army who teaches war
studies at Kings College, London.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt among military analysts, both inside and
outside the U.S. government, that a large NATO ground force could
make short work of the out-of-date tanks and artillery pieces that
would be the pillars of the Yugoslav army defense.
</P>
<P>
   But a successful NATO ground attack that cut through Yugoslav
army lines would probably not quickly destroy its ability to
inflict casualties on Western troops, U.S. government officials and
other military analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the Yugoslav army has planned since World War II
to fight a hit-and-run war against an overwhelming force that could
not be kept from invading the country, but could be punished by
months of guerrilla attacks. In mountain bunkers and underground
depots across Yugoslavia, the army has massive stockpiles of fuel,
food and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think they can beat NATO,'' said a U.S. official.
``But their objective is to try to inflict as much pain as
possible. Morale and terrain, they hope, will off-set NATO's
advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greek ambassador to the United States, Alexandre Philon,
said that the Yugoslav military has long planned to sustain a war
not by repelling an attack but by absorbing it with several layers
of defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very good and would withdraw from open warfare,''
said Philon. ``They train for that, plan for that. They are people
who can last much longer than a traditional army. If NATO ground
forces went in, there'd be a lot of fighting.''

COMMENTARY: SPIES AND CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How come they can do it right here in America and how
come our government does not take action when the crimes are
discovered?
</P>
<P>
   The woman next to me at dinner was asking the question all
Americans should ask about China's continuous and successful
nuclear espionage against the U.S. _ how come?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far only one or two people have been named as suspected
spies, who got hold of thousands of pages of American secret
information on nuclear weapons _ one of the great espionage coups
of our time.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it is almost comical _ any belief that one or two men could
find out exactly where the information was, what data to search for
and in what priority, how to extract it from lab computers without
getting caught, and the names and access codes of the companies in
America that are fronts for the Chinese government and Chinese
Army. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historians will be writing books about Beijing's counterparts to
the Soviet spy rings in America, and the Cambridge treason crowd in
Britain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which for years ignored early tips
on the espionage, now stalls on releasing information gathered by a
committee headed by Rep. Christopher Cox of California. But I
expect pretty soon the investigation teams of The Times and other
papers will break the story of the spy rings plural and their
contacts plural. Read the excellent article in the May issue of The
American Spectator by Kenneth R. Timmerman, one of the experts read
by other experts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But still _ how come these made-in-China spies? The answers are
essential not only to understanding the espionage case but the
character _ the precise word _ of President Clinton's problems
about other critical realities, from Lewinsky to Kosovo.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For almost all its time in office the administration has
preached and practiced a policy toward the Chinese government that
he had denounced before he was elected the first time but soon
adopted, widened and made more dangerous to American interests and
ideals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The policy is that the only way to get China to behave itself,
and not do nasty things like engaging in nuclear espionage and
torturing political and religious prisoners, is to build up
U.S.-China trade. Like his American business mentors and our
foreign allies, the president calls it the policy of engagement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is, it is _ engagement with China's Communist Politburo, not
with the Chinese people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The administration uses an old trick to fight American people
and organizations who still want what he supported before assorted
CEO's and political donors got to him _ the use of economic
leverage to squeeze human rights concessions out of the
Politburo.Clinton falsely accuses them of the fatal weakness of his
own policy _ playing only one note on his saxophone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Chinese take the trade money and tell the world to get
lost about human rights, or go in for nuclear espionage in America,
the president has a choice. He can remain a prisoner of Beijing by
insisting he is right.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he can break out of his cage by admitting error and
returning to the mixture of realism and idealism he had promised
Americans, to get the votes of those who cared.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But somehow I doubt he will ever do that. I think he really
believes that evasion, falsehood, stonewalling, listening to the
music of the cash register and not of the soul, stalling _ about
Monica or about espionage _ are the instruments of government and
the path of self-preservation. I suppose they are, for him.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They worked to save him from impeachment. They were useful in
helping Americans forget the promise he once spoke into my own
little ears _ not to send troops to Bosnia.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They are not quite working to save him from world realization
that neither he nor the other NATO brains ever thought that
Slobodan Milosevic would be so crass as to use NATO bombing as the
right moment to drive out the Albanians, turning the war into a
disaster for Albanians, NATO, Americans and Serbs who positioned
themselves under the bombs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He will not change his character, nor the fact that character of
a president determines character of presidential policy. He has not
yet said that espionage by his Chinese captors is good for America.
But he has a year and a half of presidential time left to figure
how to break the news.

   FUROR OVER SHAS TAPE: A videotape released by the ultra-Orthodox
Shas Party has caused a storm. In the tape, Shas leader Aryeh Deri,
who was recently sentenced on bribery charges, said the judicial
system had railroaded him because he is a Moroccan-born religious
Jew. Both confusing and offending many here, Deri compared his
treatment with that of John Demjanjuk, whose conviction as a Nazi
war criminal was overturned, and to that of Adolf Eichmann, a
convicted Nazi war criminal who was executed.

FUNDS FOR NATO'S AIR WAR, BUT LITTLE MORAL SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans moved on Thursday to add billions
of dollars to the bill for NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, the
day after denying President Clinton political support to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said ``the Congress is
deeply divided'' over the fighting in the Balkans. That appeared to
be a rare understatement on Capitol Hill on Thursday, as
skirmishing and sniping over the political and economic costs of
the war erupted all over Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the House Appropriations Committee approved
nearly $13 billion in emergency spending, $7 billion more than the
White House sought. The committee's chairman said the money was
intended to fix pressing military needs and to ``let the troops
know we really support them.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure was labeled as ``relating to the conflict in
Kosovo.'' But Clinton's budget director said it included extra
billions for military projects with ``no relation to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pushing for the added spending, some of whom now
speak of the conflict as ``Clinton's war,'' said they saw no
contradiction in voting to reject a measure supporting the fighting
while voting for money to finance it.
</P>
<P>
   They called the extra billions in the spending bill a small
downpayment toward beefing up the post-Cold War Pentagon. Some
angrily accused President Clinton and the Democrats of bleeding the
American arsenal and leading the nation into a military morass.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the same chicken hawks who vote against defense all
the time,'' Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, said
in an interview. ``Not only is their president getting us in a
mess, but he's undermining our military.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats bitterly charged Republicans with sabotaging American
foreign policy after Wednesday night's unexpected 213-213 House
vote withholding support for the bombing of Serbian targets. Their
leaders said the vote could encourage the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, to think the United States and NATO might be
weakening in their war aims.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of unity on Thursday, Secretary of Defense William
Cohen and Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
appeared unannounced at the regular Pentagon briefing to criticize
the House vote and emphasize NATO's ``solidarity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a vote signaling less support on the air campaign is
counterproductive,'' said Cohen. ``But we will continue to wage
this effort and we will continue to take this case to the American
people, and we will continue to go after Milosevic until such time
as we achieve our goals.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats had been confident the measure would pass. DeLay
called that ``a monumental miscalculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The House minority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri,
said the vote marked ``a low moment in American foreign policy and
in the history of this institution'' and ``a betrayal of everything
America stands for.'' To follow that vote with a move to add
billions of dollars of unrequested Pentagon spending to the
emergency bill was ``hypocrisy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mindboggling that some of the same members that voted
against the operation will today vote to double the spending for
the operation,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   In the House Appropriations Committee, Republicans and a handful
of Democrats who usually support military spending increases
approved a $12.9 billion emergency bill. It more than doubled the
$5.1 billion Clinton sought to pay for military operations in the
Balkans through Sept. 30. The request included money to pay for
military operations in Iraq dating back to December.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Jack Lew, Clinton's budget director, said House
Republicans were ``going too far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're exaggerating the costs of the Kosovo operation and
they're funding things that meet no one's definition of an
emergency,'' he said. ``It matters that we level with the American
people as to what is and is not an emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The House spending bill added nearly half a billion dollars for
bombs and missiles the Pentagon did not request. It would also
finance more than $1 billion in military construction projects,
most of them at bases in Europe. It also includes $1.8 billion in
pay increases for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The law says emergency spending must be restricted to
``unanticipated'' and ``immediate'' needs. The chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, Rep. C.W. Bill Young of Florida, said
that the bill met some pressing military demands, would cover
hidden costs of the Kosovo conflict, and would show that Congress
``stands behind our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration's record in anticipating the costs of
military deployments is pretty sad,'' Young said. ``We were
supposed to be in the Balkans for a year, at a cost of $1.5
billion. Five years later, it's nine billion.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill could be voted on by the full House next week, he said.
A Senate vote on an emergency bill would come the following week,
following a House-Senate conference.
</P>
<P>
   If such a bill arrives on the president's desk, he does not have
to take it or leave it, Young said. He can decide that any given
item within the bill is not an emergency and withhold his approval
for that project. The money would go unspent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on what your definition of 'emergency' is,''
Young said. ``That's a phrase that should be familiar to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is also struggling over two bills that would finance
the conflict and urge the President to achieve victory over Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee has drafted a $12 billion
spending bill for the war. But at least six senators, all fiscal
conservatives, say they are loath to vote for a bill far in excess
of the president's request, especially since the money will come
from excess Social Security revenues, which they have sworn to
protect.

ANALYSIS: IN UNUSUAL MOVE, HOUSE FAILS TO BACK BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: in DeLay quote, ``convicted'' is CQ)  
 (bl)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Congress, or even one house of Congress, to
refuse to endorse current combat missions is about as unusual as
Congress' keeping pork out of an urgent spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the House is taking the first of those untrodden paths even
as it takes its customary route on the second. Wednesday night it
voted not to endorse the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday its Appropriations Committee voted to spend more than
twice what the administration sought for the campaign and another
billion or so for other neat stuff like base construction.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, the contradiction may not matter much. But who
knows if this war is a short-run conflict? And if it is not, the
deep partisan division raises embarrassing warnings for the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since it took office, the administration has paid more
attention to the Senate than the House, and hardly any to
individual House Republicans. From 1995 through early 1998,
President Clinton could occasionally deal with Speaker Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House approach was generally to count on the
Senate to clean up any mess the House made. And the Senate, where
most members can visualize themselves in the Oval Office, is
inclined to see virtue in a powerful presidency, especially for
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern has persisted. Clinton has talked to congressional
leaders about Yugoslavia, but not to the rank and file. And the
White House, concentrating on the other votes on the Wednesday
schedule _ a bid to withdraw and a demand for consultation before
ground troops might be used _ was caught napping on the bombing
vote.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the only factor. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, as
majority whip the president's most powerful enemy in Congress, was
doing his utmost to turn votes against the bombing, while Speaker
Dennis Hastert sat quietly, not even casting his ``aye'' vote early
to give a signal of his support for it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., said that after she had voted to
endorse the bombing, DeLay had come up to her and asked: `` `Are
you sure of this vote? Are you really convicted, because we really
need a `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she rejected his plea and that he went away, but
that she changed her vote to ``no'' after talking to others.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay issued a statement Thursday saying that it was 26
Democratic defections, not his lobbying, that defeated the measure
on a tie, 213-213. He called it a Democratic miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   An aide, Mike Scanlon, said: ``We talked to members on the
floor. We didn't twist any arms. We didn't break any knuckles.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a point when he accused Democrats of being overconfident.
After 92 Republicans had voted earlier against compelling a
withdrawal of troops under the War Powers Resolution, Democrats
assumed that most would consider it logical to endorse the bombing.
But 61 of them switched, leaving only 31 Republicans behind the
president on the final vote.
</P>
<P>
   The White House seized on the contradictions. Press secretary
Joe Lockhart termed the results ``a muddle.'' He said: ``They did
not want to move forward with ground troops. They voted against
withdrawing and were deadlocked on the merits of the air campaign.
The only thing they seem to agree on is that they want to double
the amount of money we should spend on this policy that they can't
agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans interpreted their votes differently. Majority
Leader Dick Armey said in an interview, ``I did not want to give
them an after-the-fact blessing.'' He said the day's important
message was the demand, which passed, that Clinton consult before
using ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said in another interview, ``We didn't whip anybody.''
He faulted Clinton for having ignored his advice to come and talk
to House members.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay told the House not to ``take ownership'' of the war by
supporting it. He was telling Republicans to let the president keep
the inevitable blame for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is unusual for members of Congress not to do the safe
thing and vote in favor of a war that has already started (even
while complaining about it), it is almost unheard of for
Republicans to invoke the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which passed
despite them and over President Richard M. Nixon's veto.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote to demand a withdrawal of United States forces from
the war in 30 days rested on that act. Although it was defeated,
290-139, Republicans backed it, 127-92.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, has
accused many in his party of creeping isolationism. Thursday he
called the invocation of the War Powers Resolution ``legislation
the Republicans have always despised, in order to cut off a
military action that is under way and upon whose success American
credibility depends, is really appalling, really irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   This administration, like its predecessors, regards the
resolution as unconstitutional. As the appropriations vote Thursday
shows, there is not the faintest inclination to halt financing the
war, an undoubted congressional power.
</P>
<P>
   But House opposition can spread to the Senate. An unwilling
Congress dealing with war cannot make it easier. Especially if the
public continues to share what Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif.,
chairman of the Rules Committee, Thursday called ``the same kind of
confusion that exists in the Balkans, that exists in the White
House, that exists in the Congress.''

US TROOPS READY TO DO THEIR DUTY FOR KOSOVARS

   RINAS, Albania _ Knee-deep in Balkan spring mud and surrounded
by heavy, offensive weaponry, the US soldiers at the airport base
here are in the same boat as the Albanian refugees they are
defending and the Yugoslav enemy they are trained to defeat:
waiting for someone in NATO to make the decision to go to a ground
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the actual people it happens to, the indigenous
people'' who hang around the air base looking for temporary work,
said Army Lt. Timothy Wolfe, 26, as he stood by a Bradley Fighting
Vehicle. ``It gives you a sense of why you are here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always looking forward to the opportunity to do what we
are trained to do,'' Wolfe said, when asked about the possibility
of a ground war. ``So I would say, yeah, it's always exciting to
think about the possibility of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the thousands of US soldiers holed up about 16 miles
from the capital of Tirana will actually get around to doing it _
waging a ground war against the Yugoslav Army _ is still an open
question here.
</P>
<P>
   Many local Albanians, anxious to destroy the regime of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and to return the Kosovar refugees who
are clogging private homes and public spaces here, are hoping US
and other NATO troops will head over the border and finish the job
against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the troops, planes, missiles and tanks
stationed at the headquarters for Task Force Hawk are simply
waiting for the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilots are always chomping at the bit,'' said spokesman Capt.
Martin Downie. ``They're ready to go at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the two airmen who survived this week's explosion of the
Apache attack helicopter are ready to go back on the job, their
colleagues say.
</P>
<P>
   The two unnamed pilots ``brushed themselves off'' after the
Monday night crash which destroyed the aircraft, and are ready to
take off again, said Capt. Mark Arden.
</P>
<P>
   The infantry forces stationed at Rinas are less enthusiastic
than their flying colleagues, but ready to go if ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some anxiety here,'' said Sgt. Darnell McKinney, 25.
``But we're trained for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to the refugees,'' he added. ``I read an
article about a little girl being molested, and my heart was full
of rage and anger. I can't believe this is actually happening,''
McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always anxious to do your job, but given what our job
is, you don't want to rush into anything,'' Wolfe said. The
infantry would prefer that the air campaign be completed _
``destroying as much as possible'' of Milosevic's artillery _
before the troops go in, Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   US military officials won't say how many troops are at the base,
and how many have moved to other posts, such as the
Albanian-Kosovar border. A total of 5,350 troops have been okayed
for the mission, and ``they continue to flow in,'' Downie said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the reason the troops and Bradley Fighting Vehicles
are here is to provide protection for the Apache helicopters and
their crews. But the vast array of weaponry viewed by a small group
of reporters at the base seems like overkill for the guarding of a
couple of dozen helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have spotted some weaponry up north, where some
shelling has been reported from the Serbian side of the border.
Downie refused to confirm the sightings, but said the munitions
``need to go where they need to go. It's not all going to be at the
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the troops are left to conduct dress rehearsals
for a show that may never arrive.
</P>
<P>
   They fly helicopters, and take the Bradleys out for spins in the
mud. They maintain planes and other vehicles. About 500 are
involved in getting humanitarian supplies to refugees elsewhere in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to basically wait it out'' until NATO makes the big
move, McKinney said. ``We're good at waiting it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A bomb scare Thursday held up civilian and military air traffic
for awhile, but so far, no explosive has been found.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb-sniffing dog noted ``something suspicious'' in a civilian
truck filled with gravel that was driven onto the base, said Maj.
Tom Dolney, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A second dog was sent in, and the animal also found something
wrong, so the military sent in a special robot to detect explosives
in the gravel, he said. Air Force and Navy personnel were moved
from the area as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials wouldn't speculate on the nature or source of
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   But ``there are a lot of lawless groups in Albania who aren't
too thrilled about NATO being here,'' Downie said. ``This is an
offensive operation. It's as close to combat as we've gotten.''

   DENVER _ It was the last one, and from the look of it, everyone
on earth showed up Thursday. The mourners poured in and poured in,
filling the mall-sized parking lot, lining the streets around the
church for three blocks each way, and jamming the Heritage
Christian Center sanctuary to the doors, so that late-comers had to
watch the ceremony on television monitors in the church gym.
</P>
<P>
   This last funeral, in the longest week of funerals ever seen in
the broken-hearted community surrounding Columbine High School, was
for Isaiah Shoels, the 4-foot 11-inch football player who was to
graduate in two weeks. The one singled out because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 5,000 mourners _ students, faculty and parents
connected to Columbine High in Littleton and people from here in
Denver who never knew Isaiah Shoels _ came to celebrate a youth
remembered as preternaturally happy and exceedingly polite. But it
became clear, through the many eulogies, the presence of state
dignitaries and the outpouring of grief, that the ceremony Thursday
was for all 13 victims of the shooting and bombing rampage
perpetrated on Columbine High by two students who no one,
apparently, really knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last piece,'' said the Rev. Larry Russell,
executive pastor of the Heritage Christian Center, after his church
choir sang a rousing medley of gospel tunes. ``Now the healing
begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, though tinged with humor, was a sorrowful
occasion, with sobs heard throughout it. Many of the hundreds of
Columbine students in attendance sat together, forming a solemn
assembly of young faces that have shed more than their share of
tears since the massacre that ravaged their lives nine days ago. At
times, groups of students left the sanctuary in twos and threes to
cry in the lobby. One young woman wracked with grief fell on her
knees and stayed that way, until after several moments she was
helped to her feet by a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the young woman was close with Shoels, her friend shook
his head.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speakers, one of Isaiah Shoels' teachers, Tim Capra,
remembered him as the student who all the other students wanted to
be around, who eagerly helped his teachers, who always made his
class laugh. Frank DeAngelis, the principal, brought laughter when
he remembered that Isaiah always addressed him when they met in the
halls with a nod and a ``Hey, Mr. D.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the other 12 students killed April 20, Isaiah Shoels had
plans. The second of five children, he planned to attend an arts
college and become a music producer. His father, Michael, said he
had no doubts his son would succeed. He had, after all, survived
two heart surgeries, the first when he was 6 months old. Built like
a fireplug, he could bench press twice his weight and became a star
varsity football player.
</P>
<P>
   He was buried in his cap and gown.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III, recalling his father's assassination 31
years ago, used the occasion to announce that the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference planned to mount a renew a campaign
of collecting guns. ``A lot of people in America were saddened by
what happened in Columbine but we should not be shocked,'' he said.
``For we knew that America had sown the seeds of violence and our
children are still reaping the fruits of that violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens state joined dozens of other local political and
religious leaders who did not speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the privilege of knowing Isaiah,'' Owens said.
``And I didn't know the boy that we buried yesterday or the child
that we buried on Tuesday, and Monday, or Sunday or Saturday. But I
do know these were good children. If there's any good that can come
from this, it's that it's bringing Colorado and the nation
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Isaiah was singled out by his killers because
he was black, the Heritage Christian Center was filled with black
and white mourners, many who came together. And the tearful
ceremony broadcast live on CNN took a different turn once the
cameras were gone, half the mourners had left, and Isaiah's powder
blue coffin was closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dennis Leonard, a pastor at the church, asked everyone
in the pews to come down to the altar. Everyone did. The
dignitaries on the stage and the people from the balcony joined
those from the pews who surrounded the coffin decorated with blue
and white carnations. The pastor asked everyone to raise their
right hands and say ``Isaiah's life was not in vain.'' Everyone
said it. Then they applauded and cheered.
</P>

   The awesome church choir began signing ``It'll be all right,''
and people began dancing in the aisles. One woman literally danced
a jig. ``It'll be all right, `` It'll be all right,'' the choir
kept repeating as people filed out, many of them smiling, as though
they believed it.

DISCOVERING THE ALLURE OF A EUROPEAN SUMMER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Kristin Hohenadel's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was
about Wayne Wang's ``Chinese Box.''  
 By KRISTIN HOHENADEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The wedding lasted from late one August afternoon
through daybreak. At a long table beneath the shady trees in
Normandy, three generations toasted the newlyweds with homemade
Calvados and unlabeled champagne from the in-laws' vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   The table was artfully strewn with fruit and flowers. Chickens
plucked the meadow grass; children feasted on peaches nearly burst
with sweetness. I danced with a queue of expectant boy cousins
under the 3 a.m. stars.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the midst of all that, I stole away inside myself
and thought: I feel like I'm in a movie. For in my New England
childhood, long before it was possible to make such romantic
pilgrimages in person, European cinema had taught me how to dream
of a European summer.
</P>
<P>
   While we barbecued in our sterile backyards, those celluloid
Europeans cast their yachts onto the Mediterranean, picnicked among
sunflowers in the Van Gogh fields of Provence, sipped wine in
outdoor cafes. They swam in tranquil Tuscan pools, rowed on
picturesque lakes, took endless strolls and bicycle rides down
leafy country lanes. Their summers were made of small, civilized
pleasures acted out on what seemed the most exquisite stage in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Europe was a feast, summer its most luscious course; and
Europeans knew how to savor every morsel. If those Tuesday nights
at the art house with my mother had taught me anything, it was that
there was a charmed life waiting elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the train to Normandy was swamped with Germans
and college students. Venice was a hot, mobbed, rude shock in July.
But that Europe of my imagination has never failed to be a metaphor
for all of life's romantic possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Renoir's ``A Day in the Country,'' made in 1936,
demonstrated that pleasure often revolves around the achievement of
a very simple desire _ in this case, finding the perfect spot for
lunch. In black-and-white scenes framed like anemic versions of the
Impressionist paintings of the director's father, an uptight
Parisian family chooses a spot beneath the cherry trees in which to
unwind, has long discussions about the tomatoes and the wine.
</P>
<P>
   In between, girls in flowered hats push one another on tree
swings and marvel over caterpillars. Local young men twirl their
handlebar mustaches and row the ladies down the river. And there
is, in the bushes by the river, a stolen kiss that will ignite a
lifetime of desire.
</P>
<P>
   The cinematic summer in Europe often involves what happens when
all the relatives are thrown together in the country house. In
Louis Malle's ``May Fools'' (1990), it's a death that reunites the
family in the midst of the 1968 Paris riots.
</P>
<P>
   They spend so much time discussing the menu, it's easy to wonder
if they're gathered for a wedding banquet or a funeral. They picnic
in the grass, exchange partners and sexual orientations. No matter
what happens, the whole family takes a walk in the woods after
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Europeans devote whole months to pleasure in the
summertime. Perhaps this helps explain the pace of such films as
Eric Rohmer's ``La Collectioneuse'' (1971), in which beautiful
young people lie about in a villa on the shores of the
Mediterranean. Walk countless times down a rocky hillside to the
sea. Sleep in the sand. Live and relive the sensual particulars of
their sun-baked flirtations.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Claire's Knee'' (1971), Rohmer's camera lingers on the
serene mountains and lakes near Annecy, in the French Alps. The
film is emblematic of all the desire conjured up by the season in
its signature image of Claire's bronzed knee, glimmering in the sun
while she stands on a ladder picking cherries from a tree. And in
Andre Techine's ``Wild Reeds'' (1990), the passionate cauldron of a
southern French summer is the setting for an adolescent love
triangle that captures the wistfulness of lost innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the moments that can be singled out, there are surely
dozens of others that have been assimilated directly into the
imagination. If we know the meaning of the words Rome in the
summertime, it is because Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni
tiptoed barefoot in the Trevi Fountain at midnight in Fellini's
1960 ``La Dolce Vita.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If we grasp the meaning of summer on the Riviera, it's thanks to
the naked derriere of Brigitte Bardot in the opening scene of ``And
God Created Woman'' (1956), sunning herself in a port town near St.
Tropez.
</P>
<P>
   If we have memorized the quiet poetry of an Italian island, it's
because we have watched Mario Ruoppolo on his daily route up the
winding road toward the house of the exiled Pablo Neruda in ``Il
Postino,'' the bay spreading out before him. If we understand that
the piazza is the beating heart of every village, it is from the
main square in Giuseppe Tornatore's ``Cinema Paradiso'' (1990), in
which men linger in the silky night air, church bells ring out at
every hour, girls wash their hair in the fountain in the noon sun.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise forgettable movies can imprint a montage of resonant
images. Claude Chabrol's psychological thriller ``L'Enfer'' is less
compelling for its story than for its evocative scenes of life at
an inn in the Pyrenees. In the end, Bertrand Tavernier's ``Sunday
in the Country'' can be remembered as a series of sharply etched
paintings: Little girls in lace dresses jumping rope; a civilized
Sunday walk; drinks under the rose arbor on the sprawling lawn of
the many-roomed house covered in overgrown vines.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, our most vivid images of summer on the Continent are
provided by outsiders. Take Kenneth Branagh's scenic 1993
adaptation of ``Much Ado About Nothing,'' filmed on the grounds of
a Tuscan villa, or movie versions of novels by Henry James such as
``Portrait of a Lady,'' in which Isabel Archer follows her
wanderlust to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the country outside of Florence, after all, that Lucy
Honeychurch kissed George Benson in the barley field in the 1985
Merchant and Ivory adaptation of E.M. Forster's ``Room with a
View.'' And while it wasn't quite summer when the ladies escaped
dreary London in search of wisteria and sunshine in an Italian
villa by the sea in Mike Newell's ``Enchanted April'' (1991), it
might as well have been.
</P>
<P>
   Bertolucci's ``Stealing Beauty'' was a visually seductive ode to
the Tuscan expatriate fantasy; Richard Linklater's ``Before
Sunrise'' blatantly exploited the stranger-on-a-train fantasy, as
its protagonists get off to wander Vienna in a 24-hour love affair.
</P>
<P>
   These films offer glimpses of what awaits such romantic
pioneers. We can observe from a safe distance as our innocents
abroad search for what has eluded them so far _ beauty, truth,
love, escape, enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   David Lean's ``Summertime'' (1955) is a timeless postcard from
Venice, the city Gore Vidal once called ``the most beautiful cliche
in the world.'' But it's also a story about awakening and
transformation, as the spinster played by Katharine Hepburn dances
with her married Italian lover under a full Venice moon, walks
through the Piazza San Marco at midnight, floats down the Grand
Canal on a gondola at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   It was that summer in Normandy that did me in. The next time I
set foot on French soil, it was with the intention of staying as
long as the dream lasted. Katharine Hepburn leaves him in the end,
takes her indelible memories of that Venice summer and boards the
train toward home.
</P>
<P>
   It's been five summers since that August wedding, and there are
still days when I gaze upon my life as if upon a movie screen,
wondering when that sensation will end.
</P>

BAFFERT KEEPS THEM GUESSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Bob Baffert kept bettors _ and owner John
Mabee _ guessing Thursday about his plans for Santa Anita Oaks
winner Excellent Meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer said he'll announce this morning whether Excellent
Meeting will run in this afternoon's 1[-mile Kentucky Oaks against
seven fillies or in Saturday's 1\-mile Kentucky Derby against one
filly and 18 colts and geldings.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert promised Churchill Downs he'll make the call before
wagering begins on the track's unique Oaks-Derby double. Baffert
would prefer the Derby; he already has Silverbulletday in the Oaks.
Mabee would prefer the Oaks; he already has General Challenge in
the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Mabee, the San Diego insurance man, apparently was persuaded to
enter Excellent Meeting in the Derby as well as the Oaks as
insurance against a prerace injury to General Challenge. It cost
$15,000 to enter the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The two men will discuss it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to keep your options open,'' Baffert said,
``because you never know what's going to happen to these horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling where she's going to go,'' he added _ but he
wouldn't say more.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert was asked if the decision was up to him or to Mabee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell him,'' he replied. Mabee indicated he's comfortable
with that.
</P>
<P>
   This indicates one of two things: the respect owners have for
Baffert, who trained Derby winners Silver Charm and Real Quiet and
will go for a record third straight victory Saturday with General
Challenge and Prime Timber and perhaps the filly as well; or the
mellowing of Mabee, who has been known to resolve disagreements
with trainers by firing them.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert could be the first trainer to win both the Oaks and the
Derby since Ben Jones did it in 1952 with Hill Gail and Real
Delight.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pegram-owned Silverbulletday, ridden by Gary Stevens, is
3-5 on the Oaks morning line. Excellent Meeting, with Kent
Desormeaux, is 2-1. Excellent Meeting handed Silverbulletday her
only defeat in 10 starts _ at Del Mar in August.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Derby itself, the Oaks draws the largest U.S. racing
crowd each year, more than 94,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Musical stirrups?: Daragh O'Donahue was named to ride
Dubai-based Aljabr, but Sheikh Mohammed indicated another jockey
might be aboard in the Derby. Presumably he has Desormeaux in mind.
</P>
<P>
   If Excellent Meeting scratches and he doesn't ride Aljabr,
Desormeaux will be without a Derby mount a year after he won the
race with Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders: Baffert made the 12th and 13th picks in Wednesday's
post-position ``draft,'' and chose posts 14 and 15 for Prime Timber
and General Challenge even though less remote slots were available,
and his explanation sounded like spin control.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said he'd have taken post 15 even if he'd had the No. 1
pick.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, General Challenge jockey Gary Stevens backed
Baffert's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I and (owner) Mabee had talked earlier and decided we
wanted the 14 or 15 hole. There's quite a gap between the main gate
and the auxiliary gate,'' Stevens said, referring to stalls 15 and
up. ``This horse has gotten away a little slow in every one of his
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Having space on his left might prevent General Challenge from
getting cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes him a stride or two to get his balance,'' Stevens
said.
</P>
<P>
   C notes: Trainer Nick Zito said he'll bet $100 on each of his
Derby horses, 12-1 Stephen Got Even and 30-1 Adonis.
</P>
<P>
   But before you take that as a whole-hearted endorsement,
remember those are modest-size bets for Zito, who won the 1991
Derby with Strike the Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Car talk: Churchill Downs wouldn't let ABC-TV drive a
camera-toting car on the turf course during the Derby in part
because it feared damage to the grass. But the track let NASCAR's
Jeremy Mayfield drive a stock car, painted in a thoroughbred motif,
around the main track between races Thursday as a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   This must be what they meant when they said the NTRA would try
to create NASCAR-like popularity for the horse racing industry.

HOLLANDSWORTH DELIVERS BIG HITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth was activated
from the disabled list last week, but pinch-hitting in blowouts and
playing a half-inning in a game doesn't count for much.
</P>
<P>
   So while it was game 22 for the Dodgers, Thursday was like
opening day for Hollandsworth. In his first start of the season, he
had two hits and three RBI as the Dodgers beat Milwaukee 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sit and take batting practice and do drills and even
pinch hit, but until you can get back out and get the flow back,
it's not the same,'' said Hollandsworth, 0 for 2 before Thursday.
``It's just good to get back in there and contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth's first three at-bats produced an RBI groundout, a
run-scoring triple and an RBI double. How often Hollandsworth gets
an opportunity to play could hinge on how he produces.
</P>
<P>
   With an outfield of Gary Sheffield, Devon White and Raul
Mondesi, there isn't any room for Hollandsworth. What can
Hollandsworth do to gain more playing time? There isn't an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he would use Hollandsworth to
rest an outfield starter, which he did in this case. With White
getting the day off, Hollandsworth started in center field.
</P>
<P>
   During the next six days, the Dodgers play at Philadelphia and
Montreal. All six games are on artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth began the season on the disabled list (pulled
hamstring), but after being activated last Friday, he appeared in
only two games and was hitless in two at-bats. Johnson said he was
taking it slow with Hollandsworth because of the injury and cold
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Defining roles: The phone in the Dodgers' bullpen rang in the
seventh inning Monday and lefty Pedro Borbon was the only one to
get up. When it rang the same time Tuesday, lefty Onan Masaoka was
up. When it rang in the eighth, Alan Mills got ready. In the ninth,
Jeff Shaw took his jacket off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the year, guys didn't know when to take their jackets
off, but now when the phone rings, you know who's jacket it's going
to be,'' Shaw said. ``Guys are understanding their roles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' bullpen is 2-3 with a 3.93 ERA. The starters,
considered the strength of the staff, are 10-7 with a 4.52 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Noticing a trend? Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone remained
in Los Angeles for the Milwaukee series and will join the team in
Philadelphia. With the sweep, the Dodgers are 4-0 without Malone in
attendance and 1-5 with him on the road. And you know about
baseball superstitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the big discussion, on figuring how to keep the head
honcho out of here,'' Johnson said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion: Third baseman Adrian Beltre went 4 for 5 to raise
his batting average to a team-high .347.... Rehabbing right-hander
Antonio Osuna is slated to pitch two or three innings with Single-A
San Bernardino today.... The three-game sweep of the Brewers is the
first for the Dodgers against a Milwaukee club since their days in
Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Dodgers swept the Milwaukee Braves in June
1953.

NATO BOMBINGS ARE TAKING A HEAVY TOLL ON CIVILIAN ECONOMY AND
INFRASTRUCTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The Zastava factory in Kragujevac made
cars and trucks, as well as munitions. NATO strikes destroyed it
completely, putting more than 15,000 people out of work, along with
an additional 40,000 who worked at 120 subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   The Sloboda factory in Cacak made vacuum cleaners and ovens, as
well as ammunition. In five NATO raids, the factory has been
ruined, and 5,000 people are out of work.
</P>
<P>
   In Krusevac, the 14 Oktobar factory made heavy construction
equipment and bulldozers, as well as reconditioning tank engines.
NATO bombs have left it a complete ruin, putting more than 7,000
people, a quarter of the town's workforce, out of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry, a profitable part of the economy and a prime
candidate for early privatization, has been almost completely
devastated, with the two refineries in Yugoslavia and most of their
storage tanks destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The five-week air campaign, intended to change President
Slobodan Milosevic's policies toward the southern Serbian province
of Kosovo, is also destroying the country's civilian industrial
capacity and public works, including its highway, rail and
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The air war has halved economic output and thrown more than
100,000 people out of work, Western-trained and independent
economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is difficult to estimate the cost of replacements
and repairs if the war stopped today, the economists said, the
damage has had greater effects on the gross domestic product than
the Nazi and then the Allied bombing of Yugoslavia, which was a
much more rural country during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing has added to the problems of the past decade like
economic mismanagement, cronyism, the hyperinflation of 1992 and
1993, the Bosnian War trade embargo from 1992 to 1995, eight years
of virtually no foreign investment and almost constant war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics aside, this is an economic and humanitarian
catastrophe,'' Mladjan Dinkic, a professor of economics at Belgrade
University, said. ``While the Serbs won't die of hunger _
agricultural production will continue, even without fertilizers _
our industrial base will be destroyed and the size of the economy
cut in half.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinkic coordinates Group 17, a group of economists, some from
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, who had
American financing to promote a market economy. They estimate that
gross domestic product per capita, $3,000 in 1989, before economic
sanctions were imposed in May 1992, dropped to $1,650 in 1997. But
because of the large black market, or so-called shadow economy,
that figure was probably closer to $2,000, Dinkic said.
</P>
<P>
   It will drop below $1,000 if the Kosovo conflict stops now, he
said. And unemployment, officially 27 percent last year, is quite
likely to double, he added, with up to 500,000 people laid off or
out of work and 100,000 or so seeking to emigrate from a country of
10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Although he readily concedes that considerable guesswork goes
into all the figures _ damage estimates range from $40 billion to
$100 billion _ Dinkic said that no matter when the conflict ended,
the future will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   NATO says its air strikes are intended to force Milosevic to
change his policies in Kosovo and to ``degrade and destroy'' the
military ability to carry them out. But NATO is increasingly
ignoring the civilian-military distinction, going after ``high
value targets'' that are dear to Milosevic, his government, his
family and his friends, who control sectors like cigarette
production.
</P>
<P>
   But the targets, like a major cigarette factory in Nis that NATO
recently destroyed, are not essentially military, but civilian or
psychological. The lines for cigarettes are now enormous in
Belgrade, and that may be NATO's point. And NATO officials will be
pleased with the new limits on gasoline rations, which on Tuesday
were cut from 10 gallons a month to five.
</P>
<P>
   Although markets are still full of produce, people worry, too,
about the quality of the food and the produce being grown.
Fertilizer plants have been bombed, as have chemical plants that
are said to be spewing toxic fumes.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian environment minister, Branislav Lazic, said Thursday
that large quantities of chlorine and other noxious gases had been
released into the air because of the bombing of a refinery and
petrochemical plant at Pancevo, 10 miles northeast of here.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental consequence of the bombing ``knows no
borders,'' Lazic said, warning that the damage may be felt
elsewhere in the Balkans and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that ordinary people in this capital are
increasingly nervous about how long the conflict will continue and
what will remain of Yugoslavia when it ends. The deputy prime
minister who was discharged on Wednesday, Vuk Draskovic, spoke for
many people when he urged a settlement, saying: ``People who lead
this country must say clearly where we stand. They must say what
will be left of Serbia in 20 days if the bombing continues.''
</P>
<P>
   But few here said Milosevic would feel significant pressure from
his executives to stop the war, because their positions depend on
his. In a statement, Group 17 criticized NATO for punishing the
entire nation, and not just Milosevic. The economists said
destroying the civilian economy ``causes no material and even
political damage to Mr. Milosevic, but only to the citizens of
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   After the conflict with NATO is over, Dinkic said, Yugoslavia
will depend on imported oil and gasoline and will be unable to
rebuild its industrial sector, let alone its bridges, without
significant aid from the very countries of the advanced West that
are now bombing it.
</P>
<P>
   If the conflict ends with a clear NATO victory, international
aid and investment will be vital for any recovery. But foreign
investors will not be very likely to invest much money in a country
without functioning road and rail networks, a European diplomat who
specializes in economics said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roads and bridges have to come first,'' the diplomat said.
But he noted that with factories like 14 Oktobar ruined, even the
capacity to produce the construction equipment required to rebuild
bridges, airports and roads is gone.

</P>
<P>
   The director of the 14 Oktobar factory, the fortuitously named
Slobodan Milosevic, said last week in Krusevac that his foreign
partners had expressed interested in trying to help after the
conflict had ended. The machines had 45 percent imported
components, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get help from our old foreign partners, we might be able
to rebuild this factory,'' the director said. ``Without foreign
help, it will be impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the conflict ends inconclusively, with Milosevic still in
power and the West's denying any aid to Yugoslavia, the situation
will be bleak. Without aid, Yugoslavia will be isolated and poor,
dependent on Russia for energy, with greater unemployment and more
refugees, able to feed itself but not to remake its industrial
sector, Dinkic said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable diplomats here said they expected Milosevic to
remain in power under such circumstances because a poor country
able to feed itself is less revolutionary than a hungry one, like
neighboring Romania under Nicolae Ceausescu.
</P>
<P>
   And Milosevic will be able to blame the sorry state of the
economy on NATO ``aggression,'' avoiding much of the responsibility
for his decade of economic mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared of a destroyed country with no political change,''
Dinkic said.

PARASITES, NOT TOXINS, MAY BE BEHIND FROG DEFORMITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trailing tangles of a dozen limbs or missing legs altogether,
the deformed frogs found in rising numbers around the country have
become a powerful symbol of what many fear is an ever more poisoned
environment. But at least in some areas, scientists report on
Thursday, evidence shows the frog deformities are being caused not
by toxins but by parasitic worms.
</P>
<P>
   In two new studies focusing on Pacific tree frogs in California,
separate teams of researchers report in the journal Science that
when parasitic worms known as trematodes burrow into a frog's
developing limb, the infestation can cause exactly the kinds of
deformities seen in frogs in the wild. Scientists say the studies
provide the first solid evidence pointing to a culprit behind the
long mysterious deformities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finally solved one piece of the puzzle,'' said Dr.
Stanley K. Sessions, the lead author of one of the new papers and a
herpetologist at Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Blaustein, an ecologist at Oregon State University
who was not involved with the new studies, said: ``This is the best
experimental evidence so far showing a particular agent causing the
limb deformities we see in nature. I think parasites will explain a
lot of the deformities.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers interviewed, including Sessions and Pieter T.J.
Johnson, lead author of the other new paper, all emphasized that
the new findings do not rule out the possibility that chemical
pollutants or increasing ultraviolet light caused by a thinning
ozone layer could be causes of deformities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the people next to the ponds they studied can breathe a
sigh of relief,'' said Dr. Judy Helgen, a research scientist at the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in St. Paul, ``but everywhere
else we have to be vigilant. It would be irresponsible to sit back
now and say, `Oh no, it's not a chemical cause.'''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said most of the scientific community had ignored or
even ridiculed the idea that parasites could create deformities.
The big labs and big money were focused on studying chemicals and,
to some degree, ultraviolet radiation. So far though, researchers
say, while there is much evidence that chemicals can cause some
kinds of limb deformities in the lab, there has been little to show
that chemicals are actually deforming frogs in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will cause a lot of soul-searching,'' Dr. David Wake, a
herpetologist at University of California at Berkeley, said of the
new studies. ``A lot of people will have to re-evaluate what
they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Working without any high-powered competition, two teams composed
mostly of undergraduates were able to uncover the importance of
parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was an undergraduate at Stanford University when he
carried out his experiments on Pacific tree frogs, or Hyla regilla,
with two undergraduates and one post-doctoral colleague. His team
showed that frogs exposed to higher concentrations of the trematode
known as Ribeiroia had greater numbers of deformities and died at a
higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   In the other paper, Sessions and two undergraduates provided
corroborating evidence from five species of frogs from twelve sites
in California, Oregon, Arizona and New York. All their deformed
frogs were infected with the trematodes around the bases of their
limbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, where there have been the greatest concerns about
frog deformities and water quality, Dr. Helgen said there remains
no clear-cut cause. In spite of the new study, she said, ``For us
chemicals are the leading hypothesis.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her collaborators have found no sign of Ribeiroia in
the Minnesota frogs, nor of any connection at their study sites
between parasites and deformities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Researchers said that while the deformed amphibians, which
typically die before reaching sexual maturity, add pressure on
amphibian populations, there does not seem to be any direct
connection between deformities and world-wide amphibian declines.
Hot spots for die-offs, researchers agreed, do not correlate well
with hot spots for deformities.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the discovery of the role played by parasites,
biologists, including those behind the new studies, say both
deformities and population declines should still be viewed as
signals that something may be amiss. Researchers said human-induced
changes, including pollution, could well have led to increases in
parasite-induced deformities, causing parasites to increase in
number or frogs to become more susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our study does not eliminate water quality from being an issue
on the national level,'' said Johnson. ``We're not signaling the
all-clear.''

MFUME, COURTED BY BALTIMORE TO RUN FOR MAYOR, LEAVES CITY GUESSING

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ State lawmakers shortened a city residency
requirement to allow him to run. Prominent civic, business and
church leaders formed a draft committee to encourage him to run.
Three former mayors have implored him to run.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Kweisi Mfume are so convinced he is the only
choice to succeed Kurt L. Schmoke, who is stepping down after three
terms as mayor of Baltimore, that they predict dire consequences
for the city if anyone else from what they view as a lackluster
field prevails in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as they want a candidate of Mfume's stature _ a
five-term Democratic congressman from west Baltimore who left the
House in 1995 to become president and chief executive of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People _ they
can only cross their fingers and hold their breath.
</P>
<P>
   As the city approaches its first mayoral election campaign
without an incumbent in 28 years, Mfume says he has not decided
whether to run for mayor or remain at the NAACP, which is based
here.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty has kept the city's political forces on edge,
would-be candidates on the sidelines and officials of the civil
rights organization in the dark. Even Julian Bond, the
association's chairman, says he has no idea what Mfume will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants this on their timetable,'' Mfume said in an
interview on Monday, during which he expressed ambivalence over a
decision that he is promising by mid-May. ``But at the end of the
day, it's my call, it's what I'm comfortable with. In my heart of
hearts, I have to choose the best thing I can do to help the
greatest number of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he added, ``I go back and forth between my head
and heart, back and forth, day and night. What I ought to do. What
I should do. People think I have made up my mind about this. That's
not the case at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore is one of those places that have always strained to
maintain big-league stature among American cities. Schmoke, a
former Rhodes scholar and assistant U.S.attorney, has helped. So
has a vast urban redevelopment effort over the last 20 years,
creating a vibrant downtown, stabilizing neighborhoods and stemming
a slow but steady migration to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic problems remain, though, including a large number of
homicides (aout 300 a year), underachieving public schools and an
abundance of crumbling low-income housing.
</P>
<P>
   Schmoke, a Democrat in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, has
endured much of the recent criticism for the problems' persistence.
The complaints only heightened interest in Mfume as a problem
solver once the mayor announced in December that he would not seek
a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   While other Democrats, including Mfume's second cousin, Lawrence
Bell, the City Council president, say they are running for mayor no
matter what he decides, none can match Mfume's credentials.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the City Council, Mfume, now 50, went on to
gain national prominence as a congressman and chairman of the
Congressional Black Caucus before being chosen to lead the nation's
oldest civil rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Mfume played down any interest in becoming mayor.
He had two years remaining on a five-year contract at the NAACP,
where he had inherited an organization facing discord, debt and a
struggle to make a case for its own relevance.
</P>
<P>
   He has since restored financial stability, brought in new
leaders and expanded membership, especially among those of college
age. But he contends that the association needs more time to
re-establish its once-weighty role in the nation's social
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the dichotomy I face,'' he said. ``I don't feel that
what I've started here is finished. The foundation is stable, but
now it's up to the association to put up the superstructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has Mfume begun sounding more like a prospective
candidate. As members of the City Council discussed increasing the
mayor's salary of $95,000 as an added inducement _ Mfume earns
about $220,000 with the NAACP _ he said in a speech last week that
if anything ultimately persuaded him to run, it would be his love
for the city and public service, not money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to be enticed to be mayor of this city,'' he told
his audience, in what was regarded as the strongest indication yet
that he was giving serious consideration to a run.
</P>
<P>
   The speech came shortly after Gov. Parris Glendening signed a
measure that reduces the city's residency requirement for political
candidates to six months prior to election, from one year.
</P>
<P>
   The state initiative allows the Baltimore City Council to
restore the one-year requirement, and on Monday night Councilman
Norman Handy, with strong support from Bell, introduced a measure
that would do so. But that bill is not expected to gather enough
votes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Mfume moved last month from a suburban home into the
city, he said in the interview that his change of residence had
nothing to do with the new law or the mayoral race. And to those
trying to read him for signals, he urged caution for now, saying,
``I have been trying to run away from this for four months in a
dignified, respectful fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I appreciate people expressing support,'' he added. ``But
I am not a messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mfume on the sidelines, the campaign leading to the
September primary sputters on. Bell is regarded by many as the
front-runner in an Mfumeless Democratic field, whose winner is all
but assured of victory in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   While Bell has announced plans to run, he has not yet filed with
the city's election board, as candidates must by July 6. Five other
Democrats have filed, including former Councilman Carl Stokes. But
none of the campaigns have taken off, largely because Mfume's
decision will have such a strong bearing on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Schmoke, among others, predicted in an interview that if Mfume
decided to stay out, other candidates might emerge, perhaps even
William Donald Schaefer, who served a record four terms as mayor
before serving two as governor and, last year, winning a four-year
term as state comptroller at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer, who has been joined by former mayors Clarence H. Burns
and Thomas D'Alesandro 3rd in urging Mfume to run, has offered no
public sign that he is seriously interested in returning to City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mfume, he said he began to consider the race in earnest
last Friday, sounding out his five sons, ages 25 to 30. In a
perfect reflection of his own ambivalence, two urged caution, he
said, while two encouraged him to run and one expressed
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks ahead, Mfume said, he intends to ``pray on the
issue'' and discuss it further with his family before meeting with
the NAACP board next month in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he said, he will announce his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, the association's chairman, who lives in Washington, says
he has been following developments only through published reports.
Those developments include a draft movement that he called
``certainly impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 city leaders, including 11 City Council members
and a handful of state lawmakers, endorsed Mfume's candidacy in
full-page newspaper advertisements last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hate to lose him,'' said Bond, who expects to meet
privately with Mfume next week. ``But the institution is bigger
than any individual chairman or CEO. It would take a search, but we
would find a replacement.''

N.J. TO SEEK SETTLEMENT WITH U.S. ON RACE PROFILING BY POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ohio)   (bl)  
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. - Trying to forestall a federal civil rights
lawsuit, New Jersey Attorney General Peter Verniero said Thursday
that the state had agreed to negotiate a settlement with federal
officials over allegations that state police engaged in widespread
racial profiling against black and Hispanic motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general acted after the U.S. Justice
Department's Civil Rights Division informed him and Gov. Christie
Whitman in a letter Monday that it had turned up enough evidence
that state troopers used race as a basis for stopping and searching
drivers to warrant a lawsuit against the state police.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said that federal
officials deferred filing the complaint after New Jersey officials
agreed late Wednesday night to work out a voluntary out-of-court
settlement known as a consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   Such an agreement would almost certainly require the appointment
of a civilian agency to monitor the force, a point the Justice
Department has insisted on in similar cases, as well as stricter
regulations on how troopers handle stops and searches in suspected
drug cases.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing its complaint against New Jersey, the Justice
Department was invoking a rarely used provision of the 1994 federal
anti-crime law, which authorizes the government to file civil
lawsuits against police departments that ``engage in patterns of
misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only two law enforcement agencies _ the police
departments in Pittsburgh and in Steubenville, Ohio _ have agreed
to consent decrees, said Christine DiBartolo, the Justice
Department spokeswoman, and the police department in Columbus,
Ohio, is currently negotiating a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey State Police is the first statewide law
enforcement agency to enter into such discussions, and with 2,700
officers, it is the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DiBartolo would not provide details of the Justice
Department investigation or say how its findings differed from a
report released by Verniero last week, which found that officers in
at least two police barracks _ in Moorestown and Cranbury _ engaged
in racial profiling. ``His report is a good start for
negotiations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But a more senior official in the Justice Department said that
the federal investigation roughly mirrored the one that Verniero's
office conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may not be much of a disparity,'' said the official, a
lawyer who spoke on the condition that he not be identified by name
or title. ``Much of our focus was on the same area of I-95 that
they identified in their report. We had the focus also on the
Moorestown and Cranbury stations, and that certainly was the focus
of many of the complaints of motorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The official also said that in the letter to state officials,
the Justice Department had agreed that some of the remedies that
Verniero suggested in his report on racial profiling were ``a
starting point'' for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Those recommendations include revising the procedure for traffic
stops, including requiring that a trooper inform the dispatcher
about the exact reason for the stop before the officer leaves the
car; focusing the statewide drug enforcement strategy on larger
``impact cases'' rather than on pursuing more random ``targets of
opportunity'' like individual passenger vehicles; and making
quarterly public reports on the proportion of minority and
non-minority motorists who are subject to various actions by state
police.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not include a recommendation for an independent
civilian agency to monitor problems, a point that the Justice
Department has insisted on in Pittsburgh and Steubenville.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, part of the settlement included hiring an
independent auditor to monitor investigations of complaints and
compliance with the consent decree. The monitor also was required
to issue regular reports to the court, the local government and the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In sending the letter to the Whitman administration this week,
the government was effectively signaling the end to the Justice
Department's investigation into the practices of the New Jersey
State Police. The inquiry was initiated two years ago after civil
rights leaders and Democratic members of the state's congressional
delegation complained that members of minority groups were being
unfairly singled out in traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, New Jersey's quick agreement to settle the case
suggests that officials here were eager to to quiet one of the
worst political storms the governor has faced.
</P>
<P>
   After denying for years that troopers engaged in racial
profiling, Whitman acknowledged April 20 that a two-month
investigation initiated by Verniero had shown that some officers
routinely stopped and searched some black and Hispanic motorists
solely because of race.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over racial profiling has not only clouded Whitman's
image at the time she is gearing up for a U.S. Senate race next
year, but it has become a major issue in her nomination of Verniero
to serve on the state Supreme Court. Confirmation hearings on
Verniero's nomination begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   The administration acknowledged the consent decree agreement in
a four-paragraph statement that was issued by Verniero.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of
Justice has authorized the filing of a civil suit against the
Division of the State Police alleging that State Police officers
have engaged in discriminatory law enforcement,'' Verniero said in
his statement. ``As a matter of practice, it is my understanding
that this is a necessary procedural step that must be taken by the
Justice Department in order for a settlement to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Verniero would not release the letter that the Justice
Department sent to the state, a decision that rekindled the bitter
partisan fighting over both the issue of racial profiling and his
nomination to the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's apparent that the Justice Department has sufficient
evidence to file a civil rights suit,'' said Democratic state
Senate Minority Leader Richard Codey. ``Our concern is whether this
material, like the other evidence, is something Verniero should
have known about and stopped long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Reginald Jackson, the executive director of the Black
Ministers' Conference of New Jersey, a group that has been at the
forefront of complaints about racial profiling, said that a senior
official in the Justice Department called him Thursday to inform
him of the developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that they had sufficient evidence to file a lawsuit
against the state,'' said Jackson. ``I think the federal government
knows it is a much deeper problem than what Verniero's report
showed. They would not have threatened a lawsuit if it was simply
the matter of a small number of troopers conducting racial
profiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson would not identify the Justice Department official he
spoke with by name or job description, but he said the official
promised that the black ministers would be involved in any
settlement that the federal government reached with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I applaud the governor and the attorney general for agreeing
to a consent decree and I hope that they can reach an agreement
that will end profiling,'' he said. ``But one of the things we will
recommend is that an outside monitor be appointed to watch the
state police.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they would meet with state police
officials next week to begin negotiations.

POTENTIAL SENATE RIVALS ARE SCHOOL PRINCIPALS FOR A DAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just another quiet day in the New York City
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   While Hillary Rodham Clinton answered a question about the NATO
bombing of Kosovo from an eighth-grade student at a junior high
school in Queens, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was asked about his
political future by a fifth-grade student in Brooklyn, nicknamed
``the mayor,'' who pointedly said to laughter from her classmates
that she wanted to remain as mayor _ and not become a senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard you want to be a senator,'' said the student, Amy
Diaz, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, I can't be mayor after two more years,''
Giuliani responded. ``That doesn't mean I don't want to be. You
see, unlike you, I have a term limit.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday both Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani, potential rivals for
the U.S. Senate seat to be vacated in 2001 by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, were ``principals for a day'' as part of a program that
puts role models into the city's schools. Aides to both Mrs.
Clinton and Giuliani insisted that politics had nothing to do with
their participation, and pointed out that both are frequently in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear if both were ever in the New York City public
schools on the same day at exactly the same time, as they were on
Thursday. And whether the pairing of the noncandidates was mere
coincidence or plain politics, neither took any note of the other.
Asked if it mattered to him that Mrs. Clinton was in his school
system, Giuliani said, flatly: ``No. That isn't the message that
I'm sending.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet later, in one of the more striking sights of the day, Mrs.
Clinton sat cozily next to schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who has
been in an escalating battle with the mayor in recent weeks over
vouchers and control of the public schools. At one point during the
meeting of other ``principals for a day'' at the New York Public
Library, Mrs. Clinton put her hand on Crew's shoulder and whispered
in his ear. Crew said afterward that the two did not discuss
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a political event,'' he said, repeating a theme
sounded by education officials all day long. ``We had a very good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a seeming reference to Giuliani's comments last week that
the New York City school system ``should be blown up,'' Mrs.
Clinton told the library crowd, to applause, that ``we have to see
the public schools as they are, and we should be worrying about
building them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was invited but did not attend the meeting for some of
the 1,000 ``principals'' at the library, which was organized by the
group called Public Education Needs Civil Involvement in Learning,
or Pencil.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the day seemed a preview of what a
Clinton-Giuliani Senate race might look like, although played out
for an audience of astute New York City school children. At Virgil
I. Grissom Junior High School 226 in Queens, Mrs. Clinton was asked
twice by students whether she would run for the Senate. ``She said,
`There's some people talking to me about that, but I haven't made
that decision,' '' recounted Rhia Warren, the principal of JHS 226.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was at the school, which has students from almost
30 countries, from 9:15 a.m. to around 2 p.m. In a sign that she
may be less nervous about a press corps that is usually shooed away
at Mrs. Clinton's New York school appearances after the pictures
are taken, on Thursday her staff allowed newspaper and wire service
reporters to remain in the school library for the hour that Mrs.
Clinton talked with students in an eighth-grade social studies
class about the problems in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   When one student said that parents don't always realize how many
problems their children have, Mrs. Clinton agreed with the student
but said that ``most parents are doing the best they know how to
do.'' She added: ``We try. We're going to mess up. There's no
escape from it. It's part of living, and parenting.''

   President Clinton said Thursday that he planned to summon
high-ranking leaders of the entertainment industry and other
experts to the White House ``in the near future'' to discuss how
violent incidents like the school shootings in Littleton, Colo.,
might be prevented.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview to be broadcast Friday morning on the NBC
program ``Today,'' Clinton said questions to be addressed included
these: ``What should we do about guns? What should we do about
culture? What should we do about the schools? How can we help
parents? And what is government's responsibility?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments were broadcast Thursday night on the NBC
``Nightly News.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, network representatives in Washington said
White House officials had notified them of the planned gathering,
and that it had been tentatively scheduled for May 13. A White
House spokesman said Thursday night that no firm date had been set.

WAGE GROWTH FAILS TO MEET EXPECTATIONS

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite declining unemployment and a shortage of
workers in some industries, wage and benefit increases slowed
markedly in the first three months of the year, the government
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The government's broadest gauge of compensation, the employment
cost index, rose just 0.4 percent in the first quarter, the Labor
Department said. The quarterly increase _ the smallest since the
index was created in 1982 _ was half what economists had been
predicting, and showed that compensation growth had now slowed for
two consecutive quarters even as joblessness had declined to a
29-year low of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The slowing was driven to some degree by a steep decline in
bonuses paid to Wall Street executives following last fall's
financial market turmoil and a decline in commissions earned by
real estate agents as the housing market cooled.
</P>
<P>
   A number of industries, including construction and retailing,
showed accelerating wage gains, indicating that tight labor markets
were benefiting some workers. And as they have since 1996, workers
are still enjoying wage gains after accounting for inflation, a
turnabout from long stretches in both the 1980s and 1990s when
wages were stagnant or falling in inflation-adjusted terms.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall slowing trend in compensation costs was
pronounced in the first quarter, analysts said, and was in line
with a slowdown in another key wage indicator, hourly earnings.
With inflation dormant, the trend highlighted a conundrum that has
economists and policy makers at the Federal Reserve scratching
their heads: Why has the combination of steady growth and low
unemployment not forced a run-up in wages and then prices as
history and traditional economic models suggest it should?
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not appear to be a fluke,'' said Stuart Hoffman, an
economist at the PNC Corporation in Pittsburgh. ``No matter how you
slice it or dice it, the story is the same, that total compensation
and wages in particular have actually been rising more slowly in
the face of a declining unemployment rate over the last several
quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   The report suggested that there were no inflationary pressures
building in the economy and that compensation costs were unlikely
to squeeze corporate profits. Bond prices and blue-chip stocks
rallied, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 32.93 points,
to 10,878.38, its third consecutive record close.
</P>
<P>
   The 0.4 percent increase in the employment cost index in the
first quarter followed a 0.7 percent rise in the fourth quarter of
last year and a 0.9 percent jump in each of the two previous
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The figures showed a 3 percent increase in wage and benefit
costs for private industry in this year's first quarter compared
with the same period last year. That was down from a 3.5 percent
year-to-year comparison in last year's fourth quarter and a 3.8
percent increase in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wage growth in private industry was up 3.3 percent in the first
quarter compared with the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Overall compensation costs were also held down by a decline in
the growth of benefit costs. Benefit costs were up just 0.3 percent
in the first quarter, half the rate of the previous quarter,
belying predictions that resurgent medical costs would lead to
increased health care expenses for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, economists said, the explanation for the
slowdown in compensation appears to rest with the realization among
employees that inflation is no longer eating away at the purchasing
power of their paychecks. Consumer prices last year rose only 1.5
percent, meaning that even a 3 percent wage increase still put them
ahead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing nominal wages being pulled back down by lower
inflation expectations,'' said James O'Sullivan, an economist at
the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. ``Both workers and companies were
surprised by how low inflation was last year, due in part to lower
oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   With wages in private industry having grown 3.9 percent last
year and inflation at 1.5 percent, workers enjoyed a real wage
increase of 2.4 percent last year, the best in two decades,
O'Sullivan said.

</P>
<P>
   At the same time, companies are making extra efforts to hold
down their costs because intense global competition has left them
with little ability to raise prices to maintain their profit
margins. When they do agree to wage increases, they often demand
flexibility from workers in helping the company be more efficient
and productive.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in the last several years in the rate of productivity
growth have helped companies to absorb higher compensation costs
without putting undue pressure on either prices or profits.
Economists are debating whether the absence of inflation results
from temporary factors like low oil prices, cheap imports and weak
economies in much of the rest of the world, or some fundamental
improvement in the economy's capacity to grow and create new jobs
without igniting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wisconsin Central Transportation Corp., a small rail line
serving the upper Midwest, 300 locomotive engineers recently
approved a union contract that gives them a 3 percent pay increase
this year and 2 percent next year. The pay increase was coupled
with an agreement to formalize flexible staffing rules that allow
the rail line, which is trying to build a business on tracks
abandoned as unprofitable by bigger carriers, to respond to the
needs of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wage increases we're talking about here are above the rate
of inflation,'' said Ann Thoma, a spokeswoman for the railroad. The
local union representative, Ken Davis, said he was ``very pleased
with the result.''
</P>
<P>
   When the United Steelworkers of America agreed to a deal with
the RMI Titanium Co. in Niles, Ohio, this month, it concentrated on
winning improvements in its pension package and in job security.
The pay increase was 50 cents an hour for five years, or a little
over 3 percent a year for a worker earning $14.50 an hour. RMI is a
unit of USX.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a modest wage increase that keeps us up with inflation,''
said Ray Raschilla, the unit chairman of the union's local 2155-7.
``We had a lot of issues that needed to be addressed quickly, and
to be honest it would have been too expensive to hit every area.''
</P>
<P>
   Wage increases are being held down, especially in manufacturing,
by a persistent fear among workers about losing their jobs despite
the strong economy, said Calvin Campbell Jr., chairman and chief
executive of Goodman Equipment, a maker of mining machinery in
Bedford Park, Ill. Unemployment may be low but the pace of layoffs
in many industries is high, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously sometimes you have to find someone with a particular
talent, and you may see some wage pressure there,'' said Campbell,
who is chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers. ``But
that's in the minority. Growth is slowing and a lot of companies
will be cutting back or not expanding. Fewer workers will have a
tendency or desire to jump jobs.''

   WASHINGTON _ U.S. and allied pilots took advantage of clearing
weather Thursday night to conduct some of the heaviest strikes yet
in NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, as the Pentagon said it would
send 10 additional B-52 heavy bombers to join the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have some time to go yet,'' on the air strikes,
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombing escalated, so did diplomacy, with U.S., Russian
and European officials all citing measured progress in difficult
negotiations aimed at formulating a plan for bringing peace -- and
armed peacekeepers -- to the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now getting down to the footnotes,'' in talks among
NATO members and Russia, said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
``The issues of principle are beginning to be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in another reminder of the perils of prolonged conflict, a
NATO aircraft flung the combat equivalent of a wild pitch, firing
off an anti-radar missile that missed its mark not by a mile but by
many, tearing through the rooftop of a home in an upscale suburb of
the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, 30 miles east of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The missile, which did not explode, caused no injuries but came
at a delicate moment: NATO has been awaiting permission from
Bulgaria's parliament to fly strike missions through Bulgarian
airspace. The errant missile prompted a formal apology from NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulgaria knows full well that this is a mishap,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea. ``I'm confident that we can put this behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second errant NATO munition this week. During attacks
late Tuesday, a NATO bomb fell some 200 yards short of its intended
target -- a military barracks -- and exploded in a residential
neighborhood in the Yugoslav state of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Tanjug news service reported that between 16 and
20 people were killed and others injured.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting 28 targets late Wednesday and early Thursday, NATO
pilots geared up to fly some 670 sorties -- nearly half of which
were potential strike missions -- Thursday night and early Friday,
as heavy cloud cover lifted to give Balkan bombers their first
clear view of the targets below them in more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   To add to NATO's ability to strike around the clock at a
widening array of targets, Cohen said the additional B-52 heavy
bombers would be accompanied by two fresh E-3 AWACS -- jumbo jets
stuffed with equipment that allows them to monitor aircraft over a
wide area -- and an EC-130 airborne combat command center. The
planes will be used to help coordinate NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The additions are part of some 300 additional warplanes and
support craft requested by the NATO commander, U.S. Army Gen.
Wesley Clark. The Pentagon announced on Monday that it would send
30 refueling tankers as part of that package, and Cohen said
Thursday that additional portions of Clark's request would be
processed soon.
</P>
<P>
   The additional tankers and B-52s will bring to roughly 620 the
number of U.S. aircraft in the NATO armada. There are roughly 200
aircraft from other NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he spoke with Clark on Thursday and, among other
things, received an update on the readiness of 22 Apache attack
helicopters that arrived earlier this week in Albania. One crashed
on Monday during training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He indicated they've got some more training to do,'' before
the Apaches can fly missions inside Kosovo, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   During the same briefing, Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said NATO commanders were nowhere near
finished reassessing the requirements of sending a ground force
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably take another week or two at least,'' Shelton
said.
</P>
<P>
   If those plans were developed and approved, Shelton said, ``I
would not take any of the options off the table in terms of the
troops that would be available as a U.S. contribution to a NATO-led
force.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO estimated last fall that it would take a heavily armed
force of some 75,000 troops to successfully invade Kosovo -- an
option the alliance rejected. Last week, NATO leaders decided to
update that assessment to reflect changing conditions on the
ground. The alliance has made clear that it intends to carry on
with the air campaign, and not try to fight its way into Kosovo,
for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO military power is a great hammer,'' Shelton said, ``but
it is not the only tool in our foreign-policy toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to apply diplomatic leverage, Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott wound up two days of meetings with Russian officials
Thursday and flew to London to confer with his British counterpart,
Cook.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan met on
the conflict with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   And Yeltsin's special envoy to the Balkans, former prime
minister Victor Chernomyrdin, conferred on the matter with
officials in Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to speak about a breakthrough in the Yugoslav
settlement,'' Chernomyrdin told reporters after a meeting with
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, ``but there is a certain
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a close partner to Yugoslavia, has opposed NATO air
strikes since they began on March 24 to try to coerce Serb leader
Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, into accepting a
NATO-backed plan for political autonomy for the majority ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has rejected that plan -- which calls for a NATO-led
peacekeeping force of some 28,000 troops to, in effect, occupy
Kosovo for an indefinite period of time. Milosevic has said that,
instead, he would accept unarmed U.N. monitors, an option the
United States and its allies contend is insufficient to protect
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   NATO contends that Serb troops and police have executed more
than 4,000 Kosovar Albanians and run an estimated 1.5 million more
from their homes in a province-wide rampage over the past six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic regime appeared to reject a NATO-led peacekeeping
force in public comments on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``An international presence in Serbia's Kosovo province is not a
problem,'' the spokesman of Milosevic's Socialist Party, Ivica
Dacic, told reporters in Belgrade. ``But only a civilian and
unarmed mission under U.N. auspices, with Russia's participation,
would be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dacic, ``Those who are bombing Yugoslavia today cannot be a
part of any peace mission.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, though, State Department spokesman James Rubin
said ``there is increasing understanding on the Russian part,'' of
the U.S. insistence on an armed peacekeeping force with NATO at its
core.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say they agreed with it yet,'' said Rubin. ``But the
idea of the composition of a force is now being discussed more
intensively than it was before.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies have said for some time that
Russian participation in a peacekeeping force would be welcomed.
Russian troops are part of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in
Bosnia, which shares a border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cautioned, however, that agreement with Russia was not yet
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not fully agreed with Russia on the points
necessary,'' Rubin said, ``nor does even agreement with Russia
necessarily signal that Belgrade will agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has exercised limited, and apparently declining,
influence over Milosevic in recent months. It is, however, the only
one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to
currently enjoy close ties to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as far as we're concerned, we still don't have concrete
indicators from Belgrade that they are prepared to do what the
whole world is demanding they do,'' said Rubin, ``which is to stop
the offensive, pull their troops out, allow the refugees back, and
allow the necessary international security force to be deployed.''

Kosovo for an indefinite period of time. Milosevic has said that,
instead, he would accept unarmed U.N. monitors, an option the
United States and its allies contend is insufficient to protect
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   NATO contends that Serb troops and police have executed more
than 4,000 Kosovar Albanians and run an estimated 1.5 million more
from their homes in a province-wide rampage over the past six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic regime appeared to reject a NATO-led peacekeeping
force in public comments on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``An international presence in Serbia's Kosovo province is not a
problem,'' the spokesman of Milosevic's Socialist Party, Ivica
Dacic, told reporters in Belgrade. ``But only a civilian and
unarmed mission under U.N. auspices, with Russia's participation,
would be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dacic, ``Those who are bombing Yugoslavia today cannot be a
part of any peace mission.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, though, State Department spokesman James Rubin
said ``there is increasing understanding on the Russian part,'' of
the U.S. insistence on an armed peacekeeping force with NATO at its
core.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say they agreed with it yet,'' said Rubin. ``But the
idea of the composition of a force is now being discussed more
intensively than it was before.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies have said for some time that
Russian participation in a peacekeeping force would be welcomed.
Russian troops are part of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in
Bosnia, which shares a border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cautioned, however, that agreement with Russia was not yet
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not fully agreed with Russia on the points
necessary,'' Rubin said, ``nor does even agreement with Russia
necessarily signal that Belgrade will agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has exercised limited, and apparently declining,
influence over Milosevic in recent months. It is, however, the only
one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to
currently enjoy close ties to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as far as we're concerned, we still don't have concrete
indicators from Belgrade that they are prepared to do what the
whole world is demanding they do,'' said Rubin, ``which is to stop
the offensive, pull their troops out, allow the refugees back, and
allow the necessary international security force to be deployed.''

DODGERS POUND BREWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The Dodgers limped into County Stadium amid myriad
questions, and they leave as the team everyone thought they should
be.
</P>
<P>
   Three days of sound baseball accompanied by three wins has that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers used pitching and a timely hit in the first two
games, and slammed down the exclamation point in the series with
nine runs in the first four innings of Thursday's 10-4 beating of
the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a season-high for runs scored and gives the Dodgers
(12-10) a 3-0 start to their nine-game road trip. It's the first
time the Dodgers have scored more than five runs since April 17.
</P>
<P>
   It also gave the Dodgers their first series sweep since they
opened the season with three straight wins against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time. It took us how many games to have an easy
win?'' Dodgers shortstop and Milwaukee native Mark Grudzielanek
said. ``They were playing well coming into the series so it's good
to come in here and sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers (9-12) won four straight before meeting the Dodgers,
but in the first two games fell victim to strong pitching and
opportune hits from Raul Mondesi and Chan Ho Park. The Dodgers won
both games 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   This one was much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre led a 13-hit attack with a
career-high four hits and two RBI. Grudzielanek had three hits and
an RBI and outfielder Todd Hollandsworth had a double, triple and
three RBI in his first start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers right-hander Cal Eldred (0-1) was knocked out after
allowing six runs in three innings and the Dodgers built a 9-1 lead
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice three wins, a big three wins, especially
considering the first two,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros
said. ``It's a good way to start a road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The road trip could still crash and burn, but it seems less
likely considering the Dodgers showed signs of breaking out of a
two-week funk. When the Dodgers were losing nine of 13 before the
sweep, they weren't getting hits with runners in scoring position
and the starting pitching was suspect. In turn, the bullpen was
overworked and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was the Brewers' deficiencies showing up or the
Dodgers' ability kicking in, all that changed. Starters Kevin Brown
and Park each allowed two runs in 62/3 innings in the first two
games and Ismael Valdes (3-0) capped the series with seven innings.
He gave up four runs on eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   In the series, the bullpen allowed three hits in 62/3 innings,
but their importance was diminished Thursday by the Dodgers offense
finally getting hits with runners on second and third. That offense
toiled under .200 earlier, but went 6 for 16 against a quartet of
Brewers pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get out of that drought,'' said Dodgers left fielder
Gary Sheffield, who walked three times and scored twice. ``We
showed we can play a 3-2 game and win or a 10-4 game and win. The
offense has to pick up and contribute more.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a monumental feat for the Dodgers to score 10 runs
without hitting a homer. Of the 95 runs the Dodgers had scored
heading into the game, 42 had come via a home run.
</P>
<P>
   That trend disappeared in the third inning when Karros, 0 for 10
since moving to the cleanup spot before the series, had a two-run
double. Hollandsworth followed with an RBI triple and Beltre added
an RBI single as the Dodgers took a 6-1 lead. It was the first time
this season the Dodgers scored more than three runs in an inning
without hitting a homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in hitting fourth compared to somewhere else is
you're going to have more chances to drive in runs,'' Karros said.
``I had three opportunities today. When you're hitting fifth or
sixth you may only have one chance in a game.''

REV. JESSE JACKSON DELEGATION IS WELCOMED BY YUGOSLAV OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Yugoslav government officials welcomed
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a group of American Christian, Jewish
and Muslim leaders Thursday at a border crossing with Croatia,
providing them with an escort to the capital and a promise that
they would meet President Slobodan Milosevic and three captive
American soldiers during their three days here.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member delegation, whose trip has irritated the Clinton
administration, was openly relieved at the reception. The Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell, general-secretary of the National Council of
Churches, described the scheduled meetings on Friday with the
soldiers and on Saturday with Milosevic as ``a serious program.''
</P>
<P>
   The clerics have said they hope to persuade Milosevic to release
the soldiers as an act of good will that could lead to a diplomatic
solution in Kosovo. They are also to meet with religious leaders in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represent civil society and they must be heard,'' said
Jackson, referring to the Serbian Orthodox patriarch and others who
have expressed anger at the NATO bombing and support for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The group flew on commercial airlines from Washington to Zagreb,
Croatia, and then traveled in a rented bus, crammed with television
crew members and journalists, to the border. There they took a bus
provided by the government to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The group traveled under a full moon shining down from a
cloudless sky. It seemed to be perfect weather for bombing, a
situation that evoked nervousness from many on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely in a war zone,'' Jackson said as the bus
pulled up at the Hyatt Hotel in central Belgrade, not far from a
bombed-out building and near a billboard that said, in English:
``We believe in God. They believe in bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus trip began on a religious note. The clerics _ Serbian
Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Methodist, Russian Orthodox and Jewish,
with an official of the American Muslim Council _ held hands across
their seats and bowed their heads as Jackson offered a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bond us as brothers and sisters and as instruments of thy
peace,'' he said. ``We hope you will be the wind beneath our
wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Washington, the group met with Sandy Berger, the
national security adviser, who told them of the administration's
concerns that the trip would become a propaganda tool for
Yugoslavia. He also warned them that their mission would prolong
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said they neither approve nor
disapprove of the visit, but do not view the three soldiers,
captured by Yugoslav forces last month near the border with
Macedonia, as bargaining chips.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the group, non-clerics, have their own agendas.
One, Obrad Kesic, a Serbian-American businessman, said he had used
his contacts in the Serb military and government to arrange the
trip and hopes to bring about an end to the allied attacks by
creating disunity in Belgrade or in NATO.

OBSESSED WITH A VISION OF EXISTENTIAL DESPAIR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2)

 William Harris writes on dance, art and theater in Manhattan.  
 By WILLIAM HARRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Albert Camus had made dances instead of writing fiction, they
might have looked like the work of the choreographer John Jasperse.
The final image of Jasperse's ``Waving to You From Here,'' which
was performed at Dance Theater Workshop in Manhattan two years ago,
still haunts with its depiction of despair.
</P>
<P>
   A false ceiling, which had slowly lowered over the dancers'
heads during the hourlong concert, finally collapsed on them. A
metaphor, in part, for the shrinking dance world, devastated by
AIDS and a declining audience, it was also a literal image of the
experimental artist being crushed by the world he has created.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that destruction has come the inspiration for Jasperse's
new work, ``Madison as I Imagine It.'' The 55-minute abstract dance
for four people _ Miguel Guitierrez, Parker Lutz, Juliette Mapp
(who is from Madison, Wis.) and Jasperse _ with music by Hahn Rowe,
received its world premiere two weeks ago at the Spring Dance
Festival in Utrecht, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Thursday, the John Jasperse Company will present it in
eight performances at Dance Theater Workshop, through May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the work I have made up to now had this consistency of
looking at the world and saying, here is my statement about the
problem,'' said Jasperse. ``It didn't really propose any kind of
solution. If that world in `Waving' has collapsed, now what? What
do you do now? The new piece is about how imagination deals with a
circumstance and reinvents it. It's difficult making dance, and
it's especially difficult making dance in New York. I felt I wanted
to be proactive about creating an alternative way of thinking about
dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasperse, a very skinny, 6-foot-2-inch man of 35, looks more
like a gangly teen-ager than someone who has been dancing
professionally since 1985. Yet he is one of the hottest _ and
brainiest _ choreographers on the downtown scene and is
increasingly asked to choreograph for other companies.
</P>
<P>
   His dances are fragmented, gesture-based explorations aboutidentity, intimacy and anxiety. He has little use for traditional
dance vocabulary. ``What people think of as beautiful dance has
always left me frustrated and alienated,'' said Jasperse, who
prefers jagged lines and entangled limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his movements are absurdly task-oriented, like the
repeated stacking and restacking of piles of books in ``Waving to
You From Here.'' Others are less about the body and more about the
flow of energy in the room.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in ``Madison as I Imagine It,'' the dancers wave
their arms in a synchronized fury, like a squadron of hyperactive
airport ground personnel. Still others can be disarming.
</P>
<P>
   In Jasperse's 1995 ``Excessories,'' a dance about sexuality and
the fetishization of the body, five dancers stood downstage staring
blankly while tugging and jiggling each other's exposed breasts and
penises. But the cumulative effect is always the same: Jasperse's
work is hypnotic and unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   Within the dances are also formalist concerns about spatial
relationships and perception _ for instance, how a viewer can be
manipulated to see the whole body in motion, or just the fingers
executing some indecipherable sign language, to recapture what
mesmerized him about dance in the first place. ``Dance has a power
to somehow express something that is inexpressible,'' Jasperse
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is incredibly inventive and intelligent,'' says Stephanie
Reinhart, who is the director, with her husband, Charles, of the
American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C. ``He takes rituals of
everyday life and transforms them poetically, triggering memories
of your own.'' The Reinharts have commissioned a new piece to be
presented at the festival in July _ the choreographer's first
appearance there.
</P>
<P>
   Jasperse is one of the few experimental choreographers who works
with sets. ``I am really sick of seeing an empty black-void box,''
he said. Upon entering the theater for ``Madison as I Imagine It,''
the audience will see a three-sided white drop hanging from the
ceiling to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the sides will be tilted, forming a parallelogram, and the
back will be sliced off on the diagonal with the black wall behind
it visible, creating a weird floating room. Meanwhile, upstage
right, will be a table, precariously balanced on legs of different
heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense of something being a bit off,'' explained
Jasperse, who designed the set as well as the unisex costumes,
which he also constructed. ``It's not about nice, pristine
symmetry, but about asymmetry. I'm definitely mining territory
about unsureness or lack of security, a sense of fragility and
awkwardness. The architecture of the set and the movement are a
reflection of the psychodynamics of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't necessarily a real place, it's a place as I
imagined it. Not the place that you know or have actually been to,
but maybe a place that you've heard about, one you may want to go
to or are afraid to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasperse grew up in a Maryland suburb of Washington, the
youngest of three children. His mother is a former nun. His father
was an electrical engineer who worked for the Navy designing radar
systems. (The father, Roger Jasperse, also built the low-tech
apparatus that allowed the ceiling to fall in ``Waving to You From
Here.'')
</P>
<P>
   Jasperse started taking dance classes at 14 and dreamed of a
career in the musical theater. But while in high school, he
discovered a love for post-modern dance and went to Sarah Lawrence
College to pursue that interest. Shortly after graduating in 1985,
he began showing solo pieces as well as dancing in the works of
other choreographers like Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. He started
making his own group works in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excessories'' was the dance that put Jasperse on the
international dance-festival-circuit map. That piece won the Prix
d'Auteur at Les Rencontres Internationales Chorographiques de
Bagnolet in 1996, a prestigious prize for contemporary
choreography, and has subsequently been performed throughout
Europe, South America and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It also led to a commission by Batsheva Dance Company, the
modern troupe based in Tel Aviv, which will be presented in
February, 2000. In addition, a piece by Jasperse has been
commissioned by the Baryshnikov Dance Foundation for the White Oak
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographic commissions will help keep the John Jasperse
Company, with its modest $130,000 annual budget, barely solvent.
Obviously, no one relying on an income from Jasperse is renting in
the Hamptons this summer. Although it bothers him that the money he
has earned is hardly commensurate with the critical acclaim he has
received, Jasperse is not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``With `Waving,' I was feeling totally beaten down,'' he said,
``and filled with so many questions about whether I wanted to keep
making dances. Here I was being a successful choreographer, this is
what I had always wanted, and it felt kind of empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of my work has been about power, about people defining
themselves in terms of others. I feel the energy we're trying to
address now is much more adult. This dance is kind of like you're
sitting on a street corner and a day passes. There's continuity of
events you experience through that block of time, even if they
don't necessarily make sense immediately.''

   FILM-ENTRAPMENT (Undated) _ ``Entrapment,'' starring Sean
Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the young British actress, is
enjoyable in parts, but could have been much better. It is
strangely paced (especially in the beginning), always confusing to
follow, and extremely awkward as a romance.

<P>
   FILM-PUNK (Undated) _ ``SLC Punk'' is an indie movie about not
taking responsibility for one's actions, while making it seem
glamorous and cool to stay on the fringe. It's an unenlightening
film that proves youthful anarchy is just as dull as a midlife
crisis, and sadly, as predictable, too.

as a Sunday school diversion for 5-year-olds, but it isn't apt to
do much for anyone who has reached the age of reason. Like a bad
sermon, it's too long. Like a bad toupee, it's too obvious. Like a

INDIE FILM IS LOSING ITS VIGOR AS IT AGES 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Graham Fuller is executive editor of Interview Magazine and editor
of ``Loach on Loach,'' about the director Ken Loach.  
 By GRAHAM FULLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the most memorable scenes in ``Hype!,'' a playfully
ironic documentary that was introduced at the 1996 Sundance Film
Festival, a young fan laments the commercialization of the Seattle
music scene that had spawned the grunge-rock movement of the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A miserable expression clouds the youth's face as he recalls how
he supported a particular group at the beginning of its career when
it had a small following, only to watch its growing popularity ruin
it as something meaningful to him.
</P>
<P>
   His disillusion will be familiar to anyone who has attended the
birth of a grass-roots cultural revolution, then witnessed it being
co-opted by bigger, stronger forces that rob it of its original
spark.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of disillusion is beginning to surround another
artistic movement that flourished in the early 90s but has turned
into a hyperbolized growth industry: American independent cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Production of independent films in the United States is at an
all-time high (about 1,000 starts a year), and there is an
expanding market for them on television, with the success of cable
networks like the Independent Film Channel, and on the
ever-burgeoning festival circuit. But within the entertainment
business, the consensus suddenly seems to be that, documentaries
aside, powerful, innovative independent films are thin, and that it
has been a while since anything has measured up to the likes of
``Stranger Than Paradise,'' ``She's Gotta Have It,'' ``Blood
Simple,'' ``Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' ``Reservoir Dogs'' or
``Safe,'' to name some of the high points of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-directors like Todd Solondz (``Welcome to the
Dollhouse,'' ``Happiness'') and Neil LaBute (``In the Company of
Men,'' ``Your Friends and Neighbors'') are, perhaps, the only
unique voices to have emerged in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of American independent film is weak,'' said Tom
Bernard, a co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, which is
stirring several home-grown indies into the mix of films it is
distributing this year. These include the August release ``Twin
Falls Idaho,'' a tale of conjoined twins that will need glowing
reviews to attract audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Woods, the producer of such diverse independent films as
Larry Clark's ``Kids'' and Wes Craven's ``Scream,'' was just as
blunt. ``The independent scene has fallen into a formulaic rut,''
he said. ``There's a dearth of fresh and original filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might accuse ``Scream'' itself of bringing an unwelcome and
hugely influential streak of exploitation to indie cinema. To give
Woods his due, though, his new company, Independent Pictures, has
just produced ``The Julian Chronicles,'' the second film directed
by Harmony Korine, whose first, ``Gummo,'' was one of the most
audacious, least seen experimental films of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   As despised in some quarters as it was praised in others,
Korine's debut was undeniably the work of an obsessive maker of
images, a director who isn't a slave to narrative conventions but
an artist _ a difficult one to be sure _ intent on plowing his own
intentionally wayward furrow.
</P>
<P>
   Ideologically speaking, he is a true independent. He is also
that rarity, a young filmmaker with a vast knowledge of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial problem that seems to beset the current independent
scene is that a spirit of careerism has replaced the sense of
vocation that originally fueled it and resulted in the most
invigorated personal films. Whereas Korine will rave about a Werner
Herzog film from the early '70s with the same zeal with which you
hear Martin Scorsese enthusing about Michael Powell's ``Red Shoes''
or Steven Spielberg about David Lean's ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' many
of his peers tend to discuss who the hot agents are.
</P>
<P>
   One indication that accomplished American indies are few and far
between right now is the low level of industry buzz on those films
set for release this summer or fall. Among the films generating
excitement are ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a creepy
mock-documentary written and directed by Dan Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez that is opening in July, and ... nothing else whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin Falls Idaho,'' made by the identical twins Michael and
Mark Polish, and other forthcoming films like Eric Mendelsohn's
suburban drama ``Judy Berlin,'' Jim Fall's gay romantic comedy
``Trick,'' the producer-turned-director Scott King's World War
II-era drama ``Treasure Island'' and Mark Illsley's gender-bending
comedy ``Happy, Texas,'' all have a track record at Sundance and
other festivals, but no one is claiming they are truly special.
</P>
<P>
   For distributors and consumers looking for a small gem, like
Whit Stillman's ``Metropolitan'' or David O. Russell's ``Spanking
the Monkey,'' pickings are slim.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, when ``Sex, Lies and Videotape'' took Sundance by
storm, the most accurate barometer for American independent film
has been the reception accorded to selections at the festival,
which takes place in Utah in January. And it's virtually impossible
to find a distributor or producer who is enthusiastic about the
fictional movies that were shown at Sundance '99.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the dramatic competition, I saw a lack of passion
comparable to what that festival usually programs, and I think that
is a general reflection of what is being made,'' said Mary
Glucksman, programming director for First Look, a film organization
that provides a distribution and marketing platform for 9 or 10
independent features a year.
</P>
<P>
   Equally glum was Mark Urman, co-president of Lion's Gate
Releasing. ``I must say I came out of Sundance a bit distressed
because there was nothing to buy, although the dust is still
settling,'' said Urman, whose company in 1998 picked up six
Sundance titles, including two, ``Gods and Monsters'' and
``Affliction,'' that went on to significant critical success.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jeff Gilmore, director of programming at Sundance since
1990, was cautious. ``There was work at the festival this year that
I thought was extremely interesting and in some sense
iconoclastic,'' he said. ``Perhaps not entirely successful in every
case, but usually involving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty pleased when I see films like `Pi' or `Slam' or
`Three Seasons' or `Judy Berlin,' which don't fit into the hyped
and preordained categories of what people expect independent films
to be,'' he said, referring to two 1998 selections and two from
this year. ``It wasn't just critics that were saying they were
tired of looking at twenty-something angst films. We were getting
pretty tired of them, too. But of the 800 films that we looked at
for the dramatic competition this year, I have to say many of them
were very formulaic.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders aren't blaming Sundance for the apparent drop
in quality; most recognize that a festival is only as good as the
films available. They're pointing instead to a mood of opportunism
that has steadily engulfed the indie movement since it became a
conduit to directorial stardom in 1992, the year Quentin
Tarantino's ``Reservoir Dogs'' became the benchmark for neophyte
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the inordinate attention given to the indie
explosion of the mid-90s is that most first-time directors in this
country now seem driven less by the need to make an artistic
statement than by the desire to expedite their Hollywood careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It created some false expectations on the part of people who
felt they wanted to become directors,'' said Emily Russo,
co-president of the boutique distributor Zeitgeist Films.
``Filmmaking is a talent. Just as not everyone can write a good
book, not everyone can make a good film. But these days anyone with
enough initiative and drive can make a film. But that's not the
same thing as having a true filmmaker's sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill Holland, the producer of ``Desert Blue,'' which will be
released this summer, put it in even stronger terms. ``There's a
lot of rich kids out there who can come up with $500,000 to make a
movie with talented people,'' he said. ``The problem is they don't
know how to direct actors, they don't know how to handle crews,
they've never even made a short film. A lot of them think they have
talent, but they don't, and some of them are siphoning off funds
from more deserving cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Urman blames the hype, but also believes that much of the
downturn is an inevitable part of an aging process. ``American
independent film as a classification has matured to the extent that
it's actually become self-aware and a little decadent,'' he said.
``Because a machinery has been put into place _ the festival
circuit and a whole generation of distributors geared to bringing
these films to market _ it's less about the individual struggle of
the filmmaker and more about the bandwagon. As soon as that
happens, you get a different kind of movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now a cottage industry that is so watched and written
about, it's simply impossible for independent films to
spontaneously erupt anymore,'' Urman added. ``Independent
filmmakers are going into production knowing that they can have a
cassette to show or a print to screen by the submission deadline
for Sundance or some other notable festival or market. They attach
themselves from day one to agents, sales agents, publicists and
other representatives who will advance them. When people set out to
become an overnight sensation, it's very different from setting out
to make a good movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard notes the absence among new directors of genuine auteurs
like John Sayles, Jim Jarmusch and Hal Hartley, who have mostly
opted to work outside the Hollywood system because they are
unwilling to accept the artistic compromises inherent in making
studio films. ``The motivation for most kids to make independent
movies is not to have a means of independent expression, to say
something you can't say within the system, but to get into the
system, become a major director, and get rich,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Anders, the writer-director of such personal,
story-driven films as ``Gas Food Lodging'' and ``Mi Vida Loca,'' is
so disenchanted with the United States indie business that she is
thinking of moving to Britain, where she raised the money for her
latest movie, ``Sugar Town,'' a Sundance entry scheduled to open in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some good American directors scrounging to
make independent films,'' she said, ``but I think the movement is
basically over. The trend that has really bothered me is the white
middle-class boy movie. I'm so tired of hearing that voice. In
general, I don't think the guys who make those kinds of films
really know what they want to be _ they could be a filmmaker, a
rock star, whatever _ but they're very good at usurping what's
going on in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anders also blames the post-``Scream'' influx of stars into
indie films for foisting a level of mainstream blandness onto them.
``As a director, you should really be passionate about the stories
you want to tell and making sure you have the actors you want to
tell them with, and you shouldn't compromise too much.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pierson, who presents the Independent Film Channel program
``Split Screen,'' and who has shepherded many vibrant
micro-budgeted films to completion, suggests that frequently young
filmmakers, having not studied pre-'90s cinema, do not have the
faintest grasp of film narrative. ``Many of the trendsetting
independent films, including some I've been involved in myself,
have championed the idea of the character-driven movie,'' he said.
``But many of them have fallen into the trap of thinking that
creating an interesting character is enough, meaning there often
isn't much of a story when you add it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore put it this way: ``The fundamental knowledge of
storytelling isn't as imbued in many young filmmakers as it should
be, but they know all about grosses. A lot of them simply can't
talk to you about films and filmmakers. They can't sit there and
say, `This is the Nicholas Ray film that inspired me,' because they
won't have seen any of his films. We've got to get back to film
literacy in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the naked ambition or artistic callowness of
today's young wannabe directors that is taking the gleam off the
golden era of American independent film. Independently produced
movies have traditionally required several weeks to ``build'' in
theaters. The glut of mediocre pictures _ from Hollywood studios or
not _ has created a situation in which low-grossing films are being
pushed out of theaters more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise in independent productions has led to a rise in the
number of releases,'' Pierson said, ``and nobody can deny that has
caused good films to cannibalize each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the art houses that showed independent films in the
'60s,'70s and '80s have been swallowed by theater chains, which are
more likely to show ``Shakespeare in Love'' _ that $41 million,
Oscar-grabbing faux indie produced by the Disney-owned Miramax _
than rawer films like ``Slam'' or ``Buffalo 66.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a few exceptions, theater owners are so greedy that
they're not making room for the really edgy product,'' Bernard
said. And this makes it even more unlikely that a first-time
director will make a risky film with limited commercial prospects.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a moral to this story, it is that more means less.
</P>
<P>
   But ``even more'' is what is about to happen to the American
independent film scene with the advent of digital video, a format
that will enable anyone who can raise around $50,000 to make a film
with high production values.
</P>
<P>
   This format has been used to great effect by the Danish
directors Lars von Trier (the forthcoming ``The Idiots'') and
Thomas Vinterberg (``The Celebration''), whose Dogma 95 manifesto
calls for shooting in natural light with hand-held cameras. It's a
good bet that digital video will become pandemic in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no let-up in production, that's for sure,'' said
Pierson, figuratively throwing his hands up in the air. ``There
will always be first-timers who, come hell or high water, are going
to make a feature film. You'd think a lot of people who make a
feature that disappears without a trace would lick their wounds and
go away, but most of them come back and make another. There should
be some kind of 12-step program to break people of this habit _
maybe I should start it.''

AT THE SCENE OF A CRIME?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I recently discovered that the corporate division in which I
am a manager has been engaging in practices that are at least
questionable and possibly illegal. With a few discreet questions, I
have learned that the vice president in charge of the division
sanctions the activities and that my peers don't share my qualms.
Without disclosing my reason, I have lined up a transfer out of the
division, but it won't take effect for several months. In the
meantime, how can I protect myself if things blow up? Should I talk
to a lawyer?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Possibly illegal'' is not the same as illegal _ or even
unethical. At this stage, you need more facts about the issues
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to determine whether you're calling the line too close''
advised James Schrager, a business ethicist and professor of
strategy at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of
Business. Because you seem to be the only person who questions
these activities, you may be overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   To understand your company's actions _ and how or why it may be
bending the rules _ talk to your peers, Schrager said. Someone may
be able to explain the situation to your satisfaction. ``But if
you're hearing things like, `everybody does it,' or `they've never
stopped us before,' or `the law is poorly written,' there may be a
real problem,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, there is good news: In most cases, you don't have
much to worry about from a legal standpoint. ``If an individual
employee is not engaging in wrongful or criminal activity, then
there isn't much likelihood of individual liability,'' said Philip
M. Berkowitz, a management employment lawyer with Salans Hertzfeld
Heilbronn Christy &AMP; Viener of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think you should distance yourself from your
division's practices, get your objections on record, Schrager said.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to your boss, but be sure to keep the conversation private
and nonconfrontational. ``If you make it a personal dispute between
you and the boss, that doesn't do anybody any good,'' Berkowitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, consider talking to in-house counsel. The
lawyer could not only clarify the law, but the conversation could
also document your concerns. Be aware, though, that the lawyer will
almost certainly tell your boss about the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the appearance of going over your boss's head, you may
want to ask him or her for clearance first. (Of course, even if
nothing shady is going on, your boss may take offense, refuse your
request or even blow up at you.)
</P>
<P>
   Think twice about approaching an outside lawyer. Not only will
it cost you serious money, but the lawyer also won't have a
complete picture of your organization, Schrager said. And should
anyone find out, your loyalty could be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if the behavior you've uncovered is serious enough to
merit your own legal representation, you may want to think less
about protecting yourself until your transfer, and more about
finding another employer altogether. &QL;

MATCHING UP, FOR TRAVEL AND MORE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Pa., Mich.)   (af)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For seven years after her husband died in 1977, Margaret Hayward
didn't go out much. Then, in 1985, when she was 67, she went as a
single traveler on a group tour of Europe. ``I found that rather
lonely,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1988, she joined Travel Companion Exchange of Amityville,
N.Y. It manages a registry of single, divorced or widowed people
who are looking for travel companions and, in some cases, romance
or marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since she found the organization, Mrs. Hayward,
now 81, a retired church organist who lives in Centerport, N.Y.,
has taken trips several times a year, to scores of countries. Her
traveling companions, all arranged through Travel Companion
Exchange, have always been men, and she has never traveled with the
same one twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard from some women friends that other women didn't
make good traveling companions,'' Mrs. Hayward said. ``So I started
out with that in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Any problems sharing a room with a man? ``Not with me,'' she
said. ``I'm a normal female. None of them were suitable to marry
after my husband, but that's my problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hayward usually meets potential travel companions for a
``day or so'' in advance of a trip in an attempt to make sure they
are compatible. But she concedes that on at least one occasion, the
initial meeting amounted only to a lunch.
</P>
<P>
   When Jans Jurgen started Travel Companion Exchange in 1982, his
goal was to provide a service that would help travelers save money
by sharing expenses and avoiding single-supplement charges. He had
little inkling he would end up as a matchmaker. ``I was really
surprised at the number of ladies who wanted men as travel
companions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he tries to appeal to all age groups, in recent years
the majority of his clients have been over 50. The group has 2,500
active members who pay $159 to $298 a year for access to extensive
profiles of possible companions as well as a travel newsletter
published every other month.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jurgen, more than 70 percent of his clients either
request companions of the opposite sex or are willing to accept
them; fewer than 15 percent want private rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Another 500 people subscribe only to the newsletter, for $48 a
year. For either service, the address is Travel Companion Exchange,
Box 833, Amityville, N.Y. 11701 (phone 800 392-1256).
</P>
<P>
   Jurgen, 63, who now operates the service with the help of his
wife, Eul Lee, estimates that his match-up service has led to as
many as 800 marriages _ including his own. He met Ms. Lee, who is
43, five years ago when she signed up as a client; they married in
1997. It was his second marriage and her first.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things don't always work out so swimmingly, which is
why Jurgen requires profiles of all members and advises prospective
travel companions to meet before they take off together. Mrs.
Hayward, for instance, turned down travel with a man who wanted to
rough it for a month in an Asian beach house that had no running
water or toilet facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But for Maralynne Flehner and Larry Spielvogel of King of
Prussia, Pa., joining up as travel companions in 1990 for a trip to
Africa turned into love at first flight. They were married the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flehner, now 52, was a Wall Street lawyer when she met
Spielvogel, a consulting engineer based in King of Prussia. She had
been divorced once and then widowed. Spielvogel, 60, said he had
been a ``confimed bachelor'' all his life. Ms. Flehner quit her job
and moved to Pennsylvania when they married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever expected to find anybody who was so much like
me,'' Ms. Flehner said. ``It was a stroke of luck. When I found
myself widowed in my early 40s, I was not someone who felt
comfortable going into a bar to meet people. What do you do? There
are so few resources available for middle-aged and older people to
meet each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielvogel echoed a complaint of many single people who turn to
services like Jurgen's: They may have friends, but the friends
often don't have the time, inclination or money to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a bachelor, I dated many women, but when I decided
it was time for a vacation, the majority of them either weren't
interested in going to places where I wanted to go or couldn't take
the time to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Flannigan, 71, and Marilyn Laughlin, 66, of Williamston,
Mich., also found each other, in 1997, through travel. They now
live together but have opted not to marry. Flannigan is a retired
criminal investigator for the United States Justice Department, and
Ms. Laughlin is a retired teacher and a former Roman Catholic nun.
</P>
<P>
   Flannigan joined Jurgen's travel service a year or so after his
wife of 38 years died in 1987. He always chose female travel
companions and praised them recently in a letter to the Travel
Companion Exchange newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   They included, he said, the ``nudist that visited the Palm
Springs Nudist Resort with me and the marvelous (ex-nun) companion
with whom I (an atheist) now reside.''

IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT SECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of mutual fund newsletters that pursue sector
rotation strategies is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2)  
 (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most popular strategies for mutual fund investors is
sector rotation. More than 20 of the 66 fund newsletters tracked by
The Hulbert Financial Digest pursue such a strategy at least in
part, three times the total a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are many variations, but in general, sector rotation means
switching among sector funds _ those that specialize in particular
industries _ in the hope of always being in the best-performing
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors pursue the strategy through Fidelity Investments,
which offers 38 sector funds, designated by the word ``Select'' in
their names, as in Fidelity Select Regional Banks.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of sector rotation is easy to understand. If you were
lucky enough to have been invested in the best-performing Select
fund in each of the last 10 calendar years, you would have made
64.4 percent a year, on average, versus 19.2 percent for the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Few investors, of course, are lucky enough to be in the
top-performing sector fund in any given year, let alone for 10
consecutive years. Yet to hear some newsletters trumpet their
returns, you'd think investors could come awfully close to such
good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Funny things can happen on the way to the bank. The real-world
returns of newsletters' sector-rotation portfolios don't come
anywhere close to 64.4 percent a year. In fact, few portfolios even
match the market. And those that do are inordinately risky.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newsletters I track, the one that has made the most
money over the last decade investing in Select funds is Fidelity
Monitor of Rocklin, Calif., edited by Jack Bowers. His sector
rotation portfolio made 21.5 percent a year, on average, for the 10
years ended March 31, according to The Hulbert Financial Digest,
versus 18.7 percent for the S&AMP;P 500 (And Bowers makes no claims of
anything more.)
</P>
<P>
   That 21.6 percent return is impressive _ until you consider the
portfolio's risk, which was 21 percent greater than the market's.
To put that risk and return into perspective, imagine that 10 years
ago, you decided to buy an S&AMP;P 500 index fund on 21 percent margin
_ that is, for each $100 in your portfolio, you borrowed $21 and
invested $121 in the fund. Your risk would have been the same as
that of Bowers' portfolio, yet you would have made slightly more _
an average of 21.8 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Only one sector-rotation portfolio I track has beaten the stock
market on a risk-adjusted basis over its life _ though not over
just the last 10 years. It is maintained by Investors Intelligence,
edited by Michael Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Since I began following it at the beginning of 1987, it has had
an average annual return of 14.5 percent, versus 17.8 percent for
the S&AMP;P 500, but with 29 percent less risk. If your portfolio had
contained an index fund and T-bills in the proper combination to be
29 percent less risky than the market, it would have made 14.4
percent annualized, slightly less than Burke's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Burke's portfolio is the exception that proves the
rule: Its beating the market on a risk-adjusted basis has nothing
to do with sector rotation. Instead, it is a result of timing the
market. Before some market declines, he reduced his exposure to the
Select funds and increased his cash position.
</P>
<P>
   I calculate that if he hadn't used market timing and had focused
instead on sector rotation, his portfolio would have lagged behind
the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what would have happened if, every time Burke directed
you to buy a Fidelity Select fund, you bought an index fund
instead. Over the last 12\ years, you would have picked up an extra
1.3 percentage points of annual return. Better yet, you would have
incurred only three-fourths the risk that Burke's portfolio did.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Burke reduced returns and increased risk by
investing in sector funds.
</P>
<P>
   Keep that in mind the next time you're ready to pursue a
sector-rotation strategy. &QL;

RARE WINES AUCTIONS AT CHRISTIE'S AND SOTHEBY'S  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2)

   At 59, Bill Koch has a net worth well north of half a billion
dollars and is in the robust prime of life. Even so, some other
numbers are hard to ignore. He drinks a bottle or so of wine each
week and has 28,000 of them in his cellar.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why 3,400 of those bottles, including some of
the rarest wines in the world, will be sold this week at Christie's
in New York. Christie's is billing the auction, to be held on
Thursday and Friday, as the ``millennium sale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best and rarest wines of the last 100 years to enjoy over
the next 100 years,'' said Christopher Burr, head of Christie's
wine department. The sale will include parts of other major
collections, but the Koch wines, to be sold on Friday, are the
stars.
</P>
<P>
   They include a bottle of Chateau Latour 1870, valued at about
$6,000, among other Bordeaux from prized vintages including 1899,
1918, 1926, 1945 and 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Koch (pronounced coke) said soaring prices and his wine's
mortality, but not his own, were major considerations when he
decided to sell some of his horde. ``Christie's had been after me
for a long time,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home
in Boca Raton, Fla. ``Also, the market prices are good right now
and, well, it seemed like a good opportunity to prune my cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through my inventory looking particularly at ones I had
the most of and ones that are at or about to pass their peak. I've
got a lot of old wines,'' he said, in pointed understatement.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps his collection in two temperature- and
humidity-controlled cellars in his summer home at Osterville,
Mass., on Cape Cod. ``One is for new wines,'' he said, ``and the
other, fancier one, is to show off to my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   William I. Koch is known in business as a maverick member of the
Wichita, Kan., family that owns Koch Industries, an oil, chemical
and agricultural giant that is one of the largest private companies
in the country. He has spent much of the last two decades in court,
battling with his brothers over the disposition of the family's
multibillion-dollar fortune.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent yachtsman, he won the 1992 America's Cup race for
the San Diego Yacht Club. He is also a major art collector, owning
works by Renoir, Picasso, Monet and Cezanne.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his formidable wine collection, Koch does not consider
himself much of an expert. In buying wine, he said: ``I taste and
decide. I don't go into it much beyond that. I buy all the wine
books, but I don't necessarily read them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Christie's archrival, Sotheby's, is holding a
sale later this month featuring what it calls the ``millennium
superlot,'' a consignment of 17 cases of rare Bordeaux, Burgundies
and Champagnes, which Sotheby's predicts will sell for as much as
$250,000. The millennium superlot is from the collection of George
Zicarelli, an editor in New York for CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the millennium hype, these auctions, while not the
biggest or most important offered by either auction house in recent
years, reflect an ever-growing demand for rare wines, both old and
relatively new. Bottles from the 19th and early 20th centuries have
always been in short supply, but the proliferation of collectors
and knowledgeable drinkers had made good recent vintages hard to
find, too.
</P>
<P>
   The best wines from highly praised vintages like 1982 and 1990
in Bordeaux, long virtually sold out, are found only at auctions.
Some of the most famous Burgundies _ like Le Montrachet, a white,
and Romanee-Conti _ a red, are made in such small quantities that
collectors snap them up as soon as they are released, at prices
hovering near $1,000 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Wine buyers for top restaurants haunt the auction halls, paying
astonishing prices for wines their customers demand.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention is paid to expensive wines at auctions, but
bargains can be overlooked. Both sales will offer lots of
lesser-known but excellent older wines at estimated prices as low
as $200. A case of 1988 Burgundy, Nuits-St.-Georges Clos de la
Marechale, is estimated at $350 to $500, and two magnums, or double
bottles, of Antinori Chianti Classico Riserva 1985, at $200 to
$300.
</P>
<P>
   But for wine collectors, the chase is as important as the
capture. Just as Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer, is building
back a vast collection he has recently sold off, Koch readily
acknowledged that he will eventually bring his collection back up
to its pre-sale size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been almost entirely French,'' he said, ``Bordeaux and
Burgundy. Now I'd like to move into other things _ Argentina,
perhaps; Chile, California, New Zealand. I'll probably get back to
around 28,000 bottles.'' He spends so much on wine that he can
bypass the usual retail channels and buy through agents around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   At Christie's, the Thursday sale will feature wines from the
extensive holdings of two Floridians who have been collecting for
three decades: Kenneth M. Mazik, chairman of the Orlando Financial
Corp., and Dr. Robert Elkins, the founder and chief executive of
Integrated Health Services, a nursing home and home health care
provider. Both more than 6 feet tall, they are known in wine
circles as ``the big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   In putting wines up for sale, Elkins knows medical science has
its limits. ``I took a look at our list,'' he said, ``and I
realized I'd be 120 years old before I drank it up.''

IN THE AFTERMATH OF LITTLETON, COPYCAT THREATS AND CONCERNS FOR
SCHOOL SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 14-year-old boy was charged with murder in Canada, a pipe bomb
was found in an Oklahoma school and school districts across the
nation were on heightened alert on Thursday as bomb threats, talk
of hit lists and fears of more violence in the wake of the
Littleton, Colo., massacre continued to ripple outward.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days after the horrific shootings at Columbine High School,
there were new reports of threats, of schools evacuated, of police
officers patrolling in hallways, of young people being arrested or
suspended on suspicion of plotting to blow up their schools or to
kill or maim their classmate-enemies.
</P>
<P>
   There were other harsh realities. In Taber, Alberta, a town
southeast of Calgary, a gunman too young to be identified was
charged with the murder and attempted murder of two 17-year-olds
Wednesday in an incident eerily like the Colorado killings. And in
Enid, Okla., a pipe bomb was found in a school bathroom, though no
one was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   As the last of the victims' funerals unfolded in Littleton on
Thursday, many Americans were talking about school safety, gun
control, the effect of violence in movies and video games and a
disturbing series of crimes that could have been touched off by
malicious or disturbed copycats.
</P>
<P>
   But actual violence and real bombs have been rare,
law-enforcement officials and educators say, and what has been
stalking the schools is an inordinate fear of death _ largely
fueled by the terrible images of Littleton _ that has reached
epidemic proportions in a nation that seems to have no choice but
to overreact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to react to every little thing now because we can't
separate the real from the imagined,'' said Pat Lewis,
superintendent of the school district in Coalinga, Calif., where
two boys were arrested this week for saying they wanted to blow up
their schools. ``We take no chances. Safety comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere of extraordinary tension, daily calls from
worried parents have soared in thousands of schools across the
country; teachers have begun to lock classroom doors after tardy
bells; guards are being posted in schools at night to watch for
skulduggery, and dark trenchcoats like those worn by the killers in
Littleton are being banned, with violators suspended or arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the strains, people with real or fanciful grudges have
taken advantage of the tragedy by making anonymous bomb threats by
phone, by leaving apocalyptic notes in school bathrooms or on the
Internet. Some websites have foretold widespread school attacks for
Friday, the anniversary of the death of Adolf Hitler. Authorities
have said they had to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teen-agers have been branded as snitches for voicing
suspicions or telling of overheard threats, while students have
been arrested for casual remarks made on a school bus, or threats
mumbled in response to a teacher's reprimand. Most students have
been warned in recent days that even joking about bombs and guns
will land them in a police station.
</P>
<P>
   But in a nation with some 50 million students in 108,000 public
schools in which violent deaths have been extremely rare and
declining for years, the turmoil and anguish in the aftermath of
the killings in Colorado appeared to be necessary, both as a
precaution and a catharsis, some law-enforcement officials and
education experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Littleton, less than 1 percent of the schools across
the country have experienced a violent death on campus in the last
seven years,'' June Arnette, associate director of the National
School Safety Center, in Westlake, Calif., said. ``You're talking
about numbers too small to generalize.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added: ``Since Littleton, there has been a ripple
effect. Schools everywhere are in a panic mode, receiving bomb
threats, threats of terrorist attacks. Nobody can ignore those
things. Whether or not schools are safe is not the issue. It's the
perception of safety at this point that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools were still the safest place for kids outside the home,
Ms. Arnette said, but she added: ``We did witness what happened at
Columbine and we can't feel we're totally insulated. We can't hide
our head in the sand and say it's not going to happen here, so
let's not become complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be the rational of school and law-enforcement
authorities in dozens of states and thousands of school districts
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Diego area, where one suburban high school was
evacuated because of a bomb threat on Thursday, police officers
were on patrol in and around 560 schools with 461,000 students, and
school administrators said they were taking Internet threats on the
anniversary of Hitler's death seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, daily calls to a state Education Department safety
hotline have jumped 40 percent since the Littleton killings,
officials said. Some have told of students wearing black trench
coats, but most have told of students bullying or using threatening
language or of notes, some containing purpored hit lists of people
to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something going on all around the state,'' said Jeff
Hodges, the school safety coordinator for the Georgia Department of
Education. ``We have kids taking advantage of a tragic situation.
You have to follow up and take it seriously.''

MOST CRIME GUNS BOUGHT, NOT STOLEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mass., Md., Calif., Wis., Ill., N.Y., Ga., Ind.,
Nev.)   (jw) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The teen-agers who killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher
last week in Colorado got their guns the way most violent juveniles
and adult criminals get theirs: by purchasing them from gun dealers
or at gun shows or by buying them using friends as intermediaries,
law enforcement officials and criminologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that juveniles and adult criminals buy their weapons,
usually new guns, from legitimate sources is a finding developed
only in the past three years and contradicts what had been the
widely accepted view, that they steal their guns, usually older
weapons. The traditional view, still advocated by the National
Rifle Association, was that because criminals steal their weapons
and because there are an estimated 230 million guns in America,
there is little anyone can do to stop people from getting access to
guns for crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But, David Kennedy, a senior researcher at the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard University, said the new finding
was ``a quiet revolution that means law enforcement now has
practical ways to go after illegal guns.'' Police departments in
several cities, including Boston, New York, Baltimore and Los
Angeles, now target the illegal sale of guns the way police have
long cracked down on drugs, and the campaigns are credited with
sharp drops in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The recognition that juveniles and criminals buy their guns
comes as a result of tracing guns seized in crimes by the Federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, an effort largely begun
during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The firearms bureau reported in February that about a third of
guns used in crimes by juveniles had been made within the past
three years, and half of all guns illegally acquired by young
people involved straw purchasers, either friends of the offenders
or organized rings of gun traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   In another new finding, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., reported
Thursday that 1 percent of federally licensed firearms dealers sold
nearly half of the guns traced to crimes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Using data gathered by the firearms bureau, Schumer found that
although about 80 percent of the 104,000 licensed gun dealers did
not have a single crime gun traced to their stores last year, 1,160
dealers were the source of 34,626 guns seized in crimes. And a mere
0.1 percent of the dealers, or 137 of them, accounted for more than
13,000 guns traced to crimes in 1998. Some of these dealers each
sold more than 1,000 guns that were used in crimes from 1996
through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that a few bad apples are supplying the lion's
share of guns to criminals,'' Schumer said. ``This will allow us to
focus on the bad dealers and choke off the pathway of guns as they
move from legitimate commerce to children.''
</P>
<P>
   A dealer in West Milwaukee, for example, sold 1,195 guns used in
crimes in the past three years, the data showed, while one in
Riverdale, Ill., a Chicago suburb, was the source of 1,176 crime
guns. The firearms bureau did not provide the dealers' names, under
the terms of the law allowing it to trace crime guns.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and President Clinton have both proposed legislation
that would give the firearms bureau more authority to crack down on
so-called dirty dealers, stores that either knowingly sell to
criminals or that straw purchasers have learned will sell guns
without asking too many questions. One of their proposals would
allow the bureau to conduct more than the current limit of one
inspection per year of a gun dealer's records.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal would permit the firearms bureau to temporarily
suspend the licenses of dealers who sold guns used in crimes
without going through a time-consuming hearing process.
</P>
<P>
   As further examples of the problem, Schumer said that 15 dealers
in Indiana were the source of 5,119 crime guns from 1996 through
1998, 10 dealers in Illinois accounted for 4,287 guns used in
crimes during that period, and 15 dealers in Georgia were the
source of 3,726 crime guns in three years. Similarly, one dealer in
Carson City, Nev., supplied 326 guns used in crimes in 1998, all
but two committed outside Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Gun tracing by the firearms bureau has revealed that three of
the four guns used in the attack at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., were purchased at Denver-area gun shows by Robyn
Anderson, the 18-year-old girlfriend of Dylan Klebold, one of the
killers, the Jefferson County sheriff's office said. When she then
provided the weapons _ two sawed off Savage shotguns and a Hi-Point
9mm semiautomatic carbine _- to the teen-agers, she was acting as
what one firearms bureau agent described Thursday as ``a classic
straw purchaser.''
</P>
<P>
   Young men who are under 18, the legal age to buy handguns, or
are barred from purchasing because they have a criminal record,
often recruit their girlfriends to buy for them, the agent said.
Straw purchasing is a violation of federal law, and, in many
states, a violation of local law.
</P>
<P>
   The firearms bureau has long tracked guns used in notorious
crimes, but as more police agencies recognize the importance of gun
tracing, the number of guns the bureau traces has climbed to
194,235 guns in 1997, up from 37,181 in 1990. Some dealers with
troubled histories do not keep their records, agents say, making
tracing more difficult. But as the bureau has become increasingly
successful at gun tracing, the National Rifle Association through
its supporters in Congress has mounted an effort to get it to purge
some of its gun tracing data base.

TEXAS LHOUSE OKS INSURANCE PLAN FOR CHILDREN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eager to tap $423 million a year in federal
matching funds, Texas lawmakers on Thursday moved a step closer to
establishing a state-supported children's health insurance program
to help low-income residents under age 19.
</P>
<P>
   The House unanimously approved the plan after a fiery three-hour
debate, during which repeated attempts by conservatives to limit
eligibility were turned back.
</P>
<P>
   The bill still must be returned to the Senate because it was
changed by House members in several major ways. It was expanded to
include 55,000 children more than the Senate version and was
amended to say that if federal funding ceases, the state program
would, too.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was described as ``conservative, compassionate and
good for Texas'' by sponsoring Rep. Patricia Gray, D-Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   As tentatively approved, Senate Bill 445 by Sen. Mike Moncrief,
D-Fort Worth, would cover about 445,000 uninsured children whose
family income falls above the Medicaid eligibility limit but below
200 percent of the poverty level. For fiscal 1999, the poverty
level for a family of four is $16,800, so the bill would apply to
families earning up to twice that, or $33,600.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1.4 million Texas children may be uninsured,
officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   About $180 million has been set aside for the next two years for
the Children's Health Insurance Program, which would attract about
three times that amount from the federal government. A 1997 federal
law stated that Texas was eligible to receive an average of $423
million a year for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   During a protracted committee review process, several lawmakers
sought to tinker with the income limits and other factors to either
increase or decrease the number of children who would be covered.
One proposed amendment on Thursday would have limited the program
to children under the age of 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure the youngest kids, the most vulnerable
kids, are covered first,'' said Rep. Kyle Janek, R-Houston, who
proposed the change, which was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   But the most stirring debate centered on a proposal to ax a
separately funded program to provide health insurance for legal
immigrant children. Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth, R-Burleson, withdrew
her suggestion after complaining that her motives were mistakenly
construed as racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is being characterized as being a race-based, prejudicial
amendment, and it is not, was not to begin with, was never intended
to be. This was about a program that had been put into this bill
that I did not feel belonged in this bill,'' Wohlgemuth said.
</P>
<P>
   Several members had implied that Wohlgemuth was unfairly
slighting immigrant children. They argued that the impacted
children are too young to apply for citizenship and are already
endangered by inadequate health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the state of Texas to make a statement today that those
families that are coming here are welcome and those children are
going to be covered under this program,'' said Rep. Leticia Van de
Putte, D-San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about fellow Texans,'' thundered Rep. Rene
Oliveira, D-Brownsville. He said the move to strike the immigrants'
eligibility was akin to California's efforts to deny services to
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's House sponsor said lawmakers have been wrangling over
the proposal since August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have here today an enormous opportunity. We have secure
funding that will insure our kids, and I can think of no better use
for that funding than to fully invest in the health of our
community,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the primary reason for taking advantage of the
so-called ``CHIP`` program is that Texas is home to one in 10
uninsured children in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through broad-based, consensus decision-making, the cosponsors
of this legislation bring to you today a bill that we believe is
conservative, compassionate and good for Texas,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill faces a final House vote Friday before being returned
to the Senate. In the unlikely event that the Senate accepts the
House amendments, it would go to Gov. George W. Bush. But members
in both chambers have indicated that a House-Senate negotiating
committee will have to be appointed to resolve dozens of major and
minor differences.
</P>
<P>
   If finally approved, the program would come into existence on
Sept. 1, 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Until now, Warren Buffett's best-known real estate gamble was on
a bank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, his Berkshire Hathaway bought a big stake in Wells
Fargo amid a California real estate slump. The bank did not break
out of the real estate quagmire for two years, and Buffett later
acknowledged that he had not foreseen the severity of the problem
even though his investment ultimately paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Omaha billionaire is betting on real estate again. And
investors are left to wonder if he has correctly spotted the bottom
_ this time in real estate stocks _ or if he is early again.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett has spent more than $50 million, much of it in personal
funds, on shares of four REITs, with three purchases disclosed this
month. REITs, the publicly traded companies that own shopping
centers, apartment complexes, office buildings and other
properties, have been in the doldrums even as rents and real estate
values strengthen across much of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But they are coming to life. News of Buffett's purchases, and a
broad rebound in cyclical stocks that tend to soar with the
economy, has pushed REIT indexes about 10 percent higher in the
last month, the first good news for real estate shareholders since
the sector peaked in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sudden shift, real estate stocks look cheap by some
measures. For example, the stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's big
company index are trading at about 34 times their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For the last dozen years or so, that multiple has been about 1.5
times the average REIT's funds from operations, an industry measure
similar to cash flow. The stock multiple is now more than three
times the real estate average.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pulled money out of real estate mutual funds every
week for four months, but reversed course in the week ended April
21, pouring about $80 million into these funds, according to AMG
Data Services, an Arcata, Calif., mutual fund researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the attraction is the relatively high yields _ on
average, at least 2 percentage points more than on Treasury notes.
Wall Street analysts anticipate double-digit profit growth at many
real estate trusts this year. This means yields will remain strong,
since REITs pay out 95 percent of their taxable income to
shareholders every year to avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   REITs could still get hurt if the economy stumbles. But few
analysts expect problems anytime soon. Corporate earnings continue
to be surprisingly strong, and many economists have pronounced the
fallout from the financial crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil to
have passed. Meanwhile, commodity prices have stabilized _ a
bullish sign for real estate and other assets that perform well
with higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The current environment is similar to that at the bottoms of the
last six REIT cycles, says Bob Steers, co-manager of the Cohen &AMP;
Steers Realty Shares fund. Over the last three decades, he says,
the average bear market for real estate stocks lasted 14 months and
share prices declined by about one-quarter. Before the April rally,
the stocks had been in a slump for a little longer and had declined
a bit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the group is ready to move, it's ready to move because it
has been oversold,'' Steers said.

<P>
   Among the big real estate funds without high minimum investment
requirements, top performers for the three years ended in March
include Longleaf Partners Realty, with a 10.7 percent annualized
return; Cohen &AMP; Steers Realty Shares, 9.3 percent; Fidelity Real
Estate Investment Portfolio, 8.4 percent, and CGM Realty, 8.3
percent. All figures are from Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking
company in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the recent rally, analysts say shares in REITs are
mostly trading for less than the total that their properties would
sell for piecemeal. As a result, some real estate trusts are
diverting cash that would normally be used to buy properties to
buying back their stock.
</P>
<P>
   A few have even sold assets and used the proceeds for stock
buybacks. Archstone Communities, a REIT in Englewood, Colo., which
owns apartment buildings, sold property and repurchased $84.4
million in stock in February and March.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of last year, REITs have announced that they
will buy back $2.9 billion of their stock, compared with just $861
million in announced buybacks during the previous eight years
combined, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data in Newark,
N.J. CRA Real Estate Securities, a money manager in Radnor, Pa.,
counts 36 REITs that have announced buybacks since last summer, and
those have so far repurchased, on average, about 44 percent of the
shares authorized.
</P>
<P>
   Some managers are doing more than partial buybacks. An investor
group led by the company's chairman recently won a battle to
acquire Berkshire Realty outright for $12.25 a share, or a 26
percent premium to the stock's price before the buyout offer.
</P>
<P>
   And a group including the chief executive of Sunstone Hotel
Investors, a hotel operator based in San Clemente, Calif., has
offered to acquire the company for $9.50 to $10 a share, about 35
percent more than what the stock sold for earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buffett recently disclosed that he had increased his
stake in MGI Properties, a Boston real estate trust, to 10.3
percent, as the company nears liquidation. MGI's management decided
last year that it should sell everything and distribute the cash to
shareholders because of its low stock market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is now expected to generate $29 to $30 a share, almost
one-third more than MGI shares fetched last summer, when the plan
was disclosed. Shares closed Thursday unchanged at $27.5625.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Until now, Warren Buffett's best-known real estate gamble was on
a bank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, his Berkshire Hathaway bought a big stake in Wells
Fargo amid a California real estate slump. The bank did not break
out of the real estate quagmire for two years, and Buffett later
acknowledged that he had not foreseen the severity of the problem
even though his investment ultimately paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Omaha billionaire is betting on real estate again. And
investors are left to wonder if he has correctly spotted the bottom
_ this time in real estate stocks _ or if he is early again.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett has spent more than $50 million, much of it in personal
funds, on shares of four REITs, with three purchases disclosed this
month. REITs, the publicly traded companies that own shopping
centers, apartment complexes, office buildings and other
properties, have been in the doldrums even as rents and real estate
values strengthen across much of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But they are coming to life. News of Buffett's purchases, and a
broad rebound in cyclical stocks that tend to soar with the
economy, has pushed REIT indexes about 10 percent higher in the
last month, the first good news for real estate shareholders since
the sector peaked in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sudden shift, real estate stocks look cheap by some
measures. For example, the stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's big
company index are trading at about 34 times their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For the last dozen years or so, that multiple has been about 1.5
times the average REIT's funds from operations, an industry measure
similar to cash flow. The stock multiple is now more than three
times the real estate average.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pulled money out of real estate mutual funds every
week for four months, but reversed course in the week ended April
21, pouring about $80 million into these funds, according to AMG
Data Services, an Arcata, Calif., mutual fund researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the attraction is the relatively high yields _ on
average, at least 2 percentage points more than on Treasury notes.
Wall Street analysts anticipate double-digit profit growth at many
real estate trusts this year. This means yields will remain strong,
since REITs pay out 95 percent of their taxable income to
shareholders every year to avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   REITs could still get hurt if the economy stumbles. But few
analysts expect problems anytime soon. Corporate earnings continue
to be surprisingly strong, and many economists have pronounced the
fallout from the financial crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil to
have passed. Meanwhile, commodity prices have stabilized _ a
bullish sign for real estate and other assets that perform well
with higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The current environment is similar to that at the bottoms of the
last six REIT cycles, says Bob Steers, co-manager of the Cohen &AMP;
Steers Realty Shares fund. Over the last three decades, he says,
the average bear market for real estate stocks lasted 14 months and
share prices declined by about one-quarter. Before the April rally,
the stocks had been in a slump for a little longer and had declined
a bit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the group is ready to move, it's ready to move because it
has been oversold,'' Steers said.

buybacks. Archstone Communities, a REIT in Englewood, Colo., which
owns apartment buildings, sold property and repurchased $84.4
million in stock in February and March.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of last year, REITs have announced that they
will buy back $2.9 billion of their stock, compared with just $861
million in announced buybacks during the previous eight years
combined, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data in Newark,
N.J. CRA Real Estate Securities, a money manager in Radnor, Pa.,

</P>
<P>
   Some managers are doing more than partial buybacks. An investor
group led by the company's chairman recently won a battle to
acquire Berkshire Realty outright for $12.25 a share, or a 26
percent premium to the stock's price before the buyout offer.
</P>
<P>
   And a group including the chief executive of Sunstone Hotel
Investors, a hotel operator based in San Clemente, Calif., has
offered to acquire the company for $9.50 to $10 a share, about 35
percent more than what the stock sold for earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buffett recently disclosed that he had increased his
stake in MGI Properties, a Boston real estate trust, to 10.3
percent, as the company nears liquidation. MGI's management decided
last year that it should sell everything and distribute the cash to
shareholders because of its low stock market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is now expected to generate $29 to $30 a share, almost
one-third more than MGI shares fetched last summer, when the plan
was disclosed. Shares closed Thursday unchanged at $27.5625.

THIS OWNER HAS MYSTERIOUS WAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ He's portrayed as arrogant, if not ignorant,
for believing his horses can win America's greatest thoroughbred
race after training in the Dubai desert and skipping the
traditional Kentucky Derby preps.
</P>
<P>
   But the image must be wrong. Either that, or the bearded man
striding across the Churchill Downs backstretch in the royal-blue
cable-knit sweater, jeans and silver-spurred boots Thursday morning
must have been an impostor.
</P>
<P>
   No, it (begin ital)was(end ital) Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum, the
world's most powerful racehorse owner as well as the defense
minister of Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheikh was here to watch Worldly Manner and Aljabr go
through their final workouts before Saturday's Derby _ Worldly
Manner is the colt he bought in California for $5 million _ and to
win over some of his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Arrogant? Ignorant? Instead, the 50-year-old Mohammed came off
as fully aware of the mountainous challenge facing the two mystery
colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to win. I'm not saying I'm (begin ital)going(end
ital) to win,'' the Sheikh, who is Cambridge-educated, said in a
rare give-and-take with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As for U.S. trainers who question the colts' preparation: ``I
don't blame them,'' he said. ``They are experts and they have their
own way of training horses.''
</P>
<P>
   The American way involves testing a Derby prospect's ability in
major autumn 2-year-old races, a short winter break, and three or
four pre-Derby races of progressively greater distance at 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheikh Mohammed way involves halting his colts' 2-year-old
seasons in September, taking them to his lavish Godolphin training
center in Dubai and prepping them with dress-rehearsal ``trial
races'' at Nad al Sheba racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, that's reminiscent of Arazi, the brilliant 1991
2-year-old who returned to France, prepped with a single turf race
there, then finished eighth in the Derby. The Sheikh was a co-owner
of Arazi.
</P>
<P>
   To Europeans, it's more reminiscent of Lammtarra, who won the
1{-mile English Derby in his 3-year-old debut. The Sheikh was the
owner of Lammtarra.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they're in Kentucky, Worldly Manner and Aljabr each is
trying to be the first foreign-based horse since Venezuela's
Canonero II in '71 and the first horse without a race at age 3
since Morvich in '22 to win the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Another first: They're the first horses ever entered in the
Kentucky Derby by the Sheikh's Godolphin Racing Inc., which has
dominated the European classics. Meaning he could alter the routine
in future years, if it doesn't work this time.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't think the unorthodox preparation automatically puts
his horses at a disadvantage. But he said it was devised in part
out of necessity _ Godolphin trainer Saeed bin Suroor had to
prepare horses for the European season as well and couldn't spend
weeks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love challenges,'' the Sheikh said. ``And we are
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   If his colts lose Saturday, ``I'll be disappointed,'' he said.
``Then I'll say, `Well, I'll come back next year.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Sheikh said his goal is to win the Kentucky Derby in the
next four years. In that pursuit he has one big advantage: He can
purchase any horse whose owner is willing to sell.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's John and Betty Mabee were willing when Mohammed
offered $5 million for Worldly Manner after the Bob Baffert-trained
son of Riverman won the Del Mar Futurity by five lengths on Sept.
9.
</P>
<P>
   The Mabees and Baffert will have General Challenge _ and maybe
the filly Excellent Meeting _ in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said the Sheikh ``quizzed me about the Derby'' when the
trainer was in Dubai with Silver Charm in March. Now the Sheikh is
feeling Derby Fever himself, Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it's unbelievable how people get into it (in
Kentucky). He's like a little kid. He's a very down-to-earth guy...
for a defense minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed said he has studied videotapes of 20 Derbies. And he
appreciates the race's Americana, including ``My Old Kentucky
Home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes, it's very emotional,'' he said. ``What do they say _
`The sun shines bright...?'''
</P>
<P>
   He was at Churchill Downs before sun-up Thursday to watch the
5-furlong workouts by Worldly Manner (1:02) and Aljabr (1:02 3/5) _
showing improvement over their Sunday drills.
</P>
<P>
   More unorthodoxy: The last Derby starter to work 5 furlongs two
days before the race was Explosive Wagon, who finished 15th behind
Sunny's Halo in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans have praised Godolphin's methods and its horses.
Trainer Richard Mandella returned from Dubai, where he watched one
of the horses' trials, to say it was ``not just a little workout.
It was a race by any standards.'' Jockey Gary Stevens said Worldly
Manner's physique has filled out since his Del Mar days.
</P>
<P>
   Such testimonials might come too late to convince American
bettors. Worldly Manner and Aljabr, coupled for wagering, are 12-1
on the Derby morning line.
</P>
<P>
   But their owner, once thought to be arrogant or ignorant,
certainly changed some minds Thursday. &QL;

 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtually every manufacturer has minivan ergonomics down pat.
After all, functionality, comfort and convenience are the reasons
people drive these mobile dens. So other factors now count: Four
doors have become essential for convenience (and for children's
safety on one-way streets). Power-operated sliding doors win extra
credit. I also appreciate extra horsepower and nimble handling.
Innovative features, like folding seats, are a big plus.
</P>
<P>
   Given all these demands, one van was a clear winner. Second
place was easy, too. After that, it was pretty much a tossup. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. HONDA ODYSSEY Having grown to equal a long-wheelbase Chrysler
van, the new Odyssey is the right size. Its standard four doors
include two rear sliders (electric on the EX model). The second-row
seats move sideways on tracks to create a bench or separate into
captain's chairs (leaving a DMZ between squabbling children).
</P>
<P>
   The Odyssey shares a five-star crash rating with the Windstar;
its only shortcoming is a lack of side air bags. Outfitted in fine
materials, it is packed with nice touches like a folding table
between the front seats. This van is very nimble and gets smooth,
quiet power from its 210-horsepower V6.
</P>
<P>
   But what really sets the Odyssey apart is the third-row seat
that folds into the floor _ as a single mother, I've found it
impossible to remove most vans' third-row seats by myself. Finally,
since this is a Honda, you know the Odyssey's quality is
top-notch. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. FORD WINDSTAR Ford has fixed nearly everything that was wrong
with the original Windstar _ particularly the lack of a second
sliding door. Two sliders are now standard; both can be had with
power operation. The second-row seat slides sideways and there are
rear headphone jacks.
</P>
<P>
   With its optional 3.8-liter V6, the Windstar is powerful, and
its handling is good. Safety is also a strength; in addition to its
five-star safety rating, it has optional side air bags that protect
heads and chests and sonar sensors that detect objects at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   I had two complaints that kept the Windstar out of first place:
its engine is very noisy, and its parking brake lever is awkwardly
situated to the right of the driver.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. TOYOTA SIENNA I was disappointed with the Sienna when it made
its debut. Although it is a perfectly fine vehicle, it was just a
base hit _ I had expected Toyota to hit a home run. Still, the
Sienna's nearly bullet-proof quality gives it an edge, in my view,
over the Plymouth and the Chevy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smaller than the other tested vans, the Sienna has all the right
ergonomic pieces in place. And there are some nice touches, like
cargo nets on the side of the front seats for storing sunglasses
and wallets. Power is adequate, handling is agile and the ride is
quiet and smooth. The Sienna lacks side air bags and is available
with only one power door. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER I have always been a fan of Chrysler's
minivans _I used to own one _ and I've always recommended them
above all others. Chrysler still offers the most variety, with an
array of models and special packages, short wheelbase or long,
front drive or all-wheel drive, and three V6 engines.
</P>
<P>
   But the competition has moved ahead. Chrysler doesn't offer
power doors or side air bags. Its seats are awkward to remove. Its
brakes feel soft and its 3- and 3.3-liter engines are relatively
wimpy. Chrysler and Dodge (but not Plymouth) offer a more potent
3.8-liter engine; equipped that way, I'd raise my rating a notch. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. CHEVROLET VENTURE The Toyota, Plymouth and Chevy are all
close enough _ and all good enough _ that it seems a shame to rank
any van last. That said, I put the Venture at the bottom by a
narrow margin, although I consider it (and its GM stablemates from
Olds and Pontiac) a perfectly capable, acceptable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Its side air bags are a big plus. Its acceleration and handling,
especially with the sport suspension, are solid. The cargo net
between the front seats is clever.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is narrower, it does have slightly less interior room
than the others. Only one door can be power-operated. But my
biggest complaint is about the seats, a crucial matter for
long-trip vehicles. The raised, theater-style rear seats are ideal
for small passengers who want to see out, but they are miserable
for adults. In them, I felt as if my chin were resting on my knees.

 Employees Today Are More Apt to Switch Jobs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Jeff Stevenson's resume would have been tossed in the garbage by
most recruiters 20 years ago. With four different jobs in the space
of six years, he would have been viewed as an unreliable job
hopper.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stevenson's career is flourishing. He's moved in and
out of well-known firms such as Netscape and NetManage, garnering
stock along the way. And each one of his past employers has given
him a good reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed jobs every two years for the last six years, and
it's the best thing I've ever done,'' said Stevenson, 35, now
director of business development for INSoft, a division of
Sunnyvale's International Network Services that makes products to
help companies manage their software applications.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have completely changed the rules for how long
employees stay at their jobs _ and how long employers expect them
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Federal labor statistics show that workers in almost every age
group are staying at jobs for a shorter period of time than their
counterparts did in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 25- to 34-year-olds have held their current jobs
for a median of 2.7 years, down from 3 years in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Job mobility is even more pronounced in California, where a
1998 Field Poll estimated that nearly half of all workers have held
their current job for less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers reflect a sea change in people's attitudes about
their careers and changing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The days are gone when many people could expect to spend 40
years at a single company, moving steadily up the ladder and
retiring with a fat pension and gold watch.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more employees _ especially those under 30 _ view
themselves as ``free agents'' who must actively manage their own
careers.
</P>
<P>
   They realize their companies may lay them off at any moment if
there's a business slump or merger. They know their economic
survival depends on maintaining cutting-edge skills. And so they
don't feel a drop of guilt about jumping ship if another job offers
better pay or more growth opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Akre is an example of this change. Akre's father, Terry,
put in 37 years as a technician at AT&AMP;T, waking up at 5:30 a.m.
each day to be on the job by 7:30. Then he was laid off without any
warning.
</P>
<P>
   Akre, who was 18 at the time, vowed never to let that happen to
him. ``I said then and there, I'm going to `employ' my employers,''
Akre recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So Akre, a top-performing salesman, has worked for seven
employers since graduating from college in 1987. He's changed jobs
for a variety of reasons: sometimes for economic reasons or for
growth and challenge, sometimes because his company was taken over
by another firm.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the moves increased his pay by 10 to 40 percent. One
move even doubled it. Akre also managed to leave on good terms with
most of his employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of my interviews, the topic of `job hopping' comes
up,'' said Akre. ``You have to explain to people that you're more
diversified, wise, and agile than if you'd stayed at one job.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers today are becoming more used to applicants with
histories like Akre's.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many recruiters now view long tenure at one job as
skeptically as they used to view job hopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be an honor badge to have worked 23 years at IBM,''
said John Wilson, an executive recruiter with Korn/Ferry
International in San Francisco. ``It's changed to the point where
recruiters now really scrutinize the background and wisdom of a
person who's done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, you have to wonder as a recruiter: `Why was that
person so happy there for so long'?'' Wilson said. ```Were they
challenged by a lot of different roles? Or were they just so
comfortable that they stayed and stayed and stayed?'''
</P>
<P>
   Job hopping is more common and accepted in the high-tech world
than in other industries. That's because the tight high-tech labor
market, fast pace of technological change and lure of startups with
potentially lucrative stock options all create an incentive for
skilled workers to move around a lot.
</P>
<P>
   But more traditional industries are also seeing people change
jobs more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that 10 to 15 years at a job was considered good
stability,'' said Rick Pflugradt of ProTemps Professional
Personnel, an Oakland placement firm that specializes in the
insurance industry. ``Now, it's not uncommon for people to move
around from year to year.''
</P>
<P>
   Career experts say that today's trend of shorter job tenure has
its roots in the downsizing wave of the late 1980s and early 1990s,
which shattered many people's expectations of lifetime employment.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors have contributed as well:
</P>
<P>
   _The current strong economy makes workers more confident that if
a job change doesn't work out, they can find something else.
</P>
<P>
   _Many firms have replaced traditional pension plans with more
portable 401(k) retirement plans, reducing some of the financial
risk of frequent job changes.
</P>
<P>
   _The Internet _ with hundreds of job listings just a keystroke
away _ makes it easier than ever before to find out about other job
options.
</P>
<P>
   _The executive recruiter industry has also mushroomed in recent
years, so professional-level employees are more likely than before
to have someone dangling attractive new jobs in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that every single person here, regardless of their
function, has been called by a recruiter,'' said Susan Keck Truman,
director of recruitment marketing for Nortel Networks in Santa
Clara.
</P>
<P>
   For employers, job hopping can be costly and frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel experts estimate that every departing employee costs a
company 1.5 times his or her salary _ a combination of recruiting
costs, training time and lost productivity as co-workers and
supervisors pitch in during the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're really looking at a very limited window of
productivity,'' said B. Lynn Ware, an employee retention expert
with Integral Training Systems in Half Moon Bay. ``Let's say
someone stays with an organization for 2.5 years. It takes them the
first year and a half to really get up to speed. Then they spend
their last three to six months looking for the next thing. That
leaves about a half-year of real productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employers try to hold on to departing employees with
counteroffers of raises. But frequently that kind of response comes
too late. Personnel experts say the best way to retain skilled
workers is to continually check that salaries are competitive and
make sure individual employees feel challenged and appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, job hopping also levies subtle costs on employees _
both those who move and those who stay.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Gerstman worked at a search engine firm with such rapid
turnover that, after a year and a half there, he was viewed as an
old-timer.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstman, 28, found the rapid turnover discouraged friendships
at work. ```Why get close,' I thought,'' he said. ``He or she will
probably be leaving soon anyway, or perhaps I will.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnover also demoralized employees who stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody would quit, most of us felt a sense of, `What am
I wasting my time here for? I should be making more money and doing
more self-realizing work,''' said Gerstman, who ultimately left
that company. ``Even if our jobs weren't dead-end jobs, nobody
recognized that. Everyone felt as if we weren't going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's new environment, how short is too short to stay at a
job?
</P>
<P>
   The answer varies among industries and professions.
</P>
<P>
   Pflugradt, the insurance industry recruiter, gets leery if
applicants put in less than a year at a job. ``A red flag goes up,
and you think that either the employee made a bad decision or their
skills weren't quite meeting expectations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other recruiters focus less on length of employment than on
whether an applicant finished the project for which he or she was
hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two to three years used to raise a red flag,'' said Ware.
``Now, depending on the industry, it's one to 1.5 years. But what
employers are really looking at is, did the person complete the
project or commitment that they made?''
</P>
<P>
   Soma Pullela, head of marketing for a San Francisco commercial
real estate firm, has held four jobs in the past year _ much more
job hopping than most career experts would recommend.
</P>
<P>
   But Pullela, 23, had good reasons for each move and employers
didn't hold the changes against him. Over the course of the year,
he managed to triple his salary.
</P>
<P>
   Pullela is like many other workers under 30 in that he never
even considered the possibility of staying at one job for his
entire life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I pictured myself staying at companies three or four
years, maybe five,'' he said. ``That's definitely longer than what
it's actually been. But there's no way I'd be where I am now if I
hadn't done some job jumping.''

 Glitch Hits Wells Customers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Wells Fargo Bank said yesterday its fast-growing online bill
payment service has repeatedly crashed since Monday in a systems
breakdown that is similar to the woes that recently have plagued
the electronic brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Wells Fargo, the nation's largest online bank,
said as many as 150,000 customers who use Intuit's Quicken or
Microsoft's Money software to pay bills from their bank accounts
haven't been able to get through. The bank said it did not know
when it could restore service.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Wells Fargo's 860,000 online customers pay bills
directly through the bank's Internet site and haven't been
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The bank blamed the breakdown on a software glitch at CheckFree,
the Georgia company that processes bill payments made through
Quicken and Money.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree described the breakdown as ``intermittent'' and said
it affected customers of as many as 21 banks nationwide which use
Genesis, the company's most-advanced transaction processing system.
</P>
<P>
   The company traced the problem to a software bug that created a
bottleneck at the point that consumers enter Genesis from Quicken
or Money, spokeswoman Laurinda Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is testing new software code to fix the problem but
it doesn't know when the system will be operating again, Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten our customers to rely on the availability of
these systems,'' said Catherine Graeber, Wells Fargo's marketing
manager for online financial services. ``This isn't acceptable to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it is waiving April Internet banking fees, which
are as high as $8 a month, for Quicken and Money bill-payment
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Leading online brokerages, including Charles Schwab and E-Trade,
have suffered repeated failures of their electronic stock trading
systems as surges in demand have swamped their computer capacity.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, online banking has grown at at a slower, more
manageable pace, and service breakdowns have been less common. Bank
customers go online to monitor their accounts, pay bills, transfer
funds and apply for loans.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken and Money customers click on a button in their money
management software that automatically connects with CheckFree
computers to pay bills from their accounts at any of more than a
dozen banks nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, Quicken customers who bank at Wells Fargo said
they repeatedly got messages saying Intuit was unable to complete
the connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time understanding how a computer network could
be down for so long,'' said David Schnapf, a San Francisco
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Schnapf said Wells Fargo representatives couldn't explain the
breakdown or estimate when service would be restored. ``I'm
frustrated by the lack of information,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the episode shows how banks and other companies
that deal directly with customers are vulnerable to errors made by
third-party vendors, such as CheckFree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems are out of the bank's control,'' said Chris
Musto, an Internet banking analyst at Gomez Advisors in
Massachusetts. ``But to the customer, whether or not the bank
outsources is irrelevant.''

 Column: Preventing Violence In the Workplace
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Some of the recent news stories about mass shootings
have gotten me thinking about workplace violence. I'd like to get
some training for my company in how to prevent and handle workplace
violence. Where could I find such resources?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Workplace violence is a serious problem: The federal
government estimates that 20 people are murdered and 18,000
assaulted at work  &LR; every week. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But the most common media image of workplace violence _ the
crazed employee who goes on a shooting spree in his office _ is
quite uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Most workplace violence involves less dramatic scenarios such as
robberies at convenience stores, gas stations and restaurants, or
one-on-one altercations between employees.
</P>
<P>
   The single highest homicide rate is found among taxi drivers,
who run the risk of robbery daily but get little media coverage
when they're victimized.
</P>
<P>
   How to forestall workplace violence? Rebecca Speer, a San
Francisco employment lawyer who specializes in workplace violence
prevention, suggests the following steps:
</P>
<P>
   _Adopt clear personnel policies prohibiting violence and threats
of violence, and requiring employees to report such incidents to
company officials.
</P>
<P>
   _Choose certain managers to receive and resolve complaints about
violence. This could be an interdisciplinary team including people
from human resources, the legal department and operations.
</P>
<P>
   _Provide employee training so people understand these policies.
</P>
<P>
   _Establish security practices that are appropriate for your type
of business.
</P>
<P>
   The California Occupational Safety &AMP; Health Administration
offers a useful guide to preventing workplace violence at
 &LR; www.dir.ca.gov/dir/OS&AMP;H/DOSH &LR; 
 &LR; /dosh(UNDERSCORE)publications/worksecurity.html.  &LR; Federal
officials offer similar materials at &LR;  www.osha-slc.gov &LR; 
 &LR; /SLTC/workplaceviolence &LR;   &LR; /index.html &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   And the Santa Clara County Committee on Workplace Violence
offers a helpful guide at  &LR; www.growing.com/nonviolent &LR; 
 &LR; /protocol/wv(UNDERSCORE)pgce.htm. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Also check out a free workshop in San Francisco on May 11 called
``Preventing Violence in the Workplace: A Workshop om the Needs of
Small and Mid-sized Employers.'' The workshop will be at the Main
Public Library from 9 to 11 a.m. For more information, call (415)
433-2062.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of consultants now offer workplace violence
prevention help. You could call your local chapter of the Society
for Human Resource Management for names of some in your area. In
the Bay Area, contact the Northern California Human Resource
Association at (415) 291-1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a challenge to find professionals who can address
all the different aspects of the problem _ the legal, security and
human resource aspects,'' Speer said. ``You might need to shop
around a bit to find someone who is sensitive to the fact this
requires an interdisciplinary approach.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Union Dues
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a new part-time job and just discovered that the
company deducted money from my first paycheck for union dues. The
employment ad in the newspaper never said that union membership was
required as a condition of employment, and the company never said
anything about that in my job interview either. I fully recognize
the value of unions, but is forced membership like this legal? What
can I do?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Some states, known as ``right-to-work'' states, say it's
illegal to make union membership a condition of employment. But
California isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   In California, it is legal to have what is called a ``union
shop,'' in which you must be a union member or pay a fee to the
union to be employed. And there's no law requiring companies to
disclose information about union representation to job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what private-sector companies and unions are required to
do, according to Rob Remar, a labor lawyer with Leonard Carder
Nathan Zuckerman Ross Chin &AMP; Remar in San Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   _Unions must inform new employees of their obligation to pay
membership dues or _ if they don't want to become a member _ their
obligation to pay the portion of dues that is used to negotiate or
implement their contract. That portion is often called the ``Beck
amount,'' after a landmark court case on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   _Companies must get written consent from individual employees
before union dues are automatically withheld from their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that both your employer and the union did these
things, but you didn't notice because you were so busy wading
through all the other new-hire paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible that they didn't notify you _ a mess-up that
would violate the National Labor Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
   What should you do? First, decide whether you want to be a
full-fledged union member or a nonmember who pays the Beck amount.
Being a nonmember won't save you much money. That's because most of
your dues goes to things like negotiating contracts and handling
grievances _ things you'd have to pay for even as a nonmember. Only
a small portion _ 5 to 25 percent, depending on the particular
union _ goes to noncontract-related purposes like political
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to be a member, write a letter to the union
saying you only want to pay the Beck amount.
</P>
<P>
   If you do want to be a member, you don't have to do anything:
You apparently are signed up already.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want union dues withheld from your paycheck, let
the company know. But be aware that you'll still be required to pay
dues or a Beck fee _ you'll just have to do it yourself by check
rather than by withholding.
</P>

A MINEFIELD IS CROSSED, AT A SAD COST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ When they came upon the minefield in the
rugged mountains near the border, the 64 Kosovo Albanian refugees
were warned to stay in single file and not stray from the narrow
path or stumble on a branch or rock in the predawn gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty people trod through the mud without a problem, and that
is perhaps what made the tired old farmer, Osman Jezerci, less
wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osman, don't go so far over there,'' someone called out to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Jezerci looked over his shoulder, possibly to see who was
speaking. And that is when he drifted a few more feet to the left,
those near him said. The explosion lifted his body off his legs.
The man beside him died, too. So did a young woman, Selvete Kukaj.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of the blast on Wednesday, two others died from
their wounds. These two _ a 12-year-old girl named Zyjnete Avdiu
and an 18-year-old woman, Miradije Kukaj _ were buried here
Thursday in a solemn ceremony attended by a large crowd of people
who did not know them.
</P>
<P>
   This has become the habit in Blace, a Macedonian border village
of 100 homes. In the last five weeks, since NATO began bombing and
throngs of Kosovo Albanians started fleeing, people from here have
laid 12 strangers to rest in their cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Liman Jashari, the village hohxa, or holy man, said the ritual
Muslim prayers in Arabic and then switched to Albanian to soothe
the mourners at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before us, we see two bodies,'' he said. ``It is fate that
they died close to our homes before proceeding to heaven. We must
remember that everything that comes before us is the will of God.''
</P>
<P>
   He surely believed this, though it did not stop him from weeping
as the bodies were taken from coffins and laid into the earth. The
two young women wore white sheets as they were lowered into the
ground. Their heads were placed on pillows of sod.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, Macedonia awakens to a new tale of refugee misery as
if this part of the world were keen to outdo itself with
affliction. The day before, a 10-year-old boy, near death with a
bullet wound and two open leg fractures, had been brought across
the border in a wheelbarrow. Then came the horror of a minefield on
a moonlit night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear made us leave our homes, fear of the Serbs,'' said
Ibrahim Avdiu, 39, Zyjnete's father. ``My whole life has been
turned upside down with fear.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As with most stories told by the ethnic Albanian refugees,
Avdiu's starts with being ordered by Serbs to leave Kosovo. His
family's home was in Kacenik, a small city only 10 miles from
Macedonia. Fighting has been fierce there between Serbian forces
and the rebels of the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army. Some put
the death toll at more than 100 in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Avdiu, a day laborer, took his wife and four children to the
nearby village of Llanishte. From there, they could see some
goings-on through binoculars. Bulldozers, he said, were pushing
bodies into mass graves. He and hundreds of others plotted their
escapes.
</P>
<P>
   People set out for the border in various groups. The journey,
while short, was hard. The welcome cover of darkness was
accompanied by the unwelcome distress of frost. Gullies had to be
crossed, rocks had to be climbed. Very early on Wednesday, Avdiu
led a horse through the heavily wooded terrain. Clutching the
saddle was his invalid mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The group had accepted guidance from six members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. These were the men who cautioned them about the
minefield and pointed the way up the narrow path.
</P>
<P>
   When the mine exploded, the blast shook the ground and turned
dirt and stones into projectiles. People were wailing, unsure
whether to run or stand still. They wiped their faces with their
hands and smelled their fingers, trying to determine if the wetness
was sweat or blood.
</P>
<P>
   Arsim Kukaj, 20, was the only son in a family with five
daughters. Two of his sisters had been walking at his side, trying
to protect the sole male heir by standing in the sight line of any
snipers the family might encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sisters were afraid I would be shot, but instead of getting
in the way of a bullet they died because of the shrapnel,'' he
said, bereft, unable to say much more.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Avdiu's wife and sister were injured. As he tended to
them, he said, he could hear 12-year-old Zyjnete, his oldest child,
crying out, ``Daddy, I'm dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Avdiu's younger brother, Izet Asutiqi, scooped the girl up and
draped her over his back. He began running. ``I did not know where
I was going, but I just started down a road and hoped it would lead
to somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He carried her for two hours, though she was dead long before
that, he said. His shoulders and back ached from the weight.
Finally, he put her on the ground and looked for landmarks to
remember. He continued down the road.
</P>
<P>
   In Blace, Asutiqi staggered into a small grocery. He drew a map
on the ground with a stick. Villagers then risked Macedonian border
guards and Serb troops to search for the body across the border.
They carried both dead girls up and down the trails in shifts. They
did not chance more time to locate the other dead.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, the hoxha did the ritual cleaning of the
bodies. The girls' bloody clothes were replaced by the white
sheets. The village men prayed in the mosque and then passed the
coffins hand to hand down a road and then up a hill to the
cemetery. Three mules grazed among the tombstones as the mourners
went past in the early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the ground, the bodies were covered with wood planks and
then dirt. With six men at work with spades, it took less than two
minutes to fill the graves.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the dead, only men attended the ceremony, as is the
custom. But as the funeral ended, one of Miradije Kukah's older
sisters wandered in a daze toward the mound. She collapsed and
kissed the dirt, laying her cheek against the grave as if listening
for a pulse. When men lifted her up, she searched about for
flowers, but found only a single violet blossom. It was wilted and
she threw it down in despair and bawled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't cry,'' people said, attempting comfort. ``Crying will
not awaken your sister.''
</P>
<P>
   As the villagers of Blace returned to their homes, several
pointed to smoke not too far off in the mountains. The Serbs had
set fire to the village of Gorance, the hoxha said, just as they
had set a place called Rozhance ablaze the day before.
</P>
<P>
   More refugees would soon be coming through the mountains.

 Toy Sellers' Internet Battle May Be Bloody
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The quest for toy-selling supremacy on the Internet is going to be
a battle royal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Amazon.com's one-sided massacre of bookseller
Barnesandnoble.com, the fight between fledgling eToys and
traditional category-killer Toys R Us is going to be a bloody war.
</P>
<P>
   Etoys may possibly rise to victory over time, but by no means is
it going to be a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Santa Monica e-tailer _ which managed to rack up
sales of only $578,000 for fiscal year 1998 _ has many fans, who
liken its impressive business model and crisp execution to that of
Amazon during its startup years.
</P>
<P>
   But Toys R Us, which is the wounded brick-and-mortar heavyweight
of toy retailing with about 1,500 stores and $11 billion in 1998
sales, still boasts many traditional strengths that should give
eToys fits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, earlier this week, Toys R Us revealed its revamped
strategy for the Internet, which included the acquisition of a $30
million Memphis distribution warehouse. That was a smart first
step, given that overnight shipper Federal Express makes its hub
there. Williams-Sonoma, for example, and other direct-merchandisers
have located their distribution operations in Elvis-town for that
precise reason.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger, and more important, news was that Benchmark
Capital reportedly invested $10 million in the online unit.
Benchmark is a Menlo Park venture capital firm that slugged a grand
slam with its backing of Internet superstar eBay, the San Jose
online auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to First Albany Internet analyst Ullas Naik,
Benchmark's money and expertise gives the Toys R Us online unit
immediate credibility. ``That's one of the things that makes them
more of a threat than Barnes and Noble was to Amazon,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Benchmark ``is going to make sure that the whole Toys R Us
Internet initiative will run on Internet time, while Barnes and
Noble (launched its Net operations) on brick-and-mortar time.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, one of the biggest disadvantages that Barnes and
Noble faces is Amazon's huge head start. The bookselling giant
dragged its feet, and it has cost them dearly. ``Amazon has left
Barnes and Noble in the dust,'' Naik says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Toys R Us is certainly behind eToys in Net brand and
site development _ it has been operating for less than two years _
but the traditional retailer hasn't spotted its online nemesis an
insurmountable lead, Naik says.
</P>
<P>
   It seems reasonable to assume that Benchmark would not be
betting on the New Jersey toy retailer if the venture capital
firm's partners thought that Toys R Us could not catch up to eToys,
Naik says. Calls to Benchmark were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Benchmark) has its act together,'' Naik says
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Toys R Us has been given a bit of reprieve because
eToys' much-anticipated initial public offering has been delayed by
its acquisition of San Francisco's BabyCenter.
</P>
<P>
   IPOs are critical branding opportunities that introduce
little-known e-tailers to the masses. EBay's notoriety exploded
after its stock started to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   So, for now at least, Toys R Us is still the dominant brand name
in toys and it has a chance of remaining so if its new online
venture proves to be a worthy adversary of eToys, says Neil Stern,
a retail consultant with McMillan/Doolittle, a retail consultancy
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The huge edge they have over eToys is in name recognition and
vendor relationships. They are  &LR; the  &LR; category-killer toy store,''
Stern reminds. And those long-standing relationships with
toy-makers should still give Toys R Us the inside track for getting
``hot'' new toys first.
</P>
<P>
   By setting up a stand-alone subsidiary in Silicon Valley, Toys R
Us has taken an ``interesting and different path'' to avoid
conflict with its core brick-and-mortar stores, Stern says.
</P>
<P>
   It's better to let the ``virtual guys'' start from scratch as
opposed to having the ``brick-and-mortar guys'' try to figure out
the Web. But creating a separate operation also presents some
sticky issues, such as how you make sure that pricing and return
policies between both operations mesh and don't create confusion
for customers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, even if Toys R Us' online venture is a success, how
much of those sales will come out of the hide of its own
traditional business, Stern questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Still), I assume many of these challenges are manageable,''
he adds.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a big fan of traditional retailers. And in my mind, many of
them are brilliant and are capable of integrating their businesses
with the Web (If they act quickly enough).
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Toys R Us would qualify. It was a top-notch
mass-retailer. But the mighty has fallen. And if they can't excel
anymore at what they do best, how are they going to figure out the
Net?
</P>
<P>
   ``Toys R Us is an extremely screwed up retailer,'' Stern says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have, over the past six to seven years, just taken their
eye off of the ball and let their store execution really suffer,
their customer service suffer and have gotten sloppy on pricing,''
Stern says.
</P>
<P>
   His criticism doesn't end there. Stern also chastises Toys R Us
for not keeping pace with customer demands for computer-oriented
and educational toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went from being the absolute dominant market share
player'' in toys to second place behind Wal-Mart, Stern says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every way possible, they've been asleep at the switch,'' he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, how did you like the play Mrs. Lincoln?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stern thinks that Toys R Us has let its once laudable
franchise go to pot. But he doesn't dismiss its chances with
Benchmark's involvement. ``They still have a lot going for them,''
Stern concedes.
</P>
<P>
   But eToys may still have too much high-tech weaponry for the
old-line toy seller. ``Etoys has a very classy, very well done Web
site,'' Stern says. ``It's going to be an interesting battle.''
</P>
<P>
   One that has the makings of a 15 rounder.
</P>

 &UR; STREET SMART CLASSIC: &LR;  In light of McKesson blowing up this week,
Street Smarts goes back into the archives to resurrect a prescient
nugget from a November 17 column:
</P>
<P>
   ``HBO's immediate future is about as clear as summer in the
Sunset District. The Atlanta software-maker is slated to be
acquired by McKesson, but the ill-timed departure of HBO's chief
financial officer and co-president, Jay Gilbertson, casts a dark

York hedge fund manager. ... `Wall Street has been skeptical of
this deal for sometime, and now it has even more reason to be
leery.'''
</P>
<P>
   Boy did it ever. McKesson restated its quarterly earnings on

TRIBUNAL CHIEF PLANS TO QUIT, ALARMING U.S. OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief prosecutor of the international war
crimes tribunal is planning to leave her post, a move that
officials worry will weaken the tribunal at a time when the Clinton
administration is looking to the court to prosecute atrocities
committed to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the prosecutor, Louise Arbour, discussed her
possible departure during meetings with senior administration
officials, where the major item on the agenda was the possibility
of an indictment against the Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
officials said. Mrs. Arbour is seeking more information about
potential war crimes from the Americans, while administration
officials say she has enough evidence to indict the Serb leader.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they have criticized Mrs. Arbour for not
aggressively pursuing Milosevic, the Clinton administration and
human rights organizations are now alarmed that she may leave. She
is the top candidate for a seat on the Canadian Supreme Court,
which becomes open this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to create disruption in the tribunal,'' said
Michael Posner, director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights,
a private organization in New York. ``It's going to slow down the
indictments, and it's going to send exactly the wrong message to
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arbour's four-year term does not expire until next year,
and her departure now would leave the tribunal leaderless, and set
off a polarizing fight over her successor. The chief prosecutor
must be approved by the U.N. Security Council, which means that
Russia and China _ the two council nations with the strongest
objections to the NATO bombing of Serbia _ can veto anyone they
consider unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like what she's done, but I don't think we'll do
better,'' said an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Russia would almost certainly not approve of someone from a NATO
country, or anyone who would be overly aggressive in pursuing
Serbian military officers, above all Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arbour's predecessor, and the tribunal's first prosecutor,
Richard Goldstone, a South African jurist, won the support of
Russia after he was endorsed by President Nelson Mandela. When he
stepped down, Goldstone recommended Mrs. Arbour as his successor,
and her nomination was approved at a time when the court had not
been thrust into the middle of a war involving NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, an intense internal battle has erupted over the
naming of Mrs. Arbour, 52, to the Supreme Court. She is considered
to be eminently qualified, and the fact that she is a
French-speaking woman from Ontario makes her an attractive
candidate for Prime Minister Jean Chretien to appoint. But the
Foreign Ministry has been urging Chretien to keep Mrs. Arbour in
her tribunal post, because of the high visibility it gives to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has so far stayed out of the fray,
out of concerns for Canada's sensitivities to interference from its
neighbor, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon Thursday, some American officials tried to
persuade Mrs. Arbour to remain as the tribunal's chief prosecutor,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials trying to influence Mrs. Arbour's decision are a
bit ambivalent, however, the officials said, because they think
that Mrs. Arbour has not done as much as she could and above all,
has not indicted Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   A cautious jurist by nature, Mrs. Arbour has been reluctant to
indict anyone without an air-tight case. A more aggressive
prosecutor _ in the mold of New York Mayor and former prosecutor
Rudolph Giuliani, for example, several human rights lawyers
suggested _ would have long ago brought a case against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Her cautious nature has been reinforced by her chief adviser on
international humanitarian law, William Fenrick. He is a Canadian
military officer, and is very hard to convince on so-called command
and control cases, several former tribunal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Milosevic did not carry out any of the atrocities himself,
he can be convicted of a war crime only if it is established that
he exercised ``command and control'' over the units that did commit
them.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arbour wants the United States government to provide more
information about Milosevic's role in the campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   American officials respond that there is enough in the public
record to indict Milosevic, and that that has been supplemented by
information from the United States government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given her more than enough information to indict him,''
an American official said Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But an outside analyst, experienced in gathering evidence of war
crimes, said that the officials in the U.S. government who are
combing through the files for evidence of Milosevic's culpability
did not have the expertise needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not need the most sophisticated intelligence
gathering,'' said Jon Western, who was a Bosnia war-crime's analyst
in the State Department in 1992 and 1993, and is now a scholar at
the U.S. Institute of Peace. What is needed, he said, is an
understanding of the Balkans and especially knowledge about the
structure of the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are good, smart, dedicated people,'' Western said about
the war-crimes analysts now gathering information on Milosevic and
other Serb commanders. ``But they don't have any military
intelligence background.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all what is needed, Western said, is the ``commitment from
the president himself, and that has not been forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the administration, there are strong advocates for
indicting Milosevic, while others argue that an indictment would
not be a good idea, because it might be necessary to negotiate with
him to end the war. For that reason, some NATO allies are also
opposed to seeing him indicted, a NATO official said Thursday.

WHAT HAS SPRING SPRUNG AT USC?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The defense lost Chris Claiborne. The offense has
the quarterback of the future entrenched for as long as he wants to
play college football.
</P>
<P>
   Those were givens of USC spring football practice, which
concluded last week. The real question on everyone's mind, though,
is whether the Trojans will be any better than last year's 8-5
team.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a full month of spring practices, it's too soon to
tell exactly where USC will end up during coach Paul Hackett's
second season. Just ask the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's really hard to say,'' strong safety David
Gibson said. ``In the spring, there's so many injuries. The
attitude around the locker room is, ``Hey, it's time do something.'
We've done a lot of talking, but it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at how USC emerged from spring drills
position-by-position:
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback: Carson Palmer enjoyed his first spring as the No.1
quarterback. Junior Mike Van Raaphorst was very smooth, although
some teammates still wonder whether nerves contributed to his
nausea before and during games last season. The only problem will
occur if both were somehow injured, and John Fox would be pressed
into emergency duty.
</P>
<P>
   Running back: Chad Morton remains the Trojans' top tailback, but
there should be a lot more depth this season. Malaefou MacKenzie is
returning from a knee injury and will play tailback, probably in
split-back formations.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise was freshman Sultan McCullough, who had 99 yards in
a scrimmage before being ruled academically ineligible. He has the
best breakaway speed of any of the backs.
</P>
<P>
   A potential worry is fullback, where unproven Brennan Ochs, Chad
Pierson and Charlie Landrigan are the only candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers: R. Jay Soward finally showed up and was his usual
self. Senior Windrell Hayes emerged with a strong spring, but after
that, there isn't much experienced help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exciting thing is that we have four young people coming
in, Marcell Allmond, Steve Stevenson, Kareem Kelly and Craig
Mitchell. They are going to be the wide receiver corps,'' Hackett
said. ``Seeing us in four wides early will be a real shock. I can't
imagine us playing a lot of receivers until we get some time for
the young guys to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line: The big news was the amount of shuffling that
took place during practices. Right guard Travis Claridge, who will
be an Athlon preseason All-American, spent a considerable amount of
time at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   That gave freshman Zach Wilson time at right guard. Whether this
will continue in the fall remains to be seen. The other change was
senior Donta Kendrick moving ahead of Jason Grain at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem here is depth,'' Hackett said. ``We're not where
we need to be or expect to be in the offensive line, but I think
the spring has shown clear-cut improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line: This position has undergone the greatest change
in the spring. Sultan Abdul-Malik moved to linebacker, and tight
end Lonnie Ford is now a defensive end. The Trojans also have
worked Kansas State transfer Matt Childers into the rotation. Ennis
Davis missed spring practice with a knee injury, but is another
Athlon preseason All-American and is expected to be ready in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you talk about rebuilding (the defense), you
start with the defensive line,'' Hackett said. ``We've got
competition there and that will be a strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers: Mike Pollard's knee injury and Abdul-Malik's switch
to the line make depth a question here. There is much anticipation
about Markus Steele, but it's probably asking a lot for a JC
transfer to make a major impact his first year.
</P>
<P>
   Zeke Moreno will anchor the middle, with Abdul-Malik appearing
to make a nice transition to outside linebacker. Darryl Knight was
starting in the spot Steele will supposedly play, although
converted fullback Henry Wallace was another surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs: Another area of flux as Gibson moved to strong
safety and the Trojans searched for a replacement for Daylon
McCutcheon. Kris Richard won the job in spring, but there's
expected to be battle in the fall with incoming freshman Darrell
Rideaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell, goodness gracious,'' Hackett said. ``You bring in a
guy that's going to compete right away. He's not a big guy and they
played him at cornerback and safety (at Long Beach Poly). The
ground he can cover at safety and the way he can cover the field is
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialists: Kicker Adam Abrams is gone, which isn't necessarily
a bad thing, except USC has no experience at the position. David
Bell was the only kicker in spring, but JC transfer David Newbury
is expected to win the job in training camp. Mike MacGillivray
returns at punter.
</P>
<P>
   Soward and Morton will return kickoffs and punts, so this will
be considered a strength next season.

CAMBODIA GAINS FULL STATUS IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Starting Friday, Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen will finally have a chance to show off his golf game. He
will be invited to sing karaoke, too.
</P>
<P>
   With these badges of club membership, he will confirm his
nation's coming of age as the final member of the pre-eminent
political and economic group in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN,
will achieve a decades-old dream Friday with the induction of the
10th regional nation, Cambodia, at a ceremony in Hanoi. The event
will cap the emergence of Cambodia over the last year from three
decades of warfare and international exile, with the collapse of
the communist Khmer Rouge insurgency and the resolution of
long-running civil-war rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   But the occasion will also highlight an identity crisis in the
group, which has been accused of irrelevance as the region
struggles with political, economic and environmental crises that
the association was unable to deal with as a body.
</P>
<P>
   The ASEAN expansion in recent years from six to 10 members has
led to re-examinations of its character and culture, with fears of
new divisions between the older haves and the newer have-nots and
between the more democratic and the more autocratic governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is cause for concern in ASEAN, because it is virtually
dead,'' said Alex Magno, a professor of political science at the
University of the Philippines. ``It is still operating like a tea
party, keeping to the safe points and waiting for a consensus based
on the least common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   An ASEAN expert at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in
Singapore, Daljit Singh, disagreed, saying the economic crisis,
with its mix of internal and external causes, was not one that the
association could properly address. Singh said that the crisis had
worsened frictions among neighbors, but that after the crisis had
passed the group could return to its basic focus of free trade,
regional cooperation and the building of a relationship with
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The autocrats who shaped the organization in recent years and
gave it its character are gone or weakened. They include Suharto of
Indonesia, Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, Ferdinand Marcos of the
Philippines and Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia. ``The old world has
crumbled, and the new one has not yet been born,'' Magno said.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion from the original five members will strain the
ASEAN culture of consensus decision making, said Hadi Soesastro, a
political scientist at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ASEAN leaders try to force everything to be agreed upon
by all 10 members, that could be a problem,'' Soesastro said.
``They should be willing to accept that you can have a two-tier
ASEAN in different areas of cooperation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The possibility of such a division demonstrates the degree to
which ASEAN has shifted its focus. Throughout much of its life, the
group has achieved its cohesion as a bulwark against communism,
principally Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vietnam, which joined in 1995, could emerge as the leader of
the newer second-tier grouping, which would include not only
Cambodia, but also communist Laos and authoritarian Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   The older ASEAN members are Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei.
</P>
<P>
   The admission of Myanmar, formerly Burma, in 1997 was a turning
point. The stubbornness of its military junta in resisting
democratic reforms displayed the weakness of ASEAN's belief in
behind-the-scenes diplomacy. And the problem badly damaged the
group's relations with the European Union, which refused to include
Myanmar in joint meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia was barred from admission then because of a coup by Hun
Sen. Now Cambodia's voice will carry equal weight with those of its
fellow members, a giant step up from its position as international
pariah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there is going to be influence going both ways,'' said
Kao Kim Hourn, who heads the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation
and Peace, a private policy institute. ``The old members will
influence us on how to socialize, to engage with each other and to
build consensus. But the new members will influence them, as
well.''

   NASDAQ AND S&AMP;P SLIDE; DOW NOTCHES ANOTHER HIGH
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq stocks slumped for the third straight session as
investors took profits in high-technology shares, casting a further
pall over the market in general.
</P>
<P>
   Some money was redeployed into issues sensitive to the business
cycle, helping push the Dow Jones industrial average up 32.93
points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 10,878.38, its fifth
record in seven sessions. The Nasdaq composite index fell 21.93
points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 2,528.44, while the
Standard and Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.08 points, or six-tenths
of a percent, to 1,342.83.

   DIRECT TALK FROM WOULD-BE WITNESS
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Dertouzos, the director of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's laboratory for computer science, was
asked to be a witness in the Microsoft antitrust trial by William
H. Gates, but he was quickly dropped from the company's witness
list after he was questioned by a government lawyer last fall. Yet
judging from his deposition testimony released this week, Dertouzos
had a lot to say and would have been a most unusual witness, blunt
and direct, with views not tailored to either side.

 UNDATED: it seriously.''

   In Richmond, Ill., a town of 450 near the Wisconsin border,
Police Chief Charles E. Weidner said a 17-year-old was suspended
from school, and might be expelled, for talking about making a pipe
bomb. ``Don't come to school on Monday, you're too pretty to die,''
the youth told a girl. As the story spread, the police received 10
calls about the boy, and a bomb squad swept through his school and
home, finding nothing harmful. ``The kid was very apologetic,'' the
chief said. ``I feel sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens of more serious threats in the Chicago area.
At a private school in suburban Oak Lawn, a 15-year-old was
arrested after telling two girls he was going to kill the principal
and a student and plant bombs in the school. He was arrested on a
juvenile misdemeanor charge. Rumors of a planned shooting led to
the cancellation of a pep rally at another school, in Carol Stream,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, N.Y., five 13-year-old boys, all eighth-graders who
were charged on Wednesday with conspiracy to blow up the McKinley
Junior High School, were released to their parents. The boys were
overheard discussing a bomb plot, and, after being turned in by a
fellow student, were found to be in possession of a bomb-making
manual, though no explosives were uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   But in Fairport, N.Y., near Rochester, the police said they
confiscated gunpowder, propane and bomb-making books at the home of
a 12-year-old sixth grader who they said had been plotting for some
time to blow up his middle school. The boy was suspended, but is
unlikely to face criminal charges because ``it isn't illegal for a
kid or an adult to possess any of the equipment or items he had,''
Police Chief Brian Page said.

GOVERNMENT LOOSENS STANDARDS ON TUNA DEEMED `DOLPHIN-SAFE' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision that has outraged many environmental groups, the
Commerce Department on Thursday announced that it was broadening
the definition of ``dolphin-safe'' tuna to include fish caught by a
method that was banned under a 1990 law.
</P>
<P>
   The method is used by fishermen from Mexico and Venezuela, among
other countries, and uses nets a mile wide to capture tuna in the
tropical waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean. Fishing boats using
the nets chase schools of dolphin and encircle them, since tuna
often swim just below the dolphins. The practice has been condemned
by animal-protection groups because they say that chasing the
dolphins separates mothers from infants and causes stress and
injuries. Proponents say dolphins usually wriggle free on their own
or with fishermen's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cruel, inhuman method, and to call it dolphin-safe is
just a government-sanctioned consumer fraud,'' said Nancy Blaney,
director of federal government affairs for the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which has joined with 85
environmental groups to protest the decision. Ms. Blaney and others
said pressure from Mexico, whose tuna has been banned since the law
went into effect, had influenced the change.
</P>
<P>
   Terry D. Garcia, the assistant secretary of commerce for oceans
and atmosphere, said the change was ``an interim finding'' and was
based on research that found little evidence that encirclement
fishing was harming three dolphin species that are considered
depleted _ the Northeastern offshore spotted dolphin, the coastal
spotted dolphin and the Eastern spinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this change in the definition, consumers can still be
confident they are purchasing dolphin-safe tuna,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   As for international pressure, he said, ``Certainly, the
Mexicans were anxious to see it lifted, but there was pressure from
all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   A provision in the International Dolphin Conservation Program
Act, which went into effect in 1997, requires the Commerce
Department to research the effects of encirclement fishing on
depleted species.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphin deaths have decreased from 133,000 in 1986 to 2,000 last
year, Garcia said. Using the Commerce Department's most recent
studies, he said, ``We cannot conclude that encirclement as a
method of fishing for tuna causes significant adverse impact on
these depleted stocks of dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   A final ruling will be made in 2002, after further research,
Garcia said.

CARLIN TO STEP DOWN AS STATE SCHOOL BOARD CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- James F. Carlin, the feisty businessman who chafed
with professors' unions in his drive for higher standards and
tighter budgets at the state's public colleges and universities,
said Thursday that he plans to resign as the state's top higher
education official.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci is trying to replace Carlin as chairman
of the Board of Higher Education with Charles D. Baker Jr., who was
the top financial officer in the Weld-Cellucci cabinet before
leaving the administration last fall to head one of the region's
largest medical practices.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin, who turns 59 Friday, suffered several small heart
attacks last summer. The attacks occurred in the midst of
responding to the stunning failure of the majority of state teacher
college graduates on a certification exam. But he said Thursday
that health was a small factor in his decision to leave his post.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin, a self-made millionaire, still oversees his insurance
and real estate companies from an office in Natick, serves on
several boards, and spends much of the year in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that three or four years is as long as people ought to
stay in state government,'' he said. ``When they are in longer,
they start to like it for reasons other than why they get started.
I got done pretty much of what I thought could get done. We put
together a list of 25 things when I started three and a half years
ago, 17 of them are done, four or five are almost done, and four or
five will never get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlin, a former transportation secretary who also oversaw the
receivership of scandal-plagued Chelsea in the early '90s, was one
of the ``Three Amigos,'' the hard-charging Democrats who Governor
William F. Weld brought in four years ago to shake up public
education in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Although John R. Silber, as head of the state board of
education, attracted the most headlines, Carlin and William M.
Bulger, the longtime state Senate president who became president of
the University of Massachusetts, have been credited with more
significant results.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin took over the state's public higher education system in
late 1995, on the heels of dramatic budget cuts and increases in
tuition. His board has cut tuition and student fees four years in a
row at the state colleges and UMass, giving Massachusetts the most
dramatic cuts in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Another Carlin proposal has made community college almost free
for most low-income and middle-class students. The board also
eliminated remedial education at the state colleges and UMass,
increased admissions standards across the board, and established
the Commonwealth College, an honors program to attract higher
caliber students to the Amherst UMass campus.
</P>
<P>
   With the Legislature, Carlin has worked to require state schools
to stick to tight accounting as a condition of receiving state aid,
and won significant increases in that aid. The board, under his
direction, has also eliminated 50 programs that were
undersubscribed or duplicated on state campuses.
</P>
<P>
   While Silber's board was mired in petty and often personal
disputes, Carlin's board meetings by comparison were run like a
well-oiled corporation. He insisted on efficiency from
institutions, as well. A letter demanding action from colleges
after 59 percent of prospective teachers failed a state
certification exam was classic Carlin: ``I do not want to get
involved in a six-month intellectual debate over `defining the
problem' or preparing `a thoughtful, deliberate process of
establishing a dialogue pointing toward a solution,' '' he wrote,
`` . . . or whether `education school graduates are poorly prepared
because their mothers didn't love them or they weren't chosen to be
a cheerleader in junior high school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But his businesslike approach earned him the ire of professors,
especially at the state colleges, who blasted what they saw as his
lack of understanding of the academy and its traditions. They
worried that his plans to reduce tenure would destabilize their
institutions, and that raising standards would cut off access to
disadvantaged students.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Chronicle of Higher Education after a glowing
1997 profile of Carlin, Northeastern history professor Harvey Green
called Carlin ``a skilled demagogue,'' who was encouraging strains
of anti-intellectualism in the United States. ``Clothing himself in
the garb of Everyman, he is, in fact, an enemy of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlin had taken a hands-on approach in the early years of his
post, acting as lead negotiator with the professors unions. But in
the past nine months, he had scaled back his involvement.
</P>
<P>
   He said he considered leaving his post last fall, but stayed on
to deal with the crisis over teacher training, and to shepherd
another reduction in tuition and increase in admissions standards
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said Thursday only that he was ``considering'' the job. He
has yet to talk to the board of his employer, Harvard Vanguard
Medical Associates, about taking on another responsibility.
Cellucci recently appointed him to the state board of education,
and Baker would probably have to give up that post to take on
higher education. Baker, 42, also serves on the Massachusetts
Convention Center Authority board.
</P>
<P>
   As a replacement, Baker is not likely to comfort any of Carlin's
critics. The two cut a similar profile. In state office, Baker
earned a reputation as a blunt-spoken cost-conscious manager,
closing several state hospitals, and overseeing the Department of
Social Services amid one of its worst foster child scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Of Baker, Carlin said, ``Charlie will be spectacular.''

 Pressured McKesson Circles the Wagons
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With its stock sinking and shareholder lawsuits growing,
McKesson HBOC Inc. remained tight-lipped yesterday about where to
place the blame for the accounting screwup that has cost the
company half its market value.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the San Francisco drug wholesaler and hospital
software vendor slipped an additional $1.25 to close at $33.25
yesterday on the heels of Wednesday's precipitous $31.25 decline.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day drop was triggered by McKessonHBOC's announcement on
Wednesday that it had prematurely booked $42.2 million in sales
made by its newly acquired HBOC software division.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a 15-minute conference call with financial analysts
Wednesday _ during which questions were not allowed _ neither chief
executive Mark Pulido nor Chairman Charles McCall has dealt with
the key question in this accounting debacle: Did anyone know HBOC
might have an earnings skeleton in its closet before McKesson paid
$14 billion to acquire the software division in January?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have all the answers yet and in the interim there
have been several lawsuits filed,'' McKessonHBOC spokesman Larry
Kurtz said yesterday in explaining the executive silence. ``When we
do have the answers I fully expect Charlie and Mark will be out
there answering questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who followed Atlanta's HBOC before the merger said
that, although there was never any hint of impropriety at HBOC,
there were plenty of warning signs that the high-flying software
firm might not be a good match for the 166-year-old drug
wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Clulow, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer in New York, said
the first warning bell rang last July, when a merger between
McKesson and HBOC was called off after news of the deal was
inadvertently leaked by Salomon Smith Barney, the investment bank
that first tried to marry HBOC, headed by McCall, to McKesson, run
by Pulido.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCall had taken this little software company and made it into
one of the 10-top performers in the S&AMP;P,'' said Clulow, averaging
roughly 50 percent a year in average growth in sales and earnings.
``Investors were asking why HBOC would sell off to low-growth
McKesson.''
</P>
<P>
   As HBOC's stock sank about 20 percent on the leak, Clulow said
McCall assured investors the talks were just that, and there
wouldn't be a deal. McCall also sued Salomon for the lost
shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three months later, the deal happens,'' Clulow said. ``The
combined entity lost a lot of credibility'' for the about-face.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Brodsky, a financial analyst with Vector Securities in
Deerfield, Ill., said the second trip by HBOC and McKesson to the
altar in October sounded another alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When HBOC accepted McKesson's bid for a nominal (11 percent)
premium over the market, it led a lot of investors and analysts to
wonder what Charley knew,'' Brodsky said.
</P>
<P>
   By then, she said, HBOC's smaller competitors in the hospital
software market had already been hammered because their clients _
forced to spend up to 50 percent of their budgets on Year 2000
fixes _ had less to spend on other hospital software. HBOC, with a
huge installed base and a revenue stream from annual software
license fees, had forestalled _ but could not indefinitely dodge _
that reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``McKesson's shareholders didn't understand what they were
buying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the deal closed in January _ after a second
lawsuit was filed, this one by Salomon, arguing that it had come up
with the idea for marrying HBOC, the leader in health care
software, to McKesson, the leader in drug distribution, and
therefore deserved a matchmaking fee.
</P>
<P>
   All this time, McKesson's shares were trailing down, from a high
of $96.25 in September, before the merger was announced, to the mid
60s in early February, when the now-merged company acted to bolster
its price.
</P>
<P>
   On February 8, McKessonHBOC said its top executives would buy
1.2 million shares at the previous Friday's closing price of
$63.33, for a total investment of $76 million. The two biggest
buyers that day were Pulido and McCall, who bought 150,000 shares
each. But they didn't pay exactly the same amount for this
good-faith stake in McKessonHBOC.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Elliott, who tracks insider trades for First Call/Thomson
Financial in Rockville Maryland, said Pulido, the former McKesson
chief and current CEO of the merged entity, paid the full price for
his stake or $9.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the former HBOC CEO, who as chairman of the merged firm,
exercised options that reduced his outlay for the same amount of
shares to only $5.9 million, Elliott said. Today, the value of the
shares purchased by both executives is $5 million, but Pulido, who
paid the full price, lost substantially more.
</P>
<P>
   Since February's executive buying spree, McKessonHBOC has traded
in the mid 60s _ until the plunge precipitated by Wednesday's news
that McCall's division had overstated some revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what seems like a situation ripe for recrimination,
company spokesman Kurtz said no one on the McKesson side of the
deal felt misled, and there had been no finger pointing at the
board meeting earlier this week where the bad news was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some 20 shareholder lawsuits have been filed,
alleging, in essence, that somebody knew _ or should have known _
the earnings were about to hit the fan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the controversy swirling around McKessonHBOC led CIBC
analyst Clulow to say, ``This stock is certainly going to be in the
penalty box for a while.''

 &HT;    Vicar team keeping low profile
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ After he won the Kentucky Derby in 1990 with
Unbridled, Carl Nafzger wrote a book on how he trains
thoroughbreds. Now that Nafzger is back on the doorstep of the 1999
Derby with Vicar, one of the Saturday race's favorites, the book,
``Traits of a Winner,'' is in a second printing.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Tafel, owner of Vicar, with homes in Kentucky and Illinois
but a resident of Delray Beach, Fla., for most of the year, is a
retired executive from a publishing company that prints technical
books.
</P>
<P>
   As skilled and experienced as they are in the ways of the media
(after all, they're in the profession), Nafzger and Tafel both have
limitedtheir exposure during Derby Week, the high-profile period of
the racing year.
</P>
<P>
   The press is not a problem for either the trainer or Vicar's
owner. A one-time rodeo bullrider with a dry Texas sense of humor,
Nafzger is a quote machine. Tafel is right at home in the press
box, where he visited often for post-race interviews as Vicar won
Gulfstream's top 3-year-old stakes in February and March.
</P>
<P>
   But they are determined that Derby Fever is not going to wreck
their week or damage Vicar's chances to win racing's biggest prize.
</P>
<P>
   Nafzger's wife, Wanda, who functions as the stable operation's
business manager, is responsible for keeping newspaper stories away
from the trainer. ``You read something you don't like and it
irritates you,'' said Nafzger. ``I don't want to get caught up in
that. I don't have time to waste this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Tafel's concern is slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   Nafzger is best-remembered outside of racing for his call of the
1990 Derby finish at the side of Frances Genter, the 92-year-old
owner of Unbridled, who was losing her sight and her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking the lead ... he's going to win ... you've won the
Kentucky Derby,'' Nafzger shouted in what was obviously an outburst
of genuine emotion. ``Oh, Mrs. Genter, I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes Tafel, ``I'll be so nervous that Carl is going to have to
call the race for me like he did for Mrs. Genter.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tafel, 75, is determined not to be around much when the
swarms of journalists make their morning charge through the
Churchill Downs stables. His ego does not demand that he be present
for daily interviews at the barns. He skipped the big Derby
dinner-dance this week. One of his horses ran at Churchill Downs on
Thursday, but Tafel saw the race on the simulcast at Keeneland.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, when Tafel and his wife, Ida May,
are at their Lexington home, he might be seen on the golf course,
where he spends a lot of time in Palm Beach County, Fla. Not this
week. ``I'm so keyed up for the race I'm playing terrible,
especially around the greens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With about 30 horses in racing, he sends a division to Calder,
where Luis Olivares is his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Tafel's stable produced its biggest success in 1998, when
Banshee Breeze, trained by Nafzger, earned the Eclipse Award as
3-year-old filly of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Her success makes it clear to Tafel just how much better known
the Kentucky Derby is than any other race. He did not hear from
them in 1998, but this year some of his Air Force comrades have
contacted him from the days in the 1940s when he flew as a
navigator on B-24s over Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Banshee Breeze became the first filly ever to
be invited to the Dubai Cup. Tafel skipped the trip to allow
Nafzger to concentrate on the 4-year-old's primary
end-of-the-season objective, the Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream. It's
too long-range to be realistic, but if Banshee Breeze stays healthy
and Vicar continues to run well, perhaps Tafel will get two
invitations from the Persian Gulf for the Dubai Cup in the year
2000.

LOTUS SAYS IT WILL BACK PAPOWS VS. JOURNAL REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY AND ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lotus Development Corp. says it will stand by Jeffrey Papows,
its chief executive and president, in the face of a published
report suggesting that he may have fabricated details of his
military service record and educational background.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't expect to see him leaving the company,'' said
Lotus spokesman Bryan Simmons, responding to a front-page story in
Thursday's Wall Street Journal that cast doubt on stories that
Papows is said to have told friends and colleagues about his
accomplishments. The Journal quoted a number of Papows' former
colleagues and customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal said that, among other things, Papows claimed to
have been a back-seat radar-intercept officer in fighter jets
during his stint in the US Marine Corps from 1976 to 1979. He also
claimed that he served in the Marine Corps Reserve in the 1980s,
and was forced to bail out of a crippled plane, according to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal article said that Papows served as an air-traffic
controller and did not serve in the active Marine Reserves. Papows
used stories of his fighter plane exploits to win military
contracts for Lotus, the story suggested.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Journal, Papows stated on his resume that he
held the rank of captain when he left the Marines, but actually was
a first lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also said that Papows claimed to hold a black belt in
tae kwan do and a PhD from Pepperdine University. In fact, he holds
a master's from Pepperdine and a PhD from a correspondence school.
He practices tae kwan do, but has not achieved a black belt in that
discipline, the article said.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Papows also told business associates that he was
an orphan, the paper said, when in fact his parents live in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In an electronic mail message sent to Lotus employees Thursday,
Papows charged that the Journal story ``includes false allegations
about my career and military experience. ``. . . It is extremely
unfortunate that the Wall Street Journal chose to focus on my
distant personal background rather than our collective business
accomplishments.'' However, Papows did not dispute any specifics of
the Journal story.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, the Lotus spokesman, said the Cambridge, Mass. company
also will not comment on the specifics of the article. He said
Papows would not give any interviews about the article and would
not elaborate on his remarks in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen at Lotus' parent company, IBM Corp., referred
questions about Papows to Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one former Marine Corps Reserve general who is quoted
in the Journal story came to Papows' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Major General Thomas L. Wilkerson, former commander of the US
Marine Corps Reserve, said he did not increase purchases of Lotus
software after meeting with Papows and hearing about his military
background. The Journal suggested that Papows' claims about being a
military aviator helped win the business.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson, currently president of MBIA Muni Service Co. in
Armonk, N.Y., said the decision to buy the software was made
further down the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Journal said Wilkerson had been accurately
quoted.
</P>
<P>
   At Lotus Thursday, where Papows is viewed by many as an
ambitious manager with a large ego, one employee who spoke on the
condition of anonymity said there was much talk about the Journal
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff does fashion himself as a cool machismo dude, and I have
a funny feeling he just took it too far,'' the employee said. Some
employees speculated Papows might be forced to resign, but others
said he should remain because of his successful track record, the
employee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough call,'' the employee said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy comes at a time when Lotus has been prospering
on the popularity of its Notes software for collaborative
computing. IBM generally does not break out details of Lotus'
financial performance, but in his e-mail to employees, Papows said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just closed out our best Q1 ever, with our largest
revenue growth in 6 quarters and a 40 percent year-to-year growth
in Notes'' sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Levitt, who tracks Lotus for International Data Corp., a
computer industry research firm in Framingham, said he doubted the
controversy will hurt Lotus sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company's key products, Notes and Domino, are used in large
businesses and organizations to share information and coordinate
group activities. Lotus installations often cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars, and Levitt said that companies making such
decisions aren't impressed by tales of the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it comes down to the product,'' Levitt said. ``Can the
product deliver what it claims to be able to deliver?''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt also said that Papows' success at Lotus may enable him to
ride out the controversy. ``Any shortcomings in his actual resume
notwithstanding, he has proven to be an energetic and reliable
leader for Lotus Notes. He has proven himself on the job.''

 CMP Media, Miller Freeman Join Forces
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco publishing firm Miller Freeman Inc. and computer
magazine publisher CMP Media are joining forces in a $920 million
deal to create a high-tech publishing and trade show powerhouse
employing 1,300 people in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Freeman's parent company, United News &AMP; Media PLC of
London, bought CMP and will fold it into Miller Freeman's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Freeman, which employs 1,000 people at its San Francisco
headquarters and a San Mateo office, publishes more than 270
business magazines and newsletters in areas as diverse as farming,
jewelry, and pulp and paper. Geeky computer publications are its
mainstay, however, accounting for 43 percent of its revenue last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Freeman claims to be the largest trade show producer in
the world. It runs PC Expo in New York and 370 other trade shows
and conferences.
</P>
<P>
   CMP, based in Manhasset, N.Y., employs 1,800 people in the
United States, including &LR;   &LR; roughly 300 employees at offices in San
Francisco and San Mateo. Founded 28 years ago by the Leeds family,
which has maintained ownership, it publishes 11 computer-oriented
magazines such as Information Week and Computer Reseller News.
</P>
<P>
   CMP's 1998 earnings of $10 million dropped 67 percent from 1997,
reflecting hard times in the computer magazine business. The
company announced in February that it had hired the investment bank
Lazard Freres and Co. to ``explore strategic changes'' including a
possible sale or merger. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Regina Ridley, group president of Miller Freeman's high-tech
division, said CMP has ``a very impressive group of products.'' She
doesn't anticipate large layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Freeman hopes CMP will give it the muscle it needs to
compete with Ziff-Davis of New York and International Data Group of
Massachusetts. Both firms have a significant West Coast presence,
Ziff-Davis with 900 employees in the Bay Area and IDG with 1,400 in
the Bay Area, Southern California and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Freeman even plans to follow Ziff-Davis' footsteps and
sell stock in its online arm, perhaps later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though CMP runs 40 Web sites and Miller Freeman runs 140,
the two make most of their money from their print businesses, and
they aren't yet a formidable presence online.
</P>
<P>
   CMP's online arm badly lags Ziff-Davis' in the competition for
Web traffic. ZDNet was the 13th most visited Web site last month,
while CMPNet ranked 650th, according to PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tchong, editor of Iconocast, an Internet marketing
newsletter, said the print wars are ancient history because paper
publications are going away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fighting a battle of print that belongs in the
dinosaur age,'' he said. ``The battle is not in print. The battle
is online.''
</P>
<P>
   Tchong said many prospective buyers were turned off by CMP's
high asking price.
</P>
<P>
   United News, which bought Miller Freeman in 1985, is Britain's
fourth-largest media company, with revenues of $3 billion last
year. It has a well-known line of Fleet Street publications,
including the Express and the Daily Star.
</P>
<P>
   British analysts applauded the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very nice strategic move,'' said Louise Barton, an
analyst at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite, who rates United News a
``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going all the way from magazines to these electronic
portals.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mark Hawkes at CCF Charterhouse hailed the notion of
selling stock in CMPNet, and said, ``It looks a sensible deal at a
good price.''
</P>
<P>
   United News paid CMP a cash price of $39 per share _ a 15
percent premium over Wednesday's closing price. CMP shares rose
$4.56 to $38.44 yesterday. On the Nasdaq market, United News &AMP;
Media shares rose $1.50 to $23.75. In London, United News shares
rose 7 percent to close at $11.60.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, who asked not to be identified, said it was unusual
for United News to pay cash in an era when most mergers involve at
least some swapping of stock. He speculated that stock, with its
inherent risks, could have driven the price higher.
</P>
<P>
   The companies hope to close the deal within 25 business days.

CONTINUING NASDAQ SLUMP CASTS PALL ON OVERALL MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NASDAQ stocks slumped for the third consecutive
session Thursday as investors took profits in high-technology
shares, casting a further pall over the market in general.
</P>
<P>
   While some money was redeployed into issues sensitive to the
business cycle, helping push the Dow Jones industrial average up
32.93 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,878.38, its fifth record in
seven trading sessions, traders and analysts seemed increasingly
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``If technology continues to erode, I don't think there's much
to bail the market out,'' said John Peluso, head of listed equity
trading at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite index fell 21.93 points, or 0.9 percent, to
2,528.44, while the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.08
points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,342.83.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the sober mood was the fact that stocks
responded scarcely at all to a government report that employers
have been exceptionally successful in holding down wage and benefit
increases, a development that also bodes well for the Federal
Reserve's efforts to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates retreated along a wide front but the stock market
seemed oblivious. ``You had an incredibly bullish employment cost
index which in most other times would have shot the market up a
couple hundred points,'' said Thomas Galvin, chief strategist at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Galvin found that a favorite short-term indicator
showed the market to be ``overbought'' because the percentage of
New York Stock Exchange issues trading above their 10-week moving
average climbed above 70 percent at this week's calculation. Last
week it was 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks to me are beginning to look tired,'' he said,
predicting prices will stay in a tight range for the next six to
eight weeks until the shape of second-quarter corporate profits
becomes clearer.
</P>
<P>
   One possible bright spot is shares of the nation's biggest
companies. According to the Investment Company Institute, investors
put $12.7 billion in net new cash into equity mutual funds in
March, more than 17 times February's $712 million in net sales.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the nation's largest mutual fund companies say sales
in April are even higher as investors snap up shares of funds
focused on large-cap growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The government report, showing the smallest increase in labor
costs since the series began in 1982, did seem to benefit some
financial stocks. J.P. Morgan rose 2 3/16, to 138; Citigroup
increased 1}, to 76 5/16, and American Express climbed 2 5/16, to
135], accounting for the bulk of the Dow's gain. At one stage the
blue-chip gauge, which was paced by Exxon's 3-point surge, to 84{,
had been up by nearly 83 points.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firm stocks did little as investors awaited the
initial public offering by Goldman Sachs Group, now scheduled for
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Some cyclical stocks moved higher, with Alcoa reaching a new
high of 65| before closing up 2 11/16, to 64 11/16. But some other
stocks sensitive to the business cycle, like International Paper
and DuPont, gave back some recent gains amid predictions that the
recent popularity of this group would wane. International Paper
fell 1[, to 56\, while DuPont slid }, to 72}.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rotation into cyclicals is going to prove to be
short-lived,'' said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at
Value Line Asset Management. He doubted they could sustain earnings
growth in a disinflationary climate.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's Cyclical Index advanced 1.6 percent, compared
with 2.6 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among high-technology shares, Amazon.com skidded 25\, to 168\,
after losing 12] on Wednesday. The biggest Internet retailer warned
of wider losses as it spends heavily on promotion and new services.
America Online eased another 1|, to 141], as investors took profits
after its strong earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital
Management, described the current market situation as a battle
between the forces of disinflation, such as globalization and
technology-driven productivity, and more recent forces of
reflation, such as interest-rate cuts and higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   But while the latter may fade, Paulsen fretted about being
underinvested in cyclical stocks in case inflation does pick up.
This has been anticipated for so long, wrongly so far, ``you hate
to be the guy who missed it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a hefty 1 billion,
with 80 stocks making new 52-week highs and 26 new lows. Rising
issues led falling ones by 1,664 to 1,322.

HEDGE FUND REPORT RAISES FEW HACKLES ON WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hedge fund managers, who six months ago were beside
themselves that regulators might clamp down on their freewheeling
partnerships in the wake of Long-Term Capital Management's
near-collapse, are breathing easier.
</P>
<P>
   A long-awaited government report released Thursday did not
propose _ at least for now _ any direct regulation of hedge funds,
recommending instead heightened disclosure and perhaps greater
reviews of trading practices and capital requirements for brokerage
firms and banks that deal in derivatives and make loans to hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets
followed the failure last fall of Long-Term Capital, a hedge fund
in Greenwich, Conn., that suffered huge losses when its debt-laden
portfolio crumbled, helping to roil financial markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will ultimately decide what to do with many of the
recommendations. But the report has already ruled out requiring the
funds to make explicit disclosures of specific investment positions
and strategies. And it even contained a victory of sorts for hedge
funds by noting that many large Wall Street firms _ and not just
hedge funds _ routinely use almost as much debt in their day-to-day
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report contains ideas that are constructive and
healthy,'' said Leon Metzger, president of Paloma Partners Co. LLC,
a large hedge fund, who testified before Congress on the matter. It
recognizes, he said, that ``other financial institutions are
generally more highly leveraged than private investment funds.''
</P>
<P>
   E. Lee Hennessee, chief executive of Hennessee Group, a New York
hedge-fund advisory service, said, ``Ninety percent of them are not
affected by any of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be something that overwhelms everybody,''
she added, though ``it is going to affect people who use excessive
leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Other managers of large hedge funds said the recommendations
would create more difficulties for banks and brokerage firms than
for them. A top official of one of the nation's largest hedge
funds, who asked not to be identified, said the recommendations
were not likely to cause major changes for the industry,
``depending on how this plays out'' in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A chief industry concern was that the report would include the
recommendation that fund managers disclose specific information on
trading positions and strategies. That would allow smaller traders
to profit by anticipating a fund's next move.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``what they've tried to recommend are disclosures that
are more top-down, how much leverage you have, what are the
liquidity and concentrations,'' the hedge-fund manager said.
``Those are the types of things we are very happy to provide to our
lenders, though we're not necessarily eager to make them public.''
</P>
<P>
   Had regulators recommended requiring new disclosures about
specific strategies and positions, ``every hedge fund would leave
the United States,'' a manager of another large hedge fund said.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual-fund companies had been among the loudest critics of
hedge funds following LTC's plunge, attributing the stock market
drop and other fallout that ensued to a lack of regulation that had
allowed the hedge fund to borrow about $30 for every $1 of its
investors' money _ leverage that accelerated the fund's plummet.
</P>
<P>
   While the report could have called for much tougher oversight
and regulation of the industry, it is ``great news,'' said John
Brennan, chief executive of Vanguard Group, the nation's
second-largest mutual fund company. ``I didn't think the
recommendations would be as concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, who is also chairman of the Investment Company
Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade group, said the
proposals, if carried out, would give federal regulators ``better
access to information about these unregulated vehicles that will
help avoid the kind of overreaching that occurred last year. There
will be less extreme risk as a result of these in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, David Runkel, a House Banking Committee
spokesman, said the panel's chairman, Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa,
``was disappointed it didn't say right off the bat that the first
government policy should be we are not going to bail out these
suckers.'' Federal regulators had organized a consortium of banks
to rescue LTC in September.
</P>
<P>
   But Runkel added that ``generally, on first blink, it is a very
well-reasoned, common-sense approach that's not intrusive but does
provide a few additional safeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   For lenders to hedge funds, the recommendations seek far greater
disclosure of the loans. If further recommendations are needed,
regulators could propose much greater supervision of investment
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street had little to say Thursday about the report.
A spokesman for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said, ``We are reviewing
details of the report and look forward to working constructively
with the regulators and Congress to address the issues raised.''
</P>
<P>
   And Citigroup and Chase Manhattan Corp., two of the largest
banks that had each been involved with Long-Term Capital, both
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But one industry official said: ``I dont think it's a big
problem. We are still looking through it. We now know what the gist
is. There was a problem last fall and we want to work with them.
It's no fun seeing the global financial system brought to its
knees.''

REPORT APPEARS TO DIM CONNECTICUT STADIUM HOPES

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Connecticut's bid to lure the New England Patriots
suffered a potentially fatal setback Thursday as consultants to
team owner Robert Kraft told him it was unlikely a new Hartford
stadium could be completed on time or within budget, people
familiar with the situation said.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants concluded that ``there is a low probability that
the stadium can be ready for a 2002 opening date,'' the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   That bleak assessment dramatically bolsters the counteroffer
made this week by Massachusetts to keep the team.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the local effort said they were increasingly
confident the Patriots would reject Connecticut's record-breaking
deal, and instead accept Beacon Hill's offer to provide $70 million
in infrastructure funds if Kraft builds a privately financed
stadium in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft met privately Thursday evening in Hartford with Governor
John G. Rowland to discuss the status of Connecticut's work to
prepare the site on which it would build a 68,000-seat stadium with
$374 million in taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft would not comment on the report. Under the terms of his
agreement with Connecticut, Kraft is legally bound not to discuss
any plan other than the Hartford stadium deal.
</P>
<P>
   But before he flew to Connecticut Kraft received a ``very
critical'' status report from the team of consultants he hired to
help him determine whether the Hartford stadium proposal is
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Based on all the data Connecticut provided to the Patriots, the
consultants concluded that ``there is a high degree of risk
associated with planning for the stadium to be open for the 2002
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems plaguing Connecticut's bid for the Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   --Soil tests were delayed and results are not expected for
several weeks. Without that information it is unclear whether the
state can prepare the site on time and within the budget allocated
by the Legislature. Further delays are likley if the project
requires additional funding authorization.
</P>
<P>
   --The state has not come up with a fully detailed plan to move
the steam plant on the Hartford site, which could cause the state's
2002 timetable to slip further behind.
</P>
<P>
   --Current designs call for part of the stadium to be built over
a highway, and construction experts have already questioned whether
the work can be done within the $55 million allocated by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the team's consultants believe it's unlikely
Connecticut can meet its promised deadline could kill the Nutmeg
State's bid for the Patriots, sources in both Massachusetts and
Connecticut said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft can terminate his contract with Connecticut at no cost if
he decides by Sunday that the state cannot deliver on its promise
of opening the stadium by 2002 or within the budget constraints
outlined in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants' findings, sources said, hands Kraft the
opportunity to exercise the escape clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very critical assessment,'' said another source
familiar with the discussions.``The agreement says the stadium will
open 2002. And that was already a year later than originally
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Connecticut had trouble, the team accepted the state's
request to push back the deadline to 2002,'' the source said.
``Going to 2003 isn't an option under the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The consultants also pointed out that the construction timetable
envisioned by Connecticut ``is based on every detail going
perfectly, which is rare in projects of this size and scope,'' one
source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project is very complicated and is impacted by a number of
difficult logistical requirements, including building parts of the
stadium over the Whitehead Highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Connecticut Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal said he was preparing to sue the National Football
League for actively promoting Massachusetts' bid to keep the
Patriots, despite an agreement Kraft had signed to come to
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit would charge the NFL with interfering with the
agreement between Connecticut and Kraft, and with restraining
competition, by trying to block a move by the Patriots to Hartford,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is proactively intervening to lure the team away from
an agreement the team has with Connecticut,'' Blumenthal said. ``We
could sue for hundreds of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is scheduled to meet Tuesday
with Rowland at the governor's request. Connecticut may be talking
tough, but there is a clear record of delays and problems at the
Hartford site. In the end, the NFL does not expect the state will
sue, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL prefers that the Patriots remain in the Boston
television market because games can generate higher broadcast
revenues here than in Hartford's much smaller media market. The
league, along with Boston civic leaders, urged state lawmakers to
come up with a stadium plan that could persuade Kraft from leaving.
House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, Senate President Thomas F.
Finneran, and Governor Paul Cellucci struck a compromise on
proposed legislation Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Boston business and political leaders continued to
express confidence that the Patriots will remain in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, a drive by the business community to gain
commitments for $15 million in luxury box seats is in full swing.
``We will make it,'' declared advertising executive Jack Connors.
``I am not worried at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is a crucial deadline for Kraft because he can walk away
from the deal at ``his sole and absolute discretion'' if he feels
an interim report from Connecticut, which formed the basis for his
consultants' evaluation, does not provide enough assurances that
the 2002 deadline can be met. But there are also other escape
hatches for the team in the artfully negotiated contract. The later
exits put Kraft more at risk, however, since they carry possible
fines that would be decided in a Connecticut court.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft can also cancel the Connecticut deal if other team owners
refuse to approve his proposed move to Hartford. Kraft has formally
petitioned the league to make the move, but many expect the owners
will vote against it since it will mean the loss of valuable
broadcast dollars.

<P>
   Diversification is one of the cardinal rules of investing, and
it is on many people's minds as they put their money into various
single-country index funds to spread risks among financial markets.
But such a strategy may overlook the burgeoning influence of
multinational companies on the national indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Because country indexes usually weight the stocks within them
according to market capitalization, multinationals, which are
typically large, can have an undue influence on them, some analysts
say. Moreover, a big economic event that affects a multinational's
business abroad can unduly influence the index of the nation where
its stock is based. That can make otherwise independent markets
move in unison, undermining diversity.
</P>
<P>
   A fund manager who wants to track the British market will find
that ``the biggest UK stocks aren't really UK companies anymore,''
said Matthew Annable, a managing director of Barclays Global
Investors, a fund management company. ``It just happens to be that
they have an office in the UK.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, multinationals account for more than half of the market
capitalization of indexes for countries like Sweden and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   To address the issue, Barclays Global Investors; Bacon &AMP;
Woodrow, a large European consulting company, and FTSE
International, which develops indexes, are proposing an index that
will treat multinationals as a separate asset class and at the same
time keep them out of some new single-country indexes.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary study of how the new index might work, using data
from 1988 to 1998, turned up mixed results. Companies in the Morgan
Stanley Capital International World index that were in the top
quartile based on market capitalization and had at least half their
sales outside their home markets were classified as multinationals.
Then the performances of local indexes with and without these
stocks were compared over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the indexes with the highest
concentrations of multinationals saw the biggest declines in their
correlation to other countries' market indexes once the
multinationals were removed.
</P>
<P>
   But many European market indexes tracked one another more
closely once the multinationals were removed. The report explained
the anomaly by suggesting that some European companies that do
business primarily in Europe really shouldn't have been classified
as multinationals because Europe is increasingly becoming one
market.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that multinationals should be removed from
local indexes. Brian Mattes, a principal at Vanguard Group, the
index fund giant, said the matter was ``not a concern at present.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Crosby, director of global marketing at Morgan Stanley
Capital International, acknowledged the disproportionate impact
that big multinationals can have on indexes but argued it was not
necessarily time to treat them as a separate asset class.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing now is sort of a new phenomenon from
these huge cross-border mergers,'' she said, adding that many older
multinationals continue to reflect the performance of local
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Annable said the companies proposing the multinational index
plan to refine it and introduce it by this fall, along with new
local indexes revised to remove large-cap multinationals.

TWO TEXAS CHILDREN BURIED AS MOM CHARGED WITH ABANDONMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMIE STOCKWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Texas _ While two children found dead in a creekbed
last week were buried Thursday afternoon, their 22-year-old mother
was charged with two counts of child abandonment, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson County District Attorney Ken Anderson announced the
charges against Tina Marie Cornelius, a topless dancer from Austin,
who was found Wednesday evening at a Corpus Christi apartment after
a weeklong search.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius' children, 3-year-old Amanda Lee Miller and 2-year-old
Dominick Logan Cornelius, were found April 19 in 6 inches of water
in Brushy Creek, just south of Hutto. Autopsy reports show that
Amanda died of suffocation and her brother died from a cracked
skull.
</P>
<P>
   According to the probable cause statement, Cornelius told
authorities she was present and ``observed Amanda and Dominick when
they were injured and lying in the creekbed or ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant told affiant that she left the children in the
creekbed or ditch and thought they were alive when she left. She
indicated she did not go back to help them,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   A Williamson County grand jury will hear the evidence May 18,
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an extremely hectic and extremely involved last 24
hours,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the homicide investigation will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make absolutely positively sure of the facts before
any other charges are filed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The children were buried Thursday in a service attended by about
70 relatives, day-care teachers and friends. Cornelius was in
custody and did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reminded of the incongruity of this moment by the
presence of these two small coffins,'' the Rev. Phil Ware said of
the identical white coffins decked with pale roses and sprigs of
baby's breath. ``We are angered at the loss of all that these lives
were intended to be, but which will never be realized.''
</P>
<P>
   In the foyer of the funeral home, a photo collage showed the
youngsters unwrapping Christmas presents and splashing in a baby
pool. Drawings made by the boy and girl also were displayed. Some
mourners wore pink and blue ribbons above their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The children were last seen April 14 when Cornelius picked them
up from day care, according to police. Their bodies were found five
days later, but police do not think that they had been in the creek
long.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius is in county jail on a $200,000 bond, $100,000 for
each second-degree felony charge. Both are punishable by two to 20
years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius was interviewed at the Corpus apartment for six hours
before being flown to Austin for further interrogation, authorities
said. It was not known whether she voluntarily returned to Austin,
or who she was staying with in Corpus.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Cornelius did not resist the officers and agreed
to answer their questions. Before tracking her down, police had
expressed concern that she might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Police have been investigating the claims of a 25-year-old man
who says he spent the weekend with Cornelius. He told authorities
that she told him the children's father had taken them and they had
died by falling off a cliff. The children have different fathers.
</P>
<P>
   The man told the Austin American-Statesman that he had a brief
relationship with Cornelius that began on Saturday, April 17, at an
Austin musical festival and continued through the morning of April
19, about half a day before the children's bodies were found.

CHINA SPY SUSPECT REPORTEDLY TRIED TO HIDE EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES RISEN and JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A scientist suspected of spying for China tried to
hide evidence that he had transferred nuclear secrets out of a
computer system at a government nuclear weapons laboratory two days
after he failed an FBI polygraph examination in February, according
to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, deleted more than 1,000 files
containing millions of lines of classified computer codes related
to nuclear weapons from the computer system at Los Alamos National
Laboratory after the lie detector test in February. U.S. officials
say one of the questions on the test, on which he was shown to be
deceptive, related to his computer use at Los Alamos, where he
worked since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had not deleted the enormous files earlier, but had moved
them out of the lab's classified computer, renamed them and stored
them in an unsecure system years earlier, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI discovered the deleted files in March, after Lee gave
the bureau permission to search his office computer. The
administrator of the computer systems at Los Alamos then helped the
bureau to recreate the deleted files. Officials say that after the
polygraph test, Lee, apparently aware that investigators were
suspicious of his computer use, deleted between 1,000 and 2,000
files.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was fired from his job at Los Alamos on March 8 for security
violations, but has not been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has denied wrongdoing. His lawyer could not be reached on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Experts from the FBI and Los Alamos said they were horrified
when they began to sift through the files that they say Lee
transferred and then deleted. He had downloaded what amount to the
keys to the American nuclear arsenal, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer codes and data were, in effect, the distillation of
more than a half-century of research on how to perfect nuclear
weapons, they said. They included the so-called legacy codes that
enable scientists to generate computer simulations of nuclear
explosions. When coupled with data on the performance of specific
warheads, they create a virtual blueprint of the nuclear explosive
parts of a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American officials contend that Lee transferred files out of the
classified computer and into an unclassified computer network at
Los Alamos between 1983 and 1995. Most of the reported transfers
took place in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not determined whether China obtained the
computer data. But there is evidence that someone accessed the
files after they moved to the unclassified system.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Lee came under suspicion in 1996. Yet he
retained his access to nuclear secrets at Los Alamos for nearly
three more years, and no one checked his computer. The FBI and the
Energy Department, which owns the government's nuclear weapons
laboratories, are now facing sharp criticism from Congress for
their failure to control his access to secrets or to monitor his
computer use.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials say that in 1997 the Justice Department rejected
their request to seek court approval to wiretap Lee's telephone and
covertly monitor his computer use.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau has been seeking to re-interview Lee and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, was questioned about the
bureau's handling of the case in a closed briefing for the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence Thursday. After the hearing, Sen.
Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the panel,
said he was not satisfied with the way the case had been handled.
But he said Freeh had pledged that it was now one of the bureau's
highest priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said the briefing confirmed ``some of our worst fears.''

PIPPEN MUM AS DWI CASE IS RESCHEDULED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Scottie Pippen ran a fast break through a Houston
courtroom Thursday, quickly securing a reset of his drunken-driving
case and then giving reporters the slip.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who is in his first season with the Houston Rockets,
must appear in Harris County Criminal Court-at-Law Judge Sherman A.
Ross' court again May 26.
</P>
<P>
   The brief court appearance marked Pippen's first to answer to
the driving-while-intoxicated charge he was arrested on last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real comfortable, after investigating it, with the
conclusion that he was not intoxicated that night,'' said his
attorney Rusty Hardin. ``We're confident that will be the system's
ultimate conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardin wouldn't say what had brought him to that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows and believes he wasn't intoxicated, and he didn't do
anything wrong,'' Hardin said. ``He's willing to let the system
take its course, and he's comfortable that's the conclusion
everyone else will reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's appearance in court seemed to be a welcome diversion
for onlookers in the hall and in Ross' court. But he said nothing
to reporters and repeatedly declined to comment by shaking his
head.
</P>
<P>
   With news cameras and reporters trying to keep up with his quick
pace, Pippen eluded most of them afterward on a courthouse
staircase. He went to a tunnel below the courthouse and waited to
be picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Found there by a reporter and asked again for comment, he again
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   Police stopped Pippen's Mercedes at 1:20 a.m. April 22 after he
allegedly passed traffic stopped for a red light at Prairie by
driving south in the northbound lanes of Main in downtown.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with Pippen, an officer thought he was
intoxicated, and called a member of the DWI Task Force. Police say
Pippen failed a field sobriety test and was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say he was later videotaped and refused to take a
Breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, 33, was charged with misdemeanor DWI. He was released
after posting a $500 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons of the Jones Bar in Houston said Pippen was there after
an April 21 game, with teammates Charles Barkley and Matt Maloney.
The Rockets had lost 109-95 to the Dallas Mavericks in Compaq
Center, with Pippen scoring only four points.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was arrested in Chicago in January 1994 after a police
officer checking on his illegally parked car noticed a loaded
.380-caliber semiautomatic handgun inside. The charge was dismissed
when a judge ruled the officer had no probable cause to look in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was charged with misdemeanor domestic battery in May
1995, after being accused of grabbing his fiancee, Yvette Deleone,
and shoving her. The case was dismissed when Deleone declined to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   After an 11-year career with the Chicago Bulls, which earned him
six NBA Championship rings and the status as one of the league's
most talented players, Pippen was traded to the Rockets in January.
The team signed him to a five-year, $67 million contract.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Connecticut's bid to lure the New England Patriots
suffered a potentially fatal setback Thursday as consultants to
team owner Robert Kraft told him it was unlikely a new Hartford
stadium could be completed on time or within budget, people
familiar with the situation said.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants concluded that ``there is a low probability that
the stadium can be ready for a 2002 opening date,'' the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   That bleak assessment dramatically bolsters the counteroffer
made this week by Massachusetts to keep the team.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the local effort said they were increasingly
confident the Patriots would reject Connecticut's record-breaking
deal, and instead accept Beacon Hill's offer to provide $70 million
in infrastructure funds if Kraft builds a privately financed
stadium in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft met privately Thursday evening in Hartford with Governor
John G. Rowland to discuss the status of Connecticut's work to
prepare the site on which it would build a 68,000-seat stadium with
$374 million in taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft would not comment on the report. Under the terms of his
agreement with Connecticut, Kraft is legally bound not to discuss
any plan other than the Hartford stadium deal.
</P>
<P>
   But before he flew to Connecticut Kraft received a ``very
critical'' status report from the team of consultants he hired to
help him determine whether the Hartford stadium proposal is
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Based on all the data Connecticut provided to the Patriots, the
consultants concluded that ``there is a high degree of risk
associated with planning for the stadium to be open for the 2002
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems plaguing Connecticut's bid for the Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   --Soil tests were delayed and results are not expected for
several weeks. Without that information it is unclear whether the
state can prepare the site on time and within the budget allocated
by the Legislature. Further delays are likley if the project
requires additional funding authorization.
</P>
<P>
   --The state has not come up with a fully detailed plan to move
the steam plant on the Hartford site, which could cause the state's
2002 timetable to slip further behind.
</P>
<P>
   --Current designs call for part of the stadium to be built over
a highway, and construction experts have already questioned whether
the work can be done within the $55 million allocated by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the team's consultants believe it's unlikely
Connecticut can meet its promised deadline could kill the Nutmeg
State's bid for the Patriots, sources in both Massachusetts and
Connecticut said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft can terminate his contract with Connecticut at no cost if
he decides by Sunday that the state cannot deliver on its promise
of opening the stadium by 2002 or within the budget constraints
outlined in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants' findings, sources said, hands Kraft the
opportunity to exercise the escape clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very critical assessment,'' said another source
familiar with the discussions.``The agreement says the stadium will
open 2002. And that was already a year later than originally
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Connecticut had trouble, the team accepted the state's
request to push back the deadline to 2002,'' the source said.
``Going to 2003 isn't an option under the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The consultants also pointed out that the construction timetable
envisioned by Connecticut ``is based on every detail going
perfectly, which is rare in projects of this size and scope,'' one
source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project is very complicated and is impacted by a number of
difficult logistical requirements, including building parts of the
stadium over the Whitehead Highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Connecticut Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal said he was preparing to sue the National Football
League for actively promoting Massachusetts' bid to keep the
Patriots, despite an agreement Kraft had signed to come to
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit would charge the NFL with interfering with the
agreement between Connecticut and Kraft, and with restraining
competition, by trying to block a move by the Patriots to Hartford,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is proactively intervening to lure the team away from
an agreement the team has with Connecticut,'' Blumenthal said. ``We
could sue for hundreds of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is scheduled to meet Tuesday
with Rowland at the governor's request. Connecticut may be talking
tough, but there is a clear record of delays and problems at the
Hartford site. In the end, the NFL does not expect the state will
sue, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL prefers that the Patriots remain in the Boston
television market because games can generate higher broadcast
revenues here than in Hartford's much smaller media market. The
league, along with Boston civic leaders, urged state lawmakers to
come up with a stadium plan that could persuade Kraft from leaving.
House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, Senate President Thomas F.
Finneran, and Governor Paul Cellucci struck a compromise on
proposed legislation Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Boston business and political leaders continued to
express confidence that the Patriots will remain in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, a drive by the business community to gain
commitments for $15 million in luxury box seats is in full swing.
``We will make it,'' declared advertising executive Jack Connors.
``I am not worried at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is a crucial deadline for Kraft because he can walk away
from the deal at ``his sole and absolute discretion'' if he feels
an interim report from Connecticut, which formed the basis for his
consultants' evaluation, does not provide enough assurances that
the 2002 deadline can be met. But there are also other escape
hatches for the team in the artfully negotiated contract. The later
exits put Kraft more at risk, however, since they carry possible
fines that would be decided in a Connecticut court.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft can also cancel the Connecticut deal if other team owners
refuse to approve his proposed move to Hartford. Kraft has formally
petitioned the league to make the move, but many expect the owners
will vote against it since it will mean the loss of valuable
broadcast dollars.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold got the
high-powered, semiautomatic pistol used in last week's high school
massacre with the help of a man who worked with them at a pizza
delivery store, law-enforcement officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a role in it,'' Sgt. Jim Parr, a spokesman for the
Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, said Thursday, noting that
the man they were interviewing had hired a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   If the co-worker acted as a middleman, linking two minors with
the owner of an automatic weapon, he could face charges as an
accessory to the crime of selling a handgun to someone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   If he had knowledge of the two young men's plans for mayhem,
charges could be stiffer. Klebold was 17 when he and Harris killed
themselves after slaying 12 students and a teacher. Harris turned
18 two weeks before the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the pizza parlor, Blackjack Pizza, did not return
calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Post reported Thursday that the pistol, a Tec-DC9,
went from its Miami manufacturer to Zander Sporting Goods, a
firearms wholesaler in Illinois, then to Just Guns, a suburban gun
store five miles north of Denver. The gun store closed about a year
ago, and the owner, Royce Spain, told The Post that a former
employee had sold the pistol for him at a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the pistol, officials said three long guns, provided by
Robyn Anderson, who went to the prom with Klebold three days before
the shooting, were used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, 18, bought one or more of the long guns late last
year at the Tanner Gun Show, according to the Jefferson County
sheriff, John P. Stone. The sheriff said Ms. Anderson was a
witness, not a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Tiffany Burk, has said that Ms. Anderson did not know
anything about Klebold's massacre plans and that during the
shootout she was caught in a school parking lot, where she cowered
under the seat of her car for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to trace the guns comes as new details emerge about
the devastation wrought by the two gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers who have toured the cordoned-off high school
said the killers walked from room to room, bombing the cafeteria,
blasting out computer screens in classrooms, heavily shooting up
administration offices and exploding a bomb that blew a hole in a
wall of the library.
</P>
<P>
   The young men had affixed abrasive strips to their trench coats
so they could strike matches to light their bombs. As fire alarms
blared and sprinklers sprayed, they strode through the chaos,
shooting with one hand and throwing pipe bombs with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The news that one or more of the guns was bought at a Denver
area gun show has put a spotlight on a corner of the gun trade.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the news, a recorded telephone message by the
organizer of a show that was to be held on Saturday, only 10 miles
from Littleton, said the show had been canceled ``due to the
politics in Denver at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun shows are held in the Denver area almost every weekend, and
buyers flock to them because they can buy guns anonymously from
vendors. Appealing largely to white, middle-aged men, vendors
advertise with signs that say, ``Cash and Carry'' and ``No
Paperwork, No Questions Asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, about the time Ms. Anderson apparently bought one
or more ``long guns'' at the Tanner Gun Show, area gun shows
experienced a surge in rifle and shotgun sales as buyers sought to
beat a Nov. 30 deadline. On that day, federally licensed firearms
dealers were required to expand mandatory background checks from
buyers of handguns to buyers of ``long guns,'' or rifles and
shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cash and a handshake,'' Bob Glass, owner of Paladin Arms
in Boulder, said of sales by unlicensed dealers at gun shows. ``An
underage buyer has a good chance.'' Defenders of the shows say they
give blue-collar gun owners an alternative to ``high end'' firearms
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the federal government estimates, roughly five
million people attended 5,000 gun shows, typically held in
convention centers, hotel meeting rooms or at country fair grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many come out to the Tanner Gun Show,'' said
Darrell Hare, president of the Denver Merchandise Mart, which has a
maximum occupancy of 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, after Denver experienced a rash of drive-by shootings,
Denver's City Council banned the sale of 33 assault weapons _
rifles, shotguns and pistols, including the Intratec Tec-DC9.
Because of the ban, gun shows are generally held in halls near the
first interstate highway exit outside of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Merchandise Mart, which hosts the Tanner Show nine
times a year, is six blocks north of the city. Most of the region's
gun shops, like ``Just Guns,'' the one linked to the Intratec sale,
are outside the city limits.

</P>
<P>
   Last June, an aide to Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Denver, went to a
Tanner show at the Mart and bought a Chinese-made version of an
AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle for $450 in cash. According to a
transcript of the conversation released by the congresswoman, the
only question the seller asked the buyer, aside from dickering over
a price, was, ``Are you interested?''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, President Clinton included in his package of gun
control legislation a bill that DeGette has sponsored requiring
background checks at private-transaction gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, which is to hold its annual
meeting in Denver on Saturday, has long opposed such legislation.
Last fall, it pressured Denver to relax its assault weapon ban.
</P>
<P>
   After Denver officials refused, the association threw its
support in the state Legislature behind a bill that would have
pre-empted local gun control ordinances. The bill, which was
expected to be passed, was withdrawn last week after the shootings
in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators are trying to unravel the gun trail, more
details are emerging about the killers, and investigators said they
were setting up interviews with the parents.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a Juvenile Court magistrate admitted that the pair
fooled him in March of last year when they appeared before him on
charges of breaking into a car and stealing electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, `yes, your honor, no, your honor,''' John A. DeVita
said. ``They were appropriately dressed, nothing in their demeanor
that I can recall that was inappropriate. They didn't come all in
black.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on their demeanor and because they were first offenders,
the magistrate allowed the two to enter a juvenile diversion
program. They were to attend anger management classes, perform
community service, and promise not to own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But within weeks of this court appearance, Stone said, Harris
started a diary that became a blueprint for a plot to blow up the
school. Late last year, about two months before the pair graduated
from the program, Ms. Anderson apparently bought one or more guns,
the sheriff has said.
</P>
<P>
   In a tape of the magistrate's interview with the boys and their
fathers last year, DeVita can be heard praising Wayne Harris,
Eric's father, for ``ratcheting back his curfew.'' Addressing the
retired Air Force officer, he said, ``Good for you, dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Eric can be heard meekly listing his household chores:
``Laundry, pick up the trash, vacuum, sweep the floors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you do that without being told?'' the magistrate asked
Eric.
</P>
<P>
   Eric replied, ``Yes, your honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the lack of red flags in the Harris-Klebold case,
DeVita said of the five-minute encounter: ``Both dads were there,
and that's pretty rare. Most of the time, it's moms only.''

 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANCUN, Mexico _ The 85-acre Club Med resort here, like many of
its counterparts around the globe, has lured millions of
vacationers to the tropics by offering them a simple choice: work
on their tans or keep active from sunup until exhaustion playing
tennis, hiking, snorkeling or wind surfing.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing it never offered was cultural or literary
enrichment _ until now. In early April, some 20 novelists,
essayists, poets and book editors gathered for a weeklong literary
forum, to discuss weighty topics like diversity and the
globalization of literature. The discussions were open to any of
Club Med's 400 or more guests.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that Club Med _ formally Club Mediterranee S.A. _ the
Paris-based company credited with originating the ``all-inclusive''
vacation with one price that covers transportation, meals,
accommodations and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the same company that fell on hard financial times
through much of this decade, a casualty of rundown properties, a
reputation for mediocre food and amenities, the aging of the baby
boomers, a backlash against the sexual revolution and an
inconsistent message that was filtered through eight advertising
agencies in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   But now Club Med is making a comeback. Attendance is rising, the
company turned a modest profit last year and 74 of its 116 villages
are undergoing a $350 million facelift. While hurdles remain,
analysts say Club Med is finally heading in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting that perception, the stock of Club Med, which fell to
a 12-month low of 59.91 euros ($63.67) on Oct. 2, 1998, has
recovered sharply in recent months. Thursday, it closed at 86.95
euros.
</P>
<P>
   Current management is well aware that the name Club Med is far
more synonymous with the pursuit of pleasure than with the life of
the mind. But that has not deterred Philippe Bourguignon, Club
Med's chairman since 1997, from trying to change those perceptions
with offerings like the forum here, the first in North America.
Others are expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   One purpose of the forums, clearly, is to help quash the
perception of Club Med as a swingers' paradise. For even if it
wanted to, Club Med, a public company operating in 36 countries,
would find it virtually impossible to compete with resorts that
have sprung up in Europe, Asia and the Caribbean in recent years
catering exclusively to hedonistic lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   So Club Med is pretty much stuck with a strategy that has been
evolving for more than a decade: a mix of villages, some with
special programs for children (there are now 56) some that welcome
children but have no special programs or amenities for them (22).
The other 38 are for anyone 18 or over, featuring disco nights,
Broadway entertainment and chug-a-lug contests, where the mating
dance _ for straights and, increasingly at some sites, gays _
remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   But even that strategy is not risk-free, given the spurt of
all-inclusive resorts, including dozens of them here in Cancun. So
one way to lift attendance is through niche markets, whether of
cultural mavens or golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have 76,000 beds in their villages, and these forums can
help them by building a bigger customer base, especially with
people they are not yet reaching,'' said Armel Coville, an analyst
with ABN AMRO in Paris. ``It's a good strategy, because it can help
increase their overall occupancy rate. And each one-point gain in
the occupancy rate equals about 60 million francs,'' or about $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bourguignon, 51, who took over Club Med in April 1997,
occupancy rose to 72.3 percent last year, up from 69.1 percent in
fiscal 1997 and 66.9 percent in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other results have also improved under Bourguignon, who was
recruited after the Agnelli family of Italy, the biggest
stockholder in Club Med, despaired of the losses and dwindling
attendance under the leadership of Serge Trigano, the son of
Gilbert Trigano, the company visionary and longtime chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, attendance at Club Med rose 5
percent, to almost 1.6 million, although it is still well below the
record 1.8 million set in 1989. Equally important, after huge
losses in both 1997 ($215 million) and 1996 ($130 million), the
company earned $30 million on revenue of $1.5 billion. Now,
Bourguignon predicts profits of about 5.5 percent in each of the
next two years, despite the loss of up to 10 percent of its rooms
during the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   But Club Med has not just been renovating properties. It has
been making other changes and fashioning plans both big and small.
</P>
<P>
   A big change is the decision to concentrate its sales and
marketing efforts on France, the United States, Canada, Belgium,
Japan, Italy, Germany and Switzerland, countries that account for
74 percent of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   With Japan in an economic slump and American attendance lagging
for a half-dozen years, Club Med's financial turnaround last year
came largely from European vacationers. But with its millions of
people with abundant disposable incomes, the United States is Club
Med's No. 1 target these days. Combined United States and Canadian
visitors totaled 189,000 last year, trailing by a large margin the
598,200 from France. And that was the lowest total in at least six
years _ and 11,500 fewer than in 1995. Still, Bourguignon said he
expected customers from the United States to equal those from
France in five years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Club Med is considering building another
village in Florida, to complement its family village at Port St.
Lucie and plans to build its second U.S. ski resort in Colorado or
Utah _ resorts that unlike its 28 ski resorts in Europe can double
as summer vacation spots.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Club Med is pouring millions into advertising to
rejuvenate what is still a strong brand name but one that, it
acknowledges, ``has remained fuzzy and poorly understood'' chiefly
because each of its eight advertising agencies interpreted the ad
campaign's message in a different way. Each village is now ranked
with two, three or four tridents, based on amenities and comfort
level, with the result that the 13 budget Club Aquarius villages
are being folded into the two-trident category.
</P>
<P>
   And by 2003, Club Med will open minicenters in as many as 15
cities, including Paris, Singapore, Montreal, Brussels, Belgium,
and Barcelona, Spain, to give local residents a daylong sample of
the Club Med experience and to reacquaint former customers with
that experience.
</P>
<P>
   Another change involves pricing. This includes a more
sophisticated application of yield management to determine when to
lower prices during slack seasons and raise them (or at least guard
against lowering them) when demand is high. At the same time, Club
Med has already lowered prices at many villages as much as 30
percent to compete with other all-inclusive options, especially
cruise ships, which offer amenities in addition to visits to
foreign ports.
</P>
<P>
   Bourguignon acknowledges that cruise lines pose a serious
challenge, adding that Club Med is ``doing a lot of work about
whether we should match it or fight it.'' It should decide in about
six months, he said, what strategy to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledges that Club Med's relatively small size in an
industry that is steadily consolidating puts it at a disadvantage.
But he no longer favors Club Med's acquisition by Euro Disney,
which he championed while he was chief executive of Euro Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then there were synergies,'' he said, ``because both
companies had problems with their reservation systems and both of
us recruited the same types of people each year, so we could have
formed a training program. But now it's too late because both of us
have our own reservations systems and our own training programs.''
</P>
<P>
   So he is trying to set Club Med apart with innovations like the
literary forum. As an early announcement about the forum put it,
``Most Americans don't immediately think of culture in terms of
Club Med.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the writers in attendance were Rick Bass, Bharti
Mukherjee, John Edgar Weidman, Gish Jen, Susan Minot and Jay
McInerney.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks kicking off the forum, Bourguignon spoke of his
appreciation for the culture of America, where he had lived 10
years, and of his regard for Hemingway, Twain and Steinbeck, whose
books he had read as a schoolboy.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, Bourguignon, who is widely credited with
turning Euro Disney, an early money loser, into a financial
success, made it clear that he had no intention of trying to turn
Club Meds into latter-day Chautauquas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not necessarily to attract a lot of people who
would come because of the forums,'' Bourguignon said, ``because
that would change the personality of Club Med.''
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose, he added, is to give Club Med vacationers
still another option, the opportunity to hear and mingle with
writers as at some Club Meds they mingle with sports figures, and
for the wider community ``to better understand what Club Med is all
about, beyond the cliches.''
</P>
<P>
   His idea of soft-pedaling the forums has already found favor
with some Club Med customers here. ``If I came especially for the
forum and found out it was only an hour or two a night, I'd be
disappointed,'' said Helga Lemke, the director of a nonprofit
community action program in Santa Rosa, Calif. But she had not
heard about it, and after attending the first two sessions, she
pronounced herself well satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Georgina Hinrichsen, a 28-year-old New Yorker who
came here to relax, was surprised to learn of the forums. ``But
it's a great idea,'' she said, ``and I can see where some people
would want to schedule vacations around them.'' As it was,
attendance at the sessions averaged a respectable 100 or so people
a night.
</P>
<P>
   What Club Med villages do not have, except in a few villages
outside of North America, are gambling casinos, and despite
overtures from several Las Vegas companies, it has no immediate
plans to jump aboard that bandwagon. ``We don't have the competence
for that,'' Bourguignon said, ``so for now, we'll stick to what we
know best.''

BIDDERS WITHOUT FACES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The auction, it seems, is the emblematic transaction of our
time, as characteristic of fin-de-siecle America as the potlatch in
some tribal societies, or imperial land grants in colonial days. As
a means of exchange, it encapsulates a good deal about us, with our
emphasis on individual freedom, fair markets and, lately,
technology.
</P>
<P>
   For while many of us still imagine a fast-talking,
gavel-wielding auctioneer, or perhaps the desperate shouting of
traders in the commodities pits, the rise of the auction is now
fueled by computers.
</P>
<P>
   We are not far removed _ a couple of hundred years perhaps _
from a time when ordinary people had no practical way to sell
things to anyone but their neighbors, or perhaps to a few strangers
at a market fair. Now, because of the Internet, we can auction
almost anything among millions of potential buyers at minimal
transaction costs. Culturally, this phenomenon has implications.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it means the death of the bargain. After all,
bargains depend on such market imperfections as inadequate
information, barriers of time and distance, and so on. Buy
something in an Internet auction and you can be sure you are paying
the highest possible price.
</P>
<P>
   Economists refer to the ``winner's curse,'' which comes free
with whatever you happen to acquire at an auction. (The curse is
winning.)
</P>
<P>
   Prowl Ebay for a while and you'll sometimes see people bidding
as much for second-hand stuff as the same items would cost new.
Sometimes, bidders even drive the price above retail.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to overpay at auction, of course, is not limited to
the Internet. Auctions have changed the nature of book publishing,
for example: Manuscripts or even fragments of manuscripts by top
authors attract frenzied bidding from publishers chasing the next
blockbuster, while piles of work by the rest of us poor hacks are
left to languish unloved in mid-list hell.
</P>
<P>
   The same dynamic is at work in the movie business, where studio
heads desperately bid huge sums to land the few hot scripts, and in
pro sports, where stars with expiring contracts can weigh multiple
proffered fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   In retail transactions, auctions take consumers another step
away from the face-to-face dealings once so central to village
life. On-line auctions are efficient, but how do you get one to
sponsor a Little League team, or lower an awning over Main Street
when it rains?
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that business becomes more virtual, so do
communities. The growth of auctions suggests we're becoming a
nation of solitary consumers, trading electronic balances for
overpriced tchotchkes without ever leaving home. Talk about home
shopping networks!
</P>
<P>
   While auctions do a good job of setting prices for copper and
pork bellies, the Everyman sort of auction fostered by the Internet
depends heavily on cultural ``commodities'' whose value is more
subjective.
</P>
<P>
   To help us arrive at a bid for pork bellies, we have information
about bacon consumption, population trends, herds on hog farms and
so forth. But who really knows how to value a lamp by Poul
Henningsen or a painting by Irving Lehman?
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is also at work in the astonishing run-up of
Internet stocks, whose value, to the denizens of chat rooms and the
world of on-line trading, is just as subjective in the absence of
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   We may long for a world in which we buy staples across the
counter from a kindly old fellow in an apron, yet we like auctions
almost as much as we like the ``category killer'' superstores that
have wiped out the mom-and-pop retailers of memory.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, Internet auctions may have more in common with
market day in a medieval village than with ordering from the
operator at the toll-free number in Omaha. Ebay offers the
opportunity to inquire about items for sale via e-mail, and, after
the transaction, you can rate the person you bought from.
</P>
<P>
   These ratings are recorded, and anyone can look up anyone else's
record before entering a transaction. In other words, J.P. Morgan
has been proved right again: Character counts.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, when you buy something in an on-line auction, you're
not dealing with Wal-Mart or Home Depot, but rather with Joe
Cyberspace in Columbus, Ohio, who happens to be parting with a pair
of arts and crafts bookends you just can't live without. In this
day of a shrinking globe and vanishing community, that's something.

READY FOR ELWAY, PAST AND FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When asked about the possibility that John Elway
will spend his first year of NFL retirement as the third wheel in
ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' booth _ and, by the way, the '99
season opener is at Denver when the Broncos meet the Miami Dolphins
_ ABC officials have managed to stand in the pocket and face the
rush just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an often-asked question and the best I can answer is that
we're happy with a two-man booth (of Al Michaels and Boomer
Esiason), but we're exploring all options and we're not excluding
or including anyone,'' said ABC Sports spokesman Mark Mandel.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, there'll be a scramble by everyone to get Elway as
a broadcaster _ but only if he's committed to doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Elway might appear to be a perfect fit for ABC, which has an
opening and has shown a willingness to change personnel, having
dumped both Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf in consecutive years.
But ABC hasn't been the kind of network to just hire someone for
star value.
</P>
<P>
   No network wants a repeat of what happened when NBC signed
freshly retired Joe Montana and plopped him in the Sunday NFL
studio show, only to expose his lack of communications skills.
</P>
<P>
   Same with CBS' hiring of George Seifert (who has left) and
Marcus Allen (who probably should). CBS should be most cautious
about showing interest in an unproven broadcaster like Elway. It
has already started offseason moves by putting Randy Cross in
studio and hiring Dierdorf for games.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's studio show needs no tweaking and it hasn't panicked,
putting someone on as a game analyst for the sake of ratings when
it has John Madden as its hitching post.
</P>
<P>
   ABC can also draw from its ESPN pool of talent, which would seem
to give Paul Maguire a better shot than Elway at joining ``MNF.''
If he's interested, they could even do that and let Elway sit in
Maguire's chair on the ESPN Sunday night game. If anything, the
best Elway fit on TV might be ESPN's ``NFL GameDay.''
</P>
<P>
   But is that enough exposure for him?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ABC's best ratings bet would be to have Elway in as a
guest analyst for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Tributes a mile high: ESPN, Fox Sports News (on Fox Sports West
2) and CNN/SI plan to go live with Elway's retirement press
conference at noon Sunday. Then everyone will scramble to tell you
what this all means.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:30 p.m. ``John Elway: Farewell to a Champion,'' hosted by
Chris Myers, will air on Fox Sports West.
</P>
<P>
   Elway not only has to endure the ``Sunday Conversation'' with
Roy Firestone, but the 8 p.m. ESPN ``SportsCenter'' will have a
report by Andrea Kremer on Elway's future and a Chris Berman
retrospective on Elway's place in history.
</P>
<P>
   On ESPN Classic, an eight-hour Elway marathon called ``The
Magnificent 7,'' which already aired Thursday, will re-air during a
24-hour period starting Sunday at 6 p.m. That cluster of shows
includes a Super Bowl XXXIII recap, Broncos season highlights from
1987 and '89 and an hour-long show called ``Elway's Greatest
Comebacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawn bowling or leaf blowing? This could be the weekend when you
hear Parker Bohn III say the words, ``I lost the ball in the sun.''
Or see Pete Weber struggle to light his cigarette in a stiff
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at noon, CBS will be there live to cover _ with cameras
and canopies _ the Brunswick Long Island Open, otherwise known as
the first outdoor bowling event called ``The New York PBA
Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   After the preliminary rounds are finished Friday indoors in
Coram County Lanes, the final four go outside to play at Bryant
Park in midtown Manhattan. Four 53-foot trucks started building the
lanes Wednesday along with horseshoe bleachers to accommodate 2,000
fans and a video Jumbotron that allows thousands more in the park
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   If it rains, finalists will bowl under a tent. Which'll make
this look even more like a circus with empty beer bottles used as
wind chimes.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling as a TV event was never carnivalized like this in its 36
years on ABC, yet PBA Hall of Famer Marshall Holman, in his second
year as the analyst for CBS, is ``thrilled by it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is awe-inspiring and I hope there are thousands of
fans yelling on every roll,'' said Holman _ the Johnny Miller of TV
bowling, since he also competes in a couple of events a year to
stay connected with the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally you go to an arena and the players have to acclimate
themselves to the environment _ but at least there are walls and a
ceiling. Now you're dealing with all the elements. Just think about
all the things in the air, whatever is flying around in Manhattan,
landing on those lanes and dealing with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that fair, throwing caution to the wind _ or whatever else
blows by?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a completely fair world, we'd finish match play
(Friday) and whoever was ahead would win,'' said Holman. ``But the
(Saturday) television final is very important to the tour. Without
it, people don't see the product. This is another way to call
attention to the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Eye black, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Right on track: When NASCAR announced in February it would end
the practice of each track negotiating its own TV deal and assume
control of all media rights fees from its central location starting
with the 2000 race season, speculation spread about the pros and
cons of such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine each NFL team negotiating its own national TV deal. As a
league, look at where it's gotten. NASCAR, second only to the NFL
in terms of sports TV ratings, has that idea in mind as it sees its
current slate of 34 events spread over six networks, including one
on NBC for the first time this September.
</P>
<P>
   Because of existing rights fees, fans won't see much of a change
in NASCAR coverage until probably 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the TV players, the ABC/ESPN would be more apt to
gain an edge if NASCAR had to pick one outlet as its main partner.
Including Sunday's California 500 from Fontana, ABC and ESPN do 18
_ more than half _ of the NASCAR events, with the Nashville Network
(8) and CBS (4, including the Daytona 500) ranked next. ESPN also
provides daily programs and race repeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR has a lot of components that are just as important as
the races,'' said Mark Quenzel, an ESPN vice president of
programming. ``Other sports can offer something every day for their
fans. We have provided that connective tissue between events with
other shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to believe we are (in a good position with NASCAR).
They've been a large part of what we've been doing here for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ABC's live coverage of the California 500 at 11
a.m. Sunday, ESPN2 has 90 minutes of live qualifying today at 2:30
p.m. and re-airs the race at 8 p.m. Sunday. ESPN repeats the race
at midnight Sunday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   _The May issue of Brill's Content has revealed annual salary
figures for several media members, which supposedly everyone wants
to know but is afraid to ask. The magazine admits the numbers
aren't entirely accurate because they don't include outside
incomes, speaking fees, etc. As for that $1 million deal Fox
reportedly gave Keith Olbermann _ Brill's has KO pulling down $2.67
mil. ``I have no problem with printing those figures, nor did I
when I was making $26,000 a year at CNN,'' said Olbermann, who _
for the record _ had no comment on his figure. Other numbers:
ESPN's Robin Roberts makes $650,000, Sports Illustrated writer Rick
Reilly gets $450,000, Chicago Tribune columnist !racpay!Skip
Bayless makes $225,000 and an ESPN production assistant makes $9 an
hour. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_In arguing before the Nevada Athletic Commission last week for
experimenting with open scoring, boxing promoter Bob Arum
successfully pointed out the disservice HBO brings by allowing
Harold Lederman to post his unofficial scorecard during the bout.
But in doing so, Arum managed to get another shot at HBO
commentator Larry Merchant, who he once basically had banned from
an Oscar De La Hoya bout because he took offense to comments
Merchant made about mariachi music played for De La Hoya's
entrance. At the meeting, Arum played a tape of HBO's broadcast of
De La Hoya's recent close call over Pernell Whitaker, when Lederman
continued to score the bout in favor of Whitaker because of
Merchant's opinions. In those same rounds, the judges, it was later
revealed, were with De La Hoya. ``The point I'm trying to make is
not whether Harold Lederman is good or bad,'' Arum said while
making that exact point. ``In fact, he wasn't watching (the fight).
He was listening to Merchant... right then, when it happened,
Lederman's error would have been exposed (if open scoring was in
place).'' Just as Arum's bias against Merchant was exposed again. &QL; 
_Wayne Gretzky appears on Sunday's edition of ESPN's ``Sports
Reporters.'' Which starts out here at 7 a.m.

 B-52s TO DROP TRADITIONAL BUT LESS-ACCURATE `DUMB' BOMBS  
 (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With stocks of cruise missiles dwindling, Defense
Secretary William Cohen announced Thursday that the Pentagon is
providing 10 more B-52 bombers to NATO forces that would be used
for the first time to drop traditional bombs on Serbian military
targets, as well as firing guided missiles.
</P>
<P>
   A staple of the Vietnam War, when their hulking figures became a
symbol of that conflict, B-52s have been restricted to bombing with
cruise missiles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the bombers have been allowed to carry ``dumb'' bombs, which
are less accurate in hitting their targets. Dropping bombs without
satellite or laser guidance from high levels is more likely to
cause unintended damage and injury.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some cruise missiles remaining, the new
B-52s, which will be based in England, will carry Israeli-made
guided missiles, called AGM-142s or HAVE NAPs. The missiles have a
range of 50 miles and carry 750-pound explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not as good as cruise missiles but they are very
accurate,'' a Pentagon spokesman said, ``and we have a stockpile of
120 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The additional B-52 bombers are part of the 300 planes requested
several weeks ago by NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark;
he said he needed them to wage the air war day and night and to
expand the range of targets. Earlier this week, the Pentagon
dispatched 30 more refueling tankers, to be based in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   When the B-52s begin bombing with traditional bombs, they will
be used to strike at Serb forces in the field, which are the
hardest to hit, and at military targets, like barracks, that are
far from civilian areas, according to the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the reduced accuracy, the spokesman said,
``everything around it should be military, too, somewhere where
there are no civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, gave the daily Pentagon briefing Thursday for the first time
since the air war began.
</P>
<P>
   This was read as a sign that the administration is trying to
combat the growing frustration in Congress and among the public
over the lengthy air campaign, which so far has failed to make
Kosovo safe for its ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Their language reflected a stiffening of posture, if not
purpose, since they met with their allied counterparts in
Washington last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as keeping the American people behind this,'' Cohen
said, ``I think they only have to turn on their television sets
every day and to see the kind of horrendous suffering that is now
portrayed on the evening news,'' a reference to the Albanian
refugees fleeing Serbian forces in Kosovo.

 &HT;    Sheik looks to expand crown of victory at Kentucky Derby
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Everyone on the Churchill Downs backside
stopped to watch the royal parade as it headed to the track
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Five tiny blue-capped riders atop five well-muscled horses
wearing blue-trimmed saddle cloths were followed by a throng of
stablehands, trainers, gawkers, television crews, photographers and
one small, bearded man with a blue shirt, blue jeans, boots with
spurs and a pair of binoculars in one one hand.
</P>
<P>
   The last time there was this much fascination over a bunch of
blue uniforms in this state, Tubby Smith was guiding the University
of Kentucky Wildcats to the national crown.
</P>
<P>
   This is a crown affair, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded man is Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the
Crown Prince of Dubai, the single, most powerful person in the
entire world of thoroughbred racing and the man who has turned the
125th running of the Kentucky Derby into a much-debated Middle East
mystery, with his nontraditional thinking, secret training methods
and hidden-from-view horses.
</P>
<P>
   That's why all eyes were on the Sheik as he accompanied his two
Derby horses _ the big bay colt Worldly Manner and the smaller
Aljabr _ to the track for some unconventional 5 furlong work just
two days before the race.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, everything about this Derby effort is against the
grain. Although Worldly Manner was considered possibly the best
2-year-old in American racing last September, neither of the colts
has raced as a 3-year-old _ a practice that hasn't produced a Derby
winner since Morvich in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the Sheik and his three brothers _ who together own
Godolphin Racing _ have kept their horses on the other side of the
world, training in a plush, but strictly private compound in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   And that raises plenty of questions. Can you train a Derby horse
in the middle of the desert? Can you skip the traditional prep
races in Florida, California and Kentucky? Can you ship a horse
over nine time zones, take him straight out of quarantine and six
days later send him into a grueling 1 mile cavalry call like the
Kentucky Derby? And can a horse that has prepped in solitude handle
the mob scene of 140,000 raucous, cheering fans and a track jammed
with 19 other horses?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see if this works for us,'' the Sheik said. ``I love
the Kentucky Derby. It's a great challenge and we love challenges.
I'm not saying we are absolutely right here. It's our first time,
so we will learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Many here _ especially after the two colts had plodding workouts
their first time on the track last Sunday _ are skeptical. Hall of
Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who has three Derby wins, said: ``This
is not the junior prom. This is war. This race is usually won by
the horse whose feet have been held to the fire to get tested.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Lukas, like everyone else, doesn't totally write off the
Sheik because of what he has done. The Sheik has long shown he's
driven by dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday he told of coming to England as a young man to study.
And when he showed a fascination with racing and went to buy his
first three thoroughbreds, he was ridiculed by one racing insider
who said ``Why don't you just stay in your tent and race camels?''
</P>
<P>
   From that dig, he has built a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   He is from the royal family of Dubai, which is one of seven
emirates making up the United Arab Emirates. Along with serving as
the defense minister of his oil-rich nation, he has put together
the most competitive racing consortium ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he showed up at race sales in Kentucky and spent $41
million on 29 yearlings. Back home, he and his brothers built Al
Quoz Racing Stables, a facility with a private track, a 250 foot
swimming pool for horses and some 140 thoroughbreds, most said by
racing experts to be worth over $1 million each. Along with top
trainers from around the world, he employs 40 jockeys from Ireland,
England and the United States and 70 grooms from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   He owns another facility and track outside Paris that serve as
something of a minor-league farm system. He keeps 120 2-year-olds
there and the best 50 each year are brought to Dubai. In Kentucky,
he owns 5,000 acres of horse farm land worth $70 million in
Fayette, Bourbon and Woodford counties. He has 500 horses here and
employs 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   From such a stockpile, he has won most of the world's most
prestigious horse races. Everything, but the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Then last fall he sent an agent to California to tender an offer
for Worldly Manner, a Bob Baffert trained colt, owned by John and
Betty Mabee, who have General Challenge and Excellent Meeting in
Saturday's Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Worldly Manner had just won the Del Mar Futurity, his third win
in four starts and everyone was raving about him. The agent asked a
price and Mabee _ who said he didn't really want to sell _ tossed
out an exorbitant figure of $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks, the money was wired to his account and he said
it was another three weeks until he found out who the buyer was. By
then, Worldly Manner was in Dubai, where he joined Aljabr, who was
bred in Kentucky and won all three of his 2-year-old starts in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the two colts' only competitive race was something
akin to a pair of inhouse scrimmages. The Sheik _ called ``The
Boss'' by his workers _ staged two prep races, using all his own
horses and jockeys like Jerry Bailey, who were flown in. No
spectators or media were allowed to watch and afterward it was
announced each colt had had impressive wins.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the Sheik should know better. He was a part owner of
the French wonderhorse Arazi, who was lightly raced when he came to
the 1992 Derby. Billed as the next Secretariat, he finished a
dismal eighth.
</P>
<P>
   To counter, the Sheik offers Lammtarra, who raced just once as a
2-year-old, wintered in Dubai and then won the demanding 1 mile
Epsom Derby. Since then he has sold the horse for a reported $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   There is method to the Sheik's money madness. With oil reserves
diminishing in Dubai, he's try to build the country's trade and
tourism industries and he's using sports as a rich marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   He and his brothers already bankroll the $5 million Dubai Cup,
the world's riches horse race, and now they are proposing a $15
million event over three years involving nine races in eight
different countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some see the sheik as a guy who simply tries to buy everything _
including a Derby win. Others, like Derby trainers Nick Zito and
Bob Baffert, say he is great for racing. ``Look at him out here
today,'' Baffert said. ``He wants to be a regular guy and he hangs
out with the trainers. He's like a kid. He's got the fever.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheik didn't argue: ``I love the Derby and this atmosphere.
We are learning how its done here and if we don't win this one, we
will be back again. That I promise.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, as he finished the day's training, he was met by an
assistant carrying in a bag full of food from McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   A Big Mac for The Big Boss?
</P>
<P>
   The guy is learning how it's done here.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The weather outside the Astrodome was pleasant and delightful, much
too nice to be indoors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Hampton wasn't about to let a little roof get in his way.
He strolled through the Arizona Diamondbacks on Thursday afternoon
as if he were taking a leisurely walk in the park, veering from his
path on only a couple of occasions en route to a 5-2 Astros
victory.
</P>
<P>
   If pitching were as easy as Hampton made it look, Major League
Baseball would have to double the number of teams to accommodate
the wave of job applicants. Hampton spaced four hits over eight
innings and allowed two runs (one earned) in his strongest outing
of the season. He did not walk a man.
</P>
<P>
   And if that weren't enough, he drove in a pair of runs with a
two-out, two-strike double in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mentally drained,'' Hampton said after the game. ``I left
everything on the field, and that's a good feeling. Over the last
few games, I've been concentrating on getting more into every
pitch. Today I got into a rhythm, mixed up all of my pitches and
kept them guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   At times this season, Hampton has kept himself guessing, not to
mention his coaches and teammates. But if he can consistently pitch
anywhere near the level he exhibited Thursday, Hampton will be the
least of manager Larry Dierker's worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about Hampton,'' Dierker said. ``No one
said anything to him about it, but he knew that some of our main
setup guys weren't available to pitch a lot of innings, so he just
pitched right on through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton turned a three-run lead over to Billy Wagner, who had
allowed a career-high five runs the previous night. And in typical
Wagner fashion, he struck out the side for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   Billy the Kid seldom shows emotion on the mound, but he clearly
wore his feelings on his sleeve Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to jump right back out there after a bad
outing,'' said Wagner, who struck out the heart of the
Diamondbacks' order _ Jay Bell, Travis Lee and Matt Williams.
``When you give up five runs the previous night, you kind of get
(attitude) about letting people beat on you. Last night, they just
beat my brains in. I wanted to let them know that was a fluke.
That's why I was pumping my fist about getting a save.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won three of four games from the Diamondbacks before
departing on a six-game road trip to Florida and New York that
begins tonight against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of reasons for the Astros to be encouraged by
their performance against the Diamondbacks, who had won 10 of 13
games before running into trouble in Houston. The Astros hit .293
in the four-game series and outscored their guests 27-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bats woke up,'' said Derek Bell, who had one of the
Astros' 12 hits. ``We knew it was just a matter of time. The
Diamondbacks came in at the wrong time. We're starting to jell, and
we're starting to get our confidence back again. With the offense
we have, we know we can come and get you if we fall behind.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few mistakes Hampton made put the Astros behind early
when Williams crushed the first pitch of the second inning for a
homer. But Hampton regrouped, facing the minimum number of hitters
in innings three through seven and allowing just three hits after
the home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to limit my mistakes and go after the
hitters,'' said Hampton, who rang up a season-high seven
strikeouts. ``I was able to throw my sinker to both sides of the
plate, and it had good bite on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the best command I've had all season; even the balls
that missed didn't miss by much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (2-1) barely missed hitting the first home run of his
career but gladly settled for a two-run double off the
left-center-field fence in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks starter Omar Daal created a mess for himself by
issuing back-to-back two-out walks to Tony Eusebio and Tim Bogar.
Daal worked Hampton to a two-strike count but couldn't finish the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made me look silly on strike two,'' said Hampton, who
pushed the RBI total for the pitching staff to 10. ``I was just
lucky enough to get a hit. All of us pitchers take pride in our
hitting. We take a lot of extra batting practice, and we want to do
whatever we can to help ourselves out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton also was in the middle of the Astros' three-run rally in
the sixth. After Bogar singled home Carl Everett, Daal (2-2) hit
Hampton to load the bases for Craig Biggio with two out.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to assume many among the 21,506 spectators expected
Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter to make a pitching change,
since Vladimir Nunez was warming up. But Showalter decided to let
Daal take his chances with Biggio, a career .429 hitter against the
young lefthander.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio rapped a two-run double to left-center, pushing the
Astros' lead to four runs. Arizona scored an unearned run in the
eighth.

 &HT;    Smoltz vs. Avery to be `awkward'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former teammates, who are also golfing partners and
friends, take the mound tonight _ John Smoltz for the Braves and
Steve Avery for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be kind of awkward,'' said Smoltz, whose parents live 25
minutes from Avery in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, the 1991 NLCS MVP for the Braves, has faced his former
team once since he left after the 1996 season. Tom Glavine was
pitching. Avery gave up five earned runs in 3.1 innings in a 7-3
Braves win on Aug. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a chance very often to go through that what we
went through with the core of guys we did _ David Justice, Marquis
Grissom, Avery, (Jeff) Blauser, (Mark) Lemke, (Kent) Mercker,''
Smoltz said. ``With them playing for other teams, you want them to
do well, apart from tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine relief
</P>
<P>
   Glavine is hoping that the win he got Wednesday night, his first
of the season to prevent his first ever 0-4 start, is a sign of
things to come. ``I rely a lot on feel of my pitches,'' Glavine
said. ``The last three games I've felt pretty good about it. Now
it's a matter of going out and doing it consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Braves strength and conditioning coach Frank Fultz has invented
the ``forearm builder,'' a weight machine that some of the Braves'
big boppers like Brian Jordan, Javy Lopez and Ryan Klesko are using
to build up their forearm muscles.
</P>
<P>
   The machine has players stand on a platform and turn a bar to
lift weight up and back down a pulley system. Fultz said he got the
idea talking to hitters like Hank Aaron, who stressed the
importance of having strong forearms.

 &HT;    Commanding Maddux is 4-0
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Greg Maddux isn't just about good pitching anymore.
</P>
<P>
   His presence on the mound has come to evoke offensive onslaughts
by the Braves. Or so it has so far this season, and Thursday night
was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Using a three-hit, three-RBI night by Bret Boone and a three-run
homer by Andruw Jones, Maddux again got healthy run support and
another win, beating the Pirates 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux is 4-0 for the first time in his four-Cy Young inclusive
career. And he's gotten there with help from 11, 3, 20, 8 and now 8
Brave runs. Unlike his past two outings, Maddux didn't give up much
on the other side, scattering 10 hits and one run over eight
innings. He had a season-high seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux got a big hit from Bret Boone, who drove in a pair of
runs in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had runners at second and third with one out when
Boone lined a 3-2 pitch from Pirates starter Jose Silva into right
field to score both runners for a 3-1 lead. Boone had had four hits
in his previous eight at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was getting hit, like he's been doing in all four of his
previous starts (opponents were hitting .306 against him coming
in). Pirates shortstop Pat Meares had two hits off Maddux in the
first three innings and drove in the first run for the Pirates in
the third inning. He was down 0-2 in the count with two outs after
he swung through a pitch as Jason Kendall stole second base. On the
next pitch he golfed a low ball into center field to score Kendall,
the rare catcher with good speed.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux got his own rally started when he led off the next
half-inning with a liner to right, his fourth hit of the season in
his first 10 at-bats. After Otis Nixon reached on a fielder's
choice, Boone kept the rally alive with a grounder past Ed Sprague,
and Chipper Jones made it count by driving in the 1-1 tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Jones grounded to Meares, but he bobbled the ball at short,
which slowed the potential double play down just enough to where
Jones could reach first base safely and Nixon could score with two
outs.
</P>
<P>
   Silva was making his first start of the season, fresh off the
disabled list after getting hit in the face by a batted ball during
spring training. It's just the latest in a steady stream of
injuries that have stunted an otherwise very promising young
pitching career.
</P>
<P>
   When he's healthy, he's been good. National League rookie of the
year kind of good last year. He started 1998, his first full season
in the majors, 6-3 with a 3.44 ERA in his first 14 starts before he
broke his wrist trying to bunt. He missed almost three months.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing a mid-90s fastball and a good curveball, Silva kept the
Braves quiet outside of one run over the first four innings with
four strikeouts in that time, three of them looking.

VAUGHN'S TIMING IS SPECIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Mo Vaughn loves pressure. Just ask him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in those situations,'' he said Thursday after
helping the Angels break a 10-10 tie late Wednesday with the
Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's two-run blast in the eighth inning spurred the team to
a 12-10 win and marked the fourth time this season the Angels won
in their last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   So far this season, Vaughn has picked up RBI in game-tying or
game-winning situations four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's special, there's no doubt about it,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``That's why he's great. He sees the ball and
drives through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had two homers in Wednesday's win, and Collins was quick
to note that both came off left-handers David Wells and Graeme
Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are outstanding pitchers,'' Collins said. `But when
(Vaughn) gets in that box, he's got the ability to go against
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Holy cow:So what was going on in the Angels' dugout as the team
watched a 10-0 lead go down the drain?
</P>
<P>
   No much, according to Collins. When asked if he had much to say
to players and coaches during the course of Wednesday's game, he
replied: ``What did I say? `Holy cow. The lead's slipping away.'''
</P>
<P>
   Couch potatoes:Proof that professional wrestling has a wide
audience could be found in the Blue Jays' clubhouse before
Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Several players crowded around a big screen watching an ESPN
special on wrestling, shouting out the names of big-time wrestlers
when they appeared onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a small portable TV showed the Kansas City-Baltimore
game. No one was watching.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Jose Cruz admits to being a huge wrestling fan.
Beneath his batting practice jersey, he always wears a T-shirt
proclaiming his allegiance to wrestling's New World Order, also
known as the Wolfpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right baby, the Wolfpack is in the house,'' Cruz
proclaimed before grabbing a bat and heading to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's spot: Angels fans can expect to see Garret Anderson
in center field for the remainder of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made some great catches out there,'' Collins said. `He's
playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three seasons, Anderson has played left, right and
center, filling in for injured players.

WIDOW OF FORMER FRENCH PRESIDENT SCHEDULES VISIT WITH LEAVENWORTH
INMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Indian activist Leonard Peltier sat Thursday in the
paneled visiting room of the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth and
pondered what might come from his visit Friday with the widow of a
late president of France. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Mitterrand, human rights activist and widow of Francois
Mitterrand, is president of the human rights organization France
Libertes, in Paris. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She is coming to investigate Peltier's allegations that the
prison has not adequately treated health problems that have stemmed
from a tetanus infection. A press conference in Leavenworth is
scheduled to follow her visit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see what happens,'' said Peltier, 54. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, the hum from the room's fluorescent lights competed
with his soft voice. Rarely did he open his mouth, concealed by a
gray mustache, more than a centimeter. Lockjaw, he said, has kept
it shut. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping...(her visit) will bring some attention to my case
and my health and perhaps get some proper treatment for my medical
condition,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Peltier, who has a Chippewa, Lakota and French
bloodline, was convicted in the 1975 slayings of two FBI agents on
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Peltier admits to firing shots that day, he and his
supporters, who number in the thousands and include notables such
as actor Robert Redford, have long said he did not shoot FBI agents
Jack Coler and Ronald Williams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I still maintain my innocence,'' he said Thursday. ``I didn't
do it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a 1992 appeal, government prosecutors answered charges that
Peltier's case was mishandled by claiming that, although no one saw
Peltier shoot the agents, there was strong evidence connecting
Peltier to the murder weapon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most of a 45-minute interview on Thursday, Peltier, who
contracted tetanus when he stepped on a rusty nail as a child,
discussed his health. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Peltier began to have trouble opening his
mouth, so he asked prison officials to send him to the U.S. Medical
Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield. But, Peltier said, two
surgeries he had in April and May that year made the condition
worse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He began to suffer headaches, earaches and watery eyes, symptoms
that Peltier said continue. The only foods he says he can swallow
are soft and starchy, something he thinks has caused him to gain
weight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure been eating a lot of pastries,'' he said, chuckling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, a doctor at the Springfield medical center told
Peltier he thought he could fix his problems. Peltier refused, he
said, because he didn't think anything could be done at
Springfield. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every six months since, Peltier said, he has asked officials at
the prison if he could seek treatment at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., where the U.S. Bureau of Prisons has another
medical facility. Officials have told him no. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Bob Bennett said Peltier has not submitted an
official written request for treatment from Mayo physicians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A written statement from the Bureau of Prisons says that a
``thorough review of inmate Peltier's medical record reveals he is
being provided appropriate medical attention addressing both his
medical complaints and his medical condition.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The statement says that after a recent teleconference between
Peltier and medical officials at Springfield and Leavenworth,
Peltier's condition was determined to be ``stable,'' and did not
require ``prolonged, intensive treatment.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides Mitterrand's support, the European Parliament passed a
resolution Feb. 11 calling for Peltier to be transferred to a
hospital for ``appropriate medical treatment.'' The Parliament
restated its plea for the United States to grant Peltier clemency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The national office of the Bureau of Prisons has received
thousands of e-mail messages, faxes, letters and phone calls. Some
of the messages claimed to be from people waging hunger strikes to
recognize the fact that Peltier has had trouble eating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wolfson, bureau spokesman, said the messages began late
last year and continued through March: ``He's by far the one inmate
who attracts the most attention.'' &QL;

BREWERS SIGN NOMO

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The pitching-poor Milwaukee Brewers signed former
New York Mets and Dodgers right-hander Hideo Nomo to a minor-league
contract Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers general manager Sal Bando said Nomo will start Sunday
for Double-A Huntsville and join Milwaukee in Florida on Monday.
Nomo could be activated and start next Friday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's trying to catch lightning in a bottle,'' Bando said. ``If
it doesn't work out, there's no financial risk. There's no money we
have to pay. If it looks like he can be competitive and keep us in
games, he'll be with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee is Nomo's third organization in less than two months.
During spring training, he was released by the Mets. He signed a
minor-league contract with the Chicago Cubs on April 2, going 1-1
with a 3.71 ERA in three minor- league starts but was released when
he declined to make another minor-league start.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, 30, is 49-41 with a 3.66 ERA in 123 games. He was 45-36 in
three-plus seasons with the Dodgers, including 13-6 with a 2.54 ERA
en route to being named the National League Rookie of the Year in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's pitching staff entered Thursday 12th in the National
League with a 5.01 ERA. &QL;

TV EPISODES GIVE TRUE-TO-LIVE MESSAGES ABOUT DRUGS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - An 11-year-old girl on ``Cosby'' returns from a
friend's birthday party bombed on spiked punch, and is confronted
by angry adults.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old boy on ``Smart Guy'' wonders if it was wrong to
down a beer because he was worried about embarrassing himself in
front of his peers if he said no.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Wayans Bros.'' character blows an acting audition because he
shows up totally stoned.
</P>
<P>
   Something unusual is happening on television's hottest teen and
pre-teen shows.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are getting drunk, they're getting stoned, and
they're facing consequences.
</P>
<P>
   If these programs seem different - more pointed, more frank -
than their predecessors, there's a good, if not surprising, reason:
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected marriage, television network executives have
united with the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy to
deliver true-to-life messages intended to steer kids away from
drugs, booze and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration has influenced several dozens TV scripts since
last year, including the ``Cosby'' episode on CBS that aired for
the first time on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership began after former Arizona state Sen. Chuck
Blanchard and other staff members of the so-called ``drug czar''
flew to Los Angeles last August to talk to network executives about
potential anti-drug strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The strait-laced visitors from Washington told the network
managers, some of whom were initially reluctant to even take the
meeting, that television could make a huge difference in kids'
perceptions of liquor, marijuana and other controlled substances.
</P>
<P>
   And then something most unexpected happened. The networks, at
least in part, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, Blanchard can only marvel at the result: a
succession of drug and alcohol cautionary tales folded into the
story lines of teen shows such as ``Smart Guy'' and ``Wayans
Bros.'' on The WB network, as well as in mainstream programs such
as ``Cosby'' and ``Home Improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, The WB has tapped its teen talent - James Van Der
Beek, Alyssa Milano, Dylan Neal and others - to star in a series of
public service announcements airing on ``Dawson's Creek'' and other
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-drug episodes, some of which, like ``Cosby'' and the
``Smart Guy,'' are airing for the first time this April and May,
are seldom preachy and don't employ scare tactics like the
hilariously overstated ``Reefer Madness'' that their viewers'
parents may remember. It helps that some of the shows are quite
funny and not, like ``Reefer Madness,'' unintentionally so.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is a scene in a ``Wayans Bros.'' episode
broadcast in November in which main character, Marlon, is being
urged by his brother not to even pretend to smoke pot: ``That's how
it starts, just pretending . . . Next thing you know, you're
directing traffic butt-naked with just a pair of flip-flops.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor was also a key to the April 26 ``Cosby'' in which alcohol
and marijuana show up at 11-year-old Jurnee's birthday party. ``Was
there even a cake at this party?'' asks Bill Cosby's character, a
disbelieving adult.
</P>
<P>
   If you look closely, you may spot the ``Office of National Drug
Control Policy'' listed among the credits on an increasing number
of shows.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar's office, as it is commonly referred to, is best
known for trying to keep drugs out of the country. But the office,
created by Congress in 1988, has been steadily shifting its focus
from curbing the supply of drugs to slowing its demand, especially
among youths.
</P>
<P>
   Drug czar Barry McCaffrey, a retired four-star general, had been
disturbed by a federal study last August showing most teens don't
view any ``great risk'' in smoking marijuana once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly alarming to Blanchard, a former chairman of the
Arizona Senate Judiciary Committee, were the study's implications
for his home state. The study found that one out of six Arizona
youths had used illegal drugs in the past month - especially
marijuana - a rate that was one-third higher than the national
average. Blanchard, 40, left Arizona in 1997 to become McCaffrey's
chief counsel.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey thought it would be worth it to send Blanchard and
another staff member, Alan Levitt, to meet with TV executives.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't expect too much. After all, many in Hollywood
have been suspicious of Washington ever since Wisconsin Sen. Joseph
McCarthy began blacklisting actors, writers and entertainment
executives as part of the ``Red Scare'' of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard recalls sitting with WB executives last August in a
nondescript, one-story building at the Warner Bros. studios in
Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they expected, but it was a pretty cool
reception, quite frankly,'' said John Litvack, WB's senior vice
president for curent programming.
</P>
<P>
   But, slowly, the atmosphere warmed.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Blanchard believes, the drug czar's staff hit a nerve
with programming executives and writers, some of whom have seen
their pals stumble into drugs. Everyone agreed, Blanchard said,
that it was a problem when kids, especially young ones, did drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard and Levitt were careful not to dictate how the network
should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play the role of the flaming bureaucrat saying,
`Don't do this!' Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the pair offered its own research-based strategies for
how television studios might confront the drug problem if they were
so inclined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're human beings, ocasionally,'' Litvack said. ``And
occasionally we get affected by things. There were some executives,
including myself, who got fascinated with certain parts of the
(drug) problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In Litvack's case, his experience as a parent got him excited
about an upcoming ``Smart Guy,'' in which the principal character,
T.J., is a boy genius who has skipped to high school ahead of his
peers. In the May 16 episode, T.J. succumbs to pressure from boys
his own age and gets drunk; his father refuses to believe the boy
is guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My passion for that part of it came out of the fact that when
one of my children (his son) was in grade school, there was a
meeting on drugs, and 11 parents out of 250 attended,'' Litvack
said. ``I said to the headmaster, `What the hell is going on?' And
he said this was par for the course. Everybody is in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of March, the drug czar's office had counted 32
episodes of network entertainment programs that included an
anti-drug message consistent with the office's goals.
</P>
<P>
   But the networks' motives are not merely altrustic. In some
cases, they have a financial incentive as well.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar's media campaign, of which Hollywood outreach is
just a part, has a $185 million budget for this fiscal year. The
office has been spending most of that money buying expensive
television ads - which makes it in the networks' interest to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard says he doesn't care what the networks' reasoning is,
so long as the message gets out.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard tells a personal story to illustrate that at least one
of the shows hit its mark.
</P>
<P>
   His secretary, Tammye Johnson, has a teenage daughter, and the
two watched the Wayans Bros. show not knowing of the office's
involvement. The next day, she wrote a moving e-mail to the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black kids, to me, do not seem to get it unless it comes from
someone who they look up to,'' Johnson's e-mail said. ``Thank you,
Lord.''

FORMER EXECUTIVE SUES ALLIEDSIGNAL OVER FIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former officer of AlliedSignal Electronic &AMP; Avionics Systems
in Olathe, Kan., has sued the company, alleging he was fired for
exposing improper accounting practices that led to big executive
bonuses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Douglas J. Boe filed the lawsuit this week in U.S. District
Court in Kansas City, Kan., against AlliedSignal's Olathe
subsidiary and the parent company in Morris Township, N.J. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the allegations of improper bookkeeping, Boe
contends the company violated the Americans With Disabilities Act
by firing him in part because of a mental disability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe is seeking actual damages in excess of $75,000 and punitive
damages in excess of $10 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal is aware of the lawsuit but does not comment on
litigation as a matter of policy, said John Bernaden, a spokesman
for AlliedSignal EAS in Olathe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Boe also declined to comment Thursday beyond the
lawsuit's contents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe's lawsuit follows a recent companywide restructuring at
AlliedSignal that included the layoff of 150 midlevel managers at
the Olathe facility. The facility, which has 1,500 employees and is
the headquarters of AlliedSignal's electronic and avionics
division, also brought in a new president earlier this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Boe's lawsuit, AlliedSignal hired Boe in May 1995
as division controller and director of finance. He was transferred
to AlliedSignal EAS in July 1996, which at the time was in Lenexa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, the suit says, Boe became concerned about some of
AlliedSignal's financial practices, including the violation of some
generally accepted accounting principles. Violating those
principles would put the company in violation of Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Boe's concerns dealt with restructuring reserves after
AlliedSignal's 1994 acquisition of Sundstrand Data Control Inc.
Sundstrand was a competitor whose operations were consolidated into
AlliedSignal's electronics and avionics division. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe ``believes that these accounting practices were employed so
that Allied could `make the numbers' for the purpose of satisfying
Wall Street's expectations and triggering massive executive
bonuses,'' the lawsuit says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal's most senior executives would not have been
eligible for millions of dollars in personal bonuses if generally
accepted accounting principles had been followed, according to
Boe's allegations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe refused to sign documents attesting to the propriety of
AlliedSignal's financial practices for 1996 and the first quarter
of 1997, the lawsuit says. In April 1997, AlliedSignal informed Boe
that he was being investigated for the allegedly improper financial
practices that he had brought to his supervisor's attention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Boe began seeing a psychiatrist as a result of
mental anguish he was suffering because of his employment
situation, according to the lawsuit. After taking a medical leave
of absence in July 1997, Boe was diagnosed with a permanent mental
disability known as bipolar affective disorder, a manic-depressive
condition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe was assessed by his doctor as well as company doctors as
being fit to return to work in January 1998. However, despite
saying he was willing to transfer to another facility or
department, Boe was never brought back to work by AlliedSignal and
was fired in June 1998, the suit says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe's lawsuit alleges a wrongful discharge, contending the
company fired him because he was a whistle-blower and because of
his mental condition. The latter allegation, if proved true, would
be in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, according
to the lawsuit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal moved into its $40 million Olathe facility in
September, celebrating with a ribbon-cutting attended by the
company's chairman and chief executive officer, Lawrence A.
Bossidy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, who at the time headed AlliedSignal EAS, was
replaced earlier this year by Frank Daly, who came from
AlliedSignal's plant in Redmond, Wash. &QL;

GRAFT IS CONCEDED AND SUHARTO'S FAMILY FEELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Of course there was corruption under former
President Suharto, said his half-brother recently, acknowledging a
fact of life well known to all Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suharto has always protected his corrupt subordinates,'' said
the half-brother, Probosutedjo, who often acted as the former
president's spokesman. ``He got upset when anyone criticized his
officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost a year after he was forced from office last May,
prosecutors are nibbling around the edges of the huge financial
enterprises of Suharto and his family. But many Indonesians
question the government's commitment to serious investigations and
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, 37, known as
Tommy, was in court this week, accused of wrongdoing in a shady
land deal. He is the first member of the family to face prosecution
for graft.
</P>
<P>
   Others of Suharto's six children have been questioned in recent
months about their business dealings and Suharto himself was
questioned in December for three hours, primarily about major
tax-free charitable foundations he controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this what you want?'' Hutomo said bitterly to reporters
as he left a courtroom Monday where a judge refused to drop the
charges. Hutomo has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of supporters shouted from the sidewalk, ``Long
live Tommy!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the case against Hutomo falls far short of the kind of
prosecution that has been demanded by student demonstrators and
other Indonesians. Estimates of the family's wealth have run into
the tens of billions, and although they have lost control of a
number of ventures in the last year, their interests still reach
into many corners of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Hutomo is accused of graft in an $11 million land deal involving
a retail company that is one of the smaller holdings in his
wide-ranging roster of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The most flamboyant of the former president's six children,
Hutomo controlled the country's huge clove industry, was the
recipient from his father of lucrative tax breaks on a failed
``national car'' program, and splurged in 1994 with the $40 million
purchase of the Lamborghini sports car company.
</P>
<P>
   The direction the investigations take may be influenced by the
outcome of a parliamentary election, set for June 7, and the naming
of a new President, expected by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Public mistrust has been fostered by the fact that much of the
current government _ from President B.J. Habibie through Justice
Minister Muladi _ is made up of people who owe their careers to
Suharto and grew wealthy alongside him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Suharto does go to court, it could drag down the
government, bringing senior incumbents and former officials _ as
well as all the cronies suspected of accruing ill-gotten wealth _
into messy litigation,'' Suharto's legal adviser, Yohanes Yacob,
said when the former president was questioned in December.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, Probosutedjo's words acknowledging corruption
within Suharto's circle could be taken as a veiled threat.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, for one, manages a state-financed industrial zone on
Batam Island, near Singapore, that by some estimates was worth $60
million before the crash of the currency, the rupiah, in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, for his part, is by his own account no more than a
humble pensioner, living quietly in the same tree-shaded villa he
occupied as president.
</P>
<P>
   His true holdings, he told a local magazine, Dharmais, amount to
just $3 million deposited in three Indonesian banks as well as two
houses in Jakarta and a small plot of 12 acres of land.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, Suharto said, was the product of nothing more than
investments from his $75,000 annual salary.

HERBERT MAKING HIS RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How important is the crew chief in National Hot Rod Association
drag racing?
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Doug Herbert, who never had finished in the top 10 in
points prior to being associated with veteran tuner Dick LaHaie.
</P>
<P>
   Now with help from LaHaie and assistant crew chief Larry
Frazier, Herbert appears ready to make a run at the Top Fuel
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert credits LaHaie, who won the Top Fuel championship as a
driver in 1987 before tuning Scott Kalitta to back-to-back titles
in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick's made a tremendous difference,'' said Herbert, who comes
into this weekend's Penzoil Nationals at Richmond, Va. a surprising
third in points. ``He likes to take it one step at a time and pick
at it a little bit. We just try to get the car to make consistent
runs and let the competition take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert advanced to the finals at the Gatornationals in March
and won the O'Reilly Nationals in Houston earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a tremendous advantage to have Dick LaHaie as
crew chief,'' said Herbert, a four-time Top Fuel champion in the
IHRA. ``Him being a former driver, he understands what it feels
like to take a ride in a Top Fuel dragster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I joke with him and ask him if he wants to (drive).
He says, `No, I might like it too much.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's back. And that could mean trouble for the rest of the Top
Fuel drivers who watched two-time champion Gary Scelzi win for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Scezli moved from 14th to 10th in the points standings with the
win and now trails leader Mike Dunn by 174.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, does it feel good to get down the track and back in
victory lane,'' said Scelzi, who made five runs in the 4.50-second
bracket and defeated Tony Schumacher in the finals of the Lone Star
Nationals near Dallas. ``Dallas was really a do-or-die situation
for (us). We knew we were at the point that we couldn't afford to
make any more mistakes, we couldn't afford to lose in the first
round, and we definitely don't ever want to go through not
qualifying ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher, who comes into this weekend's national event second
in points, donated the $2,500 bonus he won for being Friday night's
low qualifier to Columbine High School, the site of last week's
shooting in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was devastating to a lot of good people,'' said
Schumacher, who roared to a 4.596 pass. ``We stay in Littleton when
we race at the Mopar Mile High Nationals (in Denver) and it's an
All-American town with All-American people. We're going to do our
best for them.''

CAMERON WINS POLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA -- The general consensus was one of three NASCAR Winston
Cup regulars would be on the pole for Saturday's NASCAR Winston
West 200.
</P>
<P>
   Someone forgot to tell Austin Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron, who finished second in last year's July Winston West
event at California Speedway, was the surprise polesitter Thursday
with a track-record lap of 39.853 seconds, or 180.664 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup veteran Ken Schrader, who won this event in 1997 and
last year, was a close second at 180.659. Mike Chase will start
third after posting a lap speed of 179.910.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup regulars Ricky Craven (179.551) and Mike Wallace
(178.585) were fifth and ninth, respectively. West Covina's St.
James Davis and El Monte's Kenny Smith failed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we left the shop Wednesday, we thought we would have a
good shot (at the pole),'' Cameron said. ``Then we heard that
Schrader was going to run. Then Craven and Wallace. I said, 'Oh,
man. It just got a whole lot tougher.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So to beat these guys, it means a lot to me. It's a learning
experience every time I go out. (The Winston Cup regulars) are paid
drivers and I just want to follow in their footsteps. I'm just
happy to run with them, so to out-qualify them ... wow. I'm
ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron, whose posted a 39.724 lap in practice, also did not
seem to be affected by being the first car to qualify. He even may
have been helped by his draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big change in the weather,'' said Cameron, who
finished second at a NASCAR Super Late Model event at Irwindale
Speedway earlier this month. ``I think (going first) was to our
benefit. There was good horsepower air when I went out and my car
really loosened up. Good cold air means more horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky because it got breezy later and I think that may
have bothered the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Others to qualify included Chino Hills Butch Gilliland
(seventh), Saugus Sean Woodside (15th) and Joe Bean (23rd), who
drives for Glendora businessman Joe Nava.

H&AMP;R BLOCK ENJOYS `GOOD TAX SEASON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block Inc. said Thursday that its U.S. tax service revenue
jumped 15 percent this season, to $1.5 billion, as more people
sought help because of changes in federal tax laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Block, based in Kansas City, also reported that it filed a
record 11 million electronic returns for clients and customers
between Jan. 1 and April 15, which is 18.2 percent more than a year
ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it was a good tax season for us,'' Frank L.
Salizzoni, the company's president and chief executive, said in a
statement released with the numbers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe changes to the tax code, like the new child tax and
education credits, combined with a more strategic marketing
campaign, drove additional clients to our offices,'' Salizzoni
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 16.1 million clients, or 4.8 percent more than last
year, came to more than 8,900 U.S. tax service offices operated by
Block and its franchisees, the company said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The average fee increased 9.7 percent to $92.57, about
two-thirds of which is because of the increased complexity of the
forms that taxpayers filed, the company said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Block said it planned to release full results for the fiscal
year ending today around June 15. &QL;

N.J. TO SEEK SETTLEMENT WITH U.S. ON RACE PROFILING BY POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs 13th graf to clarify what charges were in 3 cities)  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ohio)   (bl)  
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. - Trying to forestall a federal civil rights
lawsuit, New Jersey Attorney General Peter Verniero said Thursday
that the state had agreed to negotiate a settlement with federal
officials over allegations that state police engaged in widespread
racial profiling against black and Hispanic motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general acted after the U.S. Justice
Department's Civil Rights Division informed him and Gov. Christie
Whitman in a letter Monday that it had turned up enough evidence
that state troopers used race as a basis for stopping and searching
drivers to warrant a lawsuit against the state police.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said that federal
officials deferred filing the complaint after New Jersey officials
agreed late Wednesday night to work out a voluntary out-of-court
settlement known as a consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   Such an agreement would almost certainly require the appointment
of a civilian agency to monitor the force, a point the Justice
Department has insisted on in similar cases, as well as stricter
regulations on how troopers handle stops and searches in suspected
drug cases.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing its complaint against New Jersey, the Justice
Department was invoking a rarely used provision of the 1994 federal
anti-crime law, which authorizes the government to file civil
lawsuits against police departments that ``engage in patterns of
misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only two law enforcement agencies _ the police
departments in Pittsburgh and in Steubenville, Ohio _ have agreed
to consent decrees, said Christine DiBartolo, the Justice
Department spokeswoman, and the police department in Columbus,
Ohio, is currently negotiating a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey State Police is the first statewide law
enforcement agency to enter into such discussions, and with 2,700
officers, it is the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DiBartolo would not provide details of the Justice
Department investigation or say how its findings differed from a
report released by Verniero last week, which found that officers in
at least two police barracks _ in Moorestown and Cranbury _ engaged
in racial profiling. ``His report is a good start for
negotiations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But a more senior official in the Justice Department said that
the federal investigation roughly mirrored the one that Verniero's
office conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may not be much of a disparity,'' said the official, a
lawyer who spoke on the condition that he not be identified by name
or title. ``Much of our focus was on the same area of I-95 that
they identified in their report. We had the focus also on the
Moorestown and Cranbury stations, and that certainly was the focus
of many of the complaints of motorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The official also said that in the letter to state officials,
the Justice Department had agreed that some of the remedies that
Verniero suggested in his report on racial profiling were ``a
starting point'' for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Those recommendations include revising the procedure for traffic
stops, including requiring that a trooper inform the dispatcher
about the exact reason for the stop before the officer leaves the
car; focusing the statewide drug enforcement strategy on larger
``impact cases'' rather than on pursuing more random ``targets of
opportunity'' like individual passenger vehicles; and making
quarterly public reports on the proportion of minority and
non-minority motorists who are subject to various actions by state
police.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not recommend an independent civilian agency to
monitor problems, a provision that the Justice Department has
insisted on in Pittsburgh, where the complaints involved police
brutality, and in Steubenville.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, part of the settlement included hiring an
independent auditor to monitor investigations of complaints and
compliance with the consent decree. The monitor also was required
to issue regular reports to the court, the local government and the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In sending the letter to the Whitman administration this week,
the government was effectively signaling the end to the Justice
Department's investigation into the practices of the New Jersey
State Police. The inquiry was initiated two years ago after civil
rights leaders and Democratic members of the state's congressional
delegation complained that members of minority groups were being
unfairly singled out in traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, New Jersey's quick agreement to settle the case
suggests that officials here were eager to to quiet one of the
worst political storms the governor has faced.
</P>
<P>
   After denying for years that troopers engaged in racial
profiling, Whitman acknowledged April 20 that a two-month
investigation initiated by Verniero had shown that some officers
routinely stopped and searched some black and Hispanic motorists
solely because of race.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over racial profiling has not only clouded Whitman's
image at the time she is gearing up for a U.S. Senate race next
year, but it has become a major issue in her nomination of Verniero
to serve on the state Supreme Court. Confirmation hearings on
Verniero's nomination begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   The administration acknowledged the consent decree agreement in
a four-paragraph statement that was issued by Verniero.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of
Justice has authorized the filing of a civil suit against the
Division of the State Police alleging that State Police officers
have engaged in discriminatory law enforcement,'' Verniero said in
his statement. ``As a matter of practice, it is my understanding
that this is a necessary procedural step that must be taken by the
Justice Department in order for a settlement to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Verniero would not release the letter that the Justice
Department sent to the state, a decision that rekindled the bitter
partisan fighting over both the issue of racial profiling and his
nomination to the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's apparent that the Justice Department has sufficient
evidence to file a civil rights suit,'' said Democratic state
Senate Minority Leader Richard Codey. ``Our concern is whether this
material, like the other evidence, is something Verniero should
have known about and stopped long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Reginald Jackson, the executive director of the Black
Ministers' Conference of New Jersey, a group that has been at the
forefront of complaints about racial profiling, said that a senior
official in the Justice Department called him Thursday to inform
him of the developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that they had sufficient evidence to file a lawsuit
against the state,'' said Jackson. ``I think the federal government
knows it is a much deeper problem than what Verniero's report
showed. They would not have threatened a lawsuit if it was simply
the matter of a small number of troopers conducting racial
profiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson would not identify the Justice Department official he
spoke with by name or job description, but he said the official
promised that the black ministers would be involved in any
settlement that the federal government reached with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I applaud the governor and the attorney general for agreeing
to a consent decree and I hope that they can reach an agreement
that will end profiling,'' he said. ``But one of the things we will
recommend is that an outside monitor be appointed to watch the
state police.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they would meet with state police
officials next week to begin negotiations.

NO SUICIDE LINK TO KILLER'S DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luvox, the drug taken by Eric Harris, one of the two students
involved in the Colorado school massacre, belongs to the same class
of antidepressants as Prozac, Zoloft and other newer medicines used
to treat depression and a variety of other psychiatric conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Luvox was approved by the Food and Drug Administration
specifically for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,
many doctors also prescribe it for depression, and the drug is
marketed as an antidepressant in Europe. The product is marketed by
Solvay Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Because people who suffer from depression have a high risk of
suicide, Luvox, like other antidepressants, comes with the routine
warning that ``close supervision of high-risk patients should
accompany initial drug therapy.'' But there is no clear evidence
linking its class of drugs, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, with increased suicide risk, psychiatrists say.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are considered by many doctors to be safer for
potentially suicidal patients than older antidepressants, because
patients have taken large overdoses in suicide attempts and have
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Also like most other antidepressants, Luvox often comes with a
warning about the use of alcohol when taking the drug. But doctors
said that, as a practical matter, many patients drink in moderation
while taking SSRIs with no bad consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Psychopharmacologists said that stopping such drugs abruptly
might cause nausea, diarrhea, nervousness, muscle jerks and tremor,
but that the symptoms usually disappeared after a week or so.

FORD DROPS FACTORY PLAN FOR BRAZIL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   (jw) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In a decision highlighting how government
overspending has hampered foreign investment in Brazil, Ford Motor
Co. has abandoned plans to build an innovative $1 billion factory
in a southern Brazilian state, which refused to honor a pledge to
provide the company with financial incentives because of a budget
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, which said it might search for another site for its
factory, called the Project Amazon, made the announcement in a
statement Wednesday after a month of negotiating with the
government of Rio Grande do Sul, a state on Brazil's southern tip
controlled by the opposition Workers Party. Ford already assembles
cars at other factories in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Citing an annual budget shortfall of roughly 1.2 billion reais,
or $723 million, Rio Grande do Sul officials reneged on an
agreement between the state's previous administration and Ford,
which would have provided the car manufacturer with about $250
million in financing and infrastructure to complete the factory by
2001. Ford had hoped to produce as many 150,000 cars a year at the
plant, providing the region, an industrial hub with convenient
links to Brazil's neighboring trade partners, with at least 1,500
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just lost one of the most important companies in the
world,'' said Paulo Antonio Zawislak, an economics professor at the
Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul who has studied the impact
of recent automotive investments in the state. ``Unfortunately,
this happens at a time when our state was emerging at the forefront
of Brazil's auto industry.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp., which is nearing completion of its own
futuristic factory in Rio Grande do Sul, has also been in
negotiations with officials over incentives for its plant. Although
the differences with Rio Grande do Sul have resulted in a six-month
delay in the inauguration of the factory, now pushed back to
mid-2000, both state and company officials have said there is
little chance that GM will abandon the factory for another
location.

demanded money. They forced him onto the floor of the Waldo Pet
Center and ripped a gold chain from his neck. They demanded his
wallet. They kicked him in the face for lifting his head. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your head down! I'll kill you! This ain't no game!'' the
robbers shouted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew I was dead,'' the clerk said Thursday, recounting
Wednesday night's robbery at the store, 8011 Wornall Road. ``My day
was gone. These guys were not joking around.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So when he saw an opportunity to grab his assailants' gun he
took it. In the struggle that followed, the clerk shot one of the
robbers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood over him and asked for my chain back and he gave it
back,'' the clerk said. ``I was mad. I said, `Why do you rob
people?' He apologized. He said the other guy made him do it. I
didn't know how hard he was shot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The robber died later at a hospital. The second man fled into a
nearby residential area and had not been caught as of Thursday
night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was instinct, maybe it was stupid,'' said the clerk,
39, who was not being identified because the other robber was still
at large. ``I don't know. I saw an opening and I took the gun.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police on Thursday identified the dead man as Arthur
Nelson, 18. Police said they think they know who the other man is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was on probation for a January marijuana conviction. He
had several traffic tickets pending. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame this happened, but I wasn't the one who started
this,'' said the clerk, who has worked at the store for 12 years.
``I'm just trying to run a good business. This could have been a
bloodbath.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The robbery occurred shortly before the store's 9 p.m. closing
time. About six customers and five employees were still in the
building when the robbers walked into the store wearing sweatshirts
with hoods. They had pantyhose pulled over their faces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They were screaming, yelling in my face,'' the clerk said of
the robbers. `` `Give me your wallet, get on the ground, keep your
head down. I'll kill you.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After they took money from a cash register and three customers,
the robbers started to leave. Then they noticed another register
toward the back of the store. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The one with the gun put the gun on me,'' the store clerk
said. `` `Open it up. I'll kill you.' It was a bad scene.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The clerk was standing to the side of the robber at the second
cash register when he realized the man's peripheral vision was
blocked by his hood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The clerk lunged for the gun.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was holding him and they were both trying to get me,'' said
the clerk who, at 6 feet, 3 inches and 230 pounds, was bigger than
both of the robbers. ``We were yelling and hitting and punching. He
was waving the gun. I don't know what I was thinking.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once the clerk had the gun, the robbers fled. The clerk, who
said he owns guns and knows how to use them, fired two shots,
hitting one of the robbers in the back. He fell near the front
door, but stood up and stumbled back into the store before falling
on the floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He got up again and ran outside when he heard an employee
calling 911. He collapsed in the parking lot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police said the robbers fit the description of two men who have
robbed three other businesses on or near Wornall Road since April
22. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Robberies are fairly frequent around here,'' said Kevin
Alexander, an employee with Parts America, up the road from Waldo
Pet Center. ``It's not an easy feeling. I open, I close. You got
this on your mind.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors will decide whether to charge the pet store clerk
when police forward the case to their office next week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely sensitive to people in peril who have to
defend themselves,'' said Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird,
adding that prosecutors and state laws do not lean toward criminal
charges in such cases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under Missouri's self-defense law a person can use force to
protect against serious injury or robbery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely dangerous endeavor,'' Beaird said of
fighting back. ``Money is replaceable; lives are not.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The store clerk said he did what he had to do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be no hero; I was just thinking about saving
everybody else's life,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad deal. I feel sorry for the guy's mom, because
they're going to have to deal with it, but there is no doubt in my
mind they were going to kill me.'' &QL;

TRADE GROUP FACES DEADLINE ON CHOOSING NEW LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ With only hours left before a deadline
expires Friday to choose a new leader of the World Trade
Organization, bruising divisions and mistrust among member nations
were keeping them from reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from the 134-country organization that sets the rules
for global commerce planned a meeting later Friday to try once
again to find room for compromise on a choice between Mike Moore, a
former New Zealand prime minister, and Supachai Panitchpakdi,
Thailand's deputy prime minister. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision has taken on an urgency because Friday is the last
work day for the current director general, Renato Ruggiero, raising
the possibility that the organization will be leaderless just as it
is struggling with some contentious trade issues, ranging from
European-American disputes on bananas and beef to China's prolonged
quest to become a member.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership crisis also comes as the organization is planning
a ministerial meeting of all member nations in November that will
revise world trade regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Ruggiero has said that once his four-year term expires, ``I will
not serve another day.'' The contracts of Ruggiero's four deputy
directors general also expire Friday, adding to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Although member representatives vowed not to repeat the lengthy,
disruptive process that surrounded the selection of Ruggiero, a
former Italian trade minister, the selection this time has been
similar. Accusations of undue influence, trading favors and
arm-twisting have swirled around the process, creating an
atmosphere of tension and mistrust, a number of trade diplomats
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has gotten sufficiently unpleasant that a negotiator from one
important trading country supporting Moore has stopped talking to
diplomats of another nation backing Supachai.
</P>
<P>
   In part, such stresses reflect how the selection is made, which
is by consensus. All countries, or at least most, are expected to
agree on one candidate without resorting to a vote, which would put
countries on record as supporters or opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking behind the process is that all countries are equal
at the world's trade regulatory body, and that huge trading blocs
like the European Union and the United States do not have
disproportionate influence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the organization is quite likely to avoid a
confrontational vote, the matter of numbers has been crucial in the
race for director general. Both sides have been using them to make
their case.
</P>
<P>
   Supachai's supporters released figures that 65 percent of
members back him. While there is no official tally, Moore's camp
says it is ``very close'' and many diplomats agree. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The true indication of who can win will come when countries with
actual objections to one candidate or the other are flushed out.
Until now, countries can decline to join a consensus, on the ground
that they have reservations about a candidate without going on the
public record. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the only people who really knew the true position
of countries were Ali Mchumo, the trade representative from
Tanzania and chairman of the organization's general council, who
has been conducting the search, and Switzerland's trade diplomat,
William Rossier.
</P>
<P>
   Mchumo, who has tried to meet several deadlines for finding a
new director general, declared earlier this month that April 30 was
the ``ultimate deadline.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once Mchumo declares that a consensus has been formed around one
candidate, any objecting countries will have to accept his decision
or declare their objections publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mchumo will then have to explain just how he arrived at his
consensus,'' one trade diplomat explained. ``If he selects Moore,
for example, his only out is to say that the objections to Supachai
were weightier than those for Moore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Supachai supporters are likely to feel cheated,'' he added,
because of the amount of his declared support and because many
believe the organization should have a representative from a
developing country as director general.
</P>
<P>
   Supachai, who arrived in Geneva on the eve of the deadline, is
said to have the backing of nearly all Asian countries, about half
the European countries, including Britain, and many African
countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who has been in Geneva since last week, says he has
support from the United States, France, Italy and Germany as well
as Latin American, Caribbean and some African countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, even if one candidate is declared victorious, emotions
are running so high there is a good chance that he will be
effectively vetoed. This would leave the trade organization in an
unprecedented situation.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is the appointment of an interim director
general drawn from the organization's administrative staff or from
a member nation considered neutral in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could appoint the man-in-the-moon,'' one envoy said.
``There are no rules at that point.''

IN THE AFTERMATH OF LITTLETON, COPYCAT THREATS AND CONCERNS FOR
SCHOOL SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS lede to add reference to 5 Brooklyn teen-agers charged with
conspiracy; Moves graf 3 in original (``In Taber, Alberta...'')
down to 2nd take, 3rd graf; adds 2 grafs to end on charges against
4 students from Wimberley, Texas.  (sw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 14-year-old boy was charged with murder in Canada, five
Brooklyn youths were accused of conspiracy, a pipe bomb was found
in an Oklahoma school and school districts across the nation were
on heightened alert on Thursday as bomb threats, talk of hit lists
and fears of more violence in the wake of the Littleton, Colo.,
massacre continued to ripple outward.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days after the horrific shootings at Columbine High School,
there were new reports of threats, of schools evacuated, of police
officers patrolling in hallways, of young people being arrested or
suspended on suspicion of plotting to blow up their schools or to
kill or maim their classmate-enemies.
</P>
<P>
   As the last of the victims' funerals unfolded in Littleton on
Thursday, many Americans were talking about school safety, gun
control, the effect of violence in movies and video games and a
disturbing series of crimes that could have been touched off by
malicious or disturbed copycats.
</P>
<P>
   But actual violence and real bombs have been rare,
law-enforcement officials and educators say, and what has been
stalking the schools is an inordinate fear of death _ largely
fueled by the terrible images of Littleton _ that has reached
epidemic proportions in a nation that seems to have no choice but
to overreact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to react to every little thing now because we can't
separate the real from the imagined,'' said Pat Lewis,
superintendent of the school district in Coalinga, Calif., where
two boys were arrested this week for saying they wanted to blow up
their schools. ``We take no chances. Safety comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere of extraordinary tension, daily calls from
worried parents have soared in thousands of schools across the
country; teachers have begun to lock classroom doors after tardy
bells; guards are being posted in schools at night to watch for
skulduggery, and dark trenchcoats like those worn by the killers in
Littleton are being banned, with violators suspended or arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the strains, people with real or fanciful grudges have
taken advantage of the tragedy by making anonymous bomb threats by
phone, by leaving apocalyptic notes in school bathrooms or on the
Internet. Some websites have foretold widespread school attacks for
Friday, the anniversary of the death of Adolf Hitler. Authorities
have said they had to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teen-agers have been branded as snitches for voicing
suspicions or telling of overheard threats, while students have
been arrested for casual remarks made on a school bus, or threats
mumbled in response to a teacher's reprimand. Most students have
been warned in recent days that even joking about bombs and guns
will land them in a police station.
</P>
<P>
   But in a nation with some 50 million students in 108,000 public
schools in which violent deaths have been extremely rare and
declining for years, the turmoil and anguish in the aftermath of
the killings in Colorado appeared to be necessary, both as a
precaution and a catharsis, some law-enforcement officials and
education experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Littleton, less than 1 percent of the schools across
the country have experienced a violent death on campus in the last
seven years,'' June Arnette, associate director of the National
School Safety Center, in Westlake, Calif., said. ``You're talking
about numbers too small to generalize.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added: ``Since Littleton, there has been a ripple
effect. Schools everywhere are in a panic mode, receiving bomb
threats, threats of terrorist attacks. Nobody can ignore those
things. Whether or not schools are safe is not the issue. It's the
perception of safety at this point that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools were still the safest place for kids outside the home,
Ms. Arnette said, but she added: ``We did witness what happened at
Columbine and we can't feel we're totally insulated. We can't hide
our head in the sand and say it's not going to happen here, so
let's not become complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be the rational of school and law-enforcement
authorities in dozens of states and thousands of school districts
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Diego area, where one suburban high school was
evacuated because of a bomb threat on Thursday, police officers
were on patrol in and around 560 schools with 461,000 students, and
school administrators said they were taking Internet threats on the
anniversary of Hitler's death seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, daily calls to a state Education Department safety
hotline have jumped 40 percent since the Littleton killings,
officials said. Some have told of students wearing black trench
coats, but most have told of students bullying or using threatening
language or of notes, some containing purpored hit lists of people
to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something going on all around the state,'' said Jeff
Hodges, the school safety coordinator for the Georgia Department of
Education. ``We have kids taking advantage of a tragic situation.
You have to follow up and take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In Richmond, Ill., a town of 450 near the Wisconsin border,
Police Chief Charles E. Weidner said a 17-year-old was suspended
from school, and might be expelled, for talking about making a pipe
bomb. ``Don't come to school on Monday, you're too pretty to die,''
the youth told a girl. As the story spread, the police received 10
calls about the boy, and a bomb squad swept through his school and
home, finding nothing harmful. ``The kid was very apologetic,'' the
chief said. ``I feel sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens of more serious threats in the Chicago area.
At a private school in suburban Oak Lawn, a 15-year-old was
arrested after telling two girls he was going to kill the principal
and a student and plant bombs in the school. He was arrested on a
juvenile misdemeanor charge. Rumors of a planned shooting led to
the cancellation of a pep rally at another school, in Carol Stream,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In Taber, Alberta, a town southeast of Calgary, a gunman too
young to be identified was charged with the murder and attempted
murder of two 17-year-olds Wednesday in an incident eerily like the
Colorado killings. And in Enid, Okla., a pipe bomb was found in a
school bathroom, though no one was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, N.Y., five 13-year-old boys, all eighth-graders who
were charged on Wednesday with conspiracy to blow up the McKinley
Junior High School, were released to their parents. The boys were
overheard discussing a bomb plot, and, after being turned in by a
fellow student, were found to be in possession of a bomb-making
manual, though no explosives were uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   But in Fairport, N.Y., near Rochester, the police said they
confiscated gunpowder, propane and bomb-making books at the home of
a 12-year-old sixth grader who they said had been plotting for some
time to blow up his middle school. The boy was suspended, but is
unlikely to face criminal charges because ``it isn't illegal for a
kid or an adult to possess any of the equipment or items he had,''
Police Chief Brian Page said.
</P>
<P>
   In Danforth Junior High School in Wimberley, Texas, where four
eighth-grade students were charged last week with plotting to blow
up the school, life was beginning to return to normal, despite the
presence of a bomb-sniffing dog in the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody overreacted,'' Megan Baker, 15, a ninth-grader,
said. ``I think it was just the wrong time. People would have let
it go if it hadn't happened so soon after the thing in Colorado.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JOCKEYS SIGN FOR A DOLLAR AND A DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The rain left town and the sun came out and it
finally felt like spring, like Kentucky Derby week at Churchill
Downs. But for a couple of hours Thursday, the race became
secondary for about half the jockeys in the 20-horse field. The
potential winnings, from Saturday's 125th running of the most
famous horse race there is, mattered less than a few jars stuffed
with one dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   The jars sat on tables set up under the grandstand, out by the
paddock, affixed with yellow stickers asking autograph seekers for
a suggested donation of $1. At a time when people attach gross
inflationary value to almost anything with an athlete's signature
scribbled on it, this was a bargain in the name of benevolence.
</P>
<P>
   The cash would go straight into the Disabled Jockeys Fund, a
collection that doesn't require much explanation, only a heart. The
Jockeys Guild stages a number of promotional events around the
country to help stock the fund, which was begun in the early 1990s
and supports those who have lost livelihoods and limbs in the
matter of a horse's misstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 2,700 jockeys registered nationwide, and there
were 2,500 reported injuries last year,'' said John Giovanni, the
Guild's national manager and secretary. ``Most of the jockeys know
it's not a matter of if, it is a matter of when.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the only question is how bad it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to complain when you fall off your horse and you wind
up losing the hearing in your right ear, like I did, but who do you
complain to when you see people who never got up again to walk?''
said Kent Desormeaux, last year's Derby and Preakness winner aboard
Real Quiet, who Saturday will ride the touted filly Excellent
Meeting for the trainer Bob Baffert, unless she runs Friday in the
Kentucky Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux's time came in December 1992, riding Judge Hammer at
Hollywood Park. He fell in the lead, which made him an obstacle to
the field. The last horse to pass kicked him in the head. He awoke
30 hours later, would get to see the son his wife was soon to give
birth to and would reclaim his career and come within a nose of a
Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes last June.
</P>
<P>
   The 51 disabled jockeys currently under the care of the fund
weren't as lucky. They lost their careers, their ability to walk. A
jockey named Linda Hughes was recently confined to a wheelchair
after a fall at Calder Race Course in Florida. She has a daughter
to raise, a $100,000 on-track insurance policy for her medical
costs and a weekly $200 disability check. The money goes fast, and
the unforeseen needs pile up, and that is when a hand reaches into
the fund and then out to help.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Young, a disabled jockey who lives in Louisville, had
a baby recently and bought a van, but couldn't afford the $18,000
it cost to make it disabled-ready. The money came out of the
Disabled Jockeys Fund, as did a new furnace this past winter for
another former jockey in the middle of an Idaho blizzard. ``Part of
it is basic life needs,'' Giovanni said. `` But we don't just want
our disabled jockeys to survive. We want them to think: `I can get
out. I can travel.'''
</P>
<P>
   I remember going to a pre-race chapel once at the Daytona 500,
looking around at all the famous NASCAR drivers, with their wives
next to them, kids on their laps, and thinking that only a strong
sense of community, of trust, could make bearable the occasional
late-night dread. Professionalism does not allow race car drivers
or jockeys to dwell on danger, but it is always there. The Disabled
Jockeys Fund, Desormeaux said, is as much an insurance policy as it
is philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   After winning his first Derby in 1993, aboard Sea Hero, Jerry
Bailey stopped a sponsor who was awarding him a brand-new car in
mid-sentence to say he was donating it to the Disabled Jockeys
Fund. Bailey, Desormeaux, Pat Day, Shane Sellers _ the most
recognizable riding names in the sport _ signed yesterday for cash,
not for profit. A dollar wasn't much to ask, especially in the
context of what contemporary sports owners and other athletes too
often demand.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans dropped a dollar or two in the jars. Many more did
not. ``People are people,'' Desormeaux said. ``Some care, some
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   After last year's close Triple Crown call, Desormeaux was kept
at his post long after the others had gone. He signed every last
program and card, until there were no more. His jar was
three-quarters full when it was removed, its contents dumped into a
large bag. Richer for his effort, Desormeaux walked off, in the
midafternoon sun.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE `GO' KNICKS BEING HELD BACK BY THE PAST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Red Holzman was an outstanding man and a great coach
for his time. Thursday night, the Knicks celebrated Holzman in a
nostalgic halftime ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman, who died last November at age 78, brought two NBA
championships to Madison Square Garden, and his legacy is
everywhere, resonating in many positive ways.
</P>
<P>
   One of his former players, Bill Bradley, is running for
president, and another, Phil Jackson, is helping in the campaign.
Walt Frazier is a television broadcaster, Willis Reed is a longtime
NBA executive and Dick Barnett earned a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's tribute was filled with an atmosphere that
recalled the good old days and perhaps lamented that the new Knicks
can't play that kind of basketball. Lore has its place. But legend
has occupied too pivotal a role at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a much-longed-for Knicks championship, it has
become like that musty rug or those heavy curtains that keep
memories in but fresh air out. It's a manufactured world where
memories are suspended in time _ it's 1969-70 all over again.
</P>
<P>
   That basketball no longer exists. Put it out of your mind. Look
at your kids or look at their kids: tattoos, rap, earrings. Allen
Iverson, Jason Williams, Randy Moss. This is the Go generation.
</P>
<P>
   The World's Most Famous Arena, as the Garden calls itself, is
becoming a museum, where the weight of history and nostalgia
overwhelm the present. Bad boxing matches, bad hockey team and a
well-heeled, underachieving basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, though not of their own volition, have begun a
process to let in the fresh air. Everyone talks about Marcus Camby
and Latrell Sprewell. They say Camby is too brittle and can't take
the pounding. This reminds me of critics years ago who said
Muhammad Ali couldn't take a punch to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Ali didn't want take a punch to his head. Remember ``Float like
a butterfly, sting like a bee?'' Ali restructured the whole notion
of slugging it out. The blow-for-blow, bucket-of-blood Charles
Oakley-Pat Riley era had its place _ in the museum.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of fans are still in denial about this Knicks evolution.
Coach Jeff Van Gundy was in denial, too, until Dave Checketts fired
that warning shot over his head in the form of demoting Ernie
Grunfeld. Grunfeld brought in Camby and Sprewell and began the
necessary work of renovating the Knicks, sending Oakley to Toronto
and John Starks to Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley continues to take shots at the Knicks, and core fans miss
his dramatic forays into the stands for loose balls. Truth is, in
the last few weeks Camby has routinely done things _ with riveting
blocks and thundering dunks on missed shots _ that the Oak man
couldn't begin to imagine doing. Camby's acrobatics are one major
reason the Knicks had gone on a modest winning streak before
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy changed his view of Camby. Next, he'd better begin
looking at Sprewell differently; not as an albatross, but as a life
preserver. This will require a tremendous leap of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell faces barriers that go beyond basketball. Critics say
all he wants to do is run up and down the floor and score. Guess
what? That's the kind of team your Knicks have evolved into this
abbreviated season: up and down, fast moving, plenty of turnovers,
higher scores.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction against Sprewell goes beyond basketball, of course.
He attacked his coach _ an authority figure _ two years ago. In a
league dominated by black players coached by white men, Sprewell
attacked a white authority figure. The reaction to the attack,
while not solely formed along racial lines, carried significant
racial overtones. In many minds it conjured images that went beyond
mere impudence to revolt or insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Van Gundy, the Knicks and Sprewell are all linked; they are
looking for absolution. The long-suffering fans are simply looking
for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell finds a way to fit in, if he can mesh with Allan
Houston, the Knicks can play for the championship. There are signs
of that happening. On Wednesday, Sprewell scored 29 points in a
loss at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us back to Thursday night's celebration. The essence
of Red Holzman was his ability to blend talent on two championship
teams. The new Knicks have been torn by internal division. If you
believe the Garden president, Checketts, things are now stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   The new Knicks are a Go team: go to the hole, go to the boards.
Run. Play solid defense, making stops when it matters. This is not
the Red Holzman team of the late '60s _ pass it around, everyone
gets a touch. Those were the good old days, but the good old days
are gone. Let's say goodbye.

METS WALK ON THE PADRES' WILD SIDE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., S.C. W.Va.)   (jw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After seven innings Thursday afternoon against the San Diego
Padres, the Mets _ who had rallied from an early 4-0 deficit _ had
six runs on only three hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's efficiency,'' Mike Piazza said after the Mets had gone
on to an 8-5 victory. ``To go from leaving a lot of guys on base,
like we have been doing, to something like that, that's
productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did, however, benefit from 10 walks, two of them going
to Piazza, who had won Tuesday night's game with a ninth-inning,
two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   And they got another fine relief effort from Dennis Cook, the
36-year-old left-hander who continues to be one of the most
efficient and productive pitchers in the National League this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Cook pitched a scoreless sixth inning. The Mets then rallied for
two runs in the bottom of the inning to grab a 6-5 lead, and Cook _
who has pitched only seven and a third innings this season _ won
for the fourth time without a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on a pretty good pace right now,'' said John Franco, who
closed out his eighth save in eight tries with a perfect ninth
inning. ``He's tied for the league lead in wins with less innings
than anybody. So he'll be well rested.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets, who received their first poor outing from Bobby
Jones this season (nine hits and five runs in five innings), could
have some problems with their starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed remains on the disabled list, and Thursday morning Al
Leiter caused a minor scare when he reported that he had tweaked
his left knee during Wednesday night's victory. The Mets hope he
has nothing more serious than what has been diagnosed as a slight
sprain that is not expected to threaten his next scheduled start.
</P>
<P>
   If Leiter is sidelined, the Mets are going to need even more of
the kind of production they received from their offense Thursday
along with continued efficiency from the bullpen, which turned in
four scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the kind of bullpen and team that will allow
the bullpen to get wins,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``This
year, we have an offensive team that can put a crooked number up
when we're behind in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets (13-9) have already won six games this year coming from
behind. Thursday, they came back from four runs down, helped by the
walks and two Padres errors.
</P>
<P>
   A two-run, two-out double from Rey Ordonez in the second inning
cut the deficit to 4-2. Dave Magadan, the Padres' third baseman,
helped Ordonez by missing the ball near the line with a feeble
attempt at a backhand stab.
</P>
<P>
   A two-out, two-run fifth-inning home run from John Olerud
narrowed the gap to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, a run-scoring bloop single from the light-hitting
Ordonez _ who tied his career high with three runs batted in _ tied
the score at 5-5. A sacrifice fly from the pinch-hitter Robin
Ventura immediately followed Ordonez's second hit and gave the Mets
the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Kinkade's first major league home run in the eighth made it
7-5. Roger Cedeno followed with a bloop single, stole second with
the aid of Ordonez throwing his bat at the pitched ball, took third
on a perfectly placed Ordonez sacrifice and scored on a bloop
single from Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have come to rely on Ventura, who leads the club with
17 RBIs, and Olerud, who has reached base in all 22 games, homered
in the last two, and leads the team in batting (.365).
</P>
<P>
   But Ordonez and Kinkade?
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez was asked which at-bat he liked best Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line drive to left-center field,'' the shortstop said,
referring to a hard-hit ball in the fourth that was run down for an
out.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade, a rookie who had come on as a defensive replacement for
Rickey Henderson in the seventh, needs to work on his home run
trot, which was more like a gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way I do it,'' Kinkade said with a sheepish
grin. ``Brian McRae said he was going to clap for me, but I was
already back in the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Cook was already back in the clubhouse. With four
victories in nine appearances this year, Cook is on a pace to win
32 games, should he appear in the same amount of games as he did
last year (73).
</P>
<P>
   Twenty victories is even being joked about around the Mets'
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hope so and I hope so,'' said Piazza, when asked if he
thought Cook could get to 20. ``For his sake, I do. But for our
starters' sake, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn turned in the 225th three-hit game of his career,
which included his 501st double. With 2,962 hits, Gwynn is 23rd on
the career list, after passing Sam Crawford on Thursday. ... It was
determined that Al Leiter has a slight sprain of the anterior
cruciate ligament of his left knee. ``It's the same knee as last
year, but it's not the same thing,'' said Leiter, who thought he
hurt himself pushing off the rubber during his seven-inning stint
Wednesday night. ``Last year, it was the patella tendon. And I'm
totally, totally planning on not missing my next side-session and
on making my next start.'' General Manager Steve Phillips said
Leiter would be fitted with a brace and was probable for the start.
When that is depends on what the Mets do with the injured Rick Reed
and with the struggling Masato Yoshii. Reed tossed batting practice
Thursday. ``My eyes said he was OK,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.
``But his command was a little less than desirable.'' Still, the
Mets broached the possibility of Reed's starting somewhere Sunday,
perhaps on a rehab assignment, perhaps with the Mets. Sunday is
Yoshii's scheduled day, but members of the Mets' front office said
Thursday that a demotion to the minor leagues is an option for the
Japanese right-hander, especially if he struggles the next time he
pitches. ... Tim Carr, a 21-year-old reliever pitching with the
Mets' Class A affiliate in Columbia, S.C., had a seizure in the
dugout in the second game of a doubleheader in Charleston, W.Va.,
on Wednesday night. Carr, who stopped breathing at one point before
being revived, was released from a hospital early Thursday morning
and will be flown to New York for neurological testing.

SPREWELL PICKS UP KNICKS AND SHOOTS DOWN 76ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It wasn't a party until Latrell Sprewell arrived. He
supplied the music, chips and pop with a series of vicious dunks,
electric jumpers and steals that put a jolt into a Knicks team that
came out drab and discombobulated.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell lifted the Knicks with 30 points off the bench and kept
their eighth place in the playoff standing safe for another night.
The Knicks' 85-70 victory at Madison Square Garden Thursday night
against a 76ers team that had won five in a row pulled them to
within a half game of seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell took the pressure off Patrick Ewing's return after he
had missed two games with an Achilles' tendon problem. Ewing played
21 minutes, was 3 for 7 and scored 6 points. Sprewell finished 11
for 17, while Allan Houston added 22 points on a 9-for-16 night.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson ended the game with 21 points. But 17 of those
came in the first half, when it looked as if the 76ers were going
to run away from the Knicks after they took a 23-8 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A little groggy from their road trip, the Knicks needed either a
strong cup of coffee or Sprewell. With an offensive lift from
Sprewell and a defensive surge from Chris Dudley, the Knicks were
able to fight back from a 15-point, first-quarter deficit and take
a 44-42 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and Houston were actually working together to make a
run on the 76ers. They combined for 29 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sprewell took over the game. He came up with two steals at
midcourt in the final minute of the third quarter, and raced alone
for two vicious dunks. He was in his own zone and the Knicks were
the happy witnesses to the 64-56 third-quarter lead he provided.
</P>
<P>
   Houston did not get lost in the fray, his offense seeming to
carry over to his defense. Without the injured Chris Childs to help
shadow Iverson, there were times when Houston took over that duty.
He was part of the reason Iverson was held scoreless in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson may have been feeling shoulder pain that hit him in the
first half. With 40 seconds left in the third quarter, he took
himself out. But he did return early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The first-half performance of Sprewell and Houston diluted the
fancy plays Iverson had a chance to display while he could as he
worked around a slower Charlie Ward and scored 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson had his moments, like the cross-over dribble he used as
he floated through the lane on a runner in the first quarter, but
they were trumped by Sprewell's kinetic moves. He left the rookie
Larry Hughes shaking his head when he pulled up and stuck a high,
hanging jumper over his head in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks took their halftime edge on a jumper by Houston that
came off of a Sprewell miss. Although it was teamwork by accident,
it was an example of how Houston and Sprewell were able to feed off
of each other for one of the few times this season.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first half, Sprewell and Houston were finding
each other coming off screens and looking for where the other was
on the break, and that made all the difference for the Knicks. With
Ewing limited to 1 for 5 in the first half, Sprewell and Houston
picked up the slack. Sprewell scored 17 first-half points while
Houston hit for 12.
</P>
<P>
   This was the togetherness the Knicks had hoped for when they
assembled this team. At first, it seemed nothing was going to work
for the Knicks. Playing their fourth game in five nights, and their
second in 48 hours, the Knicks began a little lethargic and clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   They were overwhelmed by the ball pressure the 76ers' defense
applied to begin the game. If they weren't turning the ball over,
Houston and Ward and Larry Johnson were driving into the face of
shot-blockers Matt Geiger and Theo Ratliff. Unwilling to move the
ball to find an open man, the Knicks missed their first 11 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, they were down 23-8 with 3 minutes left in the first
quarter before they began to slowly reverse the situation. After
Ewing struggled to find his shot and labored as he moved around the
lane, he was replaced by Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not give the Knicks the kind of physical presence
that Dudley provided when he entered the game with his team down by
19-8. Dudley's arrival meant more rebounds and fewer smooth trips
to the basket by Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   What he did on defense was complemented by Sprewell's ability to
lift the team offensively. Pulling out his wild, frenetic style,
Sprewell put pressure on the 76ers' defense once he began hitting
pull-up jumpers that, as always, seem ill-advised. But once they go
in, they are genius.
</P>
<P>
   His energy pushed the Knicks on a 6-0 run to close the first
quarter. Scoring 15 points in the second quarter, Sprewell pulled
the Knicks back into a game they seemed to have no energy to play.

KANSAS SENATE VOTES TO PUT COMMUNITY COLLEGES UNDER STATE REGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER and JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA _ The Kansas Senate voted 26-13 Thursday to place 19
community colleges, including Johnson County's, under the Kansas
Board of Regents, which currently oversees state universities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The higher education reform measure was approved Wednesday by
the House and goes to Gov. Bill Graves, who is expected to sign it
into law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from Johnson County said the Legislature's approval
was like waking up from a nightmare and finding out it was real. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   College trustees and community leaders in the county have long
opposed the idea, fearing it would lead to a loss of local control
and result in a bias toward the universities by the nine regents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All six senators from Johnson County voted against it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Senate Bill 345 will drastically change the way higher
education is governed in Kansas, but it will fail in its purpose
because the Legislature has failed to define the problems we are
attempting to solve,'' said Sen. John Vratil, an Overland Park
Republican. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the bill's enactment would hail a new era in
higher education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christine Downey, an Inman Democrat, said it would result
in greater integration and coordination of higher education.
Community colleges currently are under the authority of the Kansas
Board of Education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when someone asks who speaks for higher education in
Kansas, the answer will be the Board of Regents, because they will
truly represent all sectors of the higher education community,''
Downey said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All three senators from Wyandotte County voted for the measure,
which was endorsed by Kansas City Kansas Community College. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The measure, in addition to community colleges, would place
post-secondary vocational education programs under the regents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It also would reduce property taxes in almost all counties with
a community college, but not until fiscal year 2001, which begins
July 1, 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting then, community colleges could receive almost $2.5
million in additional state money each year to improve their
educational programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The colleges in Wyandotte and Johnson counties would receive
almost half that amount. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. David Kerr, a Hutchinson Republican, questioned the
fairness of a formula giving Johnson County more than $800,000
while several rural, financially struggling community colleges
would get little. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just flabbergasted we have a formula with these kind of
results,'' said Kerr, who voted against the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Downey said the formula wasn't perfect but added that the
Legislature could return next year to make it better. She called it
a ``work in progress.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other action, negotiations surrounding the new transportation
bill continued through the day, with Graves and key lawmakers
huddling in meetings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In order to corral the necessary votes in the House, efforts
were under way to craft compromises in the areas of school finance,
a children's trust fund and money for the juvenile justice
program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With legislative spending already running above the governor's
recommendations, there was an increasing concern that revenue in
the 2001 budget year might barely meet requirements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the day, both houses approved differing versions of
catch-all spending bills that will be consolidated by House and
Senate negotiators. The resulting agreement will be considered
later in the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both versions included money to establish a satellite Kansas
Bureau of Investigation crime laboratory at Kansas City Kansas
Community College. The exact amount and staffing will be determined
by the negotiators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate upheld Graves' veto of a bill that would
have supplied $300,000 in matching money to organizations assisting
women in bringing their pregnancies to term. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 25-14. Twenty-seven votes are required in the
Senate to override a veto. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the House and Senate included money for the program in their
spending bills, assuring that Graves will have an opportunity to
veto the money again, this time after the Legislature leaves town. &QL;

ARTHUR SCHAWLOW, 77, NOBELIST FOR LASERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur L. Schawlow, co-winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in
Physics for his role in the development of lasers, died April 28 at
a hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 77 and lived in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure resulting from leukemia,
said a Stanford University spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Schawlow, an emeritus physics professor at Stanford, gained fame
in the 1950s when he collaborated with Dr. Charles Townes in
designing features of a device that came to be known as a laser _
after Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicting claims to the invention of lasers persisted for many
years, but there is general agreement that the first working laser
was built by Dr. Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories in
Malibu, Calif. The device was first operated on May 16, 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Schawlow and Townes worked together at Columbia University to
develop a device called a maser _ the microwave ancestor of the
laser _ a device that Dr. Townes had invented. Their goal was to
invent something that would amplify light in the same way that the
maser amplified microwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Schawlow conceived the idea of building a chamber, or
``cavity,'' consisting of a synthetic ruby that would act as a kind
of echo chamber for light. At one end of the ruby was a highly
polished mirror and at the other end was a semi-transparent mirror
that would allow light to pass through once it had been amplified
to a certain threshold level.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists published their idea in 1957, prompting an
international competition to build a working laser.
</P>
<P>
   Early lasers consisted of ruby cavities surrounded by coiling
flash lamps similar to strobe lights used by cameras. Energy from a
flash lamp pumped atoms within the ruby cavity to higher energy
levels. When these atoms fell back to a lower energy state, they
emitted light. A cascade of synchronized emissions resulted,
causing laser light.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ordinary light, laser light is coherent; that is, its
waves march in step with one another. The special properties of
lasers have found countless uses in modern life, including bar-code
readers, compact disks and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leading pioneers of laser science were Dr. Polykarp
Kusch of Columbia University, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in
Physics in 1955 for his discoveries about the properties of
electrons, and his graduate student Gordon Gould, who coined the
word ``laser.'' But the most famous of the laser scientists were
Townes and Schawlow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Townes shared a Nobel Prize with two Soviet physicists,
Dr. Alexander Prochorov and Dr. Nikolai Basov, for their
independent development of maser-laser devices.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years later, Schawlow shared a Nobel with Dr. Nicolaas
Bloembergen of Harvard University for their contributions to the
development of laser spectroscopy.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the history of the laser, there were disagreements
and lawsuits regarding its invention.
</P>
<P>
   Schawlow and Townes were awarded the original patent for the
laser, but in 1977 Gould, after a long legal battle, finally
obtained a patent for optically pumped lasers. But he was not
awarded a Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Schawlow was born on May 5, 1921, in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
He was a brilliant student, and won a scholarship at the University
of Toronto to study radio engineering. A spokesman for Stanford
University said that in 1948 Schawlow was conducting an atomic beam
experiment in the basement of a campus laboratory when he met Boris
Stoicheff, who was to become a faculty member at the University of
Toronto and a lifelong friend.
</P>
<P>
   In an oral history of Schawlow, Stoicheff said that ``it was a
special pleasure to visit the basement lab, where often in the
evenings Art would be serenading his atomic beam with the clarinet,
which he played reasonably well.'' The favored music was Dixieland
jazz.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a Ph.D. from Toronto, Schawlow was awarded a
postdoctoral fellowship from Columbia University to work with
Townes, who was doing research on microwave spectroscopy at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Townes had hoped to keep Schawlow with him at Columbia, the
Stanford spokesman said, but love intervened. Schawlow married
Townes' youngest sister, Aurelia, in 1951, and because of the
university's anti-nepotism regulation, Schawlow was obliged to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   He then joined Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, where he studied
superconductivity, a phenomenon not directly related to lasers.
</P>
<P>
   But the young physicist managed to spend weekends in New York at
Townes' Columbia laboratory, and it was during that period that the
two men hit upon the scheme for amplifying visible light.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 Schawlow left Bell Labs to join the faculty at Stanford,
where he worked on laser and microwave spectroscopy and
superconductivity.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Schawlow nor Townes profited financially from their
laser patent because it would have broken contractual obligations;
Schawlow was working at Bell Labs when the patent was issued, and
Townes was serving as a consultant to Bell Labs.
</P>
<P>
   Schawlow and his wife championed causes supporting autistic
children like their son, Artie, of Paradise, Calif. In 1991, while
Mrs. Schlowlow was on her way to visit their son, she was killed in
an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, Schawlow is survived by two daughters, Helen
Johnson of Stevens Point, Wis., and Edie Dwan of Charlotte, N.C.,
and five grandchildren.

BILL ON YEAR 2000 LIABILITY IS SET ASIDE IN THE SENATE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation to limit lawsuits arising from Year
2000 computer breakdowns was shelved indefinitely by the Senate
Thursday, a victim of partisan politics and the running battle
between lobbyists for business interests and those for trial
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Without the bill, some executives of high-technology companies
argue, lawyers chasing cyberspace ambulances will drive the legal
costs for fighting lawsuits related to the problem to more than $1
trillion. Opponents of the measure say it would prevent consumers
and small businesses from recovering legitimate losses caused by
faulty computers.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from both parties said they hoped compromises could be
reached that would allow the bill to be revived, but the political
obstacles are formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are refusing to allow a vote on the measure unless
Republican leaders promise to permit votes on the Democrats' top
priorities like an increase in the minimum wage. Republicans want
to avoid that.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators, even those sponsoring what is known as the
Y2K legislation, voted as a solid block Thursday against ending the
debate and bringing the bill to a vote. As a result, the motion to
invoke cloture, which requires 60 votes to succeed, failed by eight
votes, 52-47. Three Republicans _ Thad Cochran of Mississippi,
Richard Shelby of Alabama and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania _
joined the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, then
withdrew the bill from consideration, saying it was ``unreasonable
to waste the Senate's time further.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem results from the longtime reliance of computer
programs on only the last two digits of a year, with 19 presumed to
be the first two. When confronted by ``00,'' some computers,
software and electronically controlled machinery that have not been
updated might misinterpret it as 1900 rather than 2000, substitute
another year or simply freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give companies 90 days after a lawsuit was filed
to solve computer problems related to year 2000 bugs before the
suit could proceed. It would also limit punitive damages that could
be assessed against companies with 50 or fewer employees to
$250,000 or three times the financial damages, whichever was less.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has threatened to veto the bill. The White
House argues that computer companies will be less likely to address
their customers' potential turn-of-the-century problems ahead of
time, if they know their liability is limited.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view in the Senate is that a bill can be written
that will satisfy the White House if the political hurdles
unrelated to the Year 2000 issue can be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is at the top of the agenda of business
interests in the capital. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has spent
millions of dollars lobbying for the legislation and running
advertisements supporting it, and other business lobbies have
weighed in as well.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the latest skirmish between the business lobbies
and the lawyers. Businesses have tried recently with little success
to limit lawsuits in areas like product liability, medical
malpractice, smoking and patients' rights in managed-care health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines are drawn because business interests are
Republicans' most reliable donors, while trial lawyers are among
the Democrats' biggest contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the bill's chief sponsor, accused the
bill's opponents of trying to ``protect the trial lawyers' stream
of income.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., responded, ``We've got problems in
this country, but it's not how the tort system hurts business.''

U.S. SCRUTINIZES AETNA PROPOSAL TO BUY PRUDENTIAL UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doctors and consumer advocates have flooded the
Justice Department with evidence they say suggests that Aetna's
plan to buy Prudential Health Care would harm competition in the
health insurance industry. But federal antitrust officials say they
have found potential problems in only a few states, including Texas
and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced in early December, would create the nation's
biggest managed-care company, providing health benefits to 1 in 10
Americans. The Justice Department is investigating the proposed
deal to see if it would reduce competition and has demanded large
amounts of financial information from Aetna and Prudential, from
their competitors in the insurance industry, and from doctors and
hospitals around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts said the case could set an important
precedent, slowing or accelerating the consolidation of the health
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's review of the deal comes as the Clinton
administration is stepping up pressure on Congress to pass
legislation defining and protecting the rights of patients.
Consumer groups say the campaign for patients' rights is an empty
gesture if federal officials ignore the growing concentration of
the managed-care industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department has railed against physician
unionization as a threat to free-market competition,'' said Jamie
Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care, a consumer group
based in Santa Monica, Calif. ``But the administration has failed
to break up a single HMO merger. If Aetna is allowed to buy
Prudential Health Care, the resulting company would be in a
powerful position to grind its payment rates so low that physicians
could not adequately care for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna announced in December that it would buy Prudential Health
Care from Prudential Insurance Company of America for $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the government has often found it easier to
challenge the conduct of doctors and hospitals in small markets
than the behavior of large insurers whose nationwide operations
affect far more people. In the last two years, for example, the
government has accused a network of 180 doctors in rural Mesa
County, Colo., of trying to fix fees and has tried to stop the
merger of two hospitals in Poplar Bluff, Mo., which has a
population of 17,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Horoschak, an antitrust lawyer in Charlotte, N.C., said,
``At trial, it's a lot easier for the government to prove
concentration of the health care market in small isolated
communities than in a large metropolitan area, even though more
people might be affected by the merger in a big metropolitan
area.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kopit, one of the nation's leading experts on antitrust
law in the health care industry, predicted that the Justice
Department would allow the Aetna-Prudential deal to go through
without any restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care markets are local,'' Kopit said. ``In most
markets, if you combine Aetna and Prudential, they're not a
dominant player. They don't have market power. The ultimate test of
market power is whether the companies, after a merger, could
profitably and successfully raise prices above competitive
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   At most, Kopit said, the Justice Department might require Aetna
or Prudential to sell off parts of its health care business in one
or more markets. Such a divestiture, while limiting the market
share of the combined corporation in some geographic areas, ``would
not stop the merger,'' Kopit said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna executives said the Justice Department's investigation had
focused on a handful of markets, including Texas, New Jersey,
Philadelphia, several counties in Florida and the metropolitan
Washington area, which takes in northern Virginia and suburban
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association sees the Aetna-Prudential deal
as a seminal case and is pressuring the Justice Department to use
it as an occasion to clarify Federal standards for mergers in the
health insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, who coordinates health policy for President
Clinton, said AMA officers had expressed their concerns to him at a
meeting in the White House. ``They think Aetna is becoming too big
too quick,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust lawyers said the deal was getting more scrutiny than
prior mergers and acquisitions of insurers and HMOs. Experts
working with Aetna said they had become somewhat frustrated with
the government's continuing requests for more information. Aetna
spokeswoman Joyce Oberdorf said the company was complying with all
information requests and expected the transaction to close by the
end of June.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the deal, doctors and consumer groups often assert
that Aetna and Prudential together would have an unhealthy share of
the HMO market. For example, the American Medical Association says
the combined company would have 41 percent of the HMOmarket in
Texas, with 39 percent in Dallas and 46 percent in Houston; 38
percent in New Jersey, with 59 percent in Bergen County, N.J.; 30
percent in Atlanta, and 33 percent in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But federal antitrust officials said that in measuring a
company's market share, they analyzed a much broader market,
including HMOs and other types of insurance like preferred-provider
plans or indemnity insurance, which allows patients to choose any
doctor they want.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they assumed that the purchasers of
health insurance _ employers and individual consumers _ could
usually choose from a wide range of insurance products and could
substitute one for another. If, for example, a particular HMO
raises its prices, the officials said, buyers can switch to a
preferred-provider plan, which offers discounts to patients using
certain doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust lawyers said the government's tendency to use a broad
definition of the relevant market would help Aetna, because it
meant that the resulting corporation would have a relatively modest
share of most markets.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors across the country have protested Aetna's plan to buy
Prudential Health Care. Dr. Richard Geline, president of the
Illinois State Medical Society, said Aetna was ``poised to grab a
stranglehold over patients and doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome Molitor, a spokesman for the Medical Society of New
Jersey, said: ``The merger would limit choice and reduce
competition. The quality of care would suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials said the effect on doctors was a secondary
concern for them, since the main purpose of the antitrust laws is
to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest buyers of health care in the United States are
employers who provide health benefits to employees. Business groups
have long advocated competition between insurers as a way to
control costs and improve the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Canner, vice president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said the consolidation of Aetna and Prudential
Health Care would mean less competition. ``In the end,'' Ms. Canner
said, ``that would hurt buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has a reputation for hard-nosed bargaining and has had
strained relations with many doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The government is investigating a provision of Aetna's standard
contract under which doctors must take patients from all of Aetna's
insurance plans if the doctors take patients from any Aetna plan.
Doctors say this contract clause is unusual and oppressive and
forces them to take HMO patients, at lower fees, if they choose to
participate in other Aetna health plans that give the doctors more
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada insurance commissioner ruled recently that this type
of requirement was an ``unfair trade practice'' that coerced
doctors to sign contracts against their will. But Aetna says the
requirement serves the patients' interest, by guaranteeing that
doctors will continue to see patients if an employer switches from
one Aetna product to another.

REPSOL PURSUES BUYOUT OF ARGENTINE OIL CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Argentina, Spain)  (EDS: This is a late add to the Business Day front page) 
(js) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a deal that would create the world's eighth-largest oil
company, Repsol SA, Spain's largest oil company, said Thursday that
it was offering $13.4 billion in cash to buy the 85 percent of YPF,
the Argentine oil company, it does not already own.
</P>
<P>
   Repsol, which paid $2 billion in January for 15 percent of YPF,
said it would pay $44.78 a share in cash for the rest of YPF, a
price that Repsol said was a 25.4 percent premium over Thursday's
closing price for YPF shares on the Buenos Aires stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that price will be high enough for the bid to succeed
was questioned by several oil analysts Thursday afternoon as rumors
about the deal, which had been circulating for weeks, drew
attention on Wall Street a few hours ahead of the announcement by
Repsol. The rising price of oil _ $18.53 a barrel Thursday in New
York, up from $11.78 just 10 weeks ago _ should make YPF shares
rise in value, these analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would have half the gasoline-station market
in Argentina and would be a major force in Peru, Ecuador and
Brazil, Alfonso Cortina, Repsol's chief executive, said Thursday
night in a telephone call from his office in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to create an integrated, world-class oil
company,'' Cortina said, with enough cash flow that the company
will be able to pay back the added debt it will take on to make the
purchase by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Cortina said that ``we can commit to our shareholders to
increase our earnings per share roughly 20 percent from 1998 to
2002'' and that return on assets should rise from 11 percent now to
15 percent by 2002.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new company will be highly leveraged at first, with 30
percent equity and 70 percent debt, most of it an unsecured bridge
loan at floating interest rates that makes the company vulnerable
to a sudden upturn in interest rates or a sharp drop in the price
of oil. By the end of 2000, however, the company's debt should be
between 48 percent and 50 percent of the combined company's capital
structure, Cortina said. To pare down debt, he said, about $2.5
billion worth of YPF assets will be sold and a new issue of stock,
intended to raise $4 billion to $6 billion, is being arranged with
Goldman, Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney as the lead
underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   YPF, whose formal name is Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, was
founded in 1922 as the first state-owned oil company outside the
Soviet Union. For seven decades it was known as the only oil
company in the world that lost money as Argentine dictators drained
it of both products and cash to subsidize other state-owned
enterprises and to prop up unrelated YPF businesses, from hospitals
to movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   YPF was privatized between 1990 and 1993. Its payroll of 50,000
workers was cut to 10,000, and unprofitable operations were sold.
YPF is already the largest private oil company in Latin America and
the largest private company of any kind in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Cortina acknowledged that there was strong opposition in the
management of YPF to Repsol taking charge, but he said he was
confident that he could win over the key personnel.

STRONG INTEREST EXPANDS SIZE OF GOLDMAN SACHS PUBLIC OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: in reference to E(ASTERISK)Trade, replace (ASTERISK) with
the typographical symbol)  
 (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Strong interest from fund managers and even the hint
of an Internet frenzy have prompted such a scramble for shares of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. that it could increase the size of its public
offering by a factor of eight and still leave some investors
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, a blue-chip investment bank, plans to list its shares
next Tuesday, formally ending its 130-year history as a private
partnership and becoming the last major Wall Street firm to go
public. The company wound up its worldwide promotional tour with a
lunch for investors at the Plaza Hotel in New York on Thursday. The
offering is at least eight times oversubscribed, people close to
the underwriting said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your usual IPO,'' said Randall Roth of Renaissance
IPO Fund in Greenwich, Conn., which hopes to get some allocation of
shares from Goldman's underwriters. ``Everyone is into this,
whether it's tech, growth, micro-cap or big-cap buyers. Even the
day traders are interested in this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The final pricing of the shares will not take place until Monday
night, just before the offering. But people close to the deal
expect Goldman shares to sell at the top end of the range the firm
projected, or $55 a share. If Goldman's underwriters sell an extra
tranche of shares held in reserve, bringing the total offering size
to 69 million shares, it would raise $3.8 billion, which would rank
as one of the largest initial public offerings in history.
</P>
<P>
   Even at $55, Goldman's share price relative to earnings would
still be lower than its top rivals, Merrill Lynch and Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. Goldman's underwriters, led by Goldman itself,
are determined to price shares at a slight discount to rivals. That
is in part because Goldman's earnings are less diverse than those
of Merrill and Morgan Stanley, meaning that Goldman might suffer
more than its competitors if financial markets took a sharp dive.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldman has an almost mythical reputation in some circles.
And some potential investors say it is a good buy at any discount
to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it trades at a discount to Merrill and Morgan, I will
definitely be an owner,'' said Michael Holland of Holland &AMP; Co.,
which invests in financial company stocks. ``The question is how
long that discount will last,'' he said, adding that he expected
the shares to rise sharply after they list.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has not yet formally made forward profit projections.
But one person who has studied the offering said that Goldman had
room to raise the share price to the top of its range and still
list at a modest discount to Merrill and Morgan. This person
projects that at $55 Goldman shares would trade at 15 times
earnings, compared with Merrill's 16.5 times earnings and 17.25
times earnings for Morgan Stanley shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldman wants its best clients to make money on this, and they
are not going to push the limit on price,'' this person said.
</P>
<P>
   Investor demand has been strong enough that Goldman can pick and
choose the investors it wants to own its stock. Goldman has
reserved a big chunk for its own best clients, including big
pension and mutual funds that use Goldman services to trade stocks
and bonds and its own network of wealthy private clients.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has largely snubbed the huge retail client base of
Merrill Lynch, Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney, rival firms that
are part of the Goldman underwriting syndicate. Individual
investors would have a better shot of buying shares through two
Internet brokerage houses, Wit Capital and E(ASTERISK)Trade, that
were awarded an allocation by Goldman, people close to the
underwriting said.
</P>
<P>
   Some competitors saw this as a slap in the face to full-service
brokerage houses. Goldman has long shunned the idea of setting up a
traditional brokerage operation itself, preferring to concentrate
its resources on wholesale investment banking and asset management.
Recently, Goldman has been developing links to Internet companies,
including E(ASTERISK)Trade and Wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bit of a signal here: Goldman is moving more toward
the Internet and away from full-service firms,'' said one person
close to the underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Others close to the underwriting said that Goldman was simply
selecting investors it expected would hold the stock for a long
time.

ALMOST A MICROSOFT WITNESS, BUT DEFINITELY A HOT POTATO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was personally asked to be a witness in the Microsoft
antitrust trial by the software giant's chairman, Bill Gates, but
he was quickly dropped from the company's witness list after he was
questioned by a government lawyer last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Yet judging from his deposition testimony released this week,
Michael L. Dertouzos had a lot to say _ and he would have been a
most unusual witness, blunt and direct, with views not tailored to
either side.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old director of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's laboratory for computer science at first refused to be
a witness for Microsoft when the company's lawyers reached him. But
last July, Dertouzos said, Gates called him and he agreed to
testify but only on one narrow issue: that in the interests of
simplicity, the distinction between the Internet browser and the
operating system would become ``increasingly blurred in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a leading computer scientist, this was music to the
ears of the Microsoft legal team. It seemed to echo a central
defense argument _ namely, that Microsoft's Windows operating
system and its Internet Explorer browser are one seamlessly
integrated product and not two products bundled together to stifle
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as his deposition testimony makes clear, Dertouzos did not
have a legal agenda in mind. In his books and speeches, he has
advocated the need to simplify the use of computers if information
technology is to truly pay off, making the economy more productive
and people's lives richer.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he explained, a person ought to be able to easily
retrieve information from a desktop PC or from some distant place
through the Internet by using a few simple commands _ ``a steering
wheel, a gas pedal and a brake, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides speaking his mind on only one issue, Dertouzos informed
Microsoft that he would be an unusual witness in other respects as
well. He would take no pay, whereas fees of more than $1,000 an
hour are common for expert trial witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Most witnesses at the Microsoft trial prepared for days or
weeks, reviewing documents and being coached by lawyers, but not
Dertouzos. ``I would like to behave and be treated as a judge's
witness rather than as Microsoft's witness in the European
tradition of being neutral,'' he said. ``And I did not want to be
prepared in any way by Microsoft attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   He was willing to be a trial witness despite what would
inevitably be questioned as a possible conflict of interest. He
told the Justice Department lawyer at his deposition that nearly a
year earlier, in November 1997, Gates had pledged to donate $20
million to MIT to build a new computer science building.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the Gates donation, which was publicly announced
only a few weeks ago, would certainly have been used at the trial
by the Justice Department lawyers to question Dertouzos'
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer scientist answered any doubts about his
independence as his testimony proceeded. He volunteered that he and
Gates see the future of the information age differently. A key
disagreement between the two men, Dertouzos said, was ``my
statement that the new world of information, if left to its own
devices, would increase the gap between rich and poor.'' He added,
`` Gates felt it would shrink it.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the browser was now considered part of the
operating system or a separate application, Dertouzos replied,
``Historically and today, it is the case that browsers are treated
as applications, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the hopes of the Microsoft legal team fell, as did
Dertouzos' value as a defense witness. Legal cases tend to be
decided by facts, rooted in the here and now. No matter what
Dertouzos may think about the future course of computing, he said
that the browser was currently treated as a separate product, as
the Justice Department contends, and not part of the operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   That single quotation from the Dertouzos deposition was featured
in the Microsoft trial and presented as evidence by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Go a little further into his testimony, though, and Dertouzos
emphasizes the difficulty of drawing clean dividing lines, given
the malleability of software, rendered in the digital code of 1s
and 0s. His goal of simplicity, he testified, could be accomplished
in many ways _ giving the operating system the functionality of a
browser, giving a browser the functionality of an operating system,
or placing most of these capabilities centrally in a network, which

   ``There are a lot of possibilities there,'' he said. ``Software
design is still an extremely primitive activity based primarily on
art and craft. So depending on the designer's inspiration, mind-set
and approach, one of these approaches might turn out to be best.'' &QL;

 JUDGE DOMINICK DiCARLO, 71, DRUG FIGHTER UNDER REAGAN  
 (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dominick L. DiCarlo, a federal judge and a former New
York state assemblyman from Brooklyn, died April 27 after suffering
a heart attack while exercising at a gym at the federal court
complex in Manhattan. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo, a conservative Republican who was also an assistant
secretary of state for drug policy in the Reagan administration in
the early 1980s, was, in recent years, a senior judge on the U.S.
Court of International Trade in New York. At his death, he was
temporarily presiding on the U.S. District Court in New York due to
a shortage of judges there.
</P>
<P>
   During his years as a member of the New York state Assembly in
Albany, DiCarlo rose to become chairman of the codes committee and
deputy minority leader. Sometimes called ``the burly bear,'' a
reference to his size and demeanor, he was known for his debating
skills and his knowledge of the criminal-justice system.
</P>
<P>
   He is also remembered as the only Republican in the Assembly who
voted against Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's legislation to toughen
criminal laws against drug offenders. Though DiCarlo was a staunch
opponent of drug dealers, he worried that the laws lumped the
offenders into one category.
</P>
<P>
   According to his son, Robert J. DiCarlo, a former state senator
from Brooklyn, DiCarlo ``was concerned that with broad-stroke
mandatory sentences, people who were not drug dealers would find
themselves in the prison system.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominick Leonard DiCarlo was born on March 11, 1928, in Brooklyn
and raised the Bay Ridge section. He received a bachelor's degree
from St. John's College and law degrees from St. John's University
School of Law and the New York University Graduate School of Law.
He was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York and a counsel to the
minority leaders of the New York City Council before being elected
to the state Assembly in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he helped run the New York state campaign of Ronald
Reagan, and when Reagan was elected president, DiCarlo left the
Legislature to become assistant secretary of state for
international narcotics matters. He spent much of his time in that
post trying to persuade foreign leaders to supplant fields of opium
poppies in their countries with crops not used for narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Reagan appointed DiCarlo to the U.S. Court of
International Trade, and President George Bush made him chief judge
in 1991. He left that post in 1996, but still heard cases as a
senior judge.
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo was predeceased by his first wife, Esther. Besides his
son, Robert, he is survived by his wife, Susan; two other sons,
Vincent DiCarlo of Davis, Calif., and Carl DiCarlo of Brooklyn; a
daughter, Barbara Basgaard of Brick Township, N.J.; four brothers,
James DiCarlo of Commack, Vincent DiCarlo of East Islip, Michael
DiCarlo of Melville and John DiCarlo of Shoreham; two sisters, Rose
Cucci of Wantagh and Constance Testa of Wading River and eight
grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: POOR NATIONS AND THE DEBT TRAP  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 30:
</P>
<P>
   Last year when Uganda became the first country to get some
relief of its external debt under a new program of the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, it used the money it saved
largely to eliminate fees charged for primary school. The impact
was dramatic. While two years ago 54 percent of Uganda's children
attended primary school, this year 90 percent do. In contrast,
neighboring Zambia, which spends five times more each year on debt
service than on primary education, had to raise school fees. Its
enrollment is dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Debt matters. The 41 most highly indebted poor nations, 80
percent of them in Africa, pay on average 40 percent of their
annual budgets for debt service. That leaves little to invest in
basic education, health, rural roads and other programs that help
people escape from poverty. Prodded by religious and development
groups, the World Bank and the IMF began a program in 1996 to help
poor countries reduce their debt. But the program is far too
limited. Both institutions are now committed to enlarging it, a
subject they discussed at a meeting in Washington this week. When
they meet again in September they will agree on a new plan. It
should be large enough to allow many countries to redirect their
money to fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the indebted countries borrowed heavily in the 1970s
when interest rates were low and lenders, including the World Bank,
were pushing loans. Some of the money was wasted or simply stolen.
Now the debts are compounding, as many countries cannot even pay
the required interest. The problem is worsened by a drop in foreign
aid, which is at an 18-year low, although the World Bank concludes
that developing countries have learned to use it far more
effectively. A cutback in American aid has been particularly
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the urgency, the debt relief program so far has helped
only Uganda and Bolivia, and will add only three more nations this
year. Before getting relief, nations must meet IMF criteria for
economic reform and budget austerity for six years. Few can meet
this goal, especially when hit by a natural disaster or a drop in
the price of commodities they export. In addition, most qualifying
nations will get so little relief that they will still pay a
crippling percentage of their budget for debt service. Some will
even owe more than before, as they are deemed able to pay a larger
part of their debt.
</P>
<P>
   The bank and the fund are now debating how to widen the program,
which in its current, limited form is estimated to cost $13 billion
over several years. Expanded versions can cost twice that or more.
Part of the answer will depend on how much wealthy countries are
willing to spend, a decision that will come at a conference of
industrialized nations in June. They will have to pay about half
the cost, but would recoup some in increased exports. Most
countries have pledged to be generous.
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental groups have presented the World Bank and the IMF
with worthy reform proposals. Most advocate giving debt relief
while a country meets reform criteria, instead of waiting until
years after. They would also change requirements to eliminate the
burden many austerity programs place on the poor. Some groups want
to keep a country's debt burden down to a manageable 10 percent to
15 percent of its budget. Oxfam International, a development
organization, advocates requiring countries to copy what Uganda did
voluntarily _ putting the savings into a well-designed and
monitored fund, with considerable participation from civic groups,
directed at basics like schooling, which fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
   All these changes are expensive but sensible investments in the
world's poor.

 B-52s TO DROP TRADITIONAL BUT LESS-ACCURATE `DUMB' BOMBS  
 (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With stocks of cruise missiles dwindling, Defense
Secretary William Cohen announced Thursday that the Pentagon is
providing 10 more B-52 bombers to NATO forces that would be used
for the first time to drop traditional bombs on Serbian military
targets, as well as firing guided missiles.
</P>
<P>
   A staple of the Vietnam War, when their hulking figures became a
symbol of that conflict, B-52s have been restricted to bombing with
cruise missiles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the bombers have been allowed to carry ``dumb'' bombs, which
are less accurate in hitting their targets. Dropping bombs without
satellite or laser guidance from high levels is more likely to
cause unintended damage and injury.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some cruise missiles remaining, the new
B-52s, which will be based in England, will carry Israeli-made
guided missiles, called AGM-142s or HAVE NAPs. The missiles have a
range of 50 miles and carry 750-pound explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not as good as cruise missiles but they are very
accurate,'' a Pentagon spokesman said, ``and we have a stockpile of
120 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is running short not just of cruise missiles but
of another precision weapon, the satellite-guided joint direct
attack munition (JDAM) dropped by B-2 (Stealth) bombers, the
general who oversees U.S. combat aircraft told reporters at a
breakfast meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Richard Hawley, head of the Air Combat Command, said that
as the bombing campaign mounts, the Air Force could exhaust its
supply of JDAMs before the next scheduled delivery of a new batch
in May. ``It's going to be really touch-and-go as to whether we'll
go Winchester on JDAMs,'' he said, using a pilot's expression for
running out of ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   The additional B-52 bombers are part of the 300 planes requested
several weeks ago by NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark;
he said he needed them to wage the air war day and night and to
expand the range of targets. Earlier this week, the Pentagon
dispatched 30 more refueling tankers, to be based in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   When the B-52s begin bombing with traditional bombs, they will
be used to strike at Serb forces in the field, which are the
hardest to hit, and at military targets, like barracks, that are
far from civilian areas, according to the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the reduced accuracy, the spokesman said,
``everything around it should be military, too, somewhere where
there are no civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, gave the daily Pentagon briefing Thursday for the first time
since the air war began.
</P>
<P>
   This was read as a sign that the administration is trying to
combat the growing frustration in Congress and among the public
over the lengthy air campaign, which so far has failed to make
Kosovo safe for its ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Their language reflected a stiffening of posture, if not
purpose, since they met with their allied counterparts in
Washington last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as keeping the American people behind this,'' Cohen
said, ``I think they only have to turn on their television sets
every day and to see the kind of horrendous suffering that is now
portrayed on the evening news,'' a reference to the Albanian
refugees fleeing Serbian forces in Kosovo.

 (Attn: N.J., Mo., Ill., N.Y.)   (Eds: In 15th graf: Each ad features, etc., the word 90 percent

(af)  
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some 35 years after he stopped playing ball, Yogi Berra is
having something of a renaissance as a pitchman. For the former
Yankee catcher, it really is deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, you can see him in television spots promoting Amtrak
and tourism in New Jersey, and in new print ads for the nonprofit
Yogi Berra Museum at Montclair State University in Little Falls,
N.J. He is also scheduled to appear in May in a funny television
commercial for Nike about baseball. Locally, Berra is appearing in
spots for Hilltop Nissan, a New Jersey dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, PBS is developing a documentary about Berra scheduled
for broadcast this summer, and his 1998 best-selling paperback,
``The Yogi Book,'' offering a collection of his famous phrases,
recently came out in hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers say the legendary Yankee is topical for a host of
reasons, ranging from the renewed popularity of baseball to the
Yankees' winning ways to the need for heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, his well-publicized rapprochement with the Yankees owner,
George Steinbrenner, which came after years of bad blood, was more
than just cathartic. It helped put Berra back in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been an interest in Yogi Berra because he has
a strong and colorful personality,'' said Nova Lanktree, president
of Lanktree Sports Celebrity Network in Chicago, who has worked
with Berra in the past. ``He just has those charismatic qualities
that transcend time. Even the younger people get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies may be noticing him even more now because of the
``status of the Yankees as the dream team of baseball,'' Ms.
Lanktree said. And his fans say that with the death of Joe
DiMaggio, Berra is now ``the greatest living Yankee,'' a
distinction that Berra himself dismissed, pointing to other great
living teammates of his time like Whitey Ford and Phil Rizzuto.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that Joe DiMaggio's death has simply reminded people
of that precious time in baseball history _ making all the players
from those golden days more valuable to the public. For instance,
within the last six months Phil Rizzuto been getting more calls for
promotions and appearances, Brandon Steiner, president of Steiner
Sports Marketing in New York, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are baseball's oldest living legends,'' Steiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 72, but still looking fit in corduroys, spanking white
sneakers and a baseball jacket with his museum's insignia, Berra
shrugged off his popularity in a recent interview, but called it
``a great honor, and it's great that it's all in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Berra's three sons, Larry, Tim and Dale, and a daughter-in-law,
Betsy, formed LTD Enterprises six years ago to market their
father's career after they realized that Berra was inundated with
about 100 letters a week, most of them seeking his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   As sports memorabilia grew in popularity, the sons decided they
were better suited than agents to protect and promote their
father's image. LTD now runs a thriving mail-order business and has
a Yogi site on the World Wide Web, complete with a Yogi store, a
whole range of memorabilia and Yogi links to favorite sports sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sell widgets, but I can sell Yogi Berra, it's so
easy,'' said Dale Berra, the youngest son, who played major league
ball from 1977 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads for the museum feature a youthful Berra playing
ball in his Yankee stripes, superimposed over such items as a faded
baseball, a glove and a catcher's mask.
</P>
<P>
   Each ad features a funny malapropism that Berra might have said,
but which were actually written by Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in New
York, a unit of True North Communications. Lines include: ``Every
time you go, it's like you've been there before''; ``We're open
until we close,'' and ``The Yogi Berra Museum: 90 percent of it is
half Yogi.'' The agency is also now working on television spots.
The tag line for of all the ads is ``It all makes sense here.''
</P>
<P>
   Berra said he sees himself as a guy who wanted to play ball. But
even in the early days of television, he was seen as much more than
a ballplayer. The famed advertising executive George Lois said that
in an award-winning television spot he created for the Quaker Oats
Company's Puss 'n Boots cat food in 1960, Berra was one of the
first athletes to be featured not as a direct pitchman, but as part
of a story.
</P>
<P>
   The spot featured Berra, amazed by a cat that had just performed
aerobics on a trampoline, talking to the cat about how to stay in
shape. The cat answers in Whitey Ford's voice.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, Lois said, was that he had trouble selling the idea
to Quaker Oats executives because they did not believe American
women, who bought most of the cat food, could identify Yogi Berra.
Lois had to conduct research to prove the ballplayer's popularity,
which he said was easy since 182 of the 200 women he interviewed
knew Berra.
</P>
<P>
   Lois, now the head of Lois/USA in New York, said the nickname
Yogi and his ``Yogi-isms'' had helped make him a household name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably even more famous now,'' Lois said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Berra has appeared in dozens of commercials for
products like Miller Lite, Pepsi-Cola, Jockey underwear and, of
course, Yoo-Hoo, with which he had a long and famous association
until a falling out a decade ago over the brand's formula.
</P>
<P>
   Berra said he enjoys the commercial work, and remembers the days
before sports stars won big ad contracts. Back then, Berra said he
had to take odd jobs in the off-season to support his family.
</P>
<P>
   One winter after the season ended, the famous Yankee was a
headwaiter in his native St. Louis. Another season, he sold suits
alongside Phil Rizzuto at a men's clothing store in Newark. He also
said he was happy to pick up $200 or so (big money back then, he
noted) to appear at a banquet. At various times he also worked in a
shoe factory and drove a Coca-Cola delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   He credited the late Frank Scott, one of the first sports
agents, with getting him out of the kitchen, literally, by booking
television commercials and appearances on programs like ``The Phil
Silvers Show'' and ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' Berra recalled that he
worked with Scott for years without a contract. Business was
conducted on a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of dignity and honesty are among the traits that make
Berra so valuable today, said Christopher Paul, 31, an account
executive at Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding who works with Berra.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, there wasn't anyone that even came
close to a Yogi Berra,'' Paul said. ``Yogi holds a place in history
that not a lot of others hold. He's a national treasure.''

RORY CALHOUN, 76, STAR OF MANY COWBOY MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Okla.)   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rory Calhoun, a heartthrob-handsome actor who starred in scores
of cowboy movies and the television series ``The Texan,'' died
April 28 at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank, Calif. He was
76.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, who lived in Morongo Valley, Calif, was being treated
at the hospital for diabetes and emphysema, said A.C. Lyles, a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was known mainly as a rugged leading man in
B-westerns, Calhoun also played opposite such leading ladies as
Marilyn Monroe in ``River of No Return,'' Susan Hayward in ``With a
Song in My Heart,'' and Betty Grable in ``Meet Me After the Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun's nickname was ``Smoky'' _ for his smoldering good
looks, particularly his gray-as-smoke eyes. His screen name, Rory,
was said to have been pinned on him by producer David O. Selznick,
who, depending on which story the press agents put out, either was
fascinated by the actor's youthful adventures fighting roaring
forest fires or thought that he should roar because his
astrological sign was Leo.
</P>
<P>
   The actor was born Francis Timothy McCown on Aug. 8, 1922, in
Los Angeles, and grew up in Santa Cruz, Calif. His father died when
he was nine months old and he sometimes used the surname of his
mother's next husband, Nathaniel Durgin. He dropped out of high
school and became a car thief, eventually landing in a federal
reformatory in El Reno, Okla., where he served three years.
</P>
<P>
   After his release in the early 1940s, he worked at a variety of
odd jobs, among them fisherman, truck driver, mechanic, logger,
miner and ranch hand. While riding a horse in a Los Angeles park,
he met actor Alan Ladd, who persuaded him to take a screen test.
</P>
<P>
   He made his screen debut in 1944 in ``Something for the Boys,''
a musical with Carmen Miranda. After years of playing small parts,
he established himself as one of Hollywood's leading cowboys in the
1952 western ``Way of a Gaucho.'' Among the westerns that followed
were ``Four Guns to the Border,'' ``The Treasure of Pancho Villa,''
``The Hired Gun,'' ``Powder River,'' ``The Silver Whip'' and
``Black Spurs.''
</P>
<P>
   His career was endangered in the mid-1950s when blackmailers
threatened to expose his prison past, but he disclosed his record
himself, emphasizing how he had changed.
</P>
<P>
   He may be best remembered for ``The Texan,'' which ran on
network television from 1958 to 1960. He played Big Bill Longley,
who ambled from town to town and fought bad guys who broke the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   When the western genre faded in the 1960s, he made many
low-budget films. From 1982 to 1987, he appeared on the CBS
television soap opera ``Capitol.'' His last film was ``Pure
Country'' in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun's two marriages, first to singer Lita Baron, and then to
Susan Langley, a journalist, both ended in divorce. He is survived
by four daughters, Cindy, of Toluca Lake, Calif., Tami, of
Newcastle, Wash., Lorri, of Portland, Ore., and Rory Patricia Nagy
of Wilmington, N.C.

MELBA LISTON, 73, TROMBONIST AND PROMINENT JAZZ ARRANGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melba Liston, a trombonist and arranger who worked with some of
the best bands in jazz, died April 23 after a series of strokes,
said a friend, pianist Randy Weston. She was 73 and lived in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liston is best known for her collaborations with Weston,
including the ambitious African-influenced works ``High Life'' and
``Uhuru Afrika'' from the early 1960s. On those albums she created
dense harmonies to place over the percussion that Weston was using.
She made his pieces, often harmonically simple, thick with
dissonances and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liston stopped playing in 1985 after a stroke left her
partially paralyzed, but she continued to arrange music with
Weston. Their collaboration continued into the 1990s, and included
work on Weston's ``Spirits of Our Ancestors'' (1992) and ``Volcano
Blues'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liston came to prominence in jazz in 1943, when she joined
arranger-composer Gerald Wilson's band in Los Angeles. She recorded
with the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon in 1947 (he dedicated the
tune ``Mischievous Lady'' to her) and a year later she began
working with Dizzy Gillespie and his orchestra. In 1957 she took
what might be her most famous improvisation on record, on
Gillespie's ``Cool Breeze,'' from ``Dizzy Gillespie at Newport.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years earlier she had dropped out of music, working in
clerical jobs and as a film extra. She had small parts in ``The
Prodigal''and ``The 10 Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   When she returned to music she worked with Gillespie and with
Quincy Jones, who was the music director of the television show
``Free and Easy.'' In the 1960s she worked with Weston, and during
the 1970s she taught in Jamaica at the University of the West
Indies and the Jamaica Institute of Music. She returned to the

EDITORIAL: THE GAMING OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 30:
</P>
<P>
   What Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold saw as they made their
murderous way through Columbine High School last week looked
nothing like the images they saw while playing the video game
called Doom. Instead of heavily armed, square-chinned men and
prognathous monsters roaming a fortress set in a vaguely Asiatic
mountain range, the two teen-agers saw ordinary students lying
prostrate in the blandly over-lit hallways and classrooms of a
modern American high school. How that hideous reality compared to
the fantasy of Doom in the minds of those two boys is impossible to
judge.
</P>
<P>
   The search for cause in the Littleton shootings continues, and
much of it has come to focus on violent video games. Every human,
adolescent or adult, entertains fantasies of one kind or another.
What makes them fantasies is the recognition, reinforced every
passing day, that the world does not bend to our wishes. But as
entertainment technology advances, it becomes easier to act out
computer-simulated, virtual versions of the stereotyped fantasies
our culture markets so well. Something provided a conduit of sorts
between the fantasies Harris and Klebold indulged and the reality
they forced upon their classmates. For several reasons, suspicion
points to video games.
</P>
<P>
   As violent as they are, games like Doom and Doom II and Quake
are also relentlessly first-person. The screen portrays the
player's field of view, and the only visual token of the player's
identity is the gun barrel that protrudes into the bottom of the
frame. In most of these games, the setting and the violence are
inherently unrealistic. What is realistic, in a nightmarish way, is
the sense of rushed three-dimensional movement and the shift in
skill levels that occurs as a child plays more and more. After a
few hours of Doom, a child isn't virtually more skillful at
pointing and shooting, he is actually more skillful. As a player
improves, he is rewarded by an increase in the level of violence.
</P>
<P>
   What is truly alarming is the kind of fantasy these games
embody. Normally when children indulge their fantasies, they tend
to animate not only themselves but also the world around them. They
dramatize it and bring it to life, sharing the stage with the
personae they create. That is one important step toward
understanding the psychological reality of other human beings. But
the fantasy embodied in video games is a narcissistic fantasy of
rage. The psychology it profiles is brutally simple: an armed
first-person actor in a hostile world full of completely
dehumanized targets. This is a fantasy that inevitably prevents the
player from personifying his assailants, which is why it has worked
so well as a form of military training. The danger lies in the way
video games channel and limit imagination as well as in their
apparent violence.
</P>
<P>
   On psychologically vulnerable children, it seems plain that such
games must wreak a kind of havoc, reinforcing their isolation and
fortifying their anger. Still, most children who play violent video
games do not go on to murder their classmates. Nor, in a nation
full of real guns, is banning virtual violence likely to put an end
to school shootings. Oddly, those who categorically blame violent
video games for the murders at Columbine High School risk making
the same mistake they accuse adolescents of making _ confusing
fantasy and reality. Not every fantasy, no matter how violent, is a
sign of sober intent.

AT THE END OF NO. 19 POST, MENIFEE CAMP SEES A LIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Two days before the Kentucky Derby, the gloom
surrounding Barn 35 at Churchill Downs was lifting after being
pierced by the old-fashioned trust _ and maybe the piety _ of the
team inside.
</P>
<P>
   Its members needed all the uplift they could get after Menifee
drew the dreaded No. 19 post position in a field of 20, placing one
more hurdle in their path to great expectations for their hometown
horse.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help much that Vicar, winner of the Florida Derby,
drew the unfavorable No. 18. Nor that several other top horses drew
outside posts that might threaten their chances. Nor that every
stable housing a Derby horse was fighting its demons, too.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line was that Menifee, one of the favorites in the
race, would start from the auxiliary gate with only Lemon Drop Kid
to his right, and in order to muscle his way to the mainstream on
the inside, he would have to use early speed and energy to run or
barrel past some of the best 3-year-olds in America.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee would have to confront Vicar on his left, Charismatic,
First American and then, the biggest hurdle of all, General
Challenge and Prime Timber, both trained by Bob Baffert in his
quest to become the first trainer in the 125-year history of the
Derby to win three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a stable that relies on faith, omens and karma, and
this was a predicament it had faced and survived before. Those
involved all knew that Arthur Hancock, the co-owner of Menifee, had
been plunged into a doomsday mood when he drew the No. 18 post in a
field of 19 for Gato del Sol in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shattered,'' Hancock recalled. ``I went home and lay
down on my bed, and kept asking, `Why me?' I just knew we had lost
the Kentucky Derby. I knew that Gato del Sol would use up his
energy trying to run diagonally across the track from outside to
inside. Finally, I telephoned a friend of mine who was good at
mathematics, and asked him to calculate the extra distance the
horse would have to run.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend drew a right triangle, with the long leg representing
the distance from the start to the first turn. The short leg to the
right was the distance from the rail to the No. 18 post and the
hypotenuse was the distance Gato del Sol would have to run to get
to the rail by the turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a basket case,'' Hancock said. ``Then he called me back,
and said, `The difference is two and a half feet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gato del Sol won by two and a half lengths.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elliott Walden, who grew up in Midway near Lexington in the
heart of the Kentucky blue grass country, was the son of the highly
respected horseman Ben Walden Sr. His brother, Ben Jr., owns and
operates the Vinery breeding farm. Elliott Walden has been the
leading trainer at Churchill Downs for the last two springtime
meetings, and last year saddled Victory Gallop, who ran second in
the Derby and the Preakness and first in the Belmont, spoiling
Baffert's bid to sweep the Triple Crown with Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Walden has a second horse in the Derby _ Ecton Park, who is
owned by Mark Stanley and drew the favorable No. 3 post in the
starting gate. But Ecton Park is not given much of a chance, and
has even been relegated by the Churchill Downs oddsmaker to the
mutuel field. Menifee, meanwhile, is listed at 5-1, which isn't
much solace when you've got post No. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had a redraw,'' Walden said Thursday without
moaning. ``I don't feel that post positions are that important when
you have a quarter mile to go to the first turn. We didn't want No.
19, no. But I had Arthur telling me about Gato del Sol with only
one horse outside him when he won the Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the trials represented by the Kentucky Derby,
which will be won by one of the 33,000 foals delivered three years
ago, it is the core business at Barn 35 to sustain the mood and
keep the faith. Hancock, the son of the legendary Bull Hancock of
Claiborne Farm, sets the tone.
</P>
<P>
   He is joined by his partner in Menifee, the New Orleans oil man
Jimmy Stone. They are backed up by Walden and their jockey, Pat
Day, a born-again revivalist who said after he decided to take
Menifee outside and the colt went on to win the Blue Grass Stakes,
``Once the decision was made, I had great peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden, 36 years old, is 6 feet 5 inches tall with a boyish face
and forthright manner, and he has zoomed to the upper ranks of
trainers, somewhat the way Baffert has done. And he strikes the
ultimate note for Menifee and his stablemates when he recites his
favorite verse from Proverbs: ``The horse is made ready for battle,
but victory rests with the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that faith the team in Barn 35 is counting on.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    On Monday night, I ate supper at 12:49 a.m. As I ate, I began to
write this column on my laptop while watching a movie on HBO. I
made a pot of coffee about 1:15, poured a cup and went outside. My
senses were alive. The air was unseasonably cool, a few stars shone
in the western sky and the heavy odor of smoke from distant
wildfires engulfed everything.
 &HT;    Back inside, I poured more coffee and wrote until 3:30. Tired, I
lay on the couch and fell asleep. I awoke at 5:00 and went for a
walk. Returning at 6:00, I microwaved the old coffee, read the St.
Petersburg Times and the New York Times, listened to National
Public Radio, showered, dressed and arrived at work in time for my
daily 9:30 a.m. editorial board meeting.
 &HT;    I did all of these things without disturbing anyone else. What I
have described is a vignette from the life of just one of America's
25 million adults who live alone.
 &HT;    I did not know that we were so numerous until I read ``Living
Solo,'' photographer Adrienne Salinger's beautiful book chronicling
this ``unique'' way of life.
 &HT;    ``Possibly,'' Salinger writes, ``this is the first generation in
which living alone is presumed to be a legitimate choice rather
than a declaration of defeat; unprecedented numbers of people now
choose to keep their own homes, to decorate them, and to entertain
in them without overt societal pressure to adapt to specific
notions of family living. ... Until recently, living `alone' was
considered an aberration, a transient state within which
individuals were identified by the culture as submissively awaiting
mates in order to participate in society.''
 &HT;    I have lived alone since 1988, when my marriage ended in
divorce. During the first three months, I was lost _ suspended
somewhere without substantive form, incomplete without my longtime
mate. As Salinger suggests, I was cut off from the ``blissful union
in which major purchases and life decisions (are) compromises of
taste and desire.''
 &HT;    Because my house was in the woods, more than 25 miles from
Gainesville, I quickly adapted to living solo by reading and
writing, walking the vast woodlands, growing vegetables and
flowers, maintaining my 3-acre lawn, caring for Fancy Pants, my
Appaloosa, feeding the wild birds and learning to recognize them,
and keeping my old Chevy pickup running.
 &HT;    At the end of the first year of being alone, I could not imagine
living with someone else again, of relinquishing the solitude that
had forced me to feel comfortable with myself. Like Salinger, I am
not talking about being ``single,'' about giving up romantic and
sexual relations. I am talking about celebrating my living space,
about being alone in my book- and newspaper-strewn house whenever I
wish _ for as long as I wish.
 &HT;    Salinger, who has lived alone for years, captures the
uncompromising essence of the solo life in both picture and word:
``Without other people to help govern the events of daily living or
judge the ``normalcy' of particular habits, a certain eccentricity
is allowed to emerge. Eccentricity can be a good thing. It can make
us unique, creative, unusual, mysterious, and sometimes
idiosyncratic.''
 &HT;    Who are these 25 million who live alone in the United States?
``We have nothing in common,'' Salinger writes. ``We have
everything in common. We live in big cities and small towns. We eat
over the sink and in bed _ sometimes at a table. We find things
where we left them. We always know where the good scissors are. We
own the remote control. We are the people who sometimes celebrate
holidays alone. ... We are sometimes lonely. We are often
successful and driven. We are sometimes poor and trapped. We have
good friends. We have lovers. We are old. We are gay and straight.
We are divorced, widowed, single, living on opposite coasts from
our partners.''
 &HT;    Indeed, for many individuals in a ``couple,'' living alone
suggests decadence and unnaturalness. I cannot count the times that
people are shocked that I am not married. How often do
acquaintances tell me to bring my wife when I come to dinner? When
I say that I live alone, the tortured silence on the line confirms
why I live solo. How often do people try to ``set'' me up (and I
hate that)? How often am I called ``weird'' because I do things my
way?
 &HT;    ``It takes an enormous amount of courage to live alone,''
Salinger said. ``You have no escape from looking at yourself.''
 &HT;    More than most people, my favorite poet, May Sarton, who lived
solo most of her life, understood the courage that Salinger speaks
of: ``The value of solitude _ one of its values _ is, of course,
that there is nothing to cushion against attacks from within ... ''
 &HT;    Others who live solo understand perfectly.

``We have nothing in common,'' Salinger writes. ``We have
everything in common. We live in big cities and small towns. We eat
over the sink and in bed _ sometimes at a table. We find things
where we left them. We always know where the good scissors are. We
own the remote control. We are the people who sometimes celebrate
holidays alone. ... We are sometimes lonely. We are often
successful and driven. We are sometimes poor and trapped. We have
good friends. We have lovers. We are old. We are gay and straight.
We are divorced, widowed, single, living on opposite coasts from
our partners.''
 &HT;    Indeed, for many individuals in a ``couple,'' living alone
suggests decadence and unnaturalness. I cannot count the times that
people are shocked that I am not married. How often do
acquaintances tell me to bring my wife when I come to dinner? When
I say that I live alone, the tortured silence on the line confirms
why I live solo. How often do people try to ``set'' me up (and I
hate that)? How often am I called ``weird'' because I do things my
way?
 &HT;    ``It takes an enormous amount of courage to live alone,''
Salinger said. ``You have no escape from looking at yourself.''
 &HT;    More than most people, my favorite poet, May Sarton, who lived
solo most of her life, understood the courage that Salinger speaks
of: ``The value of solitude _ one of its values _ is, of course,
that there is nothing to cushion against attacks from within ... ''
 &HT;    Others who live solo understand perfectly.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    There is crime all around us, though the rates are generally
falling. Criminals come in all shapes and sizes, but tend to hail
from the lower classes of America, the poor, the rural poor, the
urban poor ... the underprivileged. The conclusion, then, is that
most criminal activity is by minorities because most of the poor
are minority people.
 &HT;    That is the logical conclusion and it is right. Right with a
couple of caveats: not all criminals come from the poor; and, most
criminals cannot read and write, despite their economic status.
 &HT;    First, who are the criminals? At least, who is in prison? Using
statistics published by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics we see that the number of whites in prison has increased
from 1990's 139 inmates per 100,000 whites, to 193 in 1996.
Following closely are Hispanics. I use the word ``closely'' in
humor, for Hispanic prisoners have increased from 548 per 100,000
in 1990 to 688 in 1996.
 &HT;    Hispanic prison numbers were obscene in 1990 and they are more
obscene today. But they are nothing compared to that of the blacks.
In 1990, there were 1,067 blacks in prison per 100,000, double the
Hispanic number and five times the white rate. In 1996, the 1,067
had increased by a third to an astounding 1,571.
 &HT;    So now we know who the criminals are; at least we know who the
stupid criminals are and the ones who couldn't afford good lawyers.
But, do we know why they are criminals? Are blacks and Hispanics a
criminal class as determined by race? Or is there some other
underlying reason?
 &HT;    Moreover, we still have whites in prison, don't we? And, there
was a day in American when 99 percent of prison inmates were white.
So, is it ethnicity? Was it ethnicity between 1840 and 1850 when
over half the arrests in New York City were of Irish immigrants?
 &HT;    Race and ethnicity have little, if anything, to do with
criminality and no one other than ``Bell Curve'' believers and
white supremacists think so. If race and ethnicity have little to
do with most criminality, what does? Sociopathology, of course,
accounts for crime among all races and ethnicities, but for our
purposes poverty and illiteracy are the answers.
 &HT;    We know from innumerable studies that the vast majority of
prisoners are illiterate or functionally illiterate. There are 1.8
million prisoners in American prisons and only a tiny percentage
can read or write. Most prisoners come from poor families.
 &HT;    Thus, can we connect the dots of poverty, illiteracy? Can we do
this without racial considerations? Yes, we can do both.
 &HT;    It doesn't take a rocket scientist to conclude that, if whites
had an 8.6 percent poverty rate in 1996 (according to the Economic
Policy Institute) and blacks had a historically persistent 26.1
percent poverty rate, blacks would have a higher rate of
incarceration. But, it does take a rocket scientist to figure out
why Hispanics, who in recent years have surpassed the black poverty
rate for the first time, at 26.4 percent, have an incarceration
rate less than half that of blacks.
 &HT;    Part of the answer to Hispanic poverty is that so many Hispanics
have immigrated to the United States in recent years and they come
here for opportunity _ not prison. But, in literacy, blacks and
whites have approximately the same high school graduation rates and
we are bombarded with the perception that Hispanics have large
school dropout rates. So why such a gulf between blacks and
Hispanics in incarceration rates?
 &HT;    That gulf, by the way, leads us to another gulf: the one between
immigrant Hispanics and native-born Hispanics. Approximately 40
percent of Hispanics have immigrated here. Yet, among bona fide
immigrants, there are few criminals. Most of the foreign born
inmates are actually not immigrants but foreign nationals caught
smuggling everything from drugs to people. Among the native-born
Hispanics, about 300 per 100,000 are incarcerated, placing them
about a third higher than whites, but about a fifth of the black
level.
 &HT;    What do we now know? We know that if a child doesn't learn to
read and write, he will probably end up in prison. We know that if
a child grows up in poverty, he may wind up in prison. Poverty,
however, should have little bearing on whether a child learns to
read or write, for that is a skill learned in school and there are
plenty of schools in poor areas.
 &HT;    I don't speak here of college prep, or of high school dropouts,
just reading and writing. Think of all that could be saved in human
and prison costs if children could just learn to read and write _
learn from the teachers we pay to teach reading and writing.
 &HT;    But the astounding black crime rate will not be solved by
reading and writing, for those skills cannot obliterate almost 400
years of slavery, subjugation, segregation and hate that oppress
and depress the lives and the spirit of blacks _ a condition that
neither this writer nor the reader can imagine without being black.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    When the Indian nations of America began to open bingo parlors
and small gaming casinos on their lands the most active and ardent
of opponents were the casino operators in Nevada and New Jersey.
 &HT;    Well financed, well connected and media-wise, they began a
campaign to place roadblocks in the path of any Indian tribe daring
to venture into gaming. Their attacks included heavy donations to
members of Congress and a media-propaganda campaign aimed at duping
the American people into believing organized crime would soon
become rampant on Indian lands.
 &HT;    One very small California tribe had the misfortune of hiring a
man of questionable background and, supposedly, with connections to
organized crime. When his past began to unravel, the tribe
immediately terminated his employment. But this was the fly in the
ointment the Nevada and New Jersey bigwigs needed to point an
accusatory finger at all Indian nations _ and they used the mass
media as their instrument of fear mongering. Even Donald Trump used
a popular radio talk show to attack Indian gaming.
 &HT;    Those people most brainwashed by this propaganda were officials
and legislators in state governments fearful that the Indian tribes
within their borders would soon approach them seeking compacts to
open casinos on their reservations.
 &HT;    In South Dakota gambling was legalized when the people voted for
a proposition allowing most forms of gambling in Deadwood. This
opened the doors for the Indian nations to offer similar gaming on
their reservations. Indian tribes were not even considered as part
of the equation until the legislation passed and the lawmakers
discovered what they had inadvertently done by placing legalized
gambling in Deadwood on the ballot.
 &HT;    As casinos became commonplace on many reservations a new set of
problems emerged. Should the revenues be handed out to the people
in per capita payments? Would this create a new form of dependency?
Should members of the tribe living off the reservation be party to
the per capita money? If per capita payments are not distributed,
where do we invest our earnings?
 &HT;    One tribe decided to give out a large Christmas bonus to its
members but forgot about the Internal Revenue Service. Of course,
the IRS stepped up and asked for their share. The tribe had to
borrow the money and this placed them in a terrible financial
position. (Why do I keep hearing that Indians don't pay taxes?)
 &HT;    Because some eastern tribes did not consider their status as
sovereign entities so important they signed compacts with state
governments requiring tax payments on their gaming revenues. This,
of course, became an obstacle for many western tribes that were in
the process of negotiating gaming agreements with state
governments. State officials recognized the opportunity to increase
their tax base and refused to approve compacts unless the tribes
paid a percentage of their earnings in taxes. This amounted to
legalized blackmail. The Indian nations of New Mexico were assessed
16 percent of their casino revenues by the state.
 &HT;    Some tribes see gaming as the new buffalo. No recent event has
had such a profound impact upon their lives since the victory over
Gen. George Custer at the Little Big Horn and the Massacre at
Wounded Knee.
 &HT;    But the key to how casino gambling treats the Indian nations of
America lies in the hands of its leadership. Whether it becomes a
secure and stable business depends on the ability of the tribal
leadership to secure solid, fruitful gaming compacts with state
governments and a willingness by the U.S. Congress to help rather
than hinder the efforts of the tribal governments.
 &HT;    In the future some tribes will stretch the limits of their
status as sovereign nations while others will stand firm and
legally and physically defy any threat to their sovereignty. This
might mean that some will start gaming operations without the
benefit of a state compact. Others will be challenging the
authority vested in Congress through the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act, an Act many tribal leaders consider to be unfair, unmanageable
and anti-Indian.
 &HT;    There are early signs of trouble just as there are early signs
of success. Tribes with traditional, educated and dedicated
leadership have dipped into the revenues produced by their casinos
to rebuild the infrastructure of their nations. They have
constructed new schools, hospitals, government buildings, museums,
colleges and earmarked money for scholarships and training programs
for tribal members. They have re-purchased land that was,
oftentimes, taken from them illegally centuries ago and thus have
expanded the exterior boundaries of their sovereign nations.
 &HT;    Of course, they have encountered opposition from state
governments at nearly every juncture. State governments have been
either blind to the improvements or reluctant to recognize them.
Tribes with 50 percent of their population on welfare 12 years ago
have reduced that percentage to near zero. The casinos have
rejuvenated economically depressed areas in some states by new job
opportunities and increased traffic to the white-owned business
located around the casinos.
 &HT;    The haste by some tribes to give out monthly per capita payments
to each member has created problems that only time can judge. On
one reservation the monthly stipend is so large that the tribe is
having a hard time convincing its young to seek the opportunities
of a higher education. In one state, the percentage of Indians
employed in the casinos was near 70 percent. In the past 5 years
that has dwindled to about 30 percent.
 &HT;    As long as that golden goose is handing out monthly checks, why
work? In some tribes in the Southwest, where the traditional and
spiritual bent of the people ensured a humble demure, a new
arrogance has arisen. It is one that clashes with the very
traditions and cultures of tribes who survived the onslaught of the
settlers with the help of and strengthened by their deep spiritual
beliefs.
 &HT;    But as the luck of the draw will have it, the largest and
poorest of the Indian nations will never be faced with this
dilemma. They are located in sparely populated regions that can
never generate the number of gamblers needed to make casinos
profitable. In 1999 only 5 percent of the gaming tribes earned 90
percent of the profits. This means that 95 percent continued to
struggle economically. The eggs dropped by the golden goose only
landed in a few places.
 &HT;    In the long run much depends on the ability of the tribal
leadership to put gaming into perspective and to use it as a
springboard to diversify their holdings. They cannot allow gaming
to become the tail that wags dog.

status as sovereign nations while others will stand firm and
legally and physically defy any threat to their sovereignty. This
might mean that some will start gaming operations without the
benefit of a state compact. Others will be challenging the
authority vested in Congress through the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act, an Act many tribal leaders consider to be unfair, unmanageable
and anti-Indian.
 &HT;    There are early signs of trouble just as there are early signs
of success. Tribes with traditional, educated and dedicated
leadership have dipped into the revenues produced by their casinos
to rebuild the infrastructure of their nations. They have
constructed new schools, hospitals, government buildings, museums,
colleges and earmarked money for scholarships and training programs
for tribal members. They have re-purchased land that was,
oftentimes, taken from them illegally centuries ago and thus have
expanded the exterior boundaries of their sovereign nations.
 &HT;    Of course, they have encountered opposition from state
governments at nearly every juncture. State governments have been
either blind to the improvements or reluctant to recognize them.
Tribes with 50 percent of their population on welfare 12 years ago
have reduced that percentage to near zero. The casinos have
rejuvenated economically depressed areas in some states by new job
opportunities and increased traffic to the white-owned business
located around the casinos.
 &HT;    The haste by some tribes to give out monthly per capita payments
to each member has created problems that only time can judge. On
one reservation the monthly stipend is so large that the tribe is
having a hard time convincing its young to seek the opportunities
of a higher education. In one state, the percentage of Indians
employed in the casinos was near 70 percent. In the past 5 years
that has dwindled to about 30 percent.
 &HT;    As long as that golden goose is handing out monthly checks, why
work? In some tribes in the Southwest, where the traditional and
spiritual bent of the people ensured a humble demure, a new
arrogance has arisen. It is one that clashes with the very
traditions and cultures of tribes who survived the onslaught of the
settlers with the help of and strengthened by their deep spiritual
beliefs.
 &HT;    But as the luck of the draw will have it, the largest and
poorest of the Indian nations will never be faced with this
dilemma. They are located in sparely populated regions that can
never generate the number of gamblers needed to make casinos
profitable. In 1999 only 5 percent of the gaming tribes earned 90
percent of the profits. This means that 95 percent continued to
struggle economically. The eggs dropped by the golden goose only
landed in a few places.
 &HT;    In the long run much depends on the ability of the tribal
leadership to put gaming into perspective and to use it as a
springboard to diversify their holdings. They cannot allow gaming
to become the tail that wags dog.

 &HT;    (Kirsten Chapman writes a weekly column for the Columbus
Dispatch in Columbus, Ohio, and is the author of three books,
including recently published ``The Way Home.'') 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``What am I going to do?'' asked the panicked voice at the other
end of the line.
 &HT;    ``My in-laws are coming for a visit, and the house is a wreck. I
don't know where to begin.''
 &HT;    So, for the sake of her friend in need, Rosemary Brown bundled
up her young son and went to the rescue.
 &HT;    As their children played, the two women moved ``through the
house like a white tornado.''
 &HT;    ``I can't tell you how much I appreciate this,'' the friend said
afterward. ``You made sense out of it. You should write a book.''
 &HT;    ``But this isn't difficult,'' Brown said.
 &HT;    ``It's easy for you,'' her friend insisted, ``but not for
everyone.''
 &HT;    Two decades later, the 53-year old Brown continues to take
readers by the hand and show them ``how'' in her recently published
``Big Kitchen Instruction Book'' (Andrews &AMP; McMeel, $19.95).
 &HT;    ``It was as if she held up a mirror for me,'' said Brown,
recalling the comment that sparked a career. ``Everyone of us has a
gift, but, because it comes so naturally, we take it for granted.
Once you realize it's special, you can begin to share it.''
 &HT;    Share she did _ by establishing Neat Ideas which specializes in
home management; and publishing, ``Getting Your Home in Order.''
 &HT;    The Nashville, Tenn., home she shares with her husband _ H.
Jackson Brown, author of ``Life's Little Instruction Book'' _ could
hardly be more orderly or beautifully arranged.
 &HT;    ``I'm a space detective,'' she admits. ``I love order,
structure, making things fit _ showing how they relate to each
other and putting them in a meaningful whole. I like jigsaw
puzzles, cross-word puzzles, puzzle of any sort.''
 &HT;    Her 432-page Instruction Book, which weighed a hefty 12 pounds
in manuscript form, is a guide to solving one of the biggest
puzzles of all: managing a kitchen. It tells how to streamline and
organize the busiest room in the house. From recipes and menus to
food facts and tips, it offers everything including the kitchen
sink, beginning on page 21.
 &HT;    ``A lot of the information,'' Brown writes in the introduction,
``has slipped through the cracks into the generation gap between
what our mothers and grandmothers knew, and what we need to find
out.''
 &HT;    Through seminars and informal gatherings, she discovered that
people wanted to know more about the kitchen. ``That's where the
rubber met the road for them,'' she said. ``It was the place where
they had the most trouble and needed the most help ... ''
 &HT;    By creating an environment that brings harmony instead of
friction, ``I help people improve family relationships without ...
counseling. It seems like a far jump between `let me help you get
your kitchen organized' to `let me help you with your family
relationships,' but they're connected through a series of links in
a chain. If I can make a difference on one end, that ends up
strengthening that chain all the way down the line.''
 &HT;    Some weeks after the November publication of her book, Brown got
a long-distance call from a wife and mother.
 &HT;    ``Rosemary, I've been married for almost 15 years. I've never
been able to cook a decent meal, never had the courage to invite
people over. Instead, we always entertained at restaurants. And
when I'd pick up the boys after sports, I'd ask, `Do you want to go
to Wendy's? McDonald's?'
 &HT;    ``Finally my oldest said, `Mom, some night could we just go
home?'
 &HT;    ``I want you to know that I've finally put down my fear of the
kitchen. We had our first dinner party where I cooked. It was so
easy, so good ... You've made a difference in my life.'''
 &HT;    What Brown wants most is to encourage people like the caller.
She hopes to reassure them.
 &HT;    ``What they do in taking care of their families is important,''
she says.
 &HT;    ``All of us have insecurities in some areas ... and others where
we shine ... When we know something well, we want to take people by
the hand and save them from grief and embarrassment. We want to
say: It's really not that difficult. All you have to do is know
these few things and then you can feel, `I can do this.'''
 &HT;    Brown considers her book common sense, not revolutionary.
 &HT;    ``I'm surprised no one has ever written all these things down
before.''
 &HT;    One nugget: ``Plan your storage so that you have easy, single
motion access to whatever you use most often.''
 &HT;    For example, many homemakers have a favorite skillet, she said,
``that lives at the bottom of a nest of saucepans. Every time they
want that skillet, they have to take the saucepans out, remove the
skillet, put the saucepans back and close the door.''
 &HT;    Her solution? Hang the skillet on the inside of the cabinet
door.
 &HT;    Brown, who received her first cookbook at age 10, has ``always
had a real desire to do something domestic. I've always been the
homemaker.''
 &HT;    No wonder she values the importance of home. Abandoned at birth
in an Oklahoma hospital on Easter Sunday, she was adopted by a
couple in Dallas who reared her in an atmosphere of love, security
and order.
 &HT;    Many of the recipes in her book share family history _ such as
the sour-cream cookies that her favorite sitter _ ``her godmother's
mother'' _ used to bake.
 &HT;    Rescued herself, she likes to help others the way a fairy
godmother, grandmother, mother or best friend would.
 &HT;    ``That to me, is one of the greatest joys _ to take someone by
the hand and say, ``Let me show you: let me make it easy for you.''

 &HT;    (Lee Ann Kim is a reporter/anchor for KGTV in San Diego,
Calif.) 
 c. 1999 KoreAm Journal 
<TEXT>
 &UR; New America News Service &QC;
<P>
   Anyone who knows Jung-Ho Pak knows not to call him maestro. Even
though the San Diego Symphony conductor and artistic director has
certainly earned the title, he refuses it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maestro means `teacher.' And since I am still learning from
the musicians, I don't like to be called that,'' Pak explains.
``When musicians call me maestro, I also call them maestro. It may
be out of respect that they call me that. But respect is more than
just words. It's about attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for me not to take myself too seriously and be
open to criticism. Keep that respect flowing back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak, 37, the youngest maestro in the symphony's history and the
only Korean American conductor of a major U.S. symphony, fears
being viewed as a tyrant. ``I've had and seen other conductors and
teachers who were really autocratic. It's very sexy to be bossy.
Very sexy to play the maestro thing. Very ego gratifying. And power
does corrupt. It turns you into a musician who thinks that (he or
she is) good. And really, that is the beginning of the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak's principal of equality carries over into his style of
conducting. Onstage, he leads the orchestra without a baton because
he sees it as a symbol of authority. He does, however, bend his
anti-baton rule when it comes to posing for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just for publicity reasons,'' Pak explains. ``If I
weren't holding that thing, no one would know who I was. Just some
Korean guy with his hands up.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, slowing down is nearly impossible for Pak, who
conducts full concerts with different orchestras every week. On
average, he'll have one rehearsal a day, maybe two, each lasting
two-and-a-half hours.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Pak's time is also spent on the road or in the air.
Three days a week he jets up north to rehearse and teach at the San
Francisco Conservatory. Twice a week he drives to Los Angeles to
work with the University of Southern California Symphony. When he's
not pulling a statewide commute, Pak is out and about in San Diego
making noise about the symphony through fund-raising, speaking at
schools or teaching students. Somewhere within that schedule, Pak
must also find time to master musical scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to spend a lot of time looking at the score,'' he says.
``But that's so hard to do ... carve out some creative time and
study very quietly and imagine what the composer was trying to say
in a piece.''
</P>
<P>
   On the podium, a conductor's task is more complex than just the
waving of arms. ``Your basic job is to keep the tempo and show what
the pacing of a piece will be,'' Pak explains. ``When you work with
a better orchestra, tempo is less crucial. You can become more
artistic and show more subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, I try to keep track of all the different
instruments,'' he says. ``As I'm conducting, I'm aware of all (of
them) at the same time. I try to find a commonality and move
together as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak compares the unharnessed clamor of classical instruments
with the sound of stepping into a cocktail party: ``When you walk
in, you hear many conversations going on at the same time. It's
almost impossible to understand what everyone's saying.'' Therein
lies the challenge: to create one big conversation by incorporating
many different voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can control things like dynamics, articulation and
phrasing,'' he continues. ``And I think having a clear beat is
very, very difficult. It's not quite as simple as it looks. You use
your hand motions, wrist and body stance to seduce and cajole an
orchestra into manifesting music.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak describes the feeling of a flawless performance to a Zen,
holistic state. He points out that when we chew food, we don't
think ``close teeth, open teeth, swallow.'' When the players hit
all the right notes, conducting springs like second nature, and
under the best circumstances, the music is carrying him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my arms hurt, it means the orchestra is going too slow,
so I'm pounding the beat a little harder,'' he explains. ``I have
to conduct bigger. Then I start to think about the mistakes. I
become conscious of the players and of myself ... like if I'm
standing kind of funny.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to his favorite composer, Pak claims it's usually
the one he's currently working on. He does, however, admit favoring
Beethoven and Brahms because ``they blend tradition and revolution
so well.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a clear winner when it comes to his favorite
conductor: ``I love Leonard Bernstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Since no one in his family is a professional musician, it's hard
to say where Pak picked up his ear for music. He dismisses any
notion of having been a prodigy. But he does credit some of his
success to being Korean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Isaac Stern once said that Koreans are the Jews of
the Orient,'' he says. ``I think it's true. If you notice, a lot of
the great musicians are Jewish. And from the Asian community,
Koreans are really cleaning up these days. And I think it's due to
our sense of temperament. There's a certain passion that Koreans
have. I think without that in my DNA, I probably wouldn't be as
good a musician.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak was born in 1962 in the San Francisco Bay area during an era
when being Korean in the United States was ``a bit unusual.'' His
parents emigrated from South Korea in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents had your very typical rags to riches story,'' he
explains. ``My father came to this country as a translator in the
army. He studied pharmacy while working at the Van de Kamp bean
factory moving boxes. My mother went to nursing school and
studied.'' After years of struggling, Pak's father became a
pharmacist, but decided to return to school for dentistry. Pak says
it was from his parents that he learned the virtues of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Korean American children, Pak took piano lessons, but
also learned the clarinet. Yet unlike many Korean American children
for whom learning music is often a ``battle of wills,'' as he calls
it, he was never forced into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so many stories of Korean parents forcing their kids to
play musical instruments when they don't want to,'' he explains.
``It's the clashing of two worlds. One is the Eastern world that
believes in discipline, obeying your parents, being successful and
being well-rounded. The other is Western where you have television
and sports, where leisure time is a very significant part of
childhood. That's where the battleground is.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak discourages Asian parents from forcing their children into
music, and instead encourages them to support the visual arts.
``One of the great dichotomies that I find in all Korean or Asian
families is that they'll send their children to piano or violin
lessons but they don't attend theater or concerts. So what I'm
hoping to do is get them in the concert hall and participate and
take pride in the fact that a Korean American is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak's first joyful moment as a conductor came at age 13, while
he was practicing with his junior high school band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a substitute teacher, and everyone was egging me on to
conduct,'' Pak recalls. ``I was very shy, but I did it. I remember
waiving my arms, and somehow things were happening. Music was being
made, and I didn't make a fool of myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being exhilarated and scared at the same time. All
the people were depending on me _ it was quite a thrill, an
incredible rush when all this sound comes at you. It's like a drug
and you want to do it again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak found his place on the podium. He went on to lead the band
in high school, where he established the cornerstone of his
conducting philosophy. ``We used to play at halftime during
basketball games. And that experience helped a great deal because
it taught me how to deal with my peers. I learned I could not
control them by yelling or acting superior. The only way I could
get their cooperation was by being their colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak was so driven by the time he attended the University of
California at Santa Cruz, that he finished his undergraduate degree
in music theory in two years because ``there weren't any
undergraduate conducting programs. I wanted to graduate as soon as
I could to go on to a master's program.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning his MA in instrumental conducting at the San
Francisco Conservatory, he landed his first real conducting job.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Bethlehem, Pa., to become a conductor at Leigh High
University, ``turned out to be the best thing for me, because I
worked with the jazz band which helped me learn to have fun while
conducting.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Pak's mother frowned upon her only son's musical
endeavors. Yet he finally gained her approval in 1992 when he
became a conducting professor at UC Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, she didn't want me to go hungry,'' he says. ``My
parents went through the Korean War. Once you go through that kind
of poverty and struggling, you just don't want it to happen to your
children no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak's claim to fame was born out of the financial disaster that
nearly decimated the San Diego Symphony Orchestra. Just
two-and-a-half years ago, the organization claimed Chapter 11 as a
result of fiscal mismanagement. The orchestra played its last note
in the spring of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego needed a miracle: someone who could regain the trust
of the music community and build morale. Someone who had a modern
perspective of a very traditional business. Someone who could make
classical music fun.
</P>
<P>
   That miracle was Jung-Ho Pak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any question we wanted him. Everything he is,
everything he's about is what we wanted,'' says Sandra Pay, the
symphony's board chairwoman. ``He looks a lot younger than he is,
but I tell people he's a 55-year-old man because he's done the work
of someone who is 55.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the symphony resurrected itself from bankruptcy
under Pak's direction. The agenda for its first full season since
the collapse includes 47 innovative performances such as the
``Light Bulb Concert Series'' in which videos, artwork and food are
used to enlighten the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've been dreaming about for a long time,'' Pak
says about his most recent concert titled ``The French
Connection.'' During the unprecedented two-hour performance, Pak
and the orchestra led the audience back in time to experience life
in Paris during the 1920s and '30s to pay homage to the era's
greatest composers, from Igor Stravinsky to Duke Ellington. The
night included large-screen projections of French art and racy
video clips of dancer Josephine Baker. In between the music and
videos, Pak conducted live interviews with French poets, art
curators, a food critic, and even a chef who cooked French cuisine
onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Never has the symphony been so interactive and viewer-friendly.
Pak has long believed that the traditional presentation of
classical music must change or ``die and become part of a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak also helped spark the idea of the ``Rush Hour Series'' for
San Diegans caught in gridlock. The hour-long concerts help quell
road rage for drivers facing a stressful commute.
</P>
<P>
   Such ingenuity and innovation have long been missing links for
the orchestra. If all goes well, the symphony will end its
inaugural season in the black. For Pak, that is an incredible
accomplishment _ one that many considered impossible.

   Anyone who knows Jung-Ho Pak knows not to call him maestro. Even
though the San Diego Symphony conductor and artistic director has
certainly earned the title, he refuses it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maestro means `teacher.' And since I am still learning from
the musicians, I don't like to be called that,'' Pak explains.
``When musicians call me maestro, I also call them maestro. It may
be out of respect that they call me that. But respect is more than
just words. It's about attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for me not to take myself too seriously and be
open to criticism. Keep that respect flowing back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak, 37, the youngest maestro in the symphony's history and the
only Korean American conductor of a major U.S. symphony, fears
being viewed as a tyrant. ``I've had and seen other conductors and
teachers who were really autocratic. It's very sexy to be bossy.
Very sexy to play the maestro thing. Very ego gratifying. And power
does corrupt. It turns you into a musician who thinks that (he or
she is) good. And really, that is the beginning of the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak's principal of equality carries over into his style of
conducting. Onstage, he leads the orchestra without a baton because
he sees it as a symbol of authority. He does, however, bend his
anti-baton rule when it comes to posing for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just for publicity reasons,'' Pak explains. ``If I
weren't holding that thing, no one would know who I was. Just some
Korean guy with his hands up.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, slowing down is nearly impossible for Pak, who
conducts full concerts with different orchestras every week. On
average, he'll have one rehearsal a day, maybe two, each lasting
two-and-a-half hours.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Pak's time is also spent on the road or in the air.
Three days a week he jets up north to rehearse and teach at the San
Francisco Conservatory. Twice a week he drives to Los Angeles to
work with the University of Southern California Symphony. When he's
not pulling a statewide commute, Pak is out and about in San Diego
making noise about the symphony through fund-raising, speaking at
schools or teaching students. Somewhere within that schedule, Pak
must also find time to master musical scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to spend a lot of time looking at the score,'' he says.
``But that's so hard to do ... carve out some creative time and
study very quietly and imagine what the composer was trying to say
in a piece.''
</P>
<P>
   On the podium, a conductor's task is more complex than just the
waving of arms. ``Your basic job is to keep the tempo and show what
the pacing of a piece will be,'' Pak explains. ``When you work with
a better orchestra, tempo is less crucial. You can become more
artistic and show more subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, I try to keep track of all the different
instruments,'' he says. ``As I'm conducting, I'm aware of all (of
them) at the same time. I try to find a commonality and move
together as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak compares the unharnessed clamor of classical instruments
with the sound of stepping into a cocktail party: ``When you walk
in, you hear many conversations going on at the same time. It's
almost impossible to understand what everyone's saying.'' Therein
lies the challenge: to create one big conversation by incorporating
many different voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can control things like dynamics, articulation and
phrasing,'' he continues. ``And I think having a clear beat is
very, very difficult. It's not quite as simple as it looks. You use
your hand motions, wrist and body stance to seduce and cajole an
orchestra into manifesting music.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak describes the feeling of a flawless performance to a Zen,
holistic state. He points out that when we chew food, we don't
think ``close teeth, open teeth, swallow.'' When the players hit
all the right notes, conducting springs like second nature, and
under the best circumstances, the music is carrying him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my arms hurt, it means the orchestra is going too slow,
so I'm pounding the beat a little harder,'' he explains. ``I have
to conduct bigger. Then I start to think about the mistakes. I
become conscious of the players and of myself ... like if I'm
standing kind of funny.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to his favorite composer, Pak claims it's usually
the one he's currently working on. He does, however, admit favoring
Beethoven and Brahms because ``they blend tradition and revolution
so well.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a clear winner when it comes to his favorite
conductor: ``I love Leonard Bernstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Since no one in his family is a professional musician, it's hard
to say where Pak picked up his ear for music. He dismisses any
notion of having been a prodigy. But he does credit some of his
success to being Korean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Isaac Stern once said that Koreans are the Jews of
the Orient,'' he says. ``I think it's true. If you notice, a lot of
the great musicians are Jewish. And from the Asian community,
Koreans are really cleaning up these days. And I think it's due to
our sense of temperament. There's a certain passion that Koreans
have. I think without that in my DNA, I probably wouldn't be as
good a musician.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak was born in 1962 in the San Francisco Bay area during an era
when being Korean in the United States was ``a bit unusual.'' His
parents emigrated from South Korea in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents had your very typical rags to riches story,'' he
explains. ``My father came to this country as a translator in the
army. He studied pharmacy while working at the Van de Kamp bean
factory moving boxes. My mother went to nursing school and
studied.'' After years of struggling, Pak's father became a
pharmacist, but decided to return to school for dentistry. Pak says
it was from his parents that he learned the virtues of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Korean American children, Pak took piano lessons, but
also learned the clarinet. Yet unlike many Korean American children
for whom learning music is often a ``battle of wills,'' as he calls
it, he was never forced into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so many stories of Korean parents forcing their kids to
play musical instruments when they don't want to,'' he explains.
``It's the clashing of two worlds. One is the Eastern world that
believes in discipline, obeying your parents, being successful and
being well-rounded. The other is Western where you have television
and sports, where leisure time is a very significant part of
childhood. That's where the battleground is.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak discourages Asian parents from forcing their children into
music, and instead encourages them to support the visual arts.
``One of the great dichotomies that I find in all Korean or Asian
families is that they'll send their children to piano or violin
lessons but they don't attend theater or concerts. So what I'm
hoping to do is get them in the concert hall and participate and
take pride in the fact that a Korean American is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak's first joyful moment as a conductor came at age 13, while
he was practicing with his junior high school band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a substitute teacher, and everyone was egging me on to
conduct,'' Pak recalls. ``I was very shy, but I did it. I remember
waiving my arms, and somehow things were happening. Music was being
made, and I didn't make a fool of myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being exhilarated and scared at the same time. All
the people were depending on me _ it was quite a thrill, an
incredible rush when all this sound comes at you. It's like a drug
and you want to do it again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak found his place on the podium. He went on to lead the band
in high school, where he established the cornerstone of his
conducting philosophy. ``We used to play at halftime during
basketball games. And that experience helped a great deal because
it taught me how to deal with my peers. I learned I could not
control them by yelling or acting superior. The only way I could
get their cooperation was by being their colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak was so driven by the time he attended the University of
California at Santa Cruz, that he finished his undergraduate degree
in music theory in two years because ``there weren't any
undergraduate conducting programs. I wanted to graduate as soon as
I could to go on to a master's program.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning his MA in instrumental conducting at the San

</P>

   WHO ARE OUR CRIMINALS? Though crime rates are generally falling,
observes columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras, criminals come in all
shapes and sizes but tend to hail from America's poor: the rural
poor, the urban poor ... the underprivileged. The conclusion, then,
can be that most criminal activity is by minorities because most of
the poor are minority people. But that, he stresses is were
generalizations end. ``One of the main reasons for high minority
crime rates is illiteracy,'' he points out. And, in the case of
African Americans, it is ``400 years of slavery, subjugation,
segregation and hate that oppress and depress their lives and

   FINDING HAPPINESS IN THE SOLO LIFE. Columnist Bill Maxwell
didn't realize there were as many as 25 million adults in America
who live alone _ and he is but one of them _ until he read
photographer Adrienne Salinger's book, ``Living Solo,'' that
chronicles this ``unique'' way of life. ``This is the first
generation,'' he quotes Salinger, ``in which living alone is
presumed to be a legitimate choice rather than a declaration of
defeat; unprecedented numbers of people now choose to keep their
own homes, to decorate them, and to entertain in them without overt
societal pressure to adapt to specific notions of family living.''

   WHO ARE OUR CRIMINALS? Though crime rates are generally falling,
observes columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras, criminals come in all
shapes and sizes but tend to hail from America's poor: the rural
poor, the urban poor ... the underprivileged. The conclusion, then,
can be that most criminal activity is by minorities because most of
the poor are minority people. But that, he stresses is were
generalizations end. ``One of the main reasons for high minority
crime rates is illiteracy,'' he points out. And, in the case of
African Americans, it is ``400 years of slavery, subjugation,
segregation and hate that oppress and depress their lives and
spirit _ a condition no one can imagine without being black.''

   SUCCESS OF GAMING DEPENDS ON ENLIGHTENED INDIAN LEADERSHIP. Some
tribes see gaming as the new buffalo, writes columnist Tim Giago.
No recent event has had such a profound impact upon their lives
since the victory over Gen. George Custer at the Little Big Horn,
and the Massacre at Wounded Knee. But the key to how casino
gambling treats the Indian nations of America lies in the hands of
its leadership. Tribes with traditional, educated and dedicated
leadership have dipped into the revenues produced by their casinos
to rebuild the infrastructure of their nations. They have
constructed new schools, hospitals, government buildings, museums,
colleges and earmarked money for scholarships and training programs
for tribal members.

   HOMEMAKER'S BLOCKBUSTER BOOK PUTS THE WORLD IN ORDER. Rosemary
Brown didn't realize she had a gift until a friend asked for help
putting her home in order, reports writer Kirsten Chapman. Twenty
years later, the Nashville, Tenn. homemaker has a business _ Neat
Ideas which specializes in home management _ and has published the
wildly successful ``Getting Your Home in Order'' and the recent hit
``Big Kitchen Instruction Book.'' Brown considers her book common
sense, not revolutionary. ``I'm surprised no one has ever written
all these things down before,'' she says, adding ``For me, one of
the greatest joys is to take someone by the hand and say, `Let me
show you: let me make it easy for you.'''

the San Diego Symphony Orchestra, writes Lee Ann Kim for KoreAm
Journal, claimed Chapter 11 as a result of fiscal mismanagement,
and the orchestra played its last note. San Diego needed a miracle:
someone who could regain the trust of the music community, build
morale, who had a modern perspective of a very traditional business
_ and who could make classical music fun. Read how Jung-Ho Pak, the
youngest maestro in the symphony's history and the only Korean

SUBWAY PUSHING SUSPECT HAS HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A homeless man accused of pushing a commuter into the
path of an oncoming subway train Wednesday has a history of mental
illness and told detectives that he spent the day of the attack
roaming city streets, convinced people were trying to kill him, a
police official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said they had found no evidence that Julio
Perez, 43, had committed any acts of serious violence before
pushing Edgar Rivera, 46, onto the tracks of the busy station at
51st Street in midtown Manhattan. The train severed Rivera's legs,
but he survived and was in critical but stable condition Thursday
at Bellevue Hospital Center, said Lorinda Klein, a hospital
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's wife, Elizabeth, kept a vigil through early Thursday
morning while doctors tried unsuccessfully to reattach his legs.
Friends and neighbors in the Soundview section of the Bronx who
heard about the attack described Rivera, a printer, as athletic,
and intensely devoted and attentive to his wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was arraigned Thursday on charges of attempted murder and
assault. He was held without bail and a judge ordered him to
undergo psychiatric tests.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that Perez lived in a men's shelter with a
special program for the mentally ill in upper Manhattan's
Washington Heights. His court-appointed lawyer, David Kapner, said
that Perez had told him that he was mentally ill and said that he
had been taking medication, but did not specify the precise nature
of the illness or say what drugs he took.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives found several pills on Perez but were unable to
identify them, a law enforcement official said. In a statement to
investigators, Perez confessed to pushing the man onto the tracks,
a second law enforcement official said, and told them that he had
carried out the attack after spending the day walking the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he said he was roaming around the streets paranoid,
thinking people were out to kill him,'' the second official said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, a native of Puerto Rico who served in the Army two
decades ago, has been in various homeless shelters since 1995. The
authorities said he had been convicted three times for fare-beating
and twice for possessing small amounts marijuana. He was arrested
in 1996 for aggravated harassment, robbery and weapons possession,
police said, but a check of his criminal record found no
disposition of that case.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Perez has been in the Fort Washington
Men's Shelter, a 200-bed facility in upper Manhattan, where he
lived in a shelter within the shelter serving 40 mentally ill men
run by Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center called Critical Time
Intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slept in our shelter the night before this happened,'' said
Martin Oesterreich, the new commissioner of the city's Department
of Homeless Services. ``You can't cover every eventuality.
Obviously the system didn't work well if we aren't able to prevent
this kind of thing. You have a tragedy like this, it makes you
re-examine everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the details of Perez's situation were far from clear
Thursday _ there remained questions about whether he had been
taking his medicine, for example, and whether he had been receptive
to treatment or had been let down by the system in any way _ the
incident revived the debate over whether the state's laws
concerning the mentally ill should be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   It is a debate that began gathering momentum three months ago
after a similar incident: the death of Kendra Webdale, who police
said was killed by a subway train after being pushed onto the
tracks by Andrew Goldstein, a 29-year-old with a history of mental
illness. That case led state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to
propose a new law that would enable relatives and doctors to compel
mentally ill people to receive treatment and medication.
</P>
<P>
   Under current state law, people must be judged both mentally ill
and a danger to themselves or others before they can be committed
against their will to short-term hospitalizations or longer stays
in institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Perez's case highlighted the need
for earlier intervention. ``It certainly indicates a real gap in
the way that we deal with serious, violent mentally ill people,''
he said, ``in that we allow them access to the streets for far
longer, and under circumstances where hopefully that won't be the
case in the future.''

STAR STRUCK? CHECK OUT YOUR WEEK 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 By Students SARABETH BALON and NICK FOREMAN 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<TEXT>
<P>
   Before finalizing your activities, take time to read the
following horoscope, which is a fun way to plan your week.
</P>
<P>
   TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Lately, you are all about helping
others. Your work pays off with every smile you receive for your
hard work. Soon you will be presented with a charity project. Take
it on. It will be a challenge, but if you do not take charge, who
will?
</P>
<P>
   GEMINI (May 21 - June 20): A very extraordinary event will occur
this week accompanied by shocking news. You will like certain
aspects and dislike others, but all in all it will create a memory
that will last a lifetime. Do not overreact when petty things
bother you.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER (June 21 - July 22): You are becoming more and more
despondent. Wake up from the daze you have been in lately. Get back
in touch with what is important in your life. Re-evaluate the
things that matter to you.
</P>
<P>
   LEO (July 23 - Aug. 22): Busy, busy, busy! These days you find
yourself busy as a bee. It is important that you keep a planner
because it is impossible to keep up with all your due dates. If you
choose not to, you may find yourself in a sticky situation.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): Last week you made people aware of
something special you possess. This week is your time to shine. Be
proud of your accomplishments. It is true that nobody likes a cocky
person, but truth also lies in the fact that you can be proud
without overdoing it.
</P>
<P>
   LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): Take a deep breath because your past
week has been a nightmare. You have a good friend who is watching
out for you this week. You will be in an awkward position later
this week and will not have time to thoroughly think the situation
out, so be quick on your feet.
</P>
<P>
   SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): Be the regulator between your
friends. At this time of year, everybody gets a little edgy. When
your friends come to you, do not take sides. That could be a big
mistake, and you do not want to get into the middle of this; it
could get ugly. You will be given a bit of good news that has been
long in coming.
</P>
<P>
   SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21): This week, lighten up a tad.
Your week will be somewhat boring unless you make it into something
special. When you put your mind to it, you can have all the fun in
the world. Do not necessarily plan it, because that takes away some
of the fun. Fly by the seat of your pants.
</P>
<P>
   CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19): It is hard to tell when somebody
is lying to you and when he is telling the truth. In one respect,
you need to be able to trust your friends. At the same time, you
need to check into something that might be fishy. A truth may be
hidden in a bushel of lies.
</P>
<P>
   AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18): A sudden rise in your social
activities will lead you to a new hottie. They will sweep you off
your feet and either continue to carry you or let you fall flat on
your face. You do not want to move too fast and assume that you
know exactly who they are. This one should be on the safe side, but
ask around before you get too wrapped up in them.
</P>
<P>
   PISCES (Feb. 19 - March 20): You might find yourself in a
relaxed and smooth atmosphere this week. It will be a confidence
boost when you realize how much you really mean to your friends and
family. A flagrant show of appreciation is coming your way. Many of
the things that you couldn't do before, you will now be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Feeling exhausted? Are you plagued
with the nuisances of homework and housework? Do not expect a break
from the business of your life in the immediate future. Things are
growing strong, but who knows how long. It takes a big person to
ask for help.
